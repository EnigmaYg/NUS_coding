* Turkish and Israeli officials first met in December 2015 and reached a preliminary agreement to normalize relations, including the return of ambassadors to both countries, after Israel agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the relatives of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid.
* During the meeting held in early February 2016, Turkish and Israeli officials discussed easing rather than lifting Israel's blockade of Gaza, which Ankara aims to begin rebuilding.
* The March 19 Istanbul terror attack in which three Israeli citizens were killed had in some respects brought the countries to better recognize some of their shared interests.
* Turkey had always kept a positive attitude from the very beginning of the normalization process.
* The normalization is evidently needed for the Israeli side.
* The situation in Gaza is always a deal breaker.
* There is no big conflict in Gaza and there is also the recent decision by Israel to expand permitted areas south of Wadi Gaza.
* A deal is possible with the good will of both sides.

* The issue of a seaport for the Gaza Strip has not been discussed in the talks between Israel and Turkey.

* Hamas, which is internationally recognized as a terrorist organization, has had control of Gaza since a bloody 2007 coup.
* The normalization of ties between Israel and Turkey hinges on reaching an agreement over humanitarian aid to Gaza.

* Talks on compensation have reached advanced stages, but one of the main hurdles has been the lifting of the Israeli blockade.
* Talks have also reportedly gotten hung up over Israeli demands for a commitment from Turkey to end tacit support for Hamas.
* After several years of chilly ties and acrimonious accusations from both sides, officials met in December in secret talks to seek a rapprochement, with another round of high-level talks taking place in February in Geneva.
* A bombing last month in Istanbul that killed three Israelis also led to cooperation between the countries and high-level contacts between leaders in Ankara and Jerusalem for the first time in years.

The sub-events of news article:
* Turkish sources claim Turkish-Israeli governmental relations are improving, but this is due to Turkey's regional unpopularity and ignores Turkey's demand for Israel to end the blockade of Gaza.
* Israel would have to abandon its security arrangement with Egypt to meet Turkey's condition, which would increase Israel's security and has begun to pay regional dividends.
* Restoring full relations between Israel and Turkey would irritate Russia, with which Israel has good trade and political relations, and a respectful series of understandings regarding Syria.
* Israel's relations with the Kurds are also at issue, as Israel has supported the Kurds in the past.
* In 2010, Turkey made three demands of Israel after the Mavi Marmara flotilla incident: an Israeli apology for the deaths of Turkish activists, a financial settlement, and lifting the Gaza blockade.
* The UN Palmer Commission Report found the blockade of Gaza to be legal in 2011, and said Israel owed Turkey neither an apology nor compensation.
* In 2013, Prime Minister Netanyahu apologized for the loss of life and agreed to discuss compensation, but Turkey did not reciprocate.
* Israel and Egypt have come to a deep understanding of the sources of instability and insecurity in Sinai, and the relationship between Hamas in Gaza and its primary sponsor, Iran, as well as ISIS.
* Egypt and Saudi Arabia upgraded relations this month, with Egypt ceding back to the Saudis two islands that Saudi Arabia had given Egypt in 1950 to help Egypt fight Israel in the Red Sea.
* Russia presents a similar series of circumstances, as relations between Russia and Turkey have taken a nosedive over the Syrian civil war.
* Israel has generally good economic and political relations with Russia, and it is hard to see the benefit that would accrue to Israel by forging closer relations with Turkey while Russia and Turkey are doing a slow burn.
* Turkey is doing a faster burn on the Kurds, having waged a fierce war against Kurdish separatists in southern Turkey and taken military action against the Kurds of Iraq and Syria.
* Israel has supported the Kurds in the past, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly supported the establishment of a Kurdish state.
* For Israel to trade its increasingly important relations with Russia, with Egypt — and thereby with Saudi Arabia — and with the Kurds for Turkish political approval and a promise to buy Israeli natural gas would seem to be a bad deal.
* For Israel to accompany that with the lifting of the Israel/Egypt embargo on Gaza that would empower Hamas — and thereby the Muslim Brotherhood, Iran and ISIS — would seem an enormous risk for no gain.

The sub-events of news article:
* Unlike in December 2014, Israel has virtually no chance of preventing the latest Palestinian attempt to get Israel condemned at the UN Security Council.
* The key to fending off the latest Palestinian attempt lies with US President Barack Obama.
* A leaked draft of the proposed resolution expresses “grave concern” over dwindling prospects of a two-state solution and calls on Israel to “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem.”
* The draft further urges the “intensification and acceleration of international and regional diplomatic efforts and support aimed at achieving, without delay, an end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967.”
* The draft does not explicitly set a 12-month deadline for negotiations on a final peace deal with Israel and an imposed full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and East Jerusalem within three years, as a resolution proposed in late December 2014 did.
* For a resolution to pass it needs nine votes from the council’s 15 members.
* Only a US veto can stop the resolution.
* Since 2014, the makeup of the Security Council has changed in the Palestinians’ favor, and there is virtually no chance for Israel to stave off a resolution critical of settlements.
* The US thus remains the only wildcard in the upcoming diplomatic showdown at Turtle Bay.
* In February 2011, a resolution condemning Israel’s settlements — without establishing deadlines for an Israel withdrawal — got 14 yes votes but stumbled over Washington’s veto.
* The US needs regional Arab allies in its fight against the Islamic State group and may not want to antagonize them over the Palestinian question.
* Obama might still be bitter over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s blatant effort to thwart the nuclear deal with Iran by addressing the US Congress and trying to get American Jews to oppose their government.
* Failure to block the resolution would give ample ammunition to domestic political opponents trying to portray the Democrats as anti-Israel, and threatens to erode Jewish support for the party ahead of the November presidential elections.

* The draft resolution blames specifically only Israeli settlers for "acts of terror, violence, destruction, harassment and provocation," while not mentioning the constant violence committed by Palestinians against Israeli civilians.
* The draft resolution reportedly has the support of enough members of the Security Council to be adopted, absent a veto by the United States.
* The Obama administration may decide to abstain, if not actually vote yes in concert with the prevailing sentiment among other Security Council members.
* The Obama administration may back another course, reportedly being developed by France, which favors putting the Security Council on record as endorsing parameters of a two-state solution along the lines of what the Palestinians have been seeking with the support of the Arab states.
* Alternatively, Obama may decide that the United States should sponsor its own resolution, laying out Obama’s proposal for a two state solution that is largely the same as the Palestinian approach, freezing all settlements and pushing Israel virtually all the way back to the insecure pre-1967 lines.
* The Palestinian leadership’s true intentions are to establish the pre-1967 lines, with minor adjustments, as the new Palestinian state’s permanent border with Israel, but Israel would not be left alone to remain a Jewish state even then.
* Hamas remains committed to ridding Israel of all Jews – by genocide, if that becomes the most expedient method.

The sub-events of news article:
* The West’s refusal to challenge the growing corruption and autocratic rule of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas could have a devastating effect on the long-term prospects for a viable Palestinian state.
* Abbas has tested the limits of Western leniency since the end of the American-sponsored talks two years ago, which Abbas himself torpedoed.
* Abbas is becoming increasingly dictatorial, establishing a new constitutional court whose members are all picked by Abbas and issuing a warrant for the arrest of a Palestinian legislator who accused an Abbas ally of corruption.
* The PA set up roadblocks to prevent teachers from marching on Ramallah, arrested the leaders of the teachers’ union, and threatened legal action unless they returned to work when teachers launched an unprecedented strike over the PA’s broken promises to raise their wages.
* In 2015, 60 percent of the nearly 200 violations of press freedom in Palestinian territories occurred in the PA-governed West Bank, with only 40 percent occurring in Hamas-ruled Gaza.
* Abbas is using the final year of President Barack Obama’s term in office as an opportunity for the “consolidation of power at home” and to “further isolate Israel.”
* Abbas’s increasingly tyrannical government in the West Bank does not only handicap political expression—it also sets back the very legitimacy of the Palestinian national project.
* Other experts have raised concerns about the PA’s corruption and its effect on the viability of a future Palestinian state.
* American and European support for the Palestinian Authority now totals hundreds of billions of dollars—possibly trillions if non-governmental activities are included.
* Donors should insist on fiscal and legal reforms, as well as the establishment of robust and independent institutions—judiciary and education included.

* The more Israel increases its calls to seek out support, the more the expectations for a future war against Gaza increase.
* The Israeli army launched large-scale military maneuvers in the Golan Heights and the Jordan Valley that included field forces and aircraft.
* The Israeli army had its largest military training since the 2014 war in Gaza, with the participation of thousands of soldiers, near the Gaza border to simulate the incursion of Hamas inside Israeli settlements and the detention of Israeli hostages.
* The Ministry of Interior and National Security in Gaza ended the fifth maneuver of its security services, which it had started in Gaza during recent weeks.

* Israeli Housing Minister Yoav Galant called April 18 for the Israeli army to prepare for a wide-scale confrontation with Hamas in Gaza by the beginning of summer.
* Hamas’ and Israel’s declaration of their unwillingness to go into a military confrontation anytime soon might face three factors that may eventually lead to an outbreak of this confrontation.
* The Israeli army is preoccupied with the growing unrest in the West Bank that began in October.
* Israelis seem to doubt how much the IDF could actually achieve in Gaza — in terms of completely eliminating the Palestinian factions’ missiles and toppling Hamas — except for killing and wounding thousands of Palestinians.

* Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon blamed recent Palestinian mortar and rocket attacks and rising tensions on Israel’s border with Gaza on successful IDF steps to locate tunnels that the Hamas terror group has dug into Israeli territory.
* Ya’alon warned that if the shooting does not stop, Israel would respond forcefully against Hamas.
* Hamas has intermittently exchanged fire with Israeli troops as they worked to destroy tunnels inside Gaza in the past week, but the group has also conveyed to Israel through Egypt that it does not seek an escalation.
* At least 20 mortar shells were fired at Israeli territory from Gaza, while Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck Hamas targets multiple times last week and over the weekend.

* Despite the increased tension along the border with Gaza in recent weeks, the years since the 2014 conflict, known as Operation Protective Edge, have been the quietest in over a decade in terms of rocket fire and attacks coming from the coastal enclave.

* The draft report lambasts the political and military echelons for alleged negligence and infuriating irresponsibility.

* The report deals with what Israel could have done to avert the clash, including the failure to understand that additional pressure on the Gaza pressure cooker would result in an explosion.
* The root of the problem that led Hamas toward the conflict was the Gaza blockade and the desire to get rid of it at whatever the cost.
* Hamas developed the Qassam rocket before the blockade as a deterrent against Israel and a way to attack without clashing with Israeli ground forces, but the blockade created a threat to its continued rule and forced it to launch an arms race that turned Gaza into a powder keg.
* Israel did not understand at the time that an extended blockade would mean subjecting Israeli residents in the south to a life in the shadow of Hamas rockets.
* Hamas fighters managed to hold their own for some 50 days in the face of a skilled and far better equipped Israel Defense Forces (IDF) army during Operation Protective Edge.
* The Israeli economy sustained serious damage during Operation Protective Edge.
* The report raises questions about whether the blockade of Gaza has improved or eroded Israel's security, its implications in terms of Israel’s international standing, and whether significant economic improvements for the residents of Gaza could have saved many lives on both sides of the border fence.

* Hamas security forces in Gaza arrested a group of Salafi activists, members of Salafiya Jihadiya, who were planning to cross the Gaza-Egypt border to join Islamic State in Sinai.
* The arrests were presented as part of an impressive operation by Hamas, fulfilling promises its representatives made to Egypt during a visit to Cairo two months ago.
* Despite the promises by Gaza’s rulers to stop the smuggling to and from Sinai and the recent arrests, Hamas continues to maintain a delicate and complicated web of interests and alliances with Islamic State in Sinai.
* Wounded members of Islamic State are still being brought into Gaza for medical treatment at almost the same rate as before the Hamas delegation’s visit to Cairo two months ago.
* Arms smuggling from the Gaza Strip to Sinai and vice versa continues, albeit at a reduced rate, supervised by members of Hamas’s military wing.
* The transfer of wounded Islamic State fighters is not the work of some low-ranking activist looking for a quick way to make money. It is a deliberate policy of Hamas that began in mid-2015.
* The most problematic factor for Cairo may be the smuggling of arms between Gaza and Sinai. There’s been a dramatic reduction in the scope, but Hamas still manages to bring quantities of arms into the Gaza Strip and to move arms and ammunition from Gaza to Sinai.
* Several former Hamas activists have crossed the border in recent weeks to join the fighting in Sinai against the Egyptian army.
* Egypt’s response to this, it must be said, shows a degree of confusion and perhaps a lack of clear strategy.
* It is doubtful, then, that Cairo will again open the Rafah crossing for periods longer than just a day or two, even with Ramadan approaching.

* Frederic C. Hof, Obama's former top Syria adviser, charged that the Obama administration's failure to protect Syrian civilians was because it was so intent on pursuing a nuclear agreement with Iran.
* Hof countered that the Obama administration did not hesitate to intervene in Iraq and Syria to protect civilians from ISIS and Yazidis.
* Hof explained that the Obama administration's fear and dismissal of making things better in Syria "by being there" applied only to those parts of Syria experiencing mass murder and massive displacement at the hands of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
* David Samuels, the writer of the profile, explained that "by eliminating the fuss about Iran’s nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey."
* Hof credited Rhodes for spelling out Obama’s foreign policy framework so clearly, but suggested that the next administration turn to the "thoughtful (if fallible) and experienced (if imperfect) foreign policy practitioners—yes, the thoroughly disrespected ‘Blob’—to undo the damage they have done."
* Richard Cohen of The Washington Post made a similar critique, stating that the Obama administration's foreign policy has resulted in Russia having more influence in the Middle East than the United States, and Iran and its proxies being everywhere.

* New York Times Magazine editor in chief Jake Silverstein defended the article and insisted that editors “stand behind the piece 100%.”

* The White House identified Ploughshares as a group that helped sell the multinational Iran nuclear deal to a skeptical public.
* Ploughshares gave NPR a $100,000 grant last year to support "national security reporting that emphasizes the themes of US nuclear weapons policy and budgets, Iran’s nuclear program, international nuclear security topics and US policy toward nuclear security."
* Ploughshares also funded reporters and partnerships with other news outlets.
* NPR ombudsman Elizabeth Jensen said no coverage was skewed and "NPR did not accept money to report favorably on the Iran deal. There was no pay for play."
* Jensen pointed to a March 2015 story on a nuclear conference hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, part of the Ploughshares-led coalition backing nuclear diplomacy with Iran, which did not disclose NPR’s relationship with Ploughshares.
* NPR is reviewing its disclosure safeguards.
* Ploughshares started supporting NPR in 1984 and has given $700,000 in grants to NPR over the last decade.
* Jensen examined 254 on-air newsmagazine stories about the Iran deal since 2015 and found almost half were "neutral," about the negotiations or the agreement’s later implementation.
* NPR spoke twice each to Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a leading opponent, and many congressional critics.
* NPR canceled a scheduled August interview with Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., a critic of the Iran deal, because it had too many other interviews booked.
* Outside groups of all stripes are increasingly giving money to news organizations for special projects or general news coverage.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Obama administration's efforts to manage the narrative about the nuclear agreement with Tehran are on the verge of becoming a full-blown PR disaster.
* The New York Times Magazine profile of deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes suggested that the administration had largely “manufactured” the tale of how the Iran deal came about.
* The State Department admitted that it had doctored the video of a 2013 press briefing in which former spokeswoman Jen Psaki seemed to suggest that the administration was misleading Americans about whether secret talks with Iran were underway.
* House Speaker Paul Ryan called for a further investigation into the missing minutes of the press briefing.
* The State Department’s annual Country Reports on Terrorism for 2015 cited Iran’s direct attacks on ISIS and its support of groups seeking to destroy the Islamic State as evidence of Iran’s terrorist activities.
* Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the Iran deal should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.
* Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that the reason Clinton supports the Iran deal and President Obama’s agenda is because she doesn’t want to go to jail.

The sub-events of news article:
* Hillary Clinton has a history of supporting military interventions, including the bombing of Serbia and Kosovo, the invasion of Iraq, and the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya.
* Clinton unsuccessfully urged President Obama to get more deeply involved in Syria's civil war, including providing lethal aid to the Syrian opposition and creating a no-fly zone.
* If elected, Clinton may be likely to further involve the U.S. military in Syria, despite the ongoing conflict and the presence of multiple outside forces.
* The U.S. has incompatible objectives in Syria, including overthrowing the Assad government, decimating ISIS, keeping Turkey happy, staying friends with the Kurds, and avoiding getting sucked into the conflict.
* The top U.S. priority in Syria has shifted from overthrowing Assad to weakening ISIS.
* Even if ISIS is defeated in Iraq and Syria, the group is likely to continue fighting using guerrilla and terrorist tactics.
* Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah prioritize keeping Assad in power, while Turkey and the Sunni Gulf states prioritize getting rid of Assad.
* The likelihood of Assad leaving power is very low, and any increase in arms or assistance to moderate Syrian opposition groups could end up in the hands of more radical Islamist groups.
* Aiding opposition forces in Syria may be creating or strengthening future enemies, as the U.S. has done in the past with al Qaeda and ISIS.
* A no-fly zone in Syria could put U.S. aircraft in conflict with Russian and Syrian aircraft and ground-based anti-aircraft missiles, potentially escalating the conflict.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Trump administration is considering providing increased US logistical and intelligence support for an Emirati/Saudi coalition military operation to take the Red Sea port of Hodeidah from Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
* Proponents of the operation say it could pressure the Houthis into agreeing to return to the negotiating table, and bolster relations between Washington and Gulf allies.
* Critics of the proposal say that if the operation to take the port from the Houthis is successful, it would create a new front line through which it would not be possible to bring food at the needed scale into Sanaa, the capital of 2 million people, and could tip large swaths of the country into famine.
* The United Nations special envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, strongly warned against escalating the military conflict.
* US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis proposed the United States provide “limited support” to the UAE-led operation in a memo to national security adviser H.R. McMaster this month.
* Former US Ambassador to Yemen Gerald Feierstein said if the coalition could actually take Hodeidah and repair the port, it could potentially facilitate humanitarian access.
* Former top USAID official Jeremy Konyndyk said about 70% of all of the food supply to northern Yemen — where most of the population is — goes through the port of Hodeidah.
* Former US officials said they were concerned that the Trump administration might be debating decisions on the matter in an interagency group currently dominated by the military, and without senior staff appointed and representing dissenting views from, for instance, USAID, and State Department bureaus less sympathetic to Gulf allies’ points of view.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Trump administration is considering providing increased US logistical and intelligence support for an Emirati/Saudi coalition military operation to take the Red Sea port of Hodeidah from Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
* Proponents of the operation say it could pressure the Houthis into agreeing to return to the negotiating table, and bolster relations between Washington and Gulf allies.
* Critics of the proposal say that if the operation to take the port from the Houthis is successful, it would create a new front line through which it would not be possible to bring food at the needed scale into Sanaa, the capital of 2 million people, and could tip large swaths of the country into famine.
* The United Nations special envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, strongly warned against escalating the military conflict.
