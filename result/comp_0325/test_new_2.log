The sub-events of news article:
* Egyptian military forces in the northern Sinai Peninsula executed at least two and as many as eight unarmed detainees and covered up the killings to make it appear that the victims were armed "terrorists" shot to death in a raid, Human Rights Watch said today.
* Video of the killings aired by an opposition television channel based in Turkey on April 20, 2017, appears to show a man in a camouflage uniform executing the two men, one after the other, with an assault rifle.
* The video also appears to show a member of Egypt's military intelligence service observing and directing the first execution and that the soldiers used Humvee vehicles supplied by the United States to transport the detainees.
* Sinai News 24, an independent Facebook page that tracks events in the Sinai Peninsula, reported that the two victims were brothers from the Rumailat clan – Daoud Sabri al-Awabdah, 16, and Abd al-Hadi Sabri al-Awabdah, 19 – whom the army had arrested in the town of Rafah and forcibly disappeared on July 18, 2016.
* In a third video of the scene, also posted on the same pro-government Facebook page, a man can be heard saying, "Should I change the position of the gun?" The man who is filming the body replies, "Finish, finish."
* Two North Sinai sources told Human Rights Watch that the man seen executing both victims is a member of a local militia, colloquially called Group 103, which was formed by the Egyptian military in 2015 to assist in Sinai operations and which the military arms and oversees.
* In the execution video, the militia member appears to be wearing an Egyptian army infantry patch on his shoulder. A second man in the video appears to be wearing a patch of the armed forces' Military Intelligence and Reconnaissance Department.
* Since the military removed former President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013, violence has significantly increased in North Sinai, an underdeveloped and long-marginalized governorate that borders Israel and Gaza.
* In response, Egypt has deployed more forces to the Sinai than at any time since the country's 1973 war with Israel.
* The counterterrorism campaign in North Sinai has been rife with abuses. Between July 2013 and August 2015, Egyptian authorities destroyed around half of the town of Rafah, on the border with the Gaza Strip, evicting thousands of families and demolishing at least 3,255 buildings.
* In January 2017, Interior Ministry counterterrorism troops most likely executed at least four and as many as 10 North Sinai men whom they had previously arrested. The Interior Ministry then apparently staged a fake raid to cover up the incident.
* The killings shown in the video that surfaced on April 20 fit a pattern described by several North Sinai residents. At least two detainees formerly held by the army told Human Rights Watch that their guards would come at dawn, summon certain detainees, and take them away without telling them where they were going. These detainees did not return, said the former prisoners, who said they believed the men had been executed.

* The Holocaust and the creation of Israel are two distinct events, and linking them is historically false and morally repugnant.

Here, in these stones, beats the heart of the Jewish People. Jerusalem is the heart of the State of Israel, and the Kotel is the heart of Jerusalem.”

* Rivlin concludes his address by saying, “On the day of Jerusalem’s liberation, then defense minister Moshe Dayan wrote a note, and slotted it in between the stones of the Kotel: ‘May peace be upon Israel’. Today too, we continue to carry that prayer. May God give, and bring peace over Israel. ‘“Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her,’ Happy Jerusalem Day.”

* Rantawi believes that there are very few choices left for Hamas, which will not be able to find a safe haven even in Sudan.
* If Hamas wants to get out of the bottleneck that is squeezing it, then it must find a way to return to the political umbrella of the PLO and give up its unilateral rule in the Gaza Strip.
* Qatar has been heavily involved not only in supporting Hamas, but also in providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians, especially in the reconstruction effort after the Israeli wars on Gaza.
* Palestinians are worried that as a result of this crisis, there will be an end to this vital lifeline.

* Rantawi called on Hamas to learn from the Palestinian exile experience in the past decades and reminded them that when the PLO was based in Tunis in the 1980s, they were forced to give in to international pressures in order to stay relevant and ensure that the world did not negotiate directly with the leadership in the occupied territories.
* Rantawi believes that there are very few choices left for Hamas, which will not be able to find a safe haven even in Sudan.
* If Hamas wants to get out of the bottleneck that is squeezing it, then it must find a way to return to the political umbrella of the PLO and give up its unilateral rule in the Gaza Strip.
* Qatar has been heavily involved not only in supporting Hamas, but also in providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians, especially in the reconstruction effort after the Israeli wars on Gaza.
* Palestinians are worried that as a result of this crisis, there will be an end to this vital lifeline.

The sub-events of news article:
* Terrorists in Egypt are shifting tactics, targeting higher-risk attacks and not only aiming for highly visible civilian targets.
* On July 7, 2017, terrorists targeted the outpost of an elite Egyptian commando force, the 103rd Thunderbolt Battalion (al-Saaka), in the southern Rafah village of el-Barth in Sinai.
* An Islamic State (IS) splinter group in Sinai claimed responsibility for ambushing the battalion.
* The attack began when a suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into an Egyptian army checkpoint in the border town of Rafah.
* Militants started shooting at soldiers, killing at least 15 members of the battalion and injuring 11 others.
* The battalion retaliated, killing 40 of the group's fighters and destroying six of its vehicles.
* The assault on the 103rd Thunderbolt Battalion was the first time such groups have targeted a specific battalion.
* The recent operations, including the assault on the 103rd Battalion, represent an "attempt to keep this support and funding," since such support is at risk following the Egyptian-Gulf ban on Qatar.
* Retired Col. Khaled Okasha, director of the National Center for Security Studies, said that the operation was a mere attempt by terrorists to reshuffle their cards by confusing the armed forces.
* Maj. Gen. Fouad Allam, deputy of the State Security Service, believes such attacks are reactionary.

* Two days later, the occupation reopened the holy site but Muslim worshippers were outraged to find they had to enter their holy shrine through metal detectors.
* Palestinians refused to enter Al Haram Al Sharif and staged peaceful street demonstrations and held daily prayers outside Al Haram Al Sharif in the following days.
* Under massive pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was forced to remove the metal detectors and smart cameras the occupation forces had installed at the entrances of the site.

* The U.S. and its NATO allies invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to oust the Taliban and deny militants a safe haven.
* The U.S. initially refused help from NATO allies to defeat the Taliban, which allowed the Taliban to re-establish a foothold when U.S. forces were pulled out for the 2004 invasion of Iraq.
* U.S. military planning in Afghanistan was based on wishful thinking, assuming that international troops would primarily focus on reconstruction and humanitarian aid after 2006, which was not the case.
* The post-Taliban Afghan government was corrupt and lacked the resources and staff to function efficiently, rendering the country dependent on foreign assistance.
* The U.S. spent $12 billion on eradication efforts to wipe out Afghanistan's opiate trade, but Afghanistan now supplies around 90 percent of the world's opium.
* The U.S. spent $800 million on various projects and initiatives to boost the legitimate Afghan economy, including a $6 million project to import nine rare Italian goats that went missing.
* President Obama's decision to set a timeline for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan undermined the mission, as it notified the Taliban how long they would have to hang on until the U.S. presence dwindled.

* Trump's options include cutting off billions in annual military aid and downgrading Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally.

* The United States could pursue unilateral drone strikes in Pakistan, although it should be prepared for likely fallout.
* Washington could sanction the powerful Pakistani military, which has been accused of supporting the Afghan Taliban and other extremists.

* Tillerson has proposed "political legitimacy" for the Taliban and support for peace talks without preconditions, including abandoning their alliance with al-Qaeda.
* The Taliban has responded to Trump's speech by vowing to continue their jihad, confident that they will outlast the US presence.
* The Taliban's ideology is fundamentalist Islam, and they are allied with al-Qaeda in the jihad against American forces.
* The US invaded Afghanistan in 2001 because the Taliban, ruling the country, provided safe haven for al-Qaeda to plot and execute attacks against the United States.
* The Taliban is a creation of Pakistani intelligence and has significant support in Afghanistan's sharia society.
* The State Department's assumption that the Taliban will make peace with the Afghan government and behave themselves is unrealistic.

* The US should focus on protecting its society from threats posed by sharia-supremacist ideology and enact a new authorization of military force to strike jihadist sanctuaries.

The sub-events of news article:
* UN envoy Staffan de Mistura predicted that Daesh strongholds in Syria could fall by the end of October, which could prompt the international community to press for free and fair elections.
* Three locations remain contested: Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, where Daesh fighters are up against US-backed and Russian-sponsored Syrian forces, and Idlib province, which is controlled by Al Qaeda’s offshoot, Jabhat Fatah Al Sham.
* The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) plans to establish provincial and municipal administrations once Daesh is expelled from Raqqa city and province.
* Damascus, Moscow and Tehran are unlikely to agree to a permanent US military presence in northern Syria.
* The Syrian army and its Russian and Iranian allies have preempted an intended post-Raqqa US-backed SDF offensive against Deir Ezzor.
* Turkey could be a serious spoiler in any effort to make peace in Syria.
* Idlib could become a battleground between Ankara, which has organised anti-Assad takfiri factions into a “Syrian National Army”, and Damascus, Moscow and Tehran.
* De Mistura’s suggestion that if Daesh is defeated in Raqqa and Deir Ezzor by the end of October, an election can be held after a year is also unrealistically optimistic.
* Eighty per cent of Syrians living in the country now dwell in government-controlled areas.

The sub-events of news article:
* Syria's foreign minister Walid Muallem announced that Syria is "marching steadily" toward the goal of rooting out terrorism and "victory is now within reach."
* Muallem pointed to the liberation of Aleppo and Palmyra, the end to the siege of Deir ez-Zour by the Islamic State extremist group, and the eradication of terrorism from many parts of Syria by the Syrian army and its supporters and allies, including Russia and Iran.
* Russia's military said about two weeks ago that Syrian troops have liberated about 85 percent of the war-torn country's territory from militants.
* Muallem praised the army and the country's allies and looked ahead to victory, though fighting still continues in many areas of the country.
* Muallem accused Israel of supporting the rebels by giving them various forms of support, including money, equipment, weapons, means of communications, and even bombing Syrian army posts.
* Muallem said that while the army and its supporting forces and allies "are making daily achievements, clearing out territories and uprooting terrorists," the threat of terrorism persists.
* On the political front, Muallem said local reconciliation agreements have allowed tens of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees to return home.
* Russia, Turkey and Iran have been negotiating separately for months in the Kazakh capital Astana to try to reduce violence on the ground by creating de-escalation zones across the country.
* Muallem said Syria is encouraged by talks in Astana and expressed hope that these talks "will help us reach an actual cessation of hostilities and separate terrorist groups" like ISIS from groups that have agreed to join the Astana process.
* Earlier this month Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to deploy observers on the edge of a "de-escalation" zone in Syria's Idlib province.
* The de-escalation plan has eased fighting in parts of western Syria between rebel factions and government forces loyal to Assad.
* Muallem reaffirmed the Syrian government's commitment to further progress in Geneva talks, which are aimed at establishing a transitional government, drafting a new constitution and holding elections in Syria.

The sub-events of news article:
* Syria's foreign minister Walid Muallem announced that Syria is "marching steadily" toward the goal of rooting out terrorism and "victory is now within reach."
* Muallem pointed to the liberation of Aleppo and Palmyra, the end to the siege of Deir ez-Zour by the Islamic State extremist group, and the eradication of terrorism from many parts of Syria by the Syrian army and its supporters and allies, including Russia and Iran.
* Russia's military said about two weeks ago that Syrian troops have liberated about 85 percent of the war-torn country's territory from militants.
* Muallem praised the army and the country's allies and looked ahead to victory, though fighting still continues in many areas of the country.
* Muallem accused Israel of supporting the rebels by giving them various forms of support, including money, equipment, weapons, means of communications, and even bombing Syrian army posts.
* Muallem said that while the army and its supporting forces and allies "are making daily achievements, clearing out territories and uprooting terrorists," the threat of terrorism persists.
* On the political front, Muallem said local reconciliation agreements have allowed tens of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees to return home.
* Russia, Turkey and Iran have been negotiating separately for months in the Kazakh capital Astana to try to reduce violence on the ground by creating de-escalation zones across the country.
* Muallem said Syria is encouraged by talks in Astana and expressed hope that these talks "will help us reach an actual cessation of hostilities and separate terrorist groups" like ISIS from groups that have agreed to join the Astana process.
* Earlier this month Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to deploy observers on the edge of a "de-escalation" zone in Syria's Idlib province.
* The de-escalation plan has eased fighting in parts of western Syria between rebel factions and government forces loyal to Assad.
* Muallem reaffirmed the Syrian government's commitment to further progress in Geneva talks, which are aimed at establishing a transitional government, drafting a new constitution and holding elections in Syria.

* Lavrov made it clear that his statement about legitimate presence in Syria applied exclusively to the Iranians and not to Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah.
* The Iranians aren’t eager to send their people to die for the Syrian regime, which is why they need Hezbollah and the Iraqi and Afghan militias they are sending to Syria.
* A strategic Iranian presence in Syria, including surface-to-surface missile bases which Iran may try to build there, is a strategic threat to the State of Israel, and the world should be warned about it.

* Russia recognized west Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and east Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital, before Trump’s announcement.
* Trump did not move the US embassy in Tel Aviv, and in fact gave nothing to Israel, other than increased Palestinian rioting, after being warned not to go ahead with this announcement.
* Trump appears to be thinking in a similar way to Russian strategic thinking, which does not focus on end state production logic, which dominates Western thinking.
* Trump abandoned the idea of pursuing the same dead end peace plans promoted by his predecessors, US Presidents Barack Obama, George Bush, and Bill Clinton.
* Trump did not explicitly abandon the two-state solution, nor did he recognize Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria.
* Trump delivered a shock to the system, which is currently responding.
* The way in which events unfold can form a basis for the next step.
* Trump understood what his predecessors did not. After the mass terrorism of the second intifada, and the conversion of Gaza into an enemy Hamas territory after Israel’s withdrawal from it, Israeli society no longer believes in the idea of giving land for stability, or in the ability of the US to supervise and guard this stability.
* Trump therefore proceeded with a recognition of Jerusalem, assisting Israel’s position, which holds that even if a Palestinian state is formed, it will not be based on the Barak - Olmert parameters of dividing Jerusalem.

The sub-events of news article:
* President Trump wants to restrict U.S. foreign aid to “America’s friends” following a United Nations rebuke of his policy towards Israel.
* Trump didn’t articulate the details of such a bill, but the proposal elevates a threat to cut funding for nations that vote against American policy positions at the United Nations.
* The issue emerged in early January, when the U.N. General Assembly voted to rebuke the U.S. for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
* Trump vowed to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, prompting some world leaders to accuse him of undermining a stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
* The announcement came as the administration has sought to rally Arab leaders around the idea that Iran, rather than the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate, is the chief cause of instability in the Middle East.
* “As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries,” Trump said.
* “When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.”

* Von Storch is a big fan of Israel and sees it as a model for Germany.
