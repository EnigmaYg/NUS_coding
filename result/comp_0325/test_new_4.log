 Theme/Focus: Japan's trade with Iran.
Key Information/Sub-event: The graph shows the trend of Japan's imports from and exports to Iran from 1988 to 2018. In 1988, Japan's imports from Iran were about the same as its exports to Iran. However, in the following years, Japan's imports from Iran increased significantly while its exports to Iran decreased. In 2018, Japan's imports from Iran were about 1.5 trillion yen, while its exports to Iran were only about 0.3 trillion yen.
News Event Perspective: The image helps to illustrate the news article about Japan's trade with Iran. It shows that Japan's imports from Iran have been much greater than its exports to Iran in recent years. This is likely due to the fact that Japan is heavily reliant on Iranian oil imports. The image also shows that Japan's trade with Iran has been declining since 2018, which is likely due to the US sanctions on Iran.

The sub-events of news article:
* The recent flurry of shuttle diplomacy towards reconciliation with the aim to bring peace to Afghanistan has generated hopes and smiles on the otherwise bruised and fractured Afghan society in particular and Pakistan in general.
* Rounds of talks have been going on for the last few weeks with the US, Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the Taliban as major players, while the Afghan National Unity Government and India remained out of the pail.
* The Taliban refused to accept the joining of the Afghan government’s delegation to the parleys in Qatar.
* Keeping out a segment of public leaders, particularly Pakhtun nationalists, was not only bound to create suspicion and concerns but also seemed elusive.
* The 1998 Geneva Accords were negotiated between the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan but unfortunately the major guarantors failed to honour their main provisions regarding ending military support to the warring groups.
* Dr Najeebullah offered his adversaries major concessions, including declaring a six-month unilateral ceasefire, approving a new constitution that recognised Islam as the state religion, introducing an electoral and multiparty system, implementing economic reforms to respect private property, granting amnesty to opposition leaders, releasing more than 16,000 political prisoners, and offering the opposition half of the posts in a government of national reconciliation.
* The acrimony between key personalities and the parties they represented resulted in a civil war with devastating effect on the country.
* The US has, in its own wisdom, incapacitated the al Qaeda network which is no longer considered strong enough to threaten their vital national interests and social order.
* The Taliban are in a belligerent mood trying to advance their influence on ground using the negotiating table as part of the tactics.
* The immediate withdrawal of the US, without bolstering the National Unity Government with the presence of neutral forces to the satisfaction of all stakeholders, may plunge the country into chaos.
* Projecting the Taliban as the sole player within Afghanistan is a departure from the path of reconciliation as it neglects other major players within society.
* The Taliban, with guns in hand and freedom to move in all directions, will provide no free choice to those sitting on the sidelines.

The sub-events of news article:
* Iranian officials abruptly ended a meeting with European envoys on Jan. 8 in Tehran, slamming the door in protest of a message that Europe could no longer tolerate ballistic missile tests in Iran and assassination plots on European soil.
* The next day, the EU imposed its first sanctions on Iran since world powers agreed the 2015 Vienna nuclear arms control deal with Tehran.
* The sanctions were largely symbolic but the stormy meeting encapsulated the unexpected shift in European diplomacy since the end of last year.
* Smaller, more dovish EU countries have joined France and Britain in a harder stance on Tehran, including considering new economic sanctions.
* Those could include asset freezes and travel bans on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Iranians developing the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program.
* The new approach moves Europe closer to US President Donald Trump’s policy of isolating Iran with tough sanctions even though European governments still support the 2015 Vienna deal from, which he withdrew in May.
* Iran’s firing of short-range ballistic missiles into Syria on Sept. 30, missile tests and a satellite launch this month have niggled Western powers.
* For Europe, alleged assassination plots by Iran on French and Danish soil in 2018 were the last straw.
* The same day as the meeting, the Netherlands publicly blamed Iran for killings on its soil in 2015 and 2017.
* On Jan. 9, the EU designated a unit of Iran’s Intelligence Ministry a terrorist organization, froze its assets and those of two men.
* The EU is set to officially launch a mechanism, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to trade with Iran later this month but it will not be operational for several months.
* EU foreign ministers planned to issue a rare joint statement on Jan. 21 about what they say is Iran’s interference in the region and calling for an end to missile tests.
* EU diplomats said there was a risk that a two-day conference in Poland in February focused on the Middle East, particularly Iran, convened by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could divide eastern and western Europe.

* Europe has established a special financial mechanism called INSTEX to maintain trade with Iran and bypass US sanctions.
* INSTEX is a brainchild of France, Germany, and England, banding together to neutralize any US opposition.
* INSTEX has breathed new life into the Iran nuclear deal, which has been hanging by a thread as a result of US’s unilateral exit last August.
* A new worldwide threat assessment by US intelligence community has directly contradicted the administration’s claim that Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons.
* Trump has criticized the report’s finding on Iran as “naïve”.
* Trump’s Iran policy has been delivered two major blows almost simultaneously, by Europe and US’s own intelligence.
* Trump’s fateful decision to impose oil sanctions on Venezuela has tightened the oil market, already jolted by US oil embargo on Iran.
* Unless the oil exemptions granted to 8 nations, which are due for renewal in May, 2019, are sustained, there is a likelihood of skyrocketing oil prices, hurting the US economy.
* INSTEX has been welcomed by China, which seeks to join it in the future in order to maintain its lucrative trade with Iran.
* The political significance of INSTEX, asserting Europe’s independent foreign policy, outweighs the economic benefits.
* The greater credibility problem of Trump’s Iran policy is now irrefutable.
* US’s Iran policy is in a word in tatters, turned even more problematic by the ripple effects of the Venezuela crisis.

* Iran will not accept these humiliating conditions and will not accede to any demand at the expense of opening a small waterway such as INSTEX, said Larijani.
* Some experts said the mechanism was useless and won’t change anything for European companies as they cannot feel confident that they could do business with Iran without being subject to US sanctions.

* The Palestinian Authority (PA) paid out NIS 230 million to 13,656 families of "martyrs" (terrorists killed carrying out attacks against Israel) in 2018.
* The figures are based on data from leftist groups, the PA and the Shin Bet, and were prepared by the Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) organization.
* The PA also paid out approximately NIS 500 million in 2018 to families of terrorists in Israeli prisons, or as pensions to terrorists who have been released from prison.
* Overall, the PA pays out NIS 732 million (over $200 million) to terrorists and their families, dead or alive.
* Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said that by the end of the week a mechanism should be in place to deduct money transferred to the PA in the amount of payouts to terrorists, as required by Knesset legislation passed last July that came into effect on January 1st.
* PMW head Itamar Marcus said that "the report shows that over 13,000 families of ‘martyr’ terrorists are getting paid by the PA, in addition to some 6,000 terrorists who are getting a salary from the PA. This is a clear measure of how the PA is supporting terror, with all of the consequences that should follow from that."

* The funds were frozen because in 2018, the Palestinian Authority transferred the same amount to terrorists imprisoned in Israel and their families and to released prisoners.
* Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came under increasing pressure to implement the tax freeze following 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher’s brutal rape and murder earlier in the month.
* Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said the move amounted to a “theft of Palestinian public money” and showed “Israel’s enactment of racist laws in support of the occupation” which “undermined the two-state solution.”
* A PA official warned that the freeze “could jeopardize the Palestinian economy and undermine the PA’s ability to pay its salaries on time.”
* Israel views the Palestinian payments as incitement to murder or pay-to-slay, while the Palestinian Authority counter claims that the payments are a source of welfare for families who have lost their main breadwinner.
* The freeze comes as the Palestinians face major budget cuts made last year after the United States slashed funding for the UN’s Palestinian refugee program UNRWA and for development programs in the Palestinian territories.

The sub-events of news article:

* The measure was approved by the Israeli government months ago, but it did not obligate Israeli officials to do so.
* After the brutal murder by a Palestinian terrorist of 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher in Yerushalayim two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu decided to seek Cabinet approval to implement the measure.
* The amount in question is $138 million out of a total $222 million, according to estimates quoted by Reuters.
* The PA’s total outlay for terrorists and their families, both living and dead, is about NIS 1.2 billion ($329 million) a year.
* Mahmoud Abbas declared that he will not accept any part of the monthly tax transfer if the deduction is made.
* Neither the U.N. nor the European Union came forth this week to voice support for Israel’s decision to withhold the funds for terror.
* The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe called for the PA to halt its terror payments last year.
* News agencies such as The Associated Press were no help either, as they seemed confused about who the victims and the perpetrators were.

The sub-events of news article:
* Jews with any connection to the Holocaust tend to harbor prejudice against Poles.
* Despite their 1,000-year sojourn in Poland, Jews were often discriminated against.
* The extermination of the three million Jews concentrated in Poland was the prime Nazi objective.
* Even while suffering from the brutal Nazi oppression, many Poles continued to harbor prejudice against Jews.
* Tens of thousands of Poles collaborated with the Nazis by acting as informants.
* There were also heroic Poles who risked a mandatory death sentence for their help in hiding and saving Jews.
* Antisemitism prevailed in Poland, as evidenced by the 1946 Kielce pogrom.
* When the communists took over Poland in 1945, they suppressed exposure of the genocide.
* In 1968, the Polish government conducted an antisemitic purge, and 30,000 Jews were expelled from the country.
* After the collapse of communism in the early 1990s, the newly independent Polish government sought to create a fresh Polish image based upon nationalism and democracy.
* In 2018, the Polish government passed a law that effectively criminalized anyone “besmirching” the Polish people by associating them with the Nazi genocidal industry applied against the Jews.
* Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki accused Israel’s newly appointed acting foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, of engaging in racist defamation of the Polish people.
* The diplomatic upheaval caused by Katz led to the Polish prime minister canceling Poland’s participation in the Visegrád group summit of Central European countries in Jerusalem.
* Populist and nationalist parties are emerging as powerful political forces in Europe.
* Many of the voters for these nationalist parties support Israel as a bastion of the free world.
* Over the past decade, most of these parties began purging their ranks of antisemites and publicly undertook to eradicate all anti-Jewish elements.
* Israel has no allies in the EU, which is now notorious for its shameless bias and double standards against the Jewish state.
* As long as leaders of the new generation publicly repudiate the crimes of their antecedents and practice what they preach, Israel would be making a major long-term blunder to spurn their support and continue accusing them collectively of being antisemitic.

* Katz’s comment caused an uproar in Poland, with Foreign Minister Marek Magierowski calling it “shameful and racist” and demanding an apology.

* Israeli interim foreign minister Yair Lapid said in late February that Poles "collaborated with the Nazis" and "sucked antisemitism with their mothers' milk," triggering a major row between the two countries.
* Foreign Minister Marek Magierowski called Katz's comment "shameful and racist" and demanded an apology.
* To try and fix the attempts to "distort history" and accuse the Poles of contributing to the Nazi crimes of the WWII era, the Foreign Ministry has issued a booklet, dubbed How it was in reality.
* The booklet, printed in English, German and Polish, is based on interviews with the survivors of Nazi death camps.
* "The booklets have been sent to countries where the problem [of history distortion] emerges the most often: to the US, the UK, Germany and Canada," the diplomat said.

* The EU's foreign ministers agreed to back Guaido's decision to declare himself president but will do so only until a new election is held.
* Each of the 28 member states will outline its position over the new head of Venezuela's National Assembly, as opposed to the EU making a joint declaration.
* Britain, Germany, France and Spain will formally back Guaido on Monday.
* Smaller EU members will adopt a more cautious approach, specifically avoiding to use words such as "recognition" in their statements.
* The EU's position is further complicated by the fact the European Parliament on Thursday recognized the 35-year-old Guaido as the head of the Venezuelan congress.
* The 28-country bloc based its decision on the Venezuelan constitution, which states the head of congress can take over if the president is absent, incapacitated or usurps power.
* Guaido's allies have long argued that Maduro stole the second mandate in January.
* Last Saturday, the EU set a eight-day deadline for a new election, which Maduro dismissed as an unacceptable ultimatum.

 Theme/Focus: The theme of the image is the effect of free trade on the Jordanian orange market.

Key Information/Sub-event: The image shows a supply and demand curve for oranges in Jordan. The demand curve is downward sloping, indicating that as the price of oranges increases, the quantity of oranges demanded decreases. The supply curve is upward sloping, indicating that as the price of oranges increases, the quantity of oranges supplied increases. The equilibrium price is $700 per ton, and the equilibrium quantity is 250,000 tons.

News Event Perspective: The image helps to illustrate the news article's discussion of the potential impact of free trade on the Jordanian orange market. The article notes that free trade could lead to lower prices for oranges, which could benefit consumers but hurt producers. The image shows that this is indeed the case, as the equilibrium price of oranges decreases from $700 per ton to $580 per ton when free trade is introduced. The quantity of oranges demanded increases from 250,000 tons to 350,000 tons, while the quantity of oranges supplied decreases from 250,000 tons to 200,000 tons. This suggests that free trade could lead to a decrease in the number of orange producers in Jordan, as some producers may be unable to compete with lower-priced imports.

* Jordan has been a strong and reliable ally to the US and a staunch supporter of genuine peace for all peoples of the Middle East.

* Jordan is for Jordanians, and the Palestinian state is for Palestinians.
* The Palestinians have been seeking a state of their own for almost a century, and it is high time this long-overdue demand and right is given to the Palestinians through the two-state solution.
* Jordan has welcomed Palestinians and other refugees, out of compassion and a sense of chivalry and responsibility, but it should not be manipulated into being made a permanent home for refugees who are eagerly waiting to go home.
* Mideast peace plans are not, and should not, be made in Washington, or in Washington and Tel Aviv, but through honest, sincere consultations with all parties concerned, especially the Palestinians and Jordan.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Strategic Affairs Ministry is preparing a brief for a new bill to be brought before the Bundestag, the law of kowtowing.
* Anyone saying the name Israel will have to incline his head and bow while uttering the explicit name.
* Violating the law will be deemed an anti-Semitic act.
* Mentioning Israel without prostration will be a criminal offense.
* The boycott, divestment and sanction movement will be outlawed, or at least prohibited from operating in public.
* Israel is employing its propaganda machinery to exert pressure on the German government to adopt this decision.
* Branding BDS as anti-Semitic, like any criticism of Israel, has turned out to be the most effective strategy of all.
* It’s hard to believe that the hundreds of Bundestag members who voted for this resolution, which defines a completely legitimate struggle as anti-Semitic, actually agreed with it.
* When the kowtowing law is passed and Germans have to genuflect in front of Israel and not just dance to its tune, perhaps some people will be there to stop this march of folly.

The sub-events of news article:
* Jason Greenblatt, President Donald Trump’s top Middle East negotiator, led Jewish prayer services at a synagogue in Bahrain during the conference there that rolled out the economic portion of the Trump administration’s peace plan.
* Greenblatt mustered an Orthodox minyan — a quorum of ten adult Jewish males — for morning services Wednesday at the synagogue, which dates to the 19th century.
* The conference wrapped up on its second day without news of whether Jared Kushner, the peace team’s boss and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, had extracted the $50-70 billion in pledges he is seeking to seed the infrastructural changes he says the Palestinian economy needs as a predicate for peace.
* The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the conference, in part because Trump has favored Israel by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and because Trump and Congress have cut off all U.S. funding to the Palestinians.
* The same day the conference opened, on Tuesday, officials of the United Nations Work and Relief Agency, which administers aid to Palestinian refugees and their descendants, garnered $113 million in pledges to help make up for the $360 million the Trump administration had cut in funding for the agency.
* The Bahrain conference, while inconclusive in its immediate goals — Kushner says he will roll out the political component of his plan later this year — was yet another signal of growing acceptance of Israel in the Arab world.
* Bahrain for the first time allowed Israeli journalists to enter to cover the conference.

* The UN General Assembly's annual endorsement of resolutions supporting the Palestinian claim of a "right of return" reinforces the Palestinian leadership's stance.
* To achieve Israeli/Palestinian peace, it is crucial for the Palestinian leadership to accept the existence of Israel and abandon the idea of ending its existence through mass population transfer.
