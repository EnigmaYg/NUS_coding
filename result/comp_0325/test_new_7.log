The sub-events of news article:
* Iran has launched multiple waves of attacks using loitering munitions, a type of unmanned aerial vehicle, against civilian facilities in the Arabian Peninsula.
* Iran has provided the know-how and components to use the technology to its political pawn in Yemen, the Houthis, leading to a spike in drone attacks throughout the Middle East.
* The drones are relatively cheap to manufacture and can be difficult to defend against, particularly the loitering "suicide" munitions that have been used with increasing frequency by Iran and its proxies against Arab, American and Israeli interests across the Middle East.
* Iran is leveraging drone strikes by its extremist proxies to strengthen its position in the region, and a coordinated response by regional allies is needed to prevent further attacks.
* Iran's use of proxies, such as the Houthis and Iraqi Shiite militia groups, to launch drone strikes gives it a measure of plausible deniability.
* Iran has been able to circumvent global sanctions to acquire the necessary components and technology to mass-produce explosives-laden UAVs.
* Without a comprehensive regional strategy that employs a more active posture to deter and weaken Iran's combat-drone capabilities, Tehran and its transnational network of militant groups is likely to conclude that the benefits outweigh the cost of escalating attacks.
* The response to Iran's growing threat should be proactive, collective, and multi-layered, including intelligence efforts to block foreign components smuggled into Iran, developing dynamic and cost-efficient technological solutions, and targeting drone shipments before reaching Iran's armed militias.
* The mastermind behind Tehran's drone program, Brig. Gen. Saeed Aghajani, was personally responsible for orchestrating the 2019 attacks on Saudi oil facilities.
* Washington is unlikely to embark on a more proactive policy that would raise the stakes for Iran and its proxies, as the Biden administration has already lifted sanctions on a number of figures linked to Iran's ballistic missiles program and signaled its willingness to restart negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal.
* Iran feels emboldened enough to launch drone strikes against oil tankers, international airports and other civilian targets, despite an array of sanctions designed to prevent them and their proxies developing such capabilities.
* Neutralizing the strategic threat posed by the Iranian network of proxy-enabled drone strikes will probably require a measure of cooperation and knowledge-sharing by states in the region that have found themselves in the crosshairs of Iran's proxy militant groups.

* The Chinese military has deployed an array of weaponry specifically to target American flattops.
* A U.S. Navy test in 2005 proved that even if hit, carriers are really hard to sink.
* The last time anyone permanently sank a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in combat was during World War II.
* To even try to sink an American flattop, you first must hit it, which is not easy due to the air wing, escorting destroyers, cruisers, and submarines that surround the carrier.
* China or another country could attempt to target the carriers with submarines, cruise missiles, and ballistic rockets.
* Shooting anything at an aircraft carrier is a costly, difficult operation, and the carrier's attackers could face withering counterfire from the vessel's defenders.
* If a country were to sink an American carrier, the United States would likely deploy all its remaining military might, including its surviving eight or nine carriers, against the country behind the sinking.

The sub-events of news article:
* China has built a mock-up of a Ford-class aircraft carrier, two Arleigh-Burke-class guided-missile destroyers, and other carrier-shaped targets in the Taklamakan desert in western Xinjiang Province.
* The mock-ups are likely intended for target practice for China's growing arsenal of anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs).
* ASBMs have never been used in combat before, and there is debate over their reliability in hitting moving targets.
* China has previously tested ASBMs against a carrier-like target in 2013 and successfully test-fired DF-21D and DF-26B missiles at moving maritime targets near the Paracel Islands in 2019.
* China's return to land-based ASBM target tests is likely intended to limit the controversy and observability of tests in the open commons of the Pacific Ocean.
* The land-based tests may also prove less expensive or logistically complicated to orchestrate, and the smaller rail-based target may allow missile units to repeatedly practice striking a moving target.
* China has been expanding and enhancing its maritime surveillance capabilities with radars deployed on a network of artificial islands, additional satellites launched into space, and new types of robotic spy submarines, surveillance drones, and maritime patrol aircraft.
* Practice against realistic and moving target tests, and forming spotter-shooter kill chains seem like necessary prerequisites before simulating more complex tactics used in combat scenarios against a reactive enemy with air defenses.

The sub-events of news article:
* In April 2020, eleven Iranian patrol boats acted dangerously near a group of U.S. Navy craft.
* The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) has armed speedboats that habitually harass U.S. Navy and allied vessels in the Persian Gulf, especially in the Strait of Hormuz.
* The IRGCN now possesses ship-launched anti-ship missiles with a range of 430 miles, according to IRGCN naval militia leader Adm. Ali Reza Tangsiri.
* In September 2020, the IRGCN said its best anti-ship missile could travel just 180 miles.
* The missile claim could have implications for tensions in the Gulf region.
* On April 22, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump authorized the Navy to "shoot down and destroy" Iranian boats that harass American vessels.
* The Navy periodically fires warning shots near Iranian boats but does not attack the boats for the mere act of operating unprofessionally.
* U.S. forces have also operated in close, even dangerous, proximity to Iranian forces.
* The back-and-forth claims and threats mark another month of escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.

* Iran has invested considerable resources in its ballistic missile forces over the past forty years.
* Iran has a large and varied ballistic missile arsenal, including missiles with infra-red seekers for terminal guidance and an anti-ship ballistic missile with a 434-mile range.
* Iran would need a persistent ISR capability to keep constant tabs on a U.S. Navy battle group.
* Iran would likely want to pull an American carrier battle group as close to the Iran coastline as possible.
* Iran would likely launch every missile it could possibly throw at a carrier strike group, ideally scores or even hundreds of missiles.
* Most Iranian missiles would miss, having never had a reasonable chance of hitting.
* It’s unlikely that a lucky Iranian missile could actually sink an American carrier.

* The Grumman F-14 Tomcat has been operated by only two nations: the United States and Iran.
* Iran received eighty F-14 Tomcat jets in the early 1970s due to concerns that Iraq could outpace Iran's forces in a war.
* After the Shah's regime fell in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran took control of seventy-nine F-14 Tomcat jets.
* In the first six months of the Iran-Iraq War, the F-14 Tomcat reportedly racked up at least fifty air-to-air victories with only one aircraft damaged.
* Iraqi pilots changed tactics to avoid engaging F-14 Tomcats, and Iranian pilots used the planes' sensors to coordinate other aircraft.
* Iranian engineers made several improvements to the F-14 Tomcat, including adding bomb racks to transform them into ground-attack aircraft.
* By the end of the Iran-Iraq War, the F-14 Tomcat had made at least two hundred kills, losing only eight to enemy action.
* Due to U.S. sanctions, spare parts for the F-14 Tomcat were impossible to import, and the number of operational aircraft dwindled to around thirty in 1988.
* Today, the number of operational F-14 Tomcat jets in Iran is estimated to have increased to forty, though their readiness varies.

The sub-events of news article:
* A Chinese admiral, Lou Yuan, threatened to sink two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and kill thousands of American sailors to resolve China's territorial disputes.
* The Chinese military has deployed an array of weaponry specifically to target American aircraft carriers.
* A U.S. Navy test in 2005 proved that even if hit, aircraft carriers are very difficult to sink.
* The last time anyone permanently sank a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in combat was during World War II.
* To even try to sink an American aircraft carrier, you first must hit it, which is not easy due to the air wing, escorting destroyers, cruisers, and submarines that surround the flattop.
* If an American aircraft carrier were sunk, the United States would likely deploy all its remaining military might against the country responsible.

* An amphibious raid against select targets on Iran's coastline is an option if tensions with Iran continue to heat up.
* An amphibious raid would involve the deployment of an Amphibious Ready Group of amphibious assault ships and their destroyer escorts backed by at least one carrier strike group.
* The raiding force could well consist of over 16,000 American Marines and sailors.
* The operation would kick off with the neutralization of local enemy air defenses.
* Marines would land by amphibious assault vehicle, LCAC hovercraft, and LCU landing craft, bringing with them artillery, armored vehicles, and in some cases a small number of Abrams tanks.
* An amphibious raid would be a very dangerous operation, with Marines exposed to air defense weapons, anti-ship weapons, artillery, and infantry close combat.
* The mere threat of an amphibious raid may do the United States more good, deterring Iran from an action that would warrant such a complex operation, than a raid itself.

* Kornets mounted on dhows are not a serious threat to aircraft carriers.
* Kornets are not "fire-and-forget" missiles and rely on a laser beam for guidance.
* Mounting a Kornet on a wooden-hulled small boat is highly impractical.
* The regular Kornet tripod is unstabilized and would make an accurate missile shot impossible at any significant range.
* Carriers are armed with a multitude of self-defense missiles and systems that would likely have no problem tracking and intercepting a Kornet.
* A Kornet hit would likely only kill people within a very small radius of the impact and leave only a small hole in the hull.
* Damage control teams on ships are trained to deal with far more devastating damage than a Kornet hit.
* The thermobaric version of the Kornet has very little penetrative capabilities and is unlikely to make its way through the hull of an aircraft carrier.

* The Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGC-N) has transformed an old target barge into a large-scale mock-up that loosely resembled the U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers.
* The IRGC-N reportedly launched a heavy warship named Abdollah Roudaki, capable of carrying helicopters, drones and missile launchers.
* The Abdollah Roudaki is 150 meters or about 492 feet in length, and displaces some 400 tons.
* The Abdollah Roudaki can reportedly carry out combat, logistical and intelligence-gathering missions.
* The IRGC-N's role has largely been to patrol the waters of the Persian Gulf, but the Abdollah Roudaki could provide the IRGC-N with true blue-water naval capabilities.

The sub-events of news article:
* Mark Langfan, Chairman of Americans for a Safe Israel, believes Russian Kornet Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) are a serious threat to the USS Abraham Lincoln, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.
* Langfan's analysis misrepresents the Kornet's capabilities and overlooks aspects of naval warfare.
* In a deployment, the carrier would be backed up by destroyers and patrol ships, including Cyclone-class patrol ships with dual 25-millimeter autocannons and Griffin missiles optimized for use against small boats.
* The carrier also has its own air wing to strike small ships before they enter engagement range.
* The Kornet is not "fire-and-forget" and relies on a laser beam from the launching post for guidance.
* Mounting a Kornet on a wooden-hulled small boat is impractical due to the unstabilized tripod firing post.
* Carriers are armed with self-defense missiles and systems, such as the Phalanx CIWS or RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile, which can track and engage smaller missiles like the Kornet.
* The Kornet's warhead is unlikely to do significant damage to an aircraft carrier due to the thin jet of molten metal created by its HEAT warhead and the dispersed nature of critical components on a ship.
* The thermobaric version of the Kornet has limited penetrative capabilities and would likely not make its way through the hull.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Palestinian Authority (PA) expressed support for Public Security Minister Omer Barlev's statement on "settler violence".
* The PA called Barlev's statement an unprecedented "official recognition" of the violence of "settlers" against Palestinian Arabs.
* Barlev came under fire on Monday over the comments, which he made following a meeting with US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland.
* Barlev said that the US official was "interested, among other things, in the settler violence and how to reduce tensions in the region and strengthen the Palestinian Authority."
* Barlev wrote, "I told her that increasing the work permits for Palestinians in Israel, both from Judea and Samaria and Gaza, which we are already carrying out, is a key to reducing tensions, just like implementing the plan to establish a joint industrial zone on the outskirts of Gaza and more. American assistance for such projects can help a lot."
* The remarks were heavily criticized by politicians from the right, including both members of the opposition as well as members of the coalition such as Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked.
* Prime Minister Naftali Bennett tweeted following Barlev's comments, "The residents of Judea and Samaria have been suffering from violence and terrorism, every day, for decades. They are the defensive wall of us all and we must strengthen them and support them, in words and deeds."
* Bennett later picked up the phone and held a clarification conversation with Barlev, in which he told him that "it is not right to generalize entire sectors in an offensive manner."

The sub-events of news article:
* Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz met with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas on Dec. 28 and offered a series of “confidence-building measures” to the Palestinians, including economic benefits, a loan, entry permits, and the legalization of undocumented Palestinians.
* Gantz’s concessions to the Palestinians have been criticized by some Israelis, who question what confidence-building measures Israel received in return and why Israel is offering so many significant concessions to the Palestinians.
* Efraim Inbar, president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, said that the meeting had “a façade of intimacy that is inappropriate” and that Abbas is “not a friend, but the enemy.”
* Gantz’s office published a generic statement devoid of details, saying, “The defense minister emphasized the shared interest in strengthening security cooperation, preserving security stability, and preventing terrorism and violence.”
* The details of the meeting were subsequently publicized, revealing the far-reaching concessions that Gantz had made to the Palestinians.
* Gantz appears to be violating the 1994 Paris Protocol agreed to between Israel and the P.A. by making changes to the agreement without bringing any legislation to the Knesset for debate.
* Abbas is personally leading a campaign to prosecute Gantz in the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes.
* The Likud released a statement calling Bennett’s government “an Israeli-Palestinian government that is returning Abbas and the Palestinians to the agenda… Concessions that will be dangerous to Israeli security are only a matter of time.”
* The meeting was praised by the United States, which has been pushing to renew ties with the Palestinian Authority that had largely been severed under Trump.
* Maurice Hirsch, head of legal strategies at Palestinian Media Watch, said that the aim of the meeting was ostensibly to prop up the P.A., but that the Palestinian people hate the P.A. so much that they would vote for Hamas in a heartbeat.
* Hirsch said that the NIS 100 million loan for the Palestinians is “positively going to go to terrorists. It is outrageous.”
* Hirsch also noted that Gantz is making agreements with the P.A. without any real oversight and without presenting any type of legislation.
* Inbar said that Israel is actively supporting the P.A. because it is “afraid of the collapse of the P.A. that serves us well in the short term, sparing Israel the responsibility for managing the lives of the Palestinians.”

The sub-events of news article:
* Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said he would have no problem meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas if the political conditions justified such talks.
* Lapid stressed that such talks would not deal with a diplomatic solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, as the current government's policy of not holding final-status negotiations with the PA will remain in place when he becomes prime minister in August 2023.
* Lapid indicated that part of his agreement with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett upon forming a government was that neither of them would hold peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
* The focus of the government in its ongoing contacts with PA officials revolves around security cooperation, improving the daily lives of Palestinians, and strengthening the Palestinian economy.
* Defense Minister Benny Gantz pushed back Monday against criticism of his recent meeting with Abbas, vowing to continue meeting with the PA leader.
* Gantz hosted Abbas at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin last week, the first time the PA leader met with a senior Israeli official inside Israel since 2010.
* Gantz's office announced several “confidence-building measures” following last week’s meeting, including approving the inclusion of 6,000 West Bank residents and 3,500 Gaza residents on a humanitarian basis in the PA’s resident registration; advancing the transfer of NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) in tax payments; and adding 600 BMC (businessman card) approvals for senior Palestinian businesspeople, as well as 500 permits for businesspeople, with such approvals to enter Israel with their vehicles, and dozens of VIP permits for PA senior officials.

* Gantz and Abbas discussed implementing economic and civilian measures, emphasizing the importance of deepening security coordination and preventing terror and violence.
* Israel announced a series of "confidence-building measures" for the Palestinian Authority, including VAT, import-tax and excise-duty benefits, a NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) loan, more than 1,000 permits for Palestinian businessmen entering Israel by car, dozens of VIP permits for P.A. officials, and the legalization of the status of 9,500 undocumented Palestinians and foreign nationals living in Judea, Samaria and Gaza.
* Israel's decision to provide these benefits to the Palestinian Authority is driven by the belief that it is in Israel's interest to keep the financially strapped P.A. from collapsing.
* Abbas has made it clear that he would use any financial assistance from Israel to maintain his "well-oiled murder machine."
* Abbas canceled the P.A. legislative elections slated for last May, claiming that Israel was unjustly forbidding eastern Jerusalem Arabs from casting ballots.

* There is a consensus that there is no chance in the foreseeable future to reach a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
* The term "no partner for peace" has worn out due to repeatable use.
* The voices that say the two-state solution is dead have gotten louder due to the growing unrest in the West Bank, the absence of a Palestinian leader who is willing to reach a peace deal, and the shift of Israeli society toward the right side of the political map.
* Israeli expert on democracy, Prof. Matti Steinberg, said the current Israeli reality is pretty clear: it's either a two-state solution or deterioration into apartheid.
* The dissipation of hate toward Israel by all Arabs states in the Middle East, thanks largely to the Abraham Accords, changed, without doubt, Israel's status in the Gulf region, and the new alliances with some Arab countries prove that.
* The current trend appears to be calling for a temporary solution to the conflict by limiting the scope of Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
* The two-state solution may have drifted away from the political agenda, but it's not gone.
* Israel will never openly declare apartheid to be the case, but the international community might.
* The difficulty of understanding the term "apartheid" is understandable. But it's just as important to understand that this is a process of a slow or fast deterioration into a startling reality.
* The public and political discourse on the diplomatic solution to the conflict must be restored, at least as long as the Palestinian leadership is still committed to the Oslo Accords.
* The Palestinian leadership is perceived as undemocratic, however, other Arab societies in the Middle East, including some of our friends, also have this kind of mindset.
* The Biden administration can provide the sane and realistic discourse, with comfortable and improved circumstances for Israel.

* Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote a book in the early 2000s titled “The Israeli Leopard” that was never published.
* Excerpts from the book were published on Friday by the Haaretz newspaper, revealing Netanyahu's views on corruption, bloated governments, and the dangers of over-concentration of centralized power.
* Netanyahu, now leader of the opposition, is currently on trial in three corruption cases, including fraud, breach of trust, and bribery.
* In the book, Netanyahu compared corruption to "a cancer that grows in the darkness" and argued that it "distorts competition, hurts citizens’ morale, and discourages them."
* Netanyahu also criticized the concentration of power in Israel, stating that "for years immense financial power has been concentrated in the government, the labor federation and the parties."
* The book also contains advice on maintaining a small government, which Netanyahu himself quickly jettisoned on becoming prime minister again.
* Netanyahu is reportedly trying to negotiate a plea deal with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, which would include dropping the bribery charge in Case 4000 and the entire Case 2000.
* The main sticking point in the plea deal negotiations is that prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude, which would see Netanyahu barred from office for seven years.

* Deputy State Attorney Liat Ben-Ari, the lead prosecutor in Netanyahu’s case, has cooled toward a potential deal.
* State Prosecutor Amit Aisman backs an agreement while Mandelblit has become less enthusiastic about a deal.

* The head of the military’s Central Command condemned soldiers for leaving an elderly Palestinian man on the ground at a construction site, where he subsequently died of heart failure, after they detained him in the middle of the night.
* Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs described the incident as an “extremely grave ethical failure” and said the officers involved should have used greater discretion in deciding to detain the 78-year-old man, Omar As’ad, in the first place as well as to then leave him unconscious in a half-constructed building.
* IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi similarly denounced the soldiers’ actions on Tuesday in remarks made to officers preparing to become company and battalion commanders.
* According to an Israel Defense Forces probe presented to IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi on Monday, a group of some 30 soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion set up an impromptu checkpoint in the central West Bank village of Jiljilya on January 12, stopping cars and checking the identification documents of people inside.
* As’ad, an American citizen who had lived in the US for many years, was found dead a few hours later with one ziptie still around one of his hands and a blindfold over his eyes.
* An autopsy conducted by the Palestinian Authority determined that he had died of a stress-induced heart attack, brought on by being bound and gagged.
* The Central Command chief said their decision to leave him, unconscious on the ground in the middle of a near-freezing winter night, was not made out of malice, but because “they cared more about completing their mission” than about ensuring As’ad’s well-being.
* In the wake of the probe, two junior officers were dismissed from their positions and barred from command roles for the next two years, and the commander of the Netzah Yehuda Battalion will be formally censured.
* Fuchs defended the decision to not take disciplinary action against the soldiers involved in As’ad’s death, saying the responsibility was ultimately the commanders’.
* Fuchs also defended the decision to set up an impromptu checkpoint inside the village, saying the practice has allowed soldiers to arrest terrorist operatives, find weapons and otherwise prevent attacks.

The sub-events of news article:
* The eighth round of the Vienna talks aimed at removing sanctions on Iran is considered the longest, most complex, and most sensitive political negotiations.
* The US has restored sanctions waivers on some of Iran's civilian nuclear activities to allow both sides to return to their commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
* The US is pursuing both overt and covert objectives from this issue, including reassuring its regional allies about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear activities after an agreement and easing worries about Iran's nuclear breakout time.
* The issue of "nuclear breakout" has always been raised by the West and its allies to put pressure on Tehran and build a consensus against the Islamic Republic.
* Iran is not seeking to develop and use atomic bombs based on a fatwa (religious decree) by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.
* The Western media is trying to portray Iran’s nuclear breakout time as very near, claiming that it is now less than a year and possibly reduced to six months.
* The element of "time" has been used as a tool to exert pressure on Iran and reduce Tehran's maximum demands.
* The Iranian team has prioritized achieving the desired result over reaching a swift unfavorable agreement.
* US senators have come to the help of the White House in order to lower Tehran's expectations.
* The JCPOA and subsequent UN Security Council Resolution 2231 included temporary restrictions on Iran, including a five- and eight-year ban on Iran's arms and missile activities.
* The arms embargo expired last year, and the restrictions on Iran’s missile program will be lifted in the near future.
* Iran has used other means of leverage at the current critical time, such as the firm positions of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council and the increasing defense-military capability.
