* Five confirmed coronavirus carriers recently flew out of Israel for vacations abroad and were not stopped at the airport because border control authorities are not being updated with details of people actively carrying the virus.
* The incidents only came to light when health maintenance organization representatives tried to contact the patients in order to receive updates on their conditions.
* Passengers on at least one of the flights have yet to be informed that they may have been exposed to the virus and now need to go into quarantine.
* HMOs have informed authorities of the incidents, but according to the report, authorities have not yet been able to contact the travelers.
* The virus carriers were able to leave the country as the Health Ministry is not transferring information about active virus carriers to police or to the Population, Immigration and Border Control Authority.
* The Health Ministry is entrusted with providing patient details to relevant authorities and “is supposed to transfer to the border and immigration authority the information without police arbitration,” police said.
* Police clarified that while the border authority can fine those who break quarantine, it is the Health Ministry that is responsible for the data.
* Police said they had offered to assist the ministry in developing an interface and control center to resolve the issue while also taking responsibility for transferring the information, but the offer was rejected.

The sub-events of news article:
* Israeli doctors are investigating 81 cases of COVID-19 patients who appear to have recovered from the coronavirus and later became reinfected.
* Israel is believed to be the first country in the world to confirm such a large-scale investigation into reinfection.
* Scientists currently believe that fewer than two dozen people worldwide have been confirmed reinfected.
* The British medical journal Lancet put the figure as low as five in its latest report.
* The Lancet article, published Monday, put the issue of reinfection on the global health agenda, as it documented America’s first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.
* Dutch authorities reported what is believed to be the first death as a result of reinfection.
* The deceased is an 89-year-old immunocompromised woman, who tested positive, recovered, and 59 days later fell ill and once again tested positive.
* In the American case outlined in the Lancet, the patient was a 25-year-old man from Nevada, who had no known immune disorders.
* The documented Israeli patient had mild symptoms the first time around and, upon second infection, was asymptomatic with the exception of an elevated heart rate.
* The Lancet reported that with the American patient, “what is worrisome is that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection resulted in worse disease than did the first infection, requiring oxygen support and hospitalization.”
* The confirmed Israeli case was documented, peer-reviewed and published by Nachmias and colleagues from the Leumit health organization in the journal IDCases.
* The patient was a 20-year-old woman from Bnei Brak, healthy until she caught the coronavirus.
* She was diagnosed on April 17, and tested negative on May 1 and May 10.
* The patient then went for screening on August 6 and on August 11, and tested positive both times.
* Nachmias said that upon the second infection, she had a blood sample drawn for analysis and found that antibodies were present.
* Nachmias said that she doesn’t have an explanation for what went wrong to result in the reinfection, but she raised the fear of a changing virus that would undermine immunity.
* Bar Ilan University immunologist Cyrille Cohen thinks the mutation theory is unlikely.
* Cohen said that SARS-CoV-2 appears to result in immunity, with some rare exceptions, which isn’t unusual as infections from the coronavirus family go.
* Nachmias suspects reinfection is being underdiagnosed by doctors who simply don’t test recovered patients because they assume immunity.
* Tel Aviv University professor Mordechai Gerlic told The Times of Israel he suspects that mistakes account for some reports of reinfection, saying they diagnoses may well reflect testing errors, or patients who never fully recovered from their first infection.

* The renewed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region has the potential to draw in regional powers such as Iran, Russia and Turkey, and thus become a proxy war in the South Caucasus.
* The conflict is progressing towards outright war as fighting has now escalated, with cities being bombed, a rising death toll and allegations of cluster bombs being used.
* Azerbaijan has addressed the longstanding asymmetry with Armenia which always had the superior army by acquiring most of its military equipment from Russia and becoming Israel's second largest military trading partner.
* Azerbaijan established ties with Israel soon after its post-Cold War independence in 1991 and is among a handful of Muslim-majority countries which have relations with Tel Aviv.
* Iran tends to favor Armenia over Azerbaijan despite the latter being a fellow Shia Muslim majority country due to Baku's alliance with Tel Aviv and Ankara.
* Azerbaijan is not just an invaluable energy source for Israel, but it also provides Tel Aviv with valuable intelligence on military activities in northern Iran.
* The arrival of Turkish-supported Syrian mercenaries in Azerbaijan is a genuine security concern for Tehran being so close to the border.
* Armenia has "underdeveloped" ties with Israel and only opened an embassy in Tel Aviv last month.
* The Armenians have already recalled their ambassador over Israel's continued supply of "ultra-modern weapons" to Azerbaijan.
* Turkey's rejection of a ceasefire at this stage and Azerbaijan's insistence on pressing forward have made Armenian disengagement from the conflict and ceding to Baku's demands "almost impossible" to imagine.
* Turkey is fully supportive of Azerbaijan due to its troubled history with the Armenians, the lack of diplomatic ties, and the fact that the Azeris are a Turkic nation.
* Azerbaijan is crucial for pan-Turkism and connecting Turkey with the wider Turkic world across Central Asia.
* Turkey is also reliant on Azerbaijani gas imports, which jumped 23 per cent in the first half of this year.
* Russia, Turkey and Iran would not be content with allowing one or the other to dominate the Caucasus.

* Turkey's strong backing for Azerbaijan has sown fears in the West that the conflict could spiral into a full-blown war embroiling Ankara and Moscow.
* Putin and Macron are among the world leaders to denounce the reported deployment of pro-Turkish fighters from Syria and Libya to Karabakh and Iran this week warned of "terrorists" who had joined the conflict from abroad.

* Fierce fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan has not subsided since September 27, making negotiations more difficult with each passing day.
* Armenian-controlled cities in the Nagorno-Karabakh region have been shelled, including the capital Stepanakert, as well as Azerbaijani villages on the other side of the line of contact, with both sides reporting civilian deaths.
* Armenian mid-range missiles have also hit civilian targets far beyond the conflict zone, reaching as far as the Absheron region near Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku.
* Several missiles hit Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, Ganja, located close to major oil and gas pipelines from the Caspian Sea to Europe.
* On October 6, Armenian forces reportedly fired a rocket targeting the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline in Azerbaijan’s Yevlakh region.
* The rocket barely missed the oil pipeline and the nearby South Caucasus natural gas line, but the threat to major energy, transportation and communication corridors remains high.
* The Armenian military adviser to the Armenian prime minister, Vagharshak Harutyunyan, openly stated on Russian TV’s Vesti news program that the Armenian army is deliberately targeting the civilian population of Azerbaijan to create panic.
* For 30 years, the two sides have not been able to settle the conflict.
* While Armenia has tried to retain its war gains, Azerbaijan has insisted on ending Armenian occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent Azerbaijani districts — making up almost 14 percent of the country’s territory.
* Four United Nations resolutions and a UN General Assembly resolution have reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity calling on Armenia to withdraw its armed forces.
* Armenia and Azerbaijan are among the most militarized states in the world, with both being primarily armed by Russia.
* Baku has also purchased drones from Israel and Turkey.
* Most recently, Russia has supplied military equipment to Armenia via Iran, causing the large Azeri population in Iran to protest Tehran’s assistance to Yerevan.
* The Armenian media has blamed Turkey for the conflict, claiming that Ankara has sent Syrian fighters to help Azerbaijan and presenting Armenia as a defender against international terrorism.
* Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has also asserted that if Azerbaijan’s army succeeds, it would mean genocide for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, referencing the genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire in 1915.
* Although Turkey has expressed strong support for Azerbaijan’s attempt to regain its territory, there is no evidence that Ankara is actively assisting Baku militarily.
* Moscow has been surprisingly reserved since the conflict erupted and may be banking on a short war that will make both sides even more dependent on Russia.
* Russian President Vladimir Putin has emphasized that Moscow’s military agreement with Yerevan only applies to the territory of Armenia.
* Faced with Moscow’s subdued response, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that Yerevan could make concessions over the Nagorno-Karabakh region if Azerbaijan was ready to do the same.
* Washington now has a valuable opportunity to begin decisive international mediation not only to stop the armed conflict but also to negotiate a durable settlement.

* Iran has adopted a neutral stance and has repeatedly offered to mediate over the past three decades, but is traditionally worried about rising Azeri nationalism and wants to maintain its huge economic interests with largely Christian Armenia.
* Reactions from governments in the Arab and Islamic worlds have been largely muted, but some feel the escalating conflict is too dangerous to ignore.
* The conflict in the Caucasus will naturally be a polarizing and divisive issue in the Middle East, as many Christians are supporting Armenia, Turkomans back Azerbaijan, and Muslim Shia and Sunnis are divided between those who are toeing Iran's line and those who are fearful of Turkey's increasing influence in the region.

* The simmering sectarian conflicts in hotbeds such as Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, and Yemen are largely blamed for the mounting identity crisis as seen in the region's principal fault line: Sunni versus Shia.
* The new normalisation process triggered by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain striking agreements with Israel is more about rising Iranian and Turkish regional influence than about peace.

The sub-events of news article:
* Nagorno-Karabakh, a small landlocked enclave in Transcaucasia, is a potential powder keg that could threaten the security of several nations, including Russia, Turkey, Iran, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.
* Nagorno-Karabakh, with an area of 4,400 square kilometers and a population of 150,000, was attached to Azerbaijan in 1924 by Josef Stalin, despite its predominantly Armenian population.
* Stalin's gerrymandering also included dividing the Kurdish majority enclave of Lachin between Armenia and Azerbaijan and attaching Talesh, a non-Azeri coastal land, to Azerbaijan.
* In 1991, the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh expelled the Azeri minority and established their own autonomous republic, with support from Armenia and Russia.
* Azerbaijan, with support from Israel, has superiority in armament in the current round of fighting.
* Turkey has cast itself as Azerbaijan's principal backer, while depicting Russia and Iran as Armenia's allies.
* Iran is facing pressure from within to support Azerbaijan, but is also concerned about the introduction of Syrian militants into the Azeri forces and the potential for spillover into Iranian territory.
* The conflict could provoke uncontrollable reactions in Iran, where an estimated 20 million Azeri-speakers live.
* If Azerbaijan wins, Turkey, Israel, and the United States would be seen as the victors, while Iran would be seen as indifferent to Azerbaijan's aspirations.
* If Armenia wins, Russia and Israel would likely be seen as co-winners, again leaving Iran isolated.
* The war is likely to produce only losers, with Azerbaijan unlikely to regain full control of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia facing territorial losses and a refugee crisis, Turkey potentially being dragged into a fifth war, Israel forced to choose sides, Russia losing its claim as peacemaker, and Iran facing geopolitical and ideological setbacks.

* The fighting that broke out three weeks ago has been the heaviest since a 1994 ceasefire and has threatened to draw in regional powers Turkey, which backs Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a military alliance with Armenia.

* The Health Ministry of Israel is considering recommending legislation requiring Israeli citizens to be vaccinated against coronavirus when the vaccine is made available in Israel.
* The move is intended to push members of the public who fear vaccination to immunize themselves and encourage the chances of herd immunity among the populace and those who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.
* The Health Ministry information campaign about the pandemic may be stepped up in order to provide additional information about the vaccination.
* The proposal may face legal opposition, as the State of Israel has until today refrained from legally requiring any vaccinations.
* The immunization rate in Israel is one of the highest in the world.
* A law forcing citizens to immunize themselves “constitutes a fatal violation of basic rights and freedoms of the individual. The way to achieve high immunization coverage is through advocacy and the establishment of trust between the government and the public.”

The sub-events of news article:
* Israel Prize-winning scientist Prof. Shlomo Havlin claims that prioritizing young superspreaders for COVID-19 vaccines could be a shortcut toward herd immunity.
* Havlin argues that immunizing potential spreaders would prevent them from infecting others and cause the pandemic to decay much faster.
* Havlin's study, which has been peer-reviewed and will soon be published in the journal National Science Review, illustrates his logic.
* Havlin proposes identifying high-encounter people through cellphone data or by sending researchers to public places to gather information and vaccinate the most sociable person in each group.
* Havlin's mathematical model predicts that societies will get three times the benefit from their initial batches of coronavirus shots if they are administered to potential spreaders, instead of the elderly and vulnerable.
* Weizmann Institute computational biologist Eran Segal suggests that a hybrid vaccination model, combining vulnerable people and superspreaders, may have potential.

The sub-events of news article:
* Former Israeli diplomat and expert on Israel-US ties, Yoram Ettinger, says that the Jewish state and the Gulf support Trump because he has applied military and financial pressure on Iran and boosted cooperation with moderate Arab states.
* Ettinger says that if Trump's challenger, Joe Biden, wins, history might repeat itself and the new boss in Washington might return to the policies implemented by the Obama administration.
* Ettinger says that the Obama administration's policies were a mistake that should not be repeated, as they referred to the upheavals in the Middle East in 2011 as an Arab Spring and a march of democracy without realizing that it was a devastating tsunami, and refrained from admitting that Islamic terror was a threat and tackling it as such.
* Ettinger predicts that Biden is likely to continue the Obama administration's policies, simply because of the nature of his political advisers, and he is also likely to shrink the US defense budget.
* Ettinger says that the US defense budget has gone up under Trump, reaching $738 billion in 2020, an increase of $21 billion from the previous year, and that decision "enhanced the US posture of deterrence in the region and the entire world".
* Ettinger says that a move to shrink the US defense budget would "whet the appetites of rogue regimes".
* In recent years, the US has managed to infuriate a number of regional players, including Syria, by launching a series of airstrikes in 2018 together with France and the UK.

* Biden backed a 1995 Senate bill to establish a US embassy in Jerusalem by 1999.
* Biden’s 2020 campaign said he would not reverse Trump’s embassy move, but would reopen a consulate in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem “to engage the Palestinians”.
* Biden is expected to walk-back parts of Trump’s record, notably by opposing Jewish settlement construction in the occupied West Bank.
* Biden also said he would restore “humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people,” after Trump cut US support to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
* Experts agree that while a renewed Middle East peace push is unlikely to top Biden’s immediate agenda, his administration will seek to restore America’s traditional role as a broker in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The sub-events of news article:
* Israel should start having conversations with members of the emerging Biden administration rather than move forward to achieve goals that the Biden administration will not accept.
* Applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the West Bank over the next two months without coordination with the incoming Biden administration might so greatly disturb a Biden administration that pressure could be brought to bear to declare all Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank illegitimate.
* Implementation of sovereignty could even result in the imposition of US sanctions on Israel (in relation to settlement, sovereignty, or both).
* The Democratic Party of today is not the same party it was eight years ago. It has become extremist in some ways, and pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel positions have multiplied and increased their grip on Democratic constituencies.
* Israel must contact the leaders of the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt with a view to establishing a joint bloc to appear together before the new administration.
* Over the next two months, Israel can encourage the search for a solution to the problem of what became of the Palestinian Authority after Hamas tore it into pieces 13 years ago.
* Jerusalem should endorse a plan for a Palestinian Emirates in which seven separate and independent emirates are built in the West Bank cities of Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarem, Qalqilya, Ramallah, Jericho, and Arab Hebron.
* As the alliance grows, its political weight is likely to increase in the eyes of the Biden administration, and all the member states will be beneficiaries — both from their internal cooperation and from their ability to present a unified bloc to the American administration.

The sub-events of news article:
* Susan Rice and Tony Blinken are the two names most frequently mentioned as being on Biden’s short list for Secretary of State.
* Rice has several factors working in her favor, including being one of the final choices to serve as Biden’s running mate for vice president and being a woman of color.
* Rice's biggest disadvantage is possible opposition to her confirmation in the Senate due to Republican hostility towards her following the deadly attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in September 2012.
* Blinken would likely have an easier ride through the Senate due to his close relationship with Biden.
* The current Israeli government would probably have a negative reaction to the choice of Rice, seeing it as a sign that the Biden administration will continue Obama’s policies.
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also reportedly not particularly fond of Rice.
* Blinken is Jewish, with a stepfather who’s a Holocaust survivor.
* Blinken played a leading role in getting the 2015 Obama nuclear deal passed by Congress.
* Other names reportedly under consideration for Secretary of State include William Burns, Nicholas Burns, Sen. Chris Coons, and Sen. Chris Murphy.
* Israeli officials would be pleased with either William Burns or Nicholas Burns as Secretary of State.
* Dore Gold, a Netanyahu ally, urged the incoming administration to choose a secretary of state with hands-on experience of previous Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.

The sub-events of news article:
* In March 2010, Israel announced the initial approval of 1,600 new homes in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem outside the pre-1967 lines, which angered Vice President Joe Biden.
* The approval for Ramat Shlomo's new homes was not issued by the Prime Minister's Office, but rather by a lower-level planning committee overseen by the Interior Ministry.
* Biden condemned the new building plans, highlighting that what was most galling was the surprise and the apparent breach of trust.
* Netanyahu apologized both for the timing and for not letting Biden know in advance, and said he had been assured that the building work would not start for years.
* Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, telephoned Netanyahu and asserted that Israel had insulted America, had threatened to undermine the very essence of the bilateral relationship, and needed to demonstrate afresh its good-faith commitment to that partnership.
* The US under Obama clashed heavily and relentlessly with Israel under Netanyahu in two central areas — the Palestinian conflict and Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions.
* On the Palestinians, the Obama administration criticized any and all Israeli building over the Green Line, including in Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem such as Ramat Shlomo.
* On Iran, Obama and Kerry wanted to believe that the promise of international rehabilitation, rejoining the family of nations, would help deter the Islamist regime from pursuing the bomb.
* 70% of Israeli Jews said shortly before the vote that they considered Trump the “preferable” candidate, as far as Israel’s interests are concerned.
* The Palestinians are being marginalized by former steadfast supporters in the Arab world, who are instead normalizing relations and joining forces with Israel in the effort to face down Iran.
* West Bank Palestinian leaders are delightedly contemplating the return of a US administration they believe will be more empathetic to their ambitions.
* Biden will be inheriting a bitterly divided America, succeeding a president who, at this point, seems determined to resist the will of the people.

* Iran announced to begin enriching uranium to 20%, well over the limit of 4% set in the 2015 nuclear agreement.
* Iran seized a South Korean tanker in the Arabian Gulf, claiming it was violating environmental standards.
* The US deployed long-range bombers fitted with cruise missiles to the Gulf, and the aircraft carrier Nimitz is on station.
* The US also has cruisers and submarines with tomahawk land-attack missiles in the region, poised for action.
* Iran's presidential elections are approaching this summer.
* Poor handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased popular discontent in Iran.
* The economy is battered by US sanctions, entering its third consecutive year of recession.
* Anger over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani by a US drone strike in Iraq a year ago remains on a slow burn, with promises of retaliation.
* Hatred of Israel was stirred by the assassination, allegedly directed by the Mossad intelligence agency, of a key Iranian nuclear scientist.
* The new Abraham accords aligning Israel and Gulf Arab states, orchestrated by the US, represent an increasingly tight bond of the anti-Iran alliance.
* Iran has enough mines to at least temporarily shut down the Strait of Hormuz, through which flows around 30% of the world’s oil.
* Iran's leaders will want to demonstrate to their population that they are acting with determination against US “aggression” and are not begging to return to the nuclear deal.
* China has been moving strategically closer to Tehran, consummating a whopping 25-year, $400 billion investment and military cooperation deal last summer.
* The best course for Team Biden is initially to go not to Tehran, but to Brussels.
* The US should maintain significant defense capability in the region — at least a carrier strike group — to discourage adventurism and further tanker-seizing.
* The US should construct a negotiating position that includes both carrots (some immediate sanctions reductions) and sticks (threat of longer-term isolation from global markets).
* The US should promote engagement to allow diplomacy to play out before any further confrontation.
* The odds of the Trump team conducting a military strike seem low.
* However, the chances of a miscalculation on the waters of the Arabian Gulf are far from negligible, given Iran’s latest provocations.

* Fihn believes the TPNW is a game-changer for the international movement to eliminate nuclear weapons, citing support from the hibakusha, survivors of the U.S. atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
* A poll by YouGov shows that support for banning nuclear weapons among the populations of six members of the U.S.-led NATO Western military alliance ranges from 77% to 89%.
* Fihn argues that opposition to the TPNW is politically untenable and that change is coming faster than most expect, as the treaty forces research universities, financial institutions, and weapons producers to support its mission or face legal, financial, and political risks.

* Fihn argues that opposition to the TPNW is politically untenable and that change is coming faster than most expect, as the treaty forces research universities, financial institutions, and weapons producers to support its mission or face legal, financial, and political risks.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Biden administration and President Hassan Rouhani's government in Tehran both want to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but their window is closing.
* Rouhani's term will end in June when Iranians head to the polls, and the country's ruling clerics are all but certain to pave the way for a hardliner to become the next president.
* As Iranian activity slows during its Nowruz new year holiday, there are no signs of an imminent breakthrough between Washington, D.C. and Tehran.
* Rouhani has "fought tooth and nail" to keep the JCPOA alive despite domestic skepticism, but his options are almost exhausted.
* With the end of the Rouhani era in sight, the momentum is with the conservatives.
* A conservative president would ensure a smooth transition to the next supreme leader.
* Among the candidates vying to be Khamenei's chosen man is Hossein Dehghan, a former IRGC air force brigadier general who served as Rouhani's defense minister.
* It remains to be seen whether an IRGC or conservative candidate would—with approval from Khamenei—still pursue JCPOA revival.
* A conservative president is unlikely to prove an easier negotiating partner for Biden.
* For Iran hawks in Congress, the identity of Iran's next president is largely irrelevant.
* Biden's public lack of progress on the JCPOA is concerning supporters of the accord.
* Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said "the window for meaningful diplomatic engagement on Iran's nuclear activities is narrowing."
* If Biden does miss the Rouhani window, Iran's next president will try to present the U.S. with a choice between "a regional war that's going to be very costly, or a new nuclear deal that is probably less strong than the JCPOA."
* The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has also acknowledged that the election will have a bearing on what role his inspectors play.
* There is still hope for JCPOA progress in the coming months, even if both sides are sticking to their guns—at least publicly—and denying there has been any behind-the-scenes contact.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Biden administration and President Hassan Rouhani's government in Tehran both want to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but their window is closing.
* Rouhani's term will end in June when Iranians head to the polls, and the country's ruling clerics are all but certain to pave the way for a hardliner to become the next president.
* As Iranian activity slows during its Nowruz new year holiday, there are no signs of an imminent breakthrough between Washington, D.C. and Tehran.
* Rouhani has "fought tooth and nail" to keep the JCPOA alive despite domestic skepticism, but his options are almost exhausted.
* With the end of the Rouhani era in sight, the momentum is with the conservatives.
* A conservative president would ensure a smooth transition to the next supreme leader.
* Among the candidates vying to be Khamenei's chosen man is Hossein Dehghan, a former IRGC air force brigadier general who served as Rouhani's defense minister.
* It remains to be seen whether an IRGC or conservative candidate would—with approval from Khamenei—still pursue JCPOA revival.
* A conservative president is unlikely to prove an easier negotiating partner for Biden.
* For Iran hawks in Congress, the identity of Iran's next president is largely irrelevant.
* Biden's public lack of progress on the JCPOA is concerning supporters of the accord.
* Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said "the window for meaningful diplomatic engagement on Iran's nuclear activities is narrowing."
* If Biden does miss the Rouhani window, Iran's next president will try to present the U.S. with a choice between "a regional war that's going to be very costly, or a new nuclear deal that is probably less strong than the JCPOA."
* The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has also acknowledged that the election will have a bearing on what role his inspectors play.
* There is still hope for JCPOA progress in the coming months, even if both sides are sticking to their guns—at least publicly—and denying there has been any behind-the-scenes contact.

* President Hassan Rouhani rejected the decision of the Guardian Council to study the candidates’ applications.
* The Guardian Council specified that “all nominees must be between 40 and 70 years of age, hold at least a master’s degree or its equivalent, have experience of at least four years in managerial posts... and have no criminal record”.
* The new terms come in implementation of a 2016 directive from Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei for the council to clarify and “determine” the requirements.
* The updated requirements are likely to exclude some well-known figures, such as Rouhani’s telecom minister, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, who is 39, or the elite Revolutionary Guards’ Saeed Mohammad, whose rank is below major general.
* The increasing number of Revolutionary Guard generals who have announced their candidacy or are likely to be intending to compete in the presidential race, have raised fears of the “militarization” of the political circle within the Iranian regime.

* On the eve of Iran's presidential election, the Guardian Council insisted that "the political contest is serious".
* Three televised debates between the seven candidates, all men, who were approved by the unelected body of jurists and clerics, had shown that "the political competition is serious".
* The vote Friday will choose a successor to Iran's moderate President Hassan Rouhani, who cannot run again now after serving two consecutive four-year terms.
* Turnout is expected to be low in a country where many have been demoralised by years of painful economic crisis that was brought on by a crippling US sanctions regime and worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic.
* The election comes as Tehran holds renewed talks with world powers to revive a battered 2015 nuclear deal.
* Ultimate power in Iran lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the president has significant influence on issues from industrial policy to foreign affairs.
* Many voters were dismayed when a field of almost 600 hopefuls for the presidency was reduced to just seven candidates by the Guardian Council.
* The field was further reduced Wednesday when three of the seven candidates dropped out, shortly before the election campaign ended at 7:00 am (0230 GMT) Thursday.
* The only reformist left in the race against Raisi and two other ultraconservatives is the relatively low-profile central bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati.
* Raisi, Iran's judiciary chief who dresses in a black turban and religious robe, belongs to the ultraconservative camp that most deeply distrusts the United States.
* Khamenei urged voters to turn out in droves to elect "a powerful president", warning that "the Satanic power centres of the world" are trying to undermine the ballot.
