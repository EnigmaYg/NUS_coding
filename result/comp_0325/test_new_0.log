* Sadat said however that this “did not mean that political action will stop and guns will start shooting.”
* Israel did not share Sadat’s approach and held that the cease-fire continues to exist by virtue of the Security Council’s resolution of June, 1967 which established the cease-fire that ended the Six-Day War.
* Israel released today the full text of its note submitted to United Nations mediator Gunnar Jarring on Feb. 26 for transmission to Cairo.
* The Israeli note was more positive and constructive than the note Egypt sent to Jarring earlier.
* The Egyptian reply was “a negative and parsimonious approach to peace-making.”
* The Israeli note did not mention free navigation through the Straits of Tiran although it stipulated navigation rights for Israeli ships and cargoes through the Suez Canal.
* The Israeli note stated bluntly that Israel would not withdraw to the boundaries that existed on June 4, 1967, the eve of the Six-Day War.
* Eban said that this refusal was based on “the clear understanding and assurances that Security Council Resolution 242 (of Nov. 22, 1967) did not mean total withdrawal from all occupied areas.”

The sub-events of news article:
* Iranian-backed Shiite militias and Sunni tribes have joined Iraq's military in a major operation to retake Tikrit from the Islamic State group, while the U.S.-led coalition has remained on the sidelines.
* The campaign for Tikrit is a dress rehearsal for the real contest: The fight to recapture Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the extremists' biggest stronghold.
* The Tikrit operation is aimed at stopping Islamic State fighters from closing in on Samarra, a Shiite holy city just to the south.
* Directing the offensive with the aid of dozens of Iranian military advisers is a powerful Iranian general, Ghasem Soleimani, commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force.
* The U.S.-led coalition forces are not providing air power in the Tikrit operation because the Iraqis haven't requested them to.
* Liberating Tikrit without the backing of coalition airstrikes will put Iraq's security forces to the ultimate battle-readiness test.
* Iran has long been influential in Iraq, but never so much so as over the past year, when the Iraqi military collapsed in the face of the Sunni extremists' onslaught.
* Embedding coalition advisers and forward air controllers with Iraqi military units presents a twofold challenge: Frontline positions would put their lives in danger and it raises the potential for coalition forces and Iranian soldiers to share a battlefield.
* The U.S.-led mission has hit a roadblock in its efforts to support the Iraqi government, as both the Iraqi and U.S. government agree that airstrikes have pushed the militants back but there will come a point where airstrikes alone will not be enough.
* Most of the battlefield successes in Iraq have been coordinated efforts, with Iraqi and Kurdish forces and Shiite militias fighting on the ground and the U.S.-led coalition providing air power.
* The military operation to retake Mosul is planned for as early as April, but many are skeptical about whether the Iraqi military will be ready for the fight.
* The failure so far to make headway in Tikrit does not bode well, as Iraqi forces are bogged down on the outskirts of the city, unable to penetrate the extremists' defenses.
* The Islamic State group has littered major roadways with mines that slow any ground advance and require painstaking clearance operations before troops can safely move through.
* The battle for Tikrit is likely to involve Iraq's first serious urban warfare challenge, involving street battles that Iraqi security forces are not trained for.
* Concerns are also mounting over the Shiite militias' battlefield conduct in a largely Sunni region where some residents are said to have initially welcomed the Islamic State militants as a better alternative to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.
* Winning over the Sunni tribes is essential because they know the terrain of the Sunni-majority areas under Islamic State control and can fight with and advise the Shiite fighters.
* Heavy Iranian involvement only threatens to exacerbate sectarian tensions.

* U.S. and allied airstrikes against ISIS cannot and will not lead to the defeat of the Islamic State.
* The airstrikes are designed to bolster the fight on the ground by the Iraqi military, the Peshmerga, and the Shiia militias.
* The Shiia militias are trained, financed, and often led by the terrorist Iranian Quds Force.
* The U.S. and allied air strikes are aiding and abetting Iran in achieving its ultimate objective, which is total control of Iraq.
* Iran is now well on the way to extending its hegemony across the entire region.
* The West must wake up to the fact that any cooperation and alliance with Iran to fight ISIS is extremely dangerous and will turn this war into a sectarian war between the Shiites and Sunnis.
* To overcome the Islamic state, it needs a cultural and religious alternative that can defy the violent, fanatic and extremist view of Islam.
* The world now looks to the new Iraqi Prime Minister Dr. Haider al-Abadi to take control and restore order inside Iraq.
* Al-Abadi must begin by rounding up the savage Shiia militias associated with the Iranian regime, purging the army of Iranian mercenaries, and re-establishing the independence of the Judiciary.
* Al-Abadi must also re-integrate those prominent Sunnis who fought against Maliki, release the thousands of Sunni political prisoners, and openly condemn the excesses of the Shiia militias.
* Obama must change his policy in Iraq and focus on driving the Iranian militias from Iraqi territory.

* The Wall Street Journal article concludes that “The best way to defeat Islamic State would be for the U.S. to assemble a coalition of Iraqis, Kurds and neighboring Sunni countries led by U.S. special forces that minimized the role of Iran.”

The sub-events of news article:
* The Iraqi army's latest effort to defeat ISIS militants and reclaim Tikrit coincided with the public debate on the perceived emergence of a new Sunni bloc against the backdrop of Turkish-Saudi rapprochement.
* A notable aspect of the military campaign was the prominent role Tehran-backed Shiite militias and, in particular, Qasim Suleimani played.
* Iran follows a policy of expansion by accumulating greater soft and hard power.
* Tehran's expansionist tendencies can be traced back to the post-1979 efforts to export the Islamic revolution.
* The U.S. occupation of Iraq in 2003 created new opportunities for Shiite sectarianism.
* Shiite sectarianism has most recently become embodied by militias in Syria and Iraq.
* According to U.S. Gen. Dempsey, the militias comprise two-thirds of all fighters on the ground.
* A number of those groups remain terror-listed by the United States.
* The U.S. conveniently ignores the issue of foreign fighters among the ranks of Shiite militias.
* The current situation not only consolidates Iran's leadership role in the Shiite world but also triggers hatred toward the Shiite community among Sunni Muslims.
* Iran's efforts to obtain soft power through over 40 state-funded media outlets hardly exerts any influence over anyone beyond the Shiite community.
* The country's emphasis on hard power faces resistance from Sunni Muslims.
* Regional powers must step up their efforts to balance Iran out in order to help create a new order in the Middle East.

The sub-events of news article:
* Qassem Soleimani, Iran's top officer responsible for foreign operations, provides assistance in Iraq "whenever we need him," said Hadi al-Ameri, the commander of the Badr militia.
* Soleimani has advised Iraqi forces in multiple operations against the Islamic State (IS), which led a major offensive last June that overran large areas north and west of Baghdad.
* Soleimani and other Iranian advisers provide the kind of forward support during operations that U.S. President Barack Obama has yet to authorize American forces to undertake.
* Soleimani has played an increasingly public and open role in the fight against IS, a major change for a man who was once known as the elusive operative leading Iranian efforts against the U.S. in Iraq.

The information extracted from the image:


 Theme/Focus: Qassem Soleimani, commander of Iran's Quds Force, pictured in Iraq.

Key Information/Sub-event: Soleimani is shown holding a radio and wearing a military-style uniform, indicating his role as a military commander. He is surrounded by other military personnel, suggesting that he is in the midst of a military operation.

News Event Perspective: The image provides visual confirmation of Soleimani's presence in Iraq, and his active involvement in military operations against the Islamic State.

* The sectarian divisions between the paramilitary and military forces in Iraq pose a problem not just in defeating ISIS in Tikrit but also in repelling the militant group in other Sunni-majority places such as Anbar province.

* The troops entered Tikrit’s southern Shishin and northern Al Qadisiya neighborhoods on Friday, after the US-led international alliance carried out air strikes against Daesh.
* The campaign was slowed on Friday evening by clashes with Daesh that killed four and wounded 11 other soldiers.
* Most of the Iranian-backed Shiite paramilitaries, which Iraqis call the Popular Mobilization Committees, or Hashid Shaabi in Arabic, are openly hostile to the United States and have opposed coalition air strikes.
* The groups continue to hold their positions around the city’s borders but, with the exception of the Badr Organization, are boycotting the current Iraqi military foray in protest against the coalition’s involvement.
* The force of more than 20,000 fighters and military personnel, the majority of them from Iranian-backed Shiite militias, launched the offensive on March 2, but it stalled two weeks ago, with officials citing high casualties among the fighters and concerns about civilians trapped in the city.
* Iraqi military commanders called for coalition air strikes to break the deadlock, but Shiiite militia leaders said they did not need help.
* Iraqi officials, speaking in private, described the US government as unhappy with a Shiite militia-led assault on one of the largest Sunni cities in Iraq.
* Sunnis have accused the Shiite militia fighters of displacing civilians and carrying out extra-judicial killings in areas they have liberated from Daesh, including in eastern Diyala province and the farmlands surrounding Baghdad.
* The decision by Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi to request US-led air strikes on Tikrit came even though many Iraqi politicians believed he could not risk going against the wishes of the paramilitary fighters on the ground.
* US military officials, mindful of the controversy around their joining a fight in which Iran has provided critical military support, have describe the ground offensive as involving Shiite fighters not aligned with Iran.

* Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert expressed shock and disappointment that the U.S. government did not veto U.N. Security Council Resolution 280, which he believes will create obstacles in the peace process by raising unrealistic expectations on the part of the Palestinians regarding the future of Jerusalem.
* The resolution, which was passed Friday, criticized the killings of at least 29 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque and called for measures to guarantee that Palestinians be protected in the future and for the speedy implementation of the self-rule accord signed last September in Washington.
* The resolution's preamble contained language regarding Jerusalem that Jewish leaders found impossible to swallow, referring to "territories occupied by Israel in June 1967, including Jerusalem."
* In a compromise formula worked out before the resolution came to a vote, the United States was able to abstain on this and another paragraph of the preamble while being able to approve the resolution as a whole.
* The United States abstained on a paragraph about the status of Jerusalem and a second paragraph that said the Hebron attack "underlines the need to provide protection and security for the Palestinian people."
* A paragraph in the main body of the resolution, which the United States supported, called for an international presence in the territories, which was provided for in the declaration of principles that formed the basis of the Palestinian self-rule accord.
* While the United States twice abstained during the voting, the 14 other members of the Security Council voted for every paragraph in the resolution.
* Following the resolution's passage, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had agreed to return to Washington next month to resume negotiations with Israel.
* The Clinton administration's handling of the resolution was sharply attacked by the American Jewish leadership and members of Congress, who criticized the administration for sacrificing core principles for short-term objectives.
* Jewish groups expressed disappointment with the resolution's preamble, which referred to Jerusalem as occupied territory, but supported the overall thrust of the resolution's condemnation of the Hebron killings and its call for a speedy resumption of the Israeli-PLO dialogue.
* Reps. Charles Schumer and Nita Lowey criticized the resolution, questioning why a similar resolution was not introduced before the Security Council regarding the killings of Israelis by Arab terrorists.
* The Clinton administration has been working on damage control, reaffirming its position recognizing a united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and explaining that the United States would have exercised its veto if the reference to Jerusalem had been in an operative paragraph of the resolution rather than in its preamble.

* Halpern accused the Administration of “a lack of will power and resolve” in going along on the resolution and noted that “Israel has certainly as much right to defend her territory against guerrilla terrorism as we have to defend South Vietnam.”
* Israel Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin warned Jordan that neither it nor the terrorists it is harboring “will dictate to us how to react or in what proportion.”
* The triennial convention of B’nai B’rith Women adopted a resolution deploring the Security Council resolution that condemned Israel in a manner that “unfairly gave way to the Soviet-Arab bloc.”

The sub-events of news article:
* The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning Israel's attack on Gaza as a violation of the cease-fire provisions and inconsistent with the obligations of the Israel-Egyptian armistice agreement and the UN Charter.
* The resolution called upon Israel to take all necessary measures to prevent such actions.
* The United States, Britain, and France said that while Egypt must be held responsible for numerous acts of violence on the Israel frontier, the Western powers do not consider Israel’s retaliatory attack on Gaza justified.
* American delegate Henry Cabot Lodge referred to the 1950 Tripartite Declaration by the United States, Britain, and France and to a public statement made by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that should these three powers find that any of the Middle East states was preparing to violate frontiers or armistice lines, the “Big Three” would immediately take action both within and outside the United Nations to prevent such a violation.
* Ambassador Lodge emphasized that Secretary Dulles also said in his statement that Israel should become part of the Middle East community and cease to look upon itself, or be looked upon by others, as alien to this community.
* Lodge stated that to achieve this would require concessions on both sides.
* Lodge noted that General E.L.M. Burns, UN truce supervisor, had pointed out in his report that infiltration from Egyptian-controlled territory, while not the only cause of tension prior to the Gaza incident, had undoubtedly been one of its main causes.
* The U.S. Government believed that whatever the provocation might have been in this case, there was no justification for the Israeli military action at Gaza.
* The Security Council had made the point clear three times previously that Israel’s retaliatory actions were inconsistent with its Charter obligations.
* The Security Council believed that the Gaza incident was the fourth incident and the United States believed it was most serious because of its obvious premeditation.
* Sir Pierson Dixon, British delegate, called the Egyptian attack on the Israel wedding party at the Patish settlement an “outrage.”
* Henri Hoppenot, the French delegate, said that the Gaza action appeared to be a military action, deliberately planned and carried out by regular Israeli forces, “for purposes of intimidation and reprisal.”
* Soviet delegate Arkadi Sobolev declared that the statements of Israel, Egypt, and Gen. Burns had indicated that Israel was responsible for the Gaza attack and that therefore the Council had to take action to censure Israel.

* Shertok emphasized that if a truce is achieved in Palestine, there must be an international authority to maintain and supervise it.

* Shertok warned that Jerusalem was in danger of becoming a battlefield, even a "shambles," and emphasized that it was the responsibility of the United Nations to enforce peace and order in this city.

* The IAEA report was issued to the U.N. agency's member states with Tehran and six world powers striving to nail down final terms of an accord on curbing its disputed nuclear programme in exchange for relief from sanctions.
* Among the issues holding up a settlement is Iran's demand that sanctions be rescinded immediately after a deal is clinched against the powers' insistence they can be lifted only in phases depending on Tehran's compliance with the terms.
* The IAEA also said it remained vital that Iran respond to the agency's questions on and access to the Parchin military base, where Western officials suspect Tehran conducted explosives tests relevant to nuclear bombs.
* The United States said it is not considering negotiating beyond the end-June deadline despite comments from France and Iran indicating there was some room to do so.
* The deal sought by the powers would have Iran accept limits to its uranium enrichment capacity and open up to unfettered IAEA inspections to help ensure it could not put its nuclear programme to developing bombs.

* The panel cited media reports and published several photos of Maj. Gen. Ghasem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, showing that he traveled to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
* The experts said they were investigating a report from an unnamed member state that an Iranian approached a company in January 2015 trying to buy compressors, which can be used to extract enriched uranium from centrifuges that could be used to fuel nuclear missiles.
* Iran has also sent arms to Iraq, according to the report.
* The report lists arms shipments to Yemen dating back to 2009 — including recent reported shipments to Houthi Shiite rebels fighting the country's government.

The sub-events of news article:
* President Obama may sign an agreement with Iran that Israel views as calamitous.
* Israel has repeatedly said that Iran poses an existential threat to the country.
* Pro-Israel organizations have called for stricter sanctions and opposing the concessions the United States has reportedly made to placate the Iranians.
* Congress is powerless to stop Obama from appeasing Iran.
* If press reports are accurate, the proposed agreement will allow Iran to remain on the threshold of building nuclear weapons, to continue its advanced missile research, to continue uranium enrichment, to prevent inspections of military sites, to refuse to disclose information about its past nuclear activities and to continue to promote terrorism and the destabilization of the region.
* The legislation passed by Congress to allow it to review any agreement the president signed is toothless; Obama can ignore it and will if need be.
* Opponents of the Iran framework have been unable to counter Obama’s false dichotomy of an agreement or war.
* The only hope of preventing a bad agreement is for the leaders of the pro-Israel community to mobilize the public the way they did in the heyday of the Soviet Jewry movement.

* Israel's ambassador to the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency in Vienna, Merav Zafary-Odiz, said that Israel intends to ratify the CTBT when the time is ripe and certain considerations are met.
* One of the obstacles to Israel's ratification of the CTBT is that Iran does not recognize Israel and is not willing to accept the fact that Israel belongs to its natural geographical group.
* Iranian ideological hostility to Israel is among the factors spurring world powers to curb Tehran's disputed nuclear program.
* Negotiators are working toward a June 30 deadline for a deal under which Iran would roll back projects with bomb-making potential in exchange for sanctions relief.

The sub-events of news article:
* Ram Ben Barak, a leading candidate for the next head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, warned that the prospective nuclear deal with Iran would empower Iran to take over the Middle East and trigger a regional nuclear arms race.
* Ben Barak said the lifting of sanctions would give Tehran “an ocean of money,” allowing it to buy influence across the Middle East and “advance to a position where no one will be able to threaten it and it will acquire control wherever it pleases.”
* Ben Barak noted that there is “almost no area in the Middle East today where Iran remains uninvolved: Iraq, where Iranian interests are in line with US interests, Lebanon, where Hezbollah is effectively an Iranian division, and Yemen, which was mostly conquered by Iran.”
* Ben Barak said he shared the view that countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia were almost certain to enter a nuclear arms race to counterbalance Iran’s nuclear aspirations.
* Ben Barak said Iran’s proxy, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, may lose its war in Syria against the Islamic State, one instance where the Sunni-Shiite conflict rages closer to Israel.
* Ben Barak also said an analysis which considers Israel to be at an advantage because its enemies are battling another is “an immature view.”

The sub-events of news article:
* A new ad for Bezeq phone company's "smart home" technology features Gidi Gov playing the role of an asthmatic salesman who bursts into an Iranian nuclear control center and pleads to stop the launch of a nuclear device.
* The ad was broadcast on Israel's Channel 2 during a commercial break in the main TV news, minutes after a news report on millions of Iranians marching in rallies chanting "Death to America" and "Death to Israel."
* The ad was screened again later in the same news broadcast, minutes after Channel 2's Middle East affairs analyst proclaimed that the nuclear deal being negotiated by the US-led world powers and Iran in Vienna is essentially done, "and it's even worse" than had been expected.

The sub-events of news article:
* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decried an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program hundreds of times.
* The agreement finalized Tuesday morning in Vienna will relieve Iran of crippling international sanctions in return for Iran limiting its uranium enrichment, ridding most of its stockpile of enriched uranium and submitting to agreed-upon inspections of its nuclear facilities.
* The deal stipulates that Iran freeze and store — but not dismantle — much of its nuclear infrastructure, and requires inspectors to request access to some Iranian facilities before entering.
* Sanctions are set to be lifted once Iran fulfills its commitments to deactivate centrifuges, restructure its nuclear facilities and transfer or dilute its uranium stockpile.
* Sanctions could be restored within 65 days if a committee of representatives from world powers and Iran determines that Iran has violated the agreement.
* Portions of the accord will expire between 10 and 25 years from the date the accord is adopted.
* The United Nations Security Council is expected to endorse the accord in a resolution.
* Netanyahu has made opposing Iran’s nuclear program the defining issue of his premiership, and has consistently criticized the potential agreement since negotiations began in 2013.
* The agreement also was criticized by Israeli opposition leaders, and the Israeli public has long been skeptical of a deal.
* The only thing standing in the way of the deal’s implementation now is a vote in Congress.
* Senators and congressmen will have two months to parse the deal’s details, and will vote to accept or reject it when Congress reconvenes in September.
* Obama has promised to veto a rejection, and overriding that veto would require a two-thirds majority in both houses.
* Israel will need to build a broad coalition of the deal’s opponents — including former members of the Obama administration — if it is to convince enough lawmakers to reject the deal.
* Republicans have staunchly opposed a deal.
* Some experts said that Netanyahu’s March speech before Congress damaged the effort to fight the deal by forcing Democratic members of Congress to choose between backing Israel and supporting Obama.
* Should the effort in Congress fail, some Israeli politicians have declared that there’s only one avenue left to prevent a nuclear Iran: a military strike.
* Experts have assessed that an Israeli strike on Iran would not be able to destroy its nuclear program.
* A strike has grown more likely, as the deal has left Iran with the capability to enrich uranium, giving it the ability to produce a bomb.

* Olli Heinonen, the former deputy director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the recently-signed nuclear deal’s provision allowing Iran more than three weeks notice before accepting international inspectors will help the country cheat in its nuclear obligations.
* Iran has signed an IAEA additional protocol permitting short-notice inspections but is delaying ratification for eight years.
* Components for nuclear bombs or warheads can be put together in a relatively small space, some 239 square yards in size.
* With a dispute settlement process that gives the Iranians 24 days before allowing inspectors in, hiding nuclear arms development work will be made easier.
* The West will be able to monitor larger Iranian facilities, but smaller ones could escape detection.
* Certain activities would leave traces that would be detectable even after Iran cleaned up, but many activities could be effectively hidden once a location was sanitized.
* Iran delayed IAEA inspectors’ access for several months in 2003; and renovated the Kelaya electric company building in the interim. By the time Iran allowed inspectors in, there were traces of enriched uranium at the facility, but not at the site that had been sanitized.
* William Tobey, a nuclear nonproliferation expert, wrote earlier this week that process for gaining access to a suspected nuclear site may actually take longer than 24 days due to imprecision in the language of the deal.

The sub-events of news article:
* Iran will inspect itself at its most sensitive known military complex to clear up suspicions of past military activity.
* Iran is required to "close the file" on past military dimensions of its nuclear program before it can get sanctions relief and proceed with the long-term nuclear deal negotiated in Vienna.
* Two senior U.S. officials told NBC News that the unusual arrangement between the IAEA and Tehran relates only to past military activity and that UN inspectors, including IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, would be on site to supervise the Iranians at every step of the way.
* A senator who opposes the deal and attended classified briefings on the IAEA's role at the Parchin complex southeast of Tehran disputes the claim that IAEA inspectors will be inside the Parchin facility while soil samples are being taken.
* The senator says the IAEA will be outside the facility where the soil samples are being taken - a concession to save face for Iran.
* Congress has not been shown the side deal negotiated between the IAEA and Tehran.
* The administration claims the future inspection regime is unprecedented in its intrusiveness.
* The Parchin "side deal" is becoming a key talking point against the deal by critics.
* House Speaker John Boehner said, "President Obama boasts his deal includes 'unprecedented verification.' He claims it's not built on trust. But the administration's briefings on these side deals have been totally insufficient — and it still isn't clear whether anyone at the White House has seen the final documents."
* House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said: "International inspections should be done by international inspectors. Period."
* John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican senator, said, "Trusting Iran to inspect its own nuclear site and report to the U.N. in an open and transparent way is remarkably naive and incredibly reckless. This revelation only reinforces the deep-seated concerns the American people have about the agreement."

The sub-events of news article:
* The State Department denied the UN atomic watchdog agreed to let Iran inspect its own nuclear facilities, rejecting revelations of a secret side deal between the Islamic Republic and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
* The Associated Press reported on a previously undisclosed side deal between Iran and the IAEA that would allow Tehran to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it has been accused of using to develop nuclear arms at least a decade ago.
* State Department spokesman John Kirby dismissed the report, saying in “no way” would the UN nuclear agency cede its oversight to Iran.
* Olli Heinonen, in charge of the Iran investigation as IAEA deputy director general from 2005 through 2010, said he could think of no similar arrangement — a country essentially allowed to carry out much of the probe of suspicions against it.
* Republican lawmakers have been severely critical of the broader agreement to limit Iran’s future nuclear programs, signed by the Obama administration, Iran and five world powers in July.
* House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi questioned the significance of the disclosure, noting it relates to investigations of past military work, not nuclear dealings going forward.
* Pelosi asserted that House Democrats have the votes to uphold any Obama veto of a congressional resolution disapproving of the Iran agreement.
* The director general of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, defended the agreement the agency reached with Iran concerning the Parchin military site, saying the arrangements are technically sound and consistent with long-established practices.
* Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman of Iran’s nuclear agency, called the AP report “media speculation” without denying its substance.
* The document seen by the AP is a draft that one official familiar with its contents said doesn’t differ substantially from the final version.
* The document suggests that instead of carrying out their own probe, IAEA staff will monitor Iranian personnel as they inspect the Parchin nuclear site.

* The IAEA must have the opportunity to explain its decisions concerning Iran.

The sub-events of news article:
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is conducting a campaign against the nuclear deal with Iran, hoping to defy Capitol Hill arithmetic and inspire enough American lawmakers to thwart it.
* Netanyahu has good reasons to be skeptical about the accord six world powers signed with Iran last month, fearing the cementing of the ayatollahs’ regime, increased terrorism, the establishment of Iran as a regional power, and perhaps even mushroom clouds over Israel.
* Netanyahu's relentless and vociferous lobbying against the deal is causing severe climate change in the already-not-so-warm ties between Washington and Jerusalem.
* The US administration was, is and will remain willing to provide Israel with military assistance, and has even pledged to be more generous than usual because of the Iran deal.
* Israel’s aggressive lobbying, which includes speaking to US lawmakers about a “moral duty” to oppose the deal, is proving corrosive.
* US President Barack Obama has openly criticized the Israeli government’s “unprecedented” effort to scuttle the deal, but insists that it will go unpunished.
* Talks about upgrading Israel’s military capabilities are conducted by human beings, not robots. Israel’s interlocutors in the Pentagon will naturally not be as well-disposed toward the Jewish state as they would have been had Jerusalem not been fighting a bitter campaign seeking to kill the president’s most important foreign policy initiative.
* Netanyahu believes that his public fight with the administration will lead Democrats to want to “mend fences with Jewish voters,” especially ahead of the 2016 presidential elections, and press the government to be especially generous to Israel when it finally discusses an increase in US military aid.
* Netanyahu’s confrontation with the White House and his call on American Jews to oppose the deal is liable to have at least two other undesired side effects: turning support for Israel into a partisan issue and leading to serious rifts in the American Jewish community.

The sub-events of news article:
* A group of rabbis across religious denominations expressed concerns with the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran.
* The rabbis believe the agreement will harm the short-term and long-term interests of the United States and its allies, particularly Israel.
* If implemented, Iran will receive up to $150 billion without committing to changing its behavior, including denying basic human rights, calling for America's downfall and Israel's annihilation, and denying the Holocaust.
* The deal will not subject Iran to a comprehensive inspections structure, allowing the regime to violate the agreement and develop a covert nuclear program.
* The deal will lift key arms embargos, giving Iran international legitimacy to arm terror groups with conventional weapons and ballistic missiles in eight years.
* The agreement entitles Iran to develop advanced centrifuges after 10 years, paving the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons with virtually zero "breakout time."
* The rabbis agree with assessments from leaders and experts in the United States and Israel that a better deal is possible and necessary.
* The rabbis call upon Senators and Representatives to vote against the deal and support the opposition of many Jewish organizations.
* The rabbis emphasize the critical responsibility to shape a better world for future generations and insist on a better deal.

The sub-events of news article:
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's public warmongering and confrontational policies played a major role in shaping the US strategy against Iran, leading to the nuclear deal.
* Israel's previous policy was to avoid taking a leading role in the campaign against Iran's nuclear program and to coordinate all major strategic decisions with the US.
* The Mossad was responsible for executing Israel's anti-Iranian policy, which included sanctions, covert operations, and exploiting ethnic divisions in Iran.
* The Stuxnet computer virus, which damaged Iran's uranium-enrichment centrifuges, was a joint project of the Israeli and American intelligence communities, initiated and executed by the Mossad.
* Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak's public threats and military preparations led the Obama administration to believe that Israel was serious about a military strike, increasing anxiety and leading to the decision to negotiate a deal with Iran.
* The US approach to the negotiations was hasty, resulting in a less than perfect deal with weaknesses in punitive measures and inspection clauses.
* The deal paves the way for Iran to purchase better air defense systems, making a future military strike more dangerous.
* Netanyahu should have coordinated his concerns with the US administration to influence the outcome of the deal and define red lines for substantial violations.

* Putin accepted Netanyahu’s position, reportedly telling him, “We are aware of the shelling against Israel and we condemn all such shelling.”
* Israel was quick to respond to the rocket fire in order to show that it does not intend to shy away.
* Russia was also quick to respond in its own way, despite the meeting with Netanyahu, with Putin criticizing Israel’s attack on the Syrian army in response to the rocket fire from the civil war.
* Official Israeli policy has been to respond forcefully to every rocket and mortar that crosses the border into Israel — deliberate or otherwise.
* Israel has not actually responded to every attack.
* In this week’s attacks, military officials made it clear that Israel “sees the Syrian regime and its army as responsible for what happens in the field.”

* Russia's air strikes in Syria have restricted Israel's freedom of action and maneuverability in Syria.
* Russia's air strikes targeted positions of rebel groups opposing the regime of President Bashar Assad, including factions supported by the US.
* Russia is trying to create a division of labor that is not to the liking of the US and its Arab and Western coalition partners assembled to fight on two fronts: the Assad regime and Islamic State.
* The big winner of the new situation is Assad and his failed regime.
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have met with Russian officials to discuss "deconfliction" to avoid accidental clashes between Israel and the Russia armies.
* Putin hopes to achieve the following aims: to help Assad to consolidate his regime, to ensure Russian access to warm water ports in the Mediterranean, to safeguard Russia's last bastion and stronghold (Syria) in the Middle East, to enable Putin to conduct a confrontational foreign policy against the US, to leverage Syria as a bargaining chip for Russia to enhance agreements across the board, to contain ISIS, and to avoid sending "boots on the ground" to fight in Syria.
* The bloody civil war that has already caused the death of more than 250,000 Syrians will be prolonged because of Russian involvement, at least in the short term.
* Against the background of negative ramifications on Israel's security posture, there is a possible positive side: the continuation of the war benefits Israel by enhancing its standing as an unmatched regional power, while Hezbollah and Iran are weakened by their involvement.

The sub-events of news article:
* Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that compressing a spring to its limit will cause it to snap back hard, and Russia considers its near-abroad as a vital security belt.
* Israel's security is dependent on its military control of the high ground of the West Bank and the Jordan River Valley.
* Russia understands Israel's security concerns better than the Obama administration and the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party.
* Obama has failed to challenge the Russians in Europe and the Chinese in Asia, and his administration has never had a Syrian policy.
* The success of the Bush experiment in democracy within Iraq led to the Arab Spring, but Obama's support for the pro-Iranian al-Maliki government and its repression of the Sunni community in Iraq led to the rise of the Jihadi extremists.
* The Obama administration's failure to follow up its words of condemnation against Assad with any real action led to a region-wide Sunni response against a perceived US tilt toward Iran.
* Russia entered Syria because it saw the Islamic State as a far more potent danger than the initial peaceful democratic opposition in Syria or a successful electoral process in Iraq.
* Moscow understands that for there to be a serious political settlement in Syria, Iranian influence needs to be vastly reduced and its links to non-state actors eliminated.
* Russia claims to have some kind of understanding with Israel, but Iranian hegemony is as serious a threat to Jerusalem as it is to the Sunni world.
* The US elections are only a year away, and President Putin cannot count on an isolationist US administration to be installed.
* The Russian "spring" has caused the US position on Syria to harden, and its allies, such as Turkey, Germany, France, and eastern Europe, are deeply concerned over Russian actions.
* The future of NATO is under severe pressure due to Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria.
* Events in Taiwan and the South China Sea, as well as Ukraine and Syria, are propelling the world into very dangerous territory.
* A Chinese aircraft carrier and a flotilla of Russian warships are now sailing off the coast of Syria, and both Moscow and Beijing have promised Iran greater military cooperation in the Gulf.
* An Iranian resupply of its proxies in Yemen could become the theatre of a superpower showdown.
* President Putin knows that Shiite supremacy will be fought tooth and nail, and Iranian nuclear weapons are not in his interest.
* A political settlement in Syria requires a broad regional and global superstructure in order to be implemented on the ground.
* Moscow needs Jerusalem to help build that regional structure through an understanding on the future of nuclear weapons within the region.
* President Putin also needs the cooperation of the US in order to establish such a regional settlement.
* The Middle East could continue to deteriorate into superpower proxy client states, all with a destabilized nuclear arms component, or the region could seek genuine peace.
* Iran's recent missile test and its now documented underground missile bases assure movement toward an apocalyptical nuclear scenario.
* The region of the Middle East will either help to establish a multipolar cooperative world order or continue on the path it's already on and pay the consequences.
* The three superpowers, Russia, China, and the US, must begin to cooperate and lead the way toward a durable world peace.

* France will recognize a Palestinian state if a final push for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians fails.
* US-led efforts to broker peace for a two-state solution collapsed in April 2014.
* Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has repeatedly warned that letting the status quo continue risks killing off a two-state solution.
* Last year, Fabius failed to get the United States on board to push for a UN Security Council resolution to set parameters for talks between the two sides and set a final deadline for a deal.
* The expansions of settlements by Israel since have been described by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as "provocative acts" that raise questions about its commitment to a two-state solution.
* Fabius has previously called for an international support group comprising Arab states, the European Union and UN Security Council members that would essentially force the two sides to compromise.
* Fabius said Paris would begin preparing in the "coming weeks" an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European and Arab.
* If this last attempt at finding a solution hits a wall, "well in this case, we need to face our responsibilities by recognising the Palestinian state", he said.
* A French diplomatic source said the aim was to launch the conference before the summer and that it would not be accompanied by a UN Security Council resolution, which would inevitably fail.
* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously criticized recent French initiatives, calling them "counter-productive".
* Despite anger in the US administration over Israeli settlements, there is little prospect of US President Barack Obama supporting any initiative that could upset the US Jewish lobby just 10 months before an election.
* Nabil Abu Rdainah, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said he welcomed the move.
* "There is no doubt that a French recognition of the Palestinian state will contribute to building peace and stability in the region," he said.
* An Israeli official, who declined to be identified, said: "The foreign minister of France says up front that if his initiative reaches a dead end, France will recognize a Palestinian state. This statement constitutes an incentive for the Palestinians to bring about a dead end. Negotiations cannot be held nor peace achieved in this manner."
* Palestine has non-member observer status at the United Nations and its flag flies with those of member states at UN headquarters in New York.
* Sweden became the first EU member nation to recognize the Palestinian state in 2014 and has since been followed by several others.
* Palestinians seek a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, parts of which have been occupied by Israel since a 1967 war.

The sub-events of news article:
* France proposed an international summit in Paris to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and preserve the two-state solution.
* France warned that it would recognize a Palestinian state if the initiative fails.
* Israel called the French initiative "puzzling" and said it ensures the talks will fail.
* The Palestinian Authority welcomed the French initiative.
* The French proposal is seen as out-of-touch, as neither side is in any mood to compromise or has the political ability to push for radical solutions.
* Europe is preoccupied with the refugee crisis, the Arab states are dealing with ISIS and each other, and the U.S. is in an election year and has essentially relinquished the Israeli-Palestinian issue.
* The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, visited Israel-Palestine to promote a two-state solution that the Obama administration itself seems to have given up on.
* The two-state solution is still supported by many think tanks, organizations, and lobby groups, as well as the American and European left.
* The PA is on the verge of collapse, and recent Israeli policies have been criticized as skirting the thin line between South African apartheid and Loony Tunes cartoons.
* The only way forward is equality, but achieving equality will require uneasy compromises by both parties, responsible leadership, committed foreign allies, and a willingness to recognize that the current situation is simply untenable.

The sub-events of news article:
* US Secretary of State John Kerry said efforts to revive the stalled Israeli Palestinian peace process need to take a “slightly different” course than they have in the past.
* Kerry said he saw the justification behind the multilateral confab, backing comments reportedly made by an Israeli general weeks ago that rampant violence over the past month would only get worse without a diplomatic effort on the horizon.
* Paris’s proposal — to convene two regional peace conferences aimed at advancing the implementation of the two-state solution, and unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood should the effort fail — is “a reflection of the frustration the international community feels” about the turmoil in the region.
* Kerry asserted at the hearing that the US government opposed any unilateral steps toward Palestinian statehood.
* Kerry quoted Israel media reports about statements made by IDF military intelligence chief Herzl Halevi, who told a Knesset committee that lack of progress with the Palestinians could lead to more violence.
* Twenty-nine Israelis and three foreign nationals have been killed in a wave of Palestinian terrorism and violence since October, during which nearly 170 Palestinians have also been killed.
* US President Barack Obama said he discussed ways to reduce the violence via a diplomatic solution with Jordan’s King Abdullah.
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the French proposal during a press conference in Berlin.
* Kerry called on both sides to take measures to signal “readiness and willingness to reduce the violence.”
* Kerry said Israel was at least partially responsible for the moribund peace efforts.

* Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope that a French initiative to hold an international Middle East peace conference could lead to a solution like breakthrough talks on Iran's nuclear deal.
* Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in April 2014, and the situation has deteriorated since then.
* A wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories since October has killed 178 Palestinians as well as 28 Israelis, an American, a Sudanese and an Eritrean.
* In January, then French foreign minister Laurent Fabius announced plans by Paris to revive plans for an international conference to "bring about the two-state solution" to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
* Abbas said he hoped the proposal "would allow the creation of a mechanism for a political solution on the model of what happened between the Europeans, Americans and Iran".
* Last year Iran struck a historic deal with world powers, that agreed to provide Tehran relief from crippling sanctions in exchange for limits on its atomic programme.
* Should efforts to breathe life into the moribund peace process fail, France would move to unilaterally recognise Palestine as a state, Fabius said in January.

The sub-events of news article:
* Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope that a French initiative to hold an international Middle East peace conference could lead to a solution like breakthrough talks on Iran's nuclear deal.
* Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in April 2014, and the situation has deteriorated since then.
* A wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories since October has killed 178 Palestinians as well as 28 Israelis, an American, a Sudanese and an Eritrean.
* In January, then French foreign minister Laurent Fabius announced plans by Paris to revive plans for an international conference to "bring about the two-state solution" to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
* Abbas said he hoped the proposal "would allow the creation of a mechanism for a political solution on the model of what happened between the Europeans, Americans and Iran".
* Last year Iran struck a historic deal with world powers, that agreed to provide Tehran relief from crippling sanctions in exchange for limits on its atomic programme.
* Should efforts to breathe life into the moribund peace process fail, France would move to unilaterally recognise Palestine as a state, Fabius said in January.
