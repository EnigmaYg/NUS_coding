* Nauert's comment came after a barrage of questions about statements made by Richard Grenell, the recently-appointed US ambassador to Germany.
* Grenell said in an interview with Breitbart that conservatives from all over Europe told him there was a feeling of resurgence following the election of US President Donald Trump.
* Grenell has been the US envoy to Berlin for less than six weeks, but he has already managed to offend the Germans by demanding they cease trading with Iran.
* US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman told reporters covering the deadly protests along the border with Gaza to “just keep your mouths shut until you figure it out.”

The sub-events of news article:
* Two former advisors from within the Canadian and US administrations have warned of the economic threat posed by US President Donald Trump ahead of the G7 summit in Canada.
* Roland Paris, a former top foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Daniel Price, a former personal representative of George W. Bush at G8 and G20 summits, think there is a chance that US President Donald Trump might cancel his participation in the summit of world leaders at the last minute.
* The G7 summit, which will bring together the leaders of Canada, the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, comes at a time that many view as a moment of historic division between Washington and its major allies in North America, Europe and Asia.
* Just days ago the Trump administration slapped stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on five of its six G7 partners.
* While the tariffs, which Europe and Canada fought hard to prevent, are the most recent, they are just the last in an increasingly long list of deep disagreements between the US and its allies.
* French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau recently all failed to convince Trump not to impose tariffs on the allies.
* In a sign of how deep the rift is, six of the seven G7 finance ministers last weekend took the unusual step of issuing a joint a message rebuking Washington for imposing the tariffs.
* For Paris, the former Trudeau adviser, now a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, the current division between the US and Canada is more fundamental than any previous disagreements between the neighboring countries.
* Despite the friction between the US and its allies, which neither Price nor Paris said they believe will be resolved, they think the G7 meeting can still be valuable — if only to air the differences between the two sides.

* German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that it would take much longer to rebuild lost trust than to destroy it with a tweet.
* France and Europe are standing by the G7 communique, and anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their "incoherence and inconsistency".
* Europe's answer to Trump's "America First" policy must be to stick even closer together, defend its interests and strengthen alliances with countries such as Japan and Canada.
* The top White House economic adviser accused Canada's prime minister of betraying Trump with "polarising" statements on U.S. trade policy that risked undermining the American leader on the eve of a historic summit with North Korea.

The sub-events of news article:
* National Security Advisor John Bolton stated that the Trump administration's decision to leave the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was about restoring American control over U.S. foreign policy, not just about the council's anti-Israel bias.
* The Trump administration's determination to restore American power and independence in the international arena places it on a collision course with the European Union (EU), whose perspective on the proper goal of international affairs is diametrically opposed to the administration's.
* The UNHRC is a perfect vehicle for advancing Europe's foreign policy, which has been consistently hostile towards Israel since the mid-1970s.
* UN Ambassador Nikki Haley expressed frustration at the fact that Europe had refused to assist in the U.S.'s efforts to reform the UNHRC by, among other things, cancelling Agenda Item 7, which created a separate standard for judging Israel.
* British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson's speech at the UNHRC was a case study in how the EU hides its opposition to the U.S. on Israel and the issue of nationalism and U.S. independence.
* Johnson's speech effectively endorsed the destruction of all rules in the international system by praising the UNHRC despite its institutional bias against Israel.
* Johnson's opposition to Item 7 is disingenuous, as he said the UK would only stop voting in favor of those resolutions in six months, indicating that Britain is not serious about peace.
* Johnson's impassioned plea for universal female education was irrelevant to the UNHRC's mandate and was likely just a way to justify remaining in an institutionally anti-Semitic body.
* Johnson is trying to organize a meeting of European and Arab foreign ministers with Trump's senior advisor Jared Kushner to present their "red lines" for peace, which is likely an attempt to gang up on the U.S. and tell the President's son-in-law that they will not accept any plan that doesn't reflect their animus towards Israel.
* Kushner responded to Johnson's attempt to railroad the White House into giving the EU veto power over U.S. Middle East policy by saying that while he is open to outside input in the U.S. peace plan, the President will decide its contents.

* Trump claims the United States pays “close to the entire cost of NATO” and that Germany pays only 1% of its GDP towards NATO, while the United States pays 4% of a larger GDP.
* The idea that European allies free ride off U.S. security spending is long-standing, but it ignores Kennan’s Cold War logic that NATO was meant to de-securitize Western European states and strengthen European security.
* NATO serves to counteract threats from Russia and China, and maintains the international system’s stability.
* The second myth that Trump’s statements feed is that United States’ alliances provide minimal benefits.
* U.S. defense pacts reduce the risks of conflict because America faces conflicting commitments and needs to restrain itself militarily.
* America’s significant number of alliances reduce the risk of future war.
* The United States can effectively restrain its allies from great conflicts because of its dominant position in its alliance hierarchies.
* Trump and other critics fundamentally misunderstand the benefit to the U.S. alliance network.
* NATO and other allies serve to maintain the current rules-based international order, reduce Washington’s risk of war, and decrease levels of global conflict.

The sub-events of news article:
* Two Jerusalem legal aid organizations will petition the Israeli Supreme Court to overturn a new military order which makes it possible for Israeli forces to demolish Palestinian homes in Area C within 96 hours after delivering demolition orders.
* Military order 1797 excuses Israeli authorities from informing Palestinian homeowners directly that their homes are slated for demolition.
* Israeli authorities only require demolition orders be placed “next to” relevant structures 96 hours before Israeli forces arrive to execute demolitions.
* Israel’s discriminatory housing policies in the West Bank ensure that it is almost impossible for the 300,000 Palestinians living in Area C to fulfill the appeal requirements put in place by military order 1797.
* COGAT remains the sole arbiter of appeals, meaning that even if Palestinians fulfill the appeal requirements, COGAT empowers itself to proceed with demolition anyway.
* This new military order violates international law, including Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which defines forcible transfer of occupied populations as a crime against humanity.
* The Palestinian Authority condemned military order 1797 when it was first announced.

* Israeli occupation forces evicted 15 illegal Jewish settler families from the illegal outpost of Netiv Ha’avot in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday.
* The 15 dwellings are to be demolished within the next few days under a supreme court order.
* Hundreds of young pro-settlement hard-liners gathered in several of the homes slated for demolition, and some hoisted Israeli flags.
* Most countries consider all Israeli settlements built in the West Bank and other land captured in the 1967 war as illegal.
* There are now about 500,000 illegal Israeli settlers living among some 2.6 million Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.
* Palestinians dismissed the dismantling of a small number of homes as an empty gesture.
* The Israeli government has announced a plan to pay compensation to the families whose homes are to be razed and rehouse them on adjacent tracts not owned by individual Palestinians.
* The remainder of Netiv Ha’avot, where some 20 houses stand on land not covered by the court ruling, is to be granted legal status and designated a neighbourhood of an Israeli government-recognised settlement, Elazar.
* Israeli occupation authorities have carried out similar evictions in the past under court order.
* Settlement expansion has continued, with little objection from the administration of US President Donald Trump.
* Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and say Israeli settlements are intended to deny them a viable and contiguous country.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Supreme Court of Israel has authorized the destruction of the Palestinian community of Khan al-Ahmar and the expulsion of its 173 residents, including 92 children, to a site near a dumpster in Abu Dis.
* Khan al-Ahmar is one of dozens of Palestinian communities under threat of expulsion, and it will be the first such community in many years to be forcibly expelled in its entirety.
* Israel has been trying to silently transfer Palestinians from all of Area C of the West Bank, which Israel exploits as though it were its own.
* The state forbids residents from connecting to infrastructural networks like water, sewage and electricity, prevents them from building legally, demolishes homes that residents had to build without permits, destroys basic infrastructure laid by them, and holds military training exercises that include firing live ammunition and shelling on agricultural land, in pastures and even within residential areas and between houses.
* In the last year alone, the Civil Administration demolished two schools and one kindergarten in Area C, leaving 138 children with no educational framework.
* Today, 45 schools in Area C are under threat of partial or full demolition.
* The vast majority of Palestinians in Area C cannot build legally without master plans, which are never approved by the Civil Administration.
* The Supreme Court's basic assumption in discussing the future of Khan al-Ahmar was that the residents are criminals who built their homes illegally, but Palestinians do not have the privilege of building legally outside the small, crowded enclaves the state allocates for them.
* Israel is trying to concentrate Palestinians in the tiniest enclaves possible, while taking over as much land as it can, creating unbearable living conditions for Palestinians to make them transfer themselves and building and expanding settlements for Jews.
* The forcible transfer of Khan al-Ahmar's residents to the dumpster in Abu Dis is a horrific escalation of Israel's policy of silent expulsion.
* The prime minister, the minister of defense and the head of the Civil Administration are all responsible for the policy of expulsion, and the Supreme Court justices who authorized the destruction of Khan al-Ahmar are complicit in dispossession and forcible transfer.

* The clashes started as hundreds of police officers arrived in Tapuah Maarav, a Jewish outpost in the northern West Bank, to evict 10 houses that were built without permits.
* The Supreme Court ruled that these houses were built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land and should be evicted by the end of June.
* By noon, some 11 police officers were injured and six settlers were arrested for rioting.
* Under the international law, all Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, are illegal.

* The army said on Thursday that following the court ruling the process of enforcing eviction and demolition orders was under way, but did not say when the buildings would be razed.

* Khan al-Ahmar is located near several major Israeli settlements and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea.

The sub-events of news article:
* The High Court of Justice agreed to hold a hearing on a petition filed by residents of Khan al-Ahmar against the state’s decision to demolish the Bedouin village near the West Bank settlement of Ma’ale Adumim.
* The hearing on the matter will be held by August 15, meaning the demolition of the hamlet will be further delayed until after the session takes place and a decision is handed down.
* The state argued that the Supreme Court, in its initial ruling, discussed the option of legalizing the village but ultimately ruled against it.
* The state claimed that village leaders had themselves never submitted any plans for the Civil Administration’s approval.
* The High Court ordered the state to respond to the petition, which it did earlier this week.
* An additional petition was filed on Monday by the same group of attorneys representing the village, claiming that no eviction orders were ever filed against the residents.
* The High Court issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from carrying out its plans to evacuate Khan al-Ahmar, and ordered the state to respond by July 16.
* The Defense Ministry body responsible for overseeing the demolition announced that it was going on strike beginning next Sunday, due to what it says is the Finance Ministry’s failure to implement improvements to workers’ pension plans promised nearly three years ago.
* The Civil Administration committee stated that among the projects that will not be carried out prior to their return to work is the Khan al-Ahmar evacuation.
* Residents say this means they will be able to begin the new school year in the village on July 15 as originally planned.
* The state says the structures, mostly makeshift shacks and tents, were built without the relevant building permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway.
* Israel has pledged to resettle the residents, whom the UN says number 180 people.
* Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump belonging to the nearby Palestinian town of Abu Dis.
* Opponents of the demolition argue that it is part of an effort to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem almost to the Dead Sea.
* Last week, the IDF issued orders authorizing the seizure of access roads to the village.
* On the day prior, clashes broke out between police and protesters at the village.
* Police said in a statement that 11 people were arrested during disturbances at the site, and that rocks were thrown at officers.
* On Sunday, an Ofer Military Court judge ordered the conditional release of eight more Palestinians.
* On Thursday, the judge ordered the last suspect, who is accused of throwing stones at troops, be released to house arrest.

* The recommendations come ahead of a September deadline set by the High Court of Justice for the Knesset to re-legislate a previous exemption that the court disqualified.
* The ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party has given an ultimatum that if a proposal dealing with the community’s conscription is not passed into law by June 22, the party will leave the government.
* The Defense Ministry hopes to create a “durable, realistic and relevant arrangement that will meet the needs of the IDF as an equal and national army, stand up to the Supreme Court ruling cancelling [the previous law] and receive the necessary wide approval in order to become law.”
* The ultra-Orthodox parties have submitted two parallel bills on the military draft, including a quasi-constitutional Basic Law that would enshrine long-term Torah study as a recognized form of official service to the state in lieu of military service.

* Filming a soldier while obstructing him from carrying out his duties will carry a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison.
* More serious circumstances, such as publishing such footage with the intention of “harming state security,” can carry a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.
* Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he would not be able to defend the law if it advanced in its current form.

The sub-events of news article:
* A controversial bill that seeks to settle the issue of IDF enlistment by the ultra-Orthodox is slated to come up for its first vote in the Knesset plenum as early as next week.
* The proposal sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that, if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the yeshivas, or rabbinical seminaries, where they study.
* Netanyahu’s Haredi coalition partners, the Shas and United Torah Judaism parties, have threatened to oppose the legislation if it advances, and even to destabilize the coalition, in order to torpedo the measure.
* Netanyahu insisted that the bill would move forward to a first or plenum vote, but that “after the first reading, there will be a discussion between all parts of the coalition toward a broad agreement for the second and third readings.”
* The heads of both Haredi parties, Shas’s Aryeh Deri and UTJ’s Yaakov Litzman, reiterated their opposition to the bill.
* Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman of the secularist Yisrael Beytenu party expressed support for the bill.
* The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a contentious one in Israel, revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas should be called up for compulsory military service, like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population.
* United Torah Judaism’s Litzman said earlier this month that if an ultra-Orthodox-backed proposal dealing with the community’s conscription is not passed into law by July 22, when the Knesset summer recess begins, the party will leave the government, likely spelling its untimely end.
* The ultra-Orthodox parties have submitted two parallel bills on the military draft.

* Legislation that would exempt the prime minister from paying taxes on certain assets passed its first reading in the Knesset.
* The bill, authored by Likud MK Miki Zohar, would provide the prime minister with “a tax exemption for payments, services and gifts given to him in the framework of his job, excluding his salary.”
* The law would exempt the premier from taxes on his state-issued car and on utility bills paid by the state at his personal home.
* The bill comes as the attorney general considers police recommendations to indict Netanyahu for receiving illicit gifts worth up to NIS 1 million.
* Netanyahu earns a gross monthly salary of NIS 48,800 ($12,500).
* The bill could add to Netanyahu’s monthly income by allowing him to charge the state for additional expenses at both the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem and his private home in Caesarea.
* The current text of the bill states that the additional funds would be awarded retroactively for the incumbent prime minister, meaning that if passed, Netanyahu could be given a lump sum of over NIS 2 million.
* Netanyahu’s financial dealings have been the subject of intense public scrutiny and, at times, scathing criticism.
* In 2015, a state comptroller report found that expenditures at the prime minister’s residence had been excessive and improper.

* A controversial bill seeking to stop using Arabic in any official publication in Israel will be brought for final approval next week.
* The new bill, pushed forward by Jewish nationalist lawmakers, seeks to strip Arabic of its status as an official language and anchor Israel as a Jewish state in law.
* An earlier version of the bill, approved by the government in May, stated that the Arabic language will receive a special status and will be made accessible in all public institutions.
* The new version drops the statement on making Arabic accessible and instead says its status will be regulated in a separate law.
* The amended bill also allows the establishment of Jewish-only communities in Israel, where Arabs are not allowed to rent or buy homes.
* The bill is scheduled to be presented in the Knesset (parliament) next week.
* It needs to pass two full rounds of votes with a majority of 61 lawmakers in the 120-seat parliament.
* Tourism Minister Yariv Levin denied that the bill aims to cancel the Arabic language's official status, saying it will be "Israel's second official language."
* However, he said the new law will not require government and public ministries to include Arabic in their publications, as they currently have to do.
* Arab citizens of Israel are Palestinians who stayed put during the 1948 war.
* They formed Israel's largest minority and often complain about lack of job opportunities, racism, and discrimination in all fields of life, including access to health, education, transportation, and municipal services.

The sub-events of news article:
* A bill enshrining Israel’s ‘Jewish character’ in law is heading into its final stretch after years of debate.
* The bill was expected to be brought to a parliamentary committee vote this week, after a provision that could have blocked Arabs and Jews from living in each other’s communities was excised.
* Detractors say the bill’s definition of the country as the Jewish national home is unfair to Arab citizens, who make up about 20 per cent of the population.
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the bill “is very important to guaranteeing the essence of our existence, and we must pass it soon”.
* The bill’s supporters want to bring it for a full Knesset vote before the parliament breaks for summer recess next week.
* If passed, it would become Israel’s 12th Basic Law — the country’s equivalent of a constitution — though it likely would face court challenges.
* The bill demotes Arabic from its status as an official national language, instead granting it a “special standing” and mandating that Arab citizens continue to have access to state services in their native tongue.
* The legislation also could anger Palestinian officials, who don’t accept Israel as the Jewish state and reject the notion that Jews constitute a people entitled to self-determination.
* The bill declares occupied Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, a characterisation opposed by Palestinians, who claim the city’s eastern sector for themselves.

* Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s director, said: “The Foreign Secretary’s pledge over trying to secure Nazanin’s release is very welcome, as is the fact he’s had a face-to-face meeting with Richard relatively early into his new job. “We’d now like to see the UK Government at all levels pushing hard for Nazanin’s release. “This has gone on far too long. Nazanin is a prisoner of conscience who should never have been jailed in the first place. She should be freed and allowed to travel back to the UK with her young daughter Gabriella.”

* Accusations of human rights abuses have been leveled at Fashafuyeh Prison since it was created in 2012.
* Fatourechi describes the quarantine ward as "Hell" and compares the living conditions between the tip and quarantine wards to those between a bedroom and a toilet.
* In a routine four-day quarantine period, the prisoner is deprived of potable water, ventilation, toilets, cigarettes, and digestible food.
* The toilet is a hole on the floor of a 2 foot by 2 foot area, without light or running water, separated by a curtain from the ward's beds and 10 foot by 10 foot cells, known as Physicals, that house between 26 and 32 prisoners.
* Quarantine cells have three-tier bunk beds and two blankets spread on the floor.
* There is no running water between 4 p.m. and 7 a.m., and the only light glows from a 100-watt fluorescent bulb.
* There is an "incredible daily influx of new prisoners" with more than 40 new prisoners brought to the quarantine ward every 24 hours.
* More than 80 percent of the quarantine inmates are intravenous drug addicts and homeless people unable to stand on their own feet.
* The detainees unlucky enough to have a bunk — the "floor sleepers" — are usually "Afghans and intravenous addicts" and are "similar to those in coffins."
* The stench of sweat and infected wounds is unbelievable.
* Drug addicts, theft convicts, 'dirty ones' and Afghans are treated like livestock from the moment they step foot in the ward.
* Families of prisoners sit in the desert outside, and no one knows who is incarcerated in the prison.

* Israel's destruction of Khan Al-Ahmar is part of a larger campaign to erase everything Palestinian, which Israel sees as an "existential threat" to its "Jewish identity."
* Israel's destruction of Palestinian homes and communities has occurred in various political and historical contexts, with no regard for its "security."
* Since 1947, Israel has destroyed nearly 600 Palestinian towns, villages, and localities, displacing nearly 800,000 Palestinians.
* In Jerusalem alone, Israel has destroyed 5,000 Palestinian homes since 1967, leading to the exile of nearly 70,000 people.
* Since 1967, Israel has demolished nearly 50,000 Palestinian homes and structures, displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.
* Israel's destruction of Palestinian homes and culture is driven by a racist mindset that sees no room for Palestinians in the land between the Sea and the River.

The sub-events of news article:
* Residents of Khan al-Ahmar, a West Bank hamlet, are bracing for the demolition of their homes after an Israeli-imposed deadline for evacuation passed on October 1, 2018.
* The Defense Ministry handed out notices in the village last month, warning residents that they had until October 1 to demolish all buildings in the hamlet or state authorities would do so.
* The notices followed a ruling from the High Court of Justice earlier this month that rejected a final appeal from Khan al-Ahmar residents to prevent the demolition of their village.
* Locals have opposed the state’s plan to relocate them near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, as well as another proposal that would have moved them to a site adjacent to a sewage treatment facility east of the Mitzpe Jericho settlement.
* The state says the structures, mostly makeshift shacks and tents, were built without permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway.
* The villagers argue that they had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as such permits are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as where Khan al-Ahmar lies, where Israel exerts full control over civilian affairs.
* Opponents of the demolition also argue that it is part of an effort to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem almost to the Dead Sea, a move critics say will bisect the West Bank, making a contiguous Palestinian state impossible.

The sub-events of news article:
* European Union (EU) will create a “special purpose vehicle” (SPV) to sustain Iran-EU trade despite the reimposition of US secondary sanctions.
* SPV will act as a new payment mechanism between the two sides and will probably mainly rely on a bartering system with a minimum flow of funds.
* SPV will aim to “assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with Iran.”
* The multiplicity of SPVs will also make the application of sanctions more challenging.
* The continuation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) absent the United States would depend on the cooperation of European small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with Iran.
* The question is whether the proposed SPV can facilitate that process and protect European banks and companies from the risk of future US sanctions.

* The Trump administration late Tuesday called for an urgent halt to the war and a start to negotiations aimed at a political settlement.
* Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a cease-fire within 30 days.
* Nigel Tricks of the Norwegian Refugee Council welcomed the cease-fire call, saying it could be “the political breakthrough that we have long requested from parties to this brutal war” that has been “four years of hell for Yemeni women, men and children.”
* Griffiths urged the concerned parties to “seize this opportunity” and singled out support for “confidence-building measures” such as Yemen’s central bank, a prisoner exchange and the re-opening of the airport in the rebel-held Yemeni capital, Sanaa.
* Wallstrom reiterated Sweden’s support for Griffiths, whose efforts to host talks between the government and rebels in Geneva in September ran aground when Houthi representatives didn’t show up, insisting they had not been guaranteed safe return after the discussions.
* The conflict in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis who toppled the internationally recognized government.
* A Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.
* The war has killed over 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
* The UN says Yemen is facing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
* At the beginning of 2017, the UN and its partners provided aid to 3 million hungry Yemenis.
* Since then, assistance has been scaled up, reaching 8 million people last month because of generous funding from donors, but far below the 14 million people — or half Yemen’s population — who may need it.
* Earlier this month, Mark Lowcock, the UN humanitarian chief, warned of “an imminent and great big famine engulfing Yemen.”

The sub-events of news article:
* A de-escalation has already been affected as demonstrated by the Ansarullah movement's (aka the Houthis) decision to stop missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
* The United Kingdom has taken the lead on a draft proposal for a limited ceasefire to the United Nations Security Council.
* The British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt raised the issue on his visit to Iran where he tried to elicit Tehran's support for the UK's plans.
* Fierce fighting is continuing in the key port of Hudaydah as the Saudi-Emirati coalition tries to make maximum gains ahead of a possible limited ceasefire centred on Hudaydah and surrounding areas.
* A cessation of hostilities without a clear roadmap for a lasting political solution is likely to make matters worse in the long run.
* The Trump administration has reportedly "slammed on the brakes" on a British-sponsored draft resolution, apparently for fear of isolating the Saudi leadership.
* The British diplomatic initiative is exclusively focussed on securing a ceasefire at the port of Hudaydah where the fiercest fighting is concentrated.
* The conflict between the Houthis and their allies on the one hand and the Saudi-UAE supported Aden-based government on the other, rages on many fronts, albeit intermittently.
* The failure of the Saudi-directed offensives in Hajjah and Saada during the summer reflect two overriding facts:
    * The Saudi-led coalition is reliant on poorly trained and often poorly motivated tribal fighters in the field.
    * Saudi-directed offensives close to the Houthi heartlands in the north are as much about distraction than of a genuine military push into these areas.
* The Houthis have taken the fight deep inside Saudi Arabia's Asir region as early as 2016 and continue to fire ballistic missiles at targets deep inside Asir and the neighbouring Jizan region.
* The complexity of the Yemeni battlefields – coupled with the fact that the Ansarullah movement has gained a tenuous foothold inside Saudi Arabia – calls into question the longevity of any "limited" ceasefire.
* Ceasefire talks are set to start in the Swedish capital Stockholm next week.
* The Saudis will find it hard to cease air strikes indefinitely, especially when presented with opportunities to target the Houthi leadership.
* The Saudis and Emiratis appear to be fighting separate campaigns in Yemen, backing competing groups and scrambling to consolidate their respective positions in Aden.
* The Saudis and Emiratis have intervened in local politics to the point of dangerously intensifying underlying fissures and centrifugal forces.
* The inherently fragile Yemeni coalition that is ranged against the cohesive Ansarullah movement is likely to implode once fighting against the Houthis stops.

* UN envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths will attend peace talks in Stockholm.
* Griffiths hopes to present an updated version of the “Framework for Negotiations” to help the warring parties agree on a road map that will lead to an end to the war and a transitional deal.
* The framework will include interim security and political arrangements, and the return of Yemen’s friendly relations with neighboring states and the restoring of state institutions.
* Griffiths hopes to go beyond the mere normalization of Yemen, as he hopes that his framework will ideally lead to principled compromises that will allow the people of Yemen to live again in peace.
* Griffiths has received assurance from the various Yemeni parties, including the Houthis and Hadi’s government, that they will attend the talks in Stockholm.
* The real assurance that seems to be missing is the green light from Tehran, the Houthis’ main ally, about facilitating such a deal.
* The odds are that the negotiations will go ahead, but the secret potion to replace rivalry with peace is still elusive.
* The Yemen conflict is one flashpoint among many where Iran is meddling in its neighbors’ internal affairs.
* Griffiths believes there is a genuine drive from all sides to join the forthcoming Stockholm consultations, but all indicators — short of a major shift in the theater of war — point to the fact it is unlikely all parties will be swayed to compromise — at least not yet.

The sub-events of news article:
* The U.S. Senate is poised to debate a resolution that would force the end to United States support for the Yemen war.
* The White House strongly opposes the resolution, and it is unclear if Congress will enact any Yemen-related legislation.
* Calls to "stop the Yemen war" ignore the stakes in the conflict and the true identity of the warring parties.
* A precipitous disengagement by the Saudi-led coalition from militarily backing the UN-backed government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the Yemeni civil war would have calamitous consequences for Yemen, the Middle East and the world at large.
* The conflict was triggered in late 2014 when the Houthis, backed by Iran, toppled the Yemeni government and took over large areas of the country.
* Saudi Arabia, responding to a request by Yemen’s legitimate government and backed by U.N. Resolution 2216, militarily intervened in the Yemen conflict seeking to restore Yemen’s legitimate government.
* The Houthis have been fighting in a way that deliberately places civilians at risk, and Yemen has experienced dire security and humanitarian circumstances.
* The Saudi-led coalition periodically has restricted access to the port of Hodeidah to curtail the influx of Iranian arms.
* Abandoning the coalition efforts would leave Yemen in the rebels’ hands.
* Iran’s long arm, the Houthis, would march on coalition-liberated areas and exact a bloody toll on the populations of cities such as Aden and Marib.
* Having an Iranian satellite armed with Iranian ballistic missiles on the Saudi doorstep would pose an intolerable threat to the kingdom.
* An abrupt termination of the war would leave Iran in control of Yemen and deal a serious blow to the global economy.
* Iran would have the ability to obstruct trade and oil flows from both the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab-el-Mandeb strait.
* Allowing the IRGC to control two of the most strategic choke points for the global energy market is simply not an option for the international community.
* The Houthis have mounted multiple attacks on commercial and military vessels over the past several years, and Iran has supplied its Yemen proxy with drone boats, conventional aerial drones and ballistic missiles.

* The EU's "special purpose vehicle" (SPV) is designed to assist Iran's regime to circumvent sanctions.
* The SPV will be officially in place by Nov. 4, a few days before the US imposes the secondary sanctions on Iran’s oil industry.
* The SPV is neither new nor innovative, and Iran is not unfamiliar with such a barter system.
* The EU's SPV is doomed to fail because corporations, firms, and private financial institutions will be reluctant to participate due to the repercussions of doing business with Tehran.
* European corporations are unwilling to run the risk of losing the $18 trillion US market for the sake of Iran’s $400 billion market.
* If firms are caught violating US financial sanctions even with the EU’s SPV, they will endanger their business with the US and lose their ability to obtain credit, funds, or borrow money from the US monetary institutions.
* European financial institutions or banks which help Iran sidestep US sanctions may be barred from using the US dollar.
* Large EU corporations, such as Total, Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Telekom, PSA, Renault, and Daimler, have ended their projects in Iran.
* No large company has declared that it will be willing to re-enter Iran’s market because of the EU’s new plan.
* Iran is more desperate for cash than for goods and services.
* The SPV is not going to be the last plan that the EU introduces to help the Iranian regime sidestep the US sanctions.
* The EU must seize the opportunity and pressure the Iranian regime into changing its destructive behavior and becoming a constructive player in the region.

* The EU will reaffirm its support for the nuclear deal on Tuesday, as long as Iran continues to comply with its obligations.
* The SPV is intended to act as a clearing house, allowing traders to pay into it to buy Iranian exports and Iran's purchases in Europe to be paid by the fund.
* The EU has not ruled out allowing entities from other states (India, China, and Turkey) to use the SPV.
* The US has explicitly warned against EU states or companies trying to circumvent the sanctions.
* The EU hopes to avoid an immediate crisis and persuade Iran to stick by its side of the nuclear deal despite US withdrawal.

* EU leaders have long called for the bloc to behave more independently and strengthen its international role, but their failure to build a way to bypass U.S. sanctions on Iran has exposed how far they are from that goal.
* The EU’s top foreign policy official, Federica Mogherini, announced plans for a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) to keep some trade with Iran flowing with Europe, but the SPV is far from ready.
* EU member states haven’t even been able to find a country willing to host the SPV.
* The Bundesbank quietly changed its rules recently to allow it to reject an Iranian request to withdraw 300 million euros ($340 million) from the Hamburg-based trade bank Europaeische-Iranische Handelsbank to protect the central bank’s relationships with institutions in “third countries,” meaning the U.S.
* U.S. representatives have made the point that large firms are unlikely to use the SPV.
* Facilitating trade with Iran is one of the easier steps the EU could take to prove its sovereignty.
* The EU blocking statute, updated in August to cover the U.S. sanctions on Iran, forbids European companies from complying with non-member countries’ extraterritorial restrictions, and allows them to claim compensation for any damages caused by such sanctions.
* Robust joint action by the EU, or even just by Germany and France, would limit even Trump’s resolve to fight back against his European allies.

The sub-events of news article:
* Eight months after the United States’ unilateral exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Iran is still awaiting the European delivery of their promises for undertaking concrete and meaningful action to preserve the deal known as the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).
* The chaotic political scene in Europe, including Britain’s increasingly chaotic and uncertain Brexit plans, France’s popular revolt, and the growing influence of far-right populist political forces, may not allow Europe to deliver on its promises to Iran regarding the JCPOA.
* Germany is also rocked by political dissension and Merkel’s decision to step down as the leader of her party, thus throwing the future of German politics under a cloud of uncertainty.
* Europe is, in a word, ‘divided’ and, in the case of Macron’s France, grappling with an unprecedented political crisis warranting the embattled president’s re-prioritization of domestic needs and, perhaps, a major stepping back from Macron’s hitherto ambitious goal to play the role of a European leader.
* None of this is good news for the future prospect of JCPOA (minus US), which has been put on life-support since US’s exit and the re-imposition of nuclear-related sanctions by Washington.
* Iran does not have too many options and it would be futile for Tehran to press Europe to deliver the deliverables at a time when there are signs of crisis pretty much everywhere in Europe.
* EU’s foreign policy chief, Mogherini, has noble intentions and no one can question her sincerity, yet it is far from clear that Mogherini can summon the political forces necessary for a long-term united plan on the JCPOA.
* A considerably weakened and fractious Europe is ill-tuned with the strong will to stand up to American power determined to scuttle the nuclear deal — that it views as a win-lose favoring Iran.
* At the moment, with several rounds of bilateral diplomacy between Iran and Europe, Tehran continues to vest hope in Europe’s ability to withstand the transatlantic pressures and translate its pro-JCPOA pronouncements into tangible results.
* Europe has lost a great deal of profit as a result of Trump’s unwise action and, chances are, a more inward looking Europe may be even less inclined to heed Trump’s policy prescriptions on Iran.
* A big question regarding France is, of course, if Macron’s next chapter after the Yellow Vest rebellion will be marked with even greater independence from US, or will he try to patch up with Trump, who has been critical of him?
* With respect to Britain, biggest possibility now is Theresa May’s failure followed by a general elections and or new referendum, in either case a good many months in London will be chewed up by the domestic priorities and, much like Paris, London will be less equipped to marshal the forces necessary for a grand opposition to American leviathan power when it comes to Iran and the Middle East.
* Negatively affecting Iran’s “Western strategy,” such negative developments cited above may in fact spur a more energetic “Eastern strategy” on Iran’s part, but that too must reckon with the differentiated interests of both Russia and China as well, instead of taking for granted a harmony of interests with the countries of the East.
