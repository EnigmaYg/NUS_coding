1. Two former advisors from within the Canadian and US administrations have warned of the economic threat posed by US President Donald Trump ahead of the G7 summit in Canada.
2. Roland Paris, a former top foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Daniel Price, a former personal representative of George W. Bush at G8 and G20 summits, think there is a chance that US President Donald Trump might cancel his participation in the summit of world leaders at the last minute.
3. The G7 summit, which will bring together the leaders of Canada, the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, comes at a time that many view as a moment of historic division between Washington and its major allies in North America, Europe and Asia.
4. Just days ago the Trump administration slapped stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on five of its six G7 partners.
5. While the tariffs, which Europe and Canada fought hard to prevent, are the most recent, they are just the last in an increasingly long list of deep disagreements between the US and its allies.
6. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau recently all failed to convince Trump not to impose tariffs on the allies.
7. In a sign of how deep the rift is, six of the seven G7 finance ministers last weekend took the unusual step of issuing a joint a message rebuking Washington for imposing the tariffs.
8. For Paris, the former Trudeau adviser, now a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, the current division between the US and Canada is more fundamental than any previous disagreements between the neighboring countries.
9. Despite the friction between the US and its allies, which neither Price nor Paris said they believe will be resolved, they think the G7 meeting can still be valuable — if only to air the differences between the two sides.

1. National Security Advisor John Bolton stated that the Trump administration's decision to leave the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was about restoring American control over U.S. foreign policy, not just about the council's anti-Israel bias.
2. The Trump administration's determination to restore American power and independence in the international arena places it on a collision course with the European Union (EU), whose perspective on the proper goal of international affairs is diametrically opposed to the administration's.
3. The UNHRC is a perfect vehicle for advancing Europe's foreign policy, which has been consistently hostile towards Israel since the mid-1970s.
4. UN Ambassador Nikki Haley expressed frustration at the fact that Europe had refused to assist in the U.S.'s efforts to reform the UNHRC by, among other things, cancelling Agenda Item 7, which created a separate standard for judging Israel.
5. British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson's speech at the UNHRC was a case study in how the EU hides its opposition to the U.S. on Israel and the issue of nationalism and U.S. independence.
6. Johnson's speech effectively endorsed the destruction of all rules in the international system by praising the UNHRC despite its institutional bias against Israel.
7. Johnson's opposition to Item 7 is disingenuous, as he said the UK would only stop voting in favor of those resolutions in six months, indicating that Britain is not serious about peace.
8. Johnson's impassioned plea for universal female education was irrelevant to the UNHRC's mandate and was likely just a way to justify remaining in an institutionally anti-Semitic body.
9. Johnson is trying to organize a meeting of European and Arab foreign ministers with Trump's senior advisor Jared Kushner to present their "red lines" for peace, which is likely an attempt to gang up on the U.S. and tell the President's son-in-law that they will not accept any plan that doesn't reflect their animus towards Israel.
10. Kushner responded to Johnson's attempt to railroad the White House into giving the EU veto power over U.S. Middle East policy by saying that while he is open to outside input in the U.S. peace plan, the President will decide its contents.

The sub-events of news article:
1. A bill enshrining Israel’s ‘Jewish character’ in law is heading into its final stretch after years of debate.
2. The bill was expected to be brought to a parliamentary committee vote this week, after a provision that could have blocked Arabs and Jews from living in each other’s communities was excised.
3. Detractors say the bill’s definition of the country as the Jewish national home is unfair to Arab citizens, who make up about 20 per cent of the population.
4. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the bill “is very important to guaranteeing the essence of our existence, and we must pass it soon”.
5. The bill’s supporters want to bring it for a full Knesset vote before the parliament breaks for summer recess next week.
6. If passed, it would become Israel’s 12th Basic Law — the country’s equivalent of a constitution — though it likely would face court challenges.
7. The bill demotes Arabic from its status as an official national language, instead granting it a “special standing” and mandating that Arab citizens continue to have access to state services in their native tongue.
8. The legislation also could anger Palestinian officials, who don’t accept Israel as the Jewish state and reject the notion that Jews constitute a people entitled to self-determination.
9. The bill declares occupied Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, a characterisation opposed by Palestinians, who claim the city’s eastern sector for themselves.

The number of the sub-event most relevant to the image is 
 9. The image is a passport issued by the State of Israel to a Jewish man named Joseph Aronovitz in 1959. The passport includes Aronovitz's photo, signature, and other personal information, as well as the Hebrew and English text "State of Israel." The image is most relevant to sub-event 9, which discusses the bill's declaration of occupied Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This is because the passport shows that Aronovitz was a citizen of Israel and that he was issued a passport by the State of Israel. This is relevant to the sub-event because it shows that the Israeli government has been issuing passports to its citizens since 1959, which is evidence that the State of Israel has been in existence for over 60 years.

3. Detractors say the bill’s definition of the country as the Jewish national home is unfair to Arab citizens, who make up about 20 per cent of the population.
4. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the bill “is very important to guaranteeing the essence of our existence, and we must pass it soon”.
5. The bill’s supporters want to bring it for a full Knesset vote before the parliament breaks for summer recess next week.
6. If passed, it would become Israel’s 12th Basic Law — the country’s equivalent of a constitution — though it likely would face court challenges.
7. The bill demotes Arabic from its status as an official national language, instead granting it a “special standing” and mandating that Arab citizens continue to have access to state services in their native tongue.
8. The legislation also could anger Palestinian officials, who don’t accept Israel as the Jewish state and reject the notion that Jews constitute a people entitled to self-determination.
9. The bill declares occupied Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, a characterisation opposed by Palestinians, who claim the city’s eastern sector for themselves.

Nazanin is a prisoner of conscience who should never have been jailed in the first place. She should be freed and allowed to travel back to the UK with her young daughter Gabriella.”

1. The UN Working Group concluded that the Iranian Regime had “no legal basis for the arrest and detention” of Xiyue Wang and that the Regime had violated his right to a fair trial.
2. The Working Group requested the Iranian Regime to release Wang immediately.
3. Wang, a naturalized US citizen, was arrested in August 2016 and imprisoned in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison, where many political prisoners are held, before being wrongfully convicted of espionage and sentenced to 10 years in prison during a closed trial.
4. The Working Group said that Wang was not spying, but conducting historical research for academic purposes, which posed no threat to the Iranian Regime.
5. The Working Group said that Wang should not have been put on trial at all, let alone one that did not meet standards for impartiality and independence.
6. The Working Group assessed a response from the Iranian Regime about Wang’s imprisonment and said that it “did not explain … how Mr. Wang had cooperated with a foreign state … against the Islamic Republic of Iran, nor how accessing historical archives relating to a period of governance over 100 years ago could amount to an attempt to overthrow the Iranian Government”.
7. The Working Group said: “There are several facts that lead the Working Group to conclude that Mr. Wang’s detention was motivated by the fact that he is a United States citizen.”
8. Princeton Vice President and Secretary Robert K. Durkee said: “Xiyue Wang has been unjustly imprisoned and separated from his wife and young child for more than two years. The Working Group makes it clear that Wang was in Iran solely to do scholarly work, and that the charges against him were entirely without merit. We hope these findings by the Working Group and its call for his immediate release will, in fact, expedite his release so he can return to his family and come back to campus to complete his Ph.D.”

2. The Defense Ministry handed out notices in the village last month, warning residents that they had until October 1 to demolish all buildings in the hamlet or state authorities would do so.
3. The notices followed a ruling from the High Court of Justice earlier this month that rejected a final appeal from Khan al-Ahmar residents to prevent the demolition of their village.
4. Locals have opposed the state’s plan to relocate them near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, as well as another proposal that would have moved them to a site adjacent to a sewage treatment facility east of the Mitzpe Jericho settlement.
5. The state says the structures, mostly makeshift shacks and tents, were built without permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway.
6. The villagers argue that they had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as such permits are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as where Khan al-Ahmar lies, where Israel exerts full control over civilian affairs.
7. Opponents of the demolition also argue that it is part of an effort to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem almost to the Dead Sea, a move critics say will bisect the West Bank, making a contiguous Palestinian state impossible.

The image shows Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian politician and a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), speaking about the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar. Ashrawi is a prominent figure in the Palestinian struggle for independence, and her statements on the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar are likely to be widely reported. The demolition of Khan al-Ahmar is a significant event in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Ashrawi's comments on the issue are likely to be of interest to a wide range of people.

The image is a bar chart showing the amount of crude oil exported from Iran in barrels per day from January to August 2018. The chart shows that Iran's oil exports have been increasing since January 2018 and reached a peak in August 2018. This increase in oil exports is likely due to the fact that the United States has not yet imposed sanctions on Iran's oil industry. However, Saudi Arabia, the only oil producer able to adjust its output, will not be able to produce 12 million barrels per day to cover Iranian oil exports once Washington introduces restrictions.

The sub-events of news article:
1. A de-escalation has already been affected as demonstrated by the Ansarullah movement's (aka the Houthis) decision to stop missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
2. The United Kingdom has taken the lead on a draft proposal for a limited ceasefire to the United Nations Security Council.
3. The British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt raised the issue on his visit to Iran where he tried to elicit Tehran's support for the UK's plans.
4. Fierce fighting is continuing in the key port of Hudaydah as the Saudi-Emirati coalition tries to make maximum gains ahead of a possible limited ceasefire centred on Hudaydah and surrounding areas.
5. A cessation of hostilities without a clear roadmap for a lasting political solution is likely to make matters worse in the long run.
6. The Trump administration has reportedly "slammed on the brakes" on a British-sponsored draft resolution, apparently for fear of isolating the Saudi leadership.
7. The British diplomatic initiative is exclusively focussed on securing a ceasefire at the port of Hudaydah where the fiercest fighting is concentrated.
8. The conflict between the Houthis and their allies on the one hand and the Saudi-UAE supported Aden-based government on the other, rages on many fronts, albeit intermittently.
9. The failure of the Saudi-directed offensives in Hajjah and Saada during the summer reflect two overriding facts:
    10. The Saudi-led coalition is reliant on poorly trained and often poorly motivated tribal fighters in the field.
    11. Saudi-directed offensives close to the Houthi heartlands in the north are as much about distraction than of a genuine military push into these areas.
12. The Houthis have taken the fight deep inside Saudi Arabia's Asir region as early as 2016 and continue to fire ballistic missiles at targets deep inside Asir and the neighbouring Jizan region.
13. The complexity of the Yemeni battlefields – coupled with the fact that the Ansarullah movement has gained a tenuous foothold inside Saudi Arabia – calls into question the longevity of any "limited" ceasefire.
14. Ceasefire talks are set to start in the Swedish capital Stockholm next week.
15. The Saudis will find it hard to cease air strikes indefinitely, especially when presented with opportunities to target the Houthi leadership.
16. The Saudis and Emiratis appear to be fighting separate campaigns in Yemen, backing competing groups and scrambling to consolidate their respective positions in Aden.
17. The Saudis and Emiratis have intervened in local politics to the point of dangerously intensifying underlying fissures and centrifugal forces.
18. The inherently fragile Yemeni coalition that is ranged against the cohesive Ansarullah movement is likely to implode once fighting against the Houthis stops.

The sub-events of news article:
1. UN envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths will attend peace talks in Stockholm.
2. Griffiths hopes to present an updated version of the “Framework for Negotiations” to help the warring parties agree on a road map that will lead to an end to the war and a transitional deal.
3. The framework will include interim security and political arrangements, and the return of Yemen’s friendly relations with neighboring states and the restoring of state institutions.
4. Griffiths hopes to go beyond the mere normalization of Yemen, as he hopes that his framework will ideally lead to principled compromises that will allow the people of Yemen to live again in peace.
5. Griffiths has received assurance from the various Yemeni parties, including the Houthis and Hadi’s government, that they will attend the talks in Stockholm.
6. The real assurance that seems to be missing is the green light from Tehran, the Houthis’ main ally, about facilitating such a deal.
7. The odds are that the negotiations will go ahead, but the secret potion to replace rivalry with peace is still elusive.
8. The Yemen conflict is one flashpoint among many where Iran is meddling in its neighbors’ internal affairs.
9. Griffiths believes there is a genuine drive from all sides to join the forthcoming Stockholm consultations, but all indicators — short of a major shift in the theater of war — point to the fact it is unlikely all parties will be swayed to compromise — at least not yet.

The sub-events of news article:
1. EU leaders have long called for the bloc to behave more independently and strengthen its international role, but their failure to build a way to bypass U.S. sanctions on Iran has exposed how far they are from that goal.
2. The EU’s top foreign policy official, Federica Mogherini, announced plans for a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) to keep some trade with Iran flowing with Europe, but the SPV is far from ready.
3. EU member states haven’t even been able to find a country willing to host the SPV.
4. The Bundesbank quietly changed its rules recently to allow it to reject an Iranian request to withdraw 300 million euros ($340 million) from the Hamburg-based trade bank Europaeische-Iranische Handelsbank to protect the central bank’s relationships with institutions in “third countries,” meaning the U.S.
5. U.S. representatives have made the point that large firms are unlikely to use the SPV.
6. Facilitating trade with Iran is one of the easier steps the EU could take to prove its sovereignty.
7. The EU blocking statute, updated in August to cover the U.S. sanctions on Iran, forbids European companies from complying with non-member countries’ extraterritorial restrictions, and allows them to claim compensation for any damages caused by such sanctions.
8. Robust joint action by the EU, or even just by Germany and France, would limit even Trump’s resolve to fight back against his European allies.
9. EU leaders’ real policy appears to be to string Iran along while waiting for the Trump presidency to end.

The number of the sub-event most relevant to the image is 
 2. 

The image shows Federica Mogherini, the EU’s top foreign policy official, announcing plans for a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) to keep some trade with Iran flowing with Europe. The article reports that the SPV is far from ready and that EU member states haven’t even been able to find a country willing to host the SPV. This suggests that the EU is not taking any concrete steps to bypass U.S. sanctions on Iran and that the SPV is unlikely to be successful.

Her death has sparked widespread protests in Iran and around the world.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Eight months after the United States’ unilateral exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Iran is still awaiting the European delivery of their promises for undertaking concrete and meaningful action to preserve the deal known as the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).
2. The chaotic political scene in Europe, including Britain’s increasingly chaotic and uncertain Brexit plans, France’s popular revolt, and the growing influence of far-right populist political forces, may not allow Europe to deliver on its promises to Iran regarding the JCPOA.
3. Germany is also rocked by political dissension and Merkel’s decision to step down as the leader of her party, thus throwing the future of German politics under a cloud of uncertainty.
4. Europe is, in a word, ‘divided’ and, in the case of Macron’s France, grappling with an unprecedented political crisis warranting the embattled president’s re-prioritization of domestic needs and, perhaps, a major stepping back from Macron’s hitherto ambitious goal to play the role of a European leader.
5. None of this is good news for the future prospect of JCPOA (minus US), which has been put on life-support since US’s exit and the re-imposition of nuclear-related sanctions by Washington.
6. Iran does not have too many options and it would be futile for Tehran to press Europe to deliver the deliverables at a time when there are signs of crisis pretty much everywhere in Europe.
7. EU’s foreign policy chief, Mogherini, has noble intentions and no one can question her sincerity, yet it is far from clear that Mogherini can summon the political forces necessary for a long-term united plan on the JCPOA.
8. A considerably weakened and fractious Europe is ill-tuned with the strong will to stand up to American power determined to scuttle the nuclear deal — that it views as a win-lose favoring Iran.
9. At the moment, with several rounds of bilateral diplomacy between Iran and Europe, Tehran continues to vest hope in Europe’s ability to withstand the transatlantic pressures and translate its pro-JCPOA pronouncements into tangible results.
10. Europe has lost a great deal of profit as a result of Trump’s unwise action and, chances are, a more inward looking Europe may be even less inclined to heed Trump’s policy prescriptions on Iran.
11. A big question regarding France is, of course, if Macron’s next chapter after the Yellow Vest rebellion will be marked with even greater independence from US, or will he try to patch up with Trump, who has been critical of him?
12. With respect to Britain, biggest possibility now is Theresa May’s failure followed by a general elections and or new referendum, in either case a good many months in London will be chewed up by the domestic priorities and, much like Paris, London will be less equipped to marshal the forces necessary for a grand opposition to American leviathan power when it comes to Iran and the Middle East.
13. Negatively affecting Iran’s “Western strategy,” such negative developments cited above may in fact spur a more energetic “Eastern strategy” on Iran’s part, but that too must reckon with the differentiated interests of both Russia and China as well, instead of taking for granted a harmony of interests with the countries of the East.
