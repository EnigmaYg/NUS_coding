1. A member of Prime Minister Imran Khan's cabinet has warned that, if left unchecked by the international community, the fallout of India's controversial move in Kashmir could lead to a nuclear conflict between the two longtime rivals.
2. Pakistan's Sayed Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari said that Prime Minister Imran Khan's upcoming visit to New York as part of the United Nations General Assembly would be "very Kashmir-centric," revolving around India's decision last month to consolidate control over its share of the disputed border territory and the ongoing human rights concerns that have since emerged there.
3. Bukhari said that Pakistan is "extremely concerned" that the situation in India-administered Kashmir could "snowball into a nuclear war" between the two nuclear-armed countries.
4. Bukhari said that Pakistan has exhausted its attempts to reach out to India diplomatically and that Modi's recent move proved to be the final straw.
5. Bukhari said that Pakistan has had success in gaining the support of certain countries, with nations like China, Turkey, Malaysia and Iran speaking out on the issue.
6. Bukhari said that he is concerned about a potential "retaliation" after the lockdown in India-administered Kashmir ends.
7. Bukhari said that Pakistan's forces are on high alert and are mobilized, but that Pakistan is trying to address the situation on an international level and avoid war.

 5. The image shows the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). The dam is being built by Ethiopia on the Blue Nile River, which is a major tributary of the Nile River. The dam is expected to generate electricity for Ethiopia and other countries in the region. However, the construction of the dam has raised concerns in Egypt and Sudan, which are downstream from Ethiopia. Egypt is concerned that the dam will reduce the amount of water that flows into the Nile River, which is essential for Egypt's agriculture. Sudan is concerned that the dam will cause flooding and other environmental damage.

3. Mufti said that the statements made by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam were misunderstood by the media.

5. Mufti said Ethiopia hopes that this dam would help support Addis Ababa’s plan to face “the undermined development,” including population growth, not only in his country, but also in several developing states where the youth generation is largely increasing amid a lack of employment opportunities.
6. Egypt insists that the Renaissance Dam policy should not affect “its interests and rights in the Nile,” particularly that Egypt relies on the River to cover more than 90 percent of its needs.
7. Mufti said the Renaissance Dam would protect the water from evaporating and it would help decrease the accumulation of slit, which engenders Ethiopia considerable costs.
8. Mufti expressed no objections to the US role in the technical negotiations between Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia on the massive dam being constructed on the Nile River.

The sub-events of news article:
1. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) will rule on November 12 on whether to mark exports of goods produced in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights to European Union countries.
2. The decision will be made following a petition filed by Psagot Winery to the Administrative Court of France against the 2015 EU directive to mark products manufactured in the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem with a special label.
3. Israel fears that an ECJ precedent, which would require labeling products from the settlements, would be forced upon all 28 EU countries and embolden the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) and other de-legitimization organizations against Israel to fight Israeli exports.
4. The decision is a follow-up to the European Union's guidelines approved in November 2015 for labeling products from the settlements, a move that has been criticized by Israel as "discriminatory" and damaging to peace efforts with the Palestinians.
5. France became one of the first countries to adopt these guidelines, and in 2016 the French Ministry of Economy even issued its own guidelines requiring the marking of products from the settlements.
6. The Administrative Court of France later annulled the decision until further notice after Psagot Winery, among others, filed a petition against marking its products, claiming that the directive contravenes the French constitution.
7. The ruling might effectively provide practical tools to attack Israel and Israeli exports to Europe.
8. The ruling will allow BDS activists to appeal to their local courts across the EU, which will be obliged to implement it without holding hearings on the matter.
9. The Israeli Foreign Ministry is preparing for the decision. In the event of an unfavorable ruling for Israel, most of the activities of the Israeli embassies will be directed at the local ministries of economy and agriculture in order to to convince them not to apply the ruling or interpret it in a lightly.

5. The ECJ is expected to announce a decision on the limited questions before it only, and then the case will be remanded back to the French court to rule on according to French anti-discrimination law.
6. Countries like Germany, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and others have indeed been ramping up their enforcement of the European Commission guidelines on labeling and sending letters to E.U. importers.
7. Psagot’s legal case does not change the status quo—it challenges those regulations themselves with the aim of preventing any future legal cases against Israeli products.
8. Even in the event of an unfavorable decision from the ECJ, Psagot’s case will be remanded back to France, where it will be challenged on anti-discrimination grounds.
9. The case before the ECJ was brought by an Israeli company exercising its legitimate rights to avail itself of the judicial process to protect its commercial interests.

The sub-events of news article:

2. The lawsuit was brought by the Psagot winery, located in territories occupied by Israel since June 1967, challenging a notice published by France’s Ministry of the Economy requiring that goods originating from Israeli-occupied territories be labeled in accordance with Regulation 1169/2011.
3. The ECJ determined that foodstuffs produced in an Israeli settlement within territory occupied by the State of Israel in 1967 must so state to prevent misleading European consumers as to the “place of provenance” of the product.
4. Israel and the US State Department expressed concern over the decision, claiming it would serve as a tool in the political campaign against Israel and encourage boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.
5. The World Jewish Congress found the ECJ ruling worrying because it could set a precedent for stricter implementation of Regulation 1169/2011’s labeling requirements and encourage BDS against Israel.
6. The author argues that Israel and producers of foodstuffs located in Israeli-occupied territories should welcome the ruling as a “teachable moment” to provide truthful and non-misleading labels that explain the historical context of their products.

3. The United States has also appeared to call for Israel to not begin the annexation process immediately, but to coordinate such a move through an as-yet-to-be-created joint committee.
4. The High Court of Justice has maintained that caretaker administrations are meant to strike a balance “between restraint and action.”
5. The Court has ruled that while there are no formal limits on an interim government’s powers, it should only take actions beyond the public need “in cases in which an ‘essential public need’ demands immediate action and cannot be delayed until after the elections.”
6. The government may attempt to argue that there is a pressing need to act quickly in order to annex the Jordan Valley and Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as US support may waver on the matter or other external factors may prevent Israel from going forward with the plan in the future.
7. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he would examine any annexation request from a legal perspective and decide based on the urgency of the request.
8. The government could try to bring the annexation matter to a vote in the Knesset, which could be brought in to vote on annexation if it gets approval from the Arrangements Committee.

6. In the event Ethiopia fills the dam over a ten-year period, Egypt's Nile water flow could be reduced by 14 per cent.

13. Given the threats made by Egypt to destroy the dam and its movement of soldiers on the Eritrean border in 2018, the prospect of open conflict is a genuine possibility in the absence of a comprehensive agreement.
