The sub-events of news article:
1. Egyptian military forces in the northern Sinai Peninsula executed at least two and as many as eight unarmed detainees and covered up the killings to make it appear that the victims were armed "terrorists" shot to death in a raid, Human Rights Watch said today.
2. Video of the killings aired by an opposition television channel based in Turkey on April 20, 2017, appears to show a man in a camouflage uniform executing the two men, one after the other, with an assault rifle.
3. The video also appears to show a member of Egypt's military intelligence service observing and directing the first execution and that the soldiers used Humvee vehicles supplied by the United States to transport the detainees.
4. Sinai News 24, an independent Facebook page that tracks events in the Sinai Peninsula, reported that the two victims were brothers from the Rumailat clan – Daoud Sabri al-Awabdah, 16, and Abd al-Hadi Sabri al-Awabdah, 19 – whom the army had arrested in the town of Rafah and forcibly disappeared on July 18, 2016.
5. In a third video of the scene, also posted on the same pro-government Facebook page, a man can be heard saying, "Should I change the position of the gun?" The man who is filming the body replies, "Finish, finish."
6. Two North Sinai sources told Human Rights Watch that the man seen executing both victims is a member of a local militia, colloquially called Group 103, which was formed by the Egyptian military in 2015 to assist in Sinai operations and which the military arms and oversees.
7. In the execution video, the militia member appears to be wearing an Egyptian army infantry patch on his shoulder. A second man in the video appears to be wearing a patch of the armed forces' Military Intelligence and Reconnaissance Department.
8. Since the military removed former President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013, violence has significantly increased in North Sinai, an underdeveloped and long-marginalized governorate that borders Israel and Gaza.
9. In response, Egypt has deployed more forces to the Sinai than at any time since the country's 1973 war with Israel.
10. The counterterrorism campaign in North Sinai has been rife with abuses. Between July 2013 and August 2015, Egyptian authorities destroyed around half of the town of Rafah, on the border with the Gaza Strip, evicting thousands of families and demolishing at least 3,255 buildings.
11. In January 2017, Interior Ministry counterterrorism troops most likely executed at least four and as many as 10 North Sinai men whom they had previously arrested. The Interior Ministry then apparently staged a fake raid to cover up the incident.
12. The killings shown in the video that surfaced on April 20 fit a pattern described by several North Sinai residents. At least two detainees formerly held by the army told Human Rights Watch that their guards would come at dawn, summon certain detainees, and take them away without telling them where they were going. These detainees did not return, said the former prisoners, who said they believed the men had been executed.

2. Despite these concessions, Palestinians have not agreed to continue negotiations or stop incitement against Israel.
3. The international community and some Israeli politicians continue to insist on a two-state solution, despite the dangers posed by a Palestinian state.
4. Israel's current strategy is to assist Palestinians in building new towns and infrastructure, but this approach is unlikely to succeed in the long term.
5. Arab proposals for a one-state solution that eliminates Israel are an effective Palestinian strategy, as they make the two-state option seem more reasonable and acceptable.
6. Israeli leaders have not proposed a viable alternative to a two-state solution, and their insistence on keeping three large settlement blocs and Jerusalem as a united city is unrealistic.
7. Israel should promote a solution that sustains its own vital interests, including sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, which is historically, legally, and demographically part of the State of Israel.
8. An assertion of sovereignty in Area C, where 450,000 Jews and 40,000 Arabs live, would ensure Israel's vital strategic interests.
9. Arabs living in areas under Israeli control could choose from a variety of options, including applying for Israeli citizenship or residency, maintaining their citizenship in Jordan or the Palestinian Authority, or resettling with compensation.
10. Arab refugees and their descendants living under UNRWA's sponsorship should be offered full citizenship in the countries where they reside.

4. The post-Taliban Afghan government was corrupt and lacked the resources and staff to function efficiently, rendering the country dependent on foreign assistance.
5. The U.S. spent $12 billion on eradication efforts to wipe out Afghanistan's opiate trade, but Afghanistan now supplies around 90 percent of the world's opium.

7. President Obama's decision to set a timeline for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan undermined the mission, as it notified the Taliban how long they would have to hang on until the U.S. presence dwindled.

6. The United States could pursue unilateral drone strikes in Pakistan, although it should be prepared for likely fallout.
7. Washington could sanction the powerful Pakistani military, which has been accused of supporting the Afghan Taliban and other extremists.
8. Analysts say part of that move could be to significantly cut or even end military aid and subsidized weapons sales to Islamabad.

The image shows a line of trucks, likely waiting to cross the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This suggests that the sub-event most relevant to the image is the one that discusses the possibility of the United States cutting off military aid and subsidized weapons sales to Pakistan. This is because such a move would likely have a significant impact on the Pakistani economy, and could potentially lead to the loss of jobs in the transportation sector.

The sub-events of news article:
1. US President Donald Trump has announced his new Afghan policy, which is in contrast to his electoral promises of a complete disengagement from Afghanistan.
2. Trump's Afghan policy is a departure from his predecessor's approach in its boldness, but the broad parameters remain more or less the same.
3. The key features of Trump's Afghan policy operate on a condition-based approach instead of a calendar-driven policy.
4. No more peace talks with the Taliban, holding Pakistan accountable for providing sanctuaries to the Afghan militant groups, working closely with India to stabilise Afghanistan and the deployments of an additional 4,000 US troops are the main elements of this policy.
5. The addition of 4,000 troops will take the total number of foreign troops in Afghanistan to 15,000 (12,000 from the US and 3,000 from Nato) who will advise, assist and train the Afghan forces.
6. The policy seems to be a compromise between Trump – who wanted a complete withdrawal – and his generals – who wanted to ramp up the war effort in Afghanistan.
7. The policy lacks a clear articulation on how its various components will break the strategic deadlock in Afghanistan, stabilise the deteriorating security situation and improve the prospects for peace-building.
8. Trump's Afghan policy exposes Washington's policy paralysis, lack of imagination and viable political options.
9. It guarantees neither a decisive victory nor military gains that are significant enough to force the Taliban to come to the negotiating table.
10. Trump's policy pronouncement is a clear indication that Washington is scaling down its commitment from stabilising Afghanistan to preventing a terrorist attack on US soil which originates from Afghanistan.
11. The Afghan Taliban has diversified the regional linkages, minimising their sole dependence on Pakistan.
12. Today, the Taliban have a working relationship with Iran and Russia and, to a lesser extent, with Beijing.
13. The hardline towards Pakistan is not going to change its Afghan policy.
14. The increased Indian engagement in Afghanistan – as envisaged by Trump in his speech – will further strengthen Islamabad’s threat perception and add to its strategic anxiety.
15. The endgame in Afghanistan has become more uncertain, with no end in sight to America’s longest war.
16. With its new Afghan policy, the Trump administration can manage the conflict in Afghanistan but cannot resolve it.
17. Consequently, the current status quo in Afghanistan is likely to persist.

5. Trump asserts that the U.S. will not engage in nation-building, preferring a counterterrorism response, despite the fact that U.S. national security interests are dependent on the creation of a legitimate state in Afghanistan.
6. Trump emphasized the role of regional actors, specifically Pakistan and India, in resolving the situation in Afghanistan.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Russia recognized west Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and east Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital, before Trump’s announcement.
2. Trump did not move the US embassy in Tel Aviv, and in fact gave nothing to Israel, other than increased Palestinian rioting, after being warned not to go ahead with this announcement.
3. Trump appears to be thinking in a similar way to Russian strategic thinking, which does not focus on end state production logic, which dominates Western thinking.
4. Trump abandoned the idea of pursuing the same dead end peace plans promoted by his predecessors, US Presidents Barack Obama, George Bush, and Bill Clinton.
5. Trump did not explicitly abandon the two-state solution, nor did he recognize Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria.
6. Trump delivered a shock to the system, which is currently responding.
7. The way in which events unfold can form a basis for the next step.
8. Trump understood what his predecessors did not. After the mass terrorism of the second intifada, and the conversion of Gaza into an enemy Hamas territory after Israel’s withdrawal from it, Israeli society no longer believes in the idea of giving land for stability, or in the ability of the US to supervise and guard this stability.
9. Trump therefore proceeded with a recognition of Jerusalem, assisting Israel’s position, which holds that even if a Palestinian state is formed, it will not be based on the Barak - Olmert parameters of dividing Jerusalem.
