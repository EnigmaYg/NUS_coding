The image is a line graph that shows the number of new asymptomatic cases on the Chinese mainland from April 1 to October 20. The y-axis shows the number of cases, while the x-axis shows the date. The graph shows that the number of cases peaked in April and then declined. The lowest number of cases in June and July. The number of cases began to rise again in August and reached a second peak in September. The graph shows that there has been a significant increase in the number of new asymptomatic cases on the Chinese mainland in recent months. This is likely due to the fact that the virus is still spreading and that there are a large number of people who are still susceptible to the virus. It is important to note that the graph only shows the number of new asymptomatic cases. It does not show the total number of cases, which is likely to be much higher.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Israeli doctors are investigating 81 cases of COVID-19 patients who appear to have recovered from the coronavirus and later became reinfected.
2. Israel is believed to be the first country in the world to confirm such a large-scale investigation into reinfection.
3. Scientists currently believe that fewer than two dozen people worldwide have been confirmed reinfected.
4. The British medical journal Lancet put the figure as low as five in its latest report.
5. The Lancet article, published Monday, put the issue of reinfection on the global health agenda, as it documented America’s first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.
6. Dutch authorities reported what is believed to be the first death as a result of reinfection.
7. The deceased is an 89-year-old immunocompromised woman, who tested positive, recovered, and 59 days later fell ill and once again tested positive.
8. In the American case outlined in the Lancet, the patient was a 25-year-old man from Nevada, who had no known immune disorders.
9. The documented Israeli patient had mild symptoms the first time around and, upon second infection, was asymptomatic with the exception of an elevated heart rate.
10. The Lancet reported that with the American patient, “what is worrisome is that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection resulted in worse disease than did the first infection, requiring oxygen support and hospitalization.”
11. The confirmed Israeli case was documented, peer-reviewed and published by Nachmias and colleagues from the Leumit health organization in the journal IDCases.
12. The patient was a 20-year-old woman from Bnei Brak, healthy until she caught the coronavirus.
13. She was diagnosed on April 17, and tested negative on May 1 and May 10.
14. The patient then went for screening on August 6 and on August 11, and tested positive both times.
15. Nachmias said that upon the second infection, she had a blood sample drawn for analysis and found that antibodies were present.
16. Nachmias said that she doesn’t have an explanation for what went wrong to result in the reinfection, but she raised the fear of a changing virus that would undermine immunity.
17. Bar Ilan University immunologist Cyrille Cohen thinks the mutation theory is unlikely.
18. Cohen said that SARS-CoV-2 appears to result in immunity, with some rare exceptions, which isn’t unusual as infections from the coronavirus family go.
19. Nachmias suspects reinfection is being underdiagnosed by doctors who simply don’t test recovered patients because they assume immunity.
20. Tel Aviv University professor Mordechai Gerlic told The Times of Israel he suspects that mistakes account for some reports of reinfection, saying they diagnoses may well reflect testing errors, or patients who never fully recovered from their first infection.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Fierce fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan has not subsided since September 27, making negotiations more difficult with each passing day.
2. Armenian-controlled cities in the Nagorno-Karabakh region have been shelled, including the capital Stepanakert, as well as Azerbaijani villages on the other side of the line of contact, with both sides reporting civilian deaths.
3. Armenian mid-range missiles have also hit civilian targets far beyond the conflict zone, reaching as far as the Absheron region near Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku.
4. Several missiles hit Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, Ganja, located close to major oil and gas pipelines from the Caspian Sea to Europe.
5. On October 6, Armenian forces reportedly fired a rocket targeting the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline in Azerbaijan’s Yevlakh region.
6. The rocket barely missed the oil pipeline and the nearby South Caucasus natural gas line, but the threat to major energy, transportation and communication corridors remains high.
7. The Armenian military adviser to the Armenian prime minister, Vagharshak Harutyunyan, openly stated on Russian TV’s Vesti news program that the Armenian army is deliberately targeting the civilian population of Azerbaijan to create panic.
8. For 30 years, the two sides have not been able to settle the conflict.
9. While Armenia has tried to retain its war gains, Azerbaijan has insisted on ending Armenian occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent Azerbaijani districts — making up almost 14 percent of the country’s territory.
10. Four United Nations resolutions and a UN General Assembly resolution have reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity calling on Armenia to withdraw its armed forces.
11. Armenia and Azerbaijan are among the most militarized states in the world, with both being primarily armed by Russia.
12. Baku has also purchased drones from Israel and Turkey.
13. Most recently, Russia has supplied military equipment to Armenia via Iran, causing the large Azeri population in Iran to protest Tehran’s assistance to Yerevan.
14. The Armenian media has blamed Turkey for the conflict, claiming that Ankara has sent Syrian fighters to help Azerbaijan and presenting Armenia as a defender against international terrorism.
15. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has also asserted that if Azerbaijan’s army succeeds, it would mean genocide for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, referencing the genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire in 1915.
16. Although Turkey has expressed strong support for Azerbaijan’s attempt to regain its territory, there is no evidence that Ankara is actively assisting Baku militarily.
17. Moscow has been surprisingly reserved since the conflict erupted and may be banking on a short war that will make both sides even more dependent on Russia.
18. Russian President Vladimir Putin has emphasized that Moscow’s military agreement with Yerevan only applies to the territory of Armenia.
19. Faced with Moscow’s subdued response, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that Yerevan could make concessions over the Nagorno-Karabakh region if Azerbaijan was ready to do the same.
20. Washington now has a valuable opportunity to begin decisive international mediation not only to stop the armed conflict but also to negotiate a durable settlement.

The sub-events of news article:
1. The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh has sparked heated debate in the Middle East, with the conflict increasingly framed as a clash around religious, sectarian, and ethnic lines.
2. Turkey provides full-throated support to Azerbaijan mainly because Azeris belong to the same Turkish ethnicity, and also due to the long-standing hostility between the Turks and Armenians.

4. Reactions from governments in the Arab and Islamic worlds have been largely muted, but some feel the escalating conflict is too dangerous to ignore.
5. The conflict in the Caucasus will naturally be a polarizing and divisive issue in the Middle East, as many Christians are supporting Armenia, Turkomans back Azerbaijan, and Muslim Shia and Sunnis are divided between those who are toeing Iran's line and those who are fearful of Turkey's increasing influence in the region.
6. While geopolitical and economic factors remain inarguably relevant in Middle East conflicts, religious and other ethnic identities deeply interwoven in its societies have demonstrated again a significant role in the region's dynamics.
7. The simmering sectarian conflicts in hotbeds such as Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, and Yemen are largely blamed for the mounting identity crisis as seen in the region's principal fault line: Sunni versus Shia.
8. The new normalisation process triggered by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain striking agreements with Israel is more about rising Iranian and Turkish regional influence than about peace.
9. The question of belonging continues to impact national politics to become a driving force in geopolitical competition and regional political rivalries.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Nagorno-Karabakh, a small landlocked enclave in Transcaucasia, is a potential powder keg that could threaten the security of several nations, including Russia, Turkey, Iran, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.
2. Nagorno-Karabakh, with an area of 4,400 square kilometers and a population of 150,000, was attached to Azerbaijan in 1924 by Josef Stalin, despite its predominantly Armenian population.
3. Stalin's gerrymandering also included dividing the Kurdish majority enclave of Lachin between Armenia and Azerbaijan and attaching Talesh, a non-Azeri coastal land, to Azerbaijan.
4. In 1991, the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh expelled the Azeri minority and established their own autonomous republic, with support from Armenia and Russia.

8. The conflict could provoke uncontrollable reactions in Iran, where an estimated 20 million Azeri-speakers live.

The war is likely to produce only losers, with Azerbaijan unlikely to regain full control of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia facing territorial losses and a refugee crisis, Turkey potentially being dragged into a fifth war, Israel forced to choose sides, Russia losing its claim as peacemaker, and Iran facing geopolitical and ideological setbacks.

1. Israel should start having conversations with members of the emerging Biden administration rather than move forward to achieve goals that the Biden administration will not accept.
2. Applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the West Bank over the next two months without coordination with the incoming Biden administration might so greatly disturb a Biden administration that pressure could be brought to bear to declare all Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank illegitimate.
3. Implementation of sovereignty could even result in the imposition of US sanctions on Israel (in relation to settlement, sovereignty, or both).
4. The Democratic Party of today is not the same party it was eight years ago. It has become extremist in some ways, and pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel positions have multiplied and increased their grip on Democratic constituencies.
5. Israel must contact the leaders of the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt with a view to establishing a joint bloc to appear together before the new administration.
6. Over the next two months, Israel can encourage the search for a solution to the problem of what became of the Palestinian Authority after Hamas tore it into pieces 13 years ago.
7. Jerusalem should endorse a plan for a Palestinian Emirates in which seven separate and independent emirates are built in the West Bank cities of Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarem, Qalqilya, Ramallah, Jericho, and Arab Hebron.
8. As the alliance grows, its political weight is likely to increase in the eyes of the Biden administration, and all the member states will be beneficiaries — both from their internal cooperation and from their ability to present a unified bloc to the American administration.

1. US President-elect Joe Biden’s advisers are divided on the prospect of rejoining the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
2. Some of Biden’s aides are pushing against rejoining the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
3. Biden’s aides argue that rejoining the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran would waste the headway made by the Trump administration in pressuring Tehran through its maximum pressure policy.
4. Biden’s aides assert that the way to move forward is to keep up the pressure from the sanctions slapped on Tehran by the Trump team to force Iran to expand the deal.
5. Iran denies that its nuclear aspirations have a military dimension and angrily lashes out at demands to give up the ballistic missile development project as well as regional meddling.
6. After Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, Iran has been gradually rolling back its own commitments to the agreement.
7. Iran recently notified the UN nuclear watchdog of an intention to install more advanced centrifuges underground and rebuilt a centrifuge assembly center destroyed by sabotage in summer.

The image shows Joe Biden wearing a mask and giving a thumbs-up. This is most likely taken after he heard the news that Iran has decided to install more advanced centrifuges underground and rebuilt a centrifuge assembly center destroyed by sabotage in summer. This is because the US has been pressuring Iran to give up its nuclear program, and Iran's decision to expand its nuclear program is a sign that it is not willing to back down. Biden's thumbs-up suggests that he is confident that he will be able to deal with Iran's nuclear program.

3. Biden has indicated his eagerness to renew the JCPOA, but should prioritize addressing Iran's problematic role in the region, including its hegemonic ambitions and support for terrorism.
4. Iran has not halted nuclear research or weapons development and has used sanctions relief from the JCPOA to expand its influence and fund terrorism.
5. Biden should use maximum pressure and leverage to ensure more favorable concessions from Iran, including a complete halt to its nuclear weapons program, cessation of intercontinental ballistic missile development, and an end to its support for terrorism.

The sub-events of news article:
1. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) has entered into effect, becoming the world's first legally binding international agreement to ban the development and seek the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
2. Nobel Peace Prize winner Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), urges President Joe Biden to join the TPNW and reverse the nuclear buildup of his predecessors.
3. Biden has drawn acclaim from arms control advocates for his efforts to limit the development of nuclear weapons, including his decision to renew the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia.
4. Fihn believes the TPNW is a game-changer for the international movement to eliminate nuclear weapons, citing support from the hibakusha, survivors of the U.S. atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
5. A poll by YouGov shows that support for banning nuclear weapons among the populations of six members of the U.S.-led NATO Western military alliance ranges from 77% to 89%.
6. Fihn argues that opposition to the TPNW is politically untenable and that change is coming faster than most expect, as the treaty forces research universities, financial institutions, and weapons producers to support its mission or face legal, financial, and political risks.

The sub-events of news article:
1. The Biden administration and President Hassan Rouhani's government in Tehran both want to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but their window is closing.
2. Rouhani's term will end in June when Iranians head to the polls, and the country's ruling clerics are all but certain to pave the way for a hardliner to become the next president.
3. As Iranian activity slows during its Nowruz new year holiday, there are no signs of an imminent breakthrough between Washington, D.C. and Tehran.
4. Rouhani has "fought tooth and nail" to keep the JCPOA alive despite domestic skepticism, but his options are almost exhausted.
5. With the end of the Rouhani era in sight, the momentum is with the conservatives.
6. A conservative president would ensure a smooth transition to the next supreme leader.
7. Among the candidates vying to be Khamenei's chosen man is Hossein Dehghan, a former IRGC air force brigadier general who served as Rouhani's defense minister.
8. It remains to be seen whether an IRGC or conservative candidate would—with approval from Khamenei—still pursue JCPOA revival.
9. A conservative president is unlikely to prove an easier negotiating partner for Biden.
10. For Iran hawks in Congress, the identity of Iran's next president is largely irrelevant.
11. Biden's public lack of progress on the JCPOA is concerning supporters of the accord.
12. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said "the window for meaningful diplomatic engagement on Iran's nuclear activities is narrowing."
13. If Biden does miss the Rouhani window, Iran's next president will try to present the U.S. with a choice between "a regional war that's going to be very costly, or a new nuclear deal that is probably less strong than the JCPOA."
14. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has also acknowledged that the election will have a bearing on what role his inspectors play.
15. There is still hope for JCPOA progress in the coming months, even if both sides are sticking to their guns—at least publicly—and denying there has been any behind-the-scenes contact.

3. Iran's accessible foreign exchange reserves have dropped from over $120 billion in 2018 to just $4 billion, and the Iranian government is facing an economic crisis.
4. The main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was reportedly set back by around nine months because of an explosion earlier this month, and the assassination of Mohsen Fahkrizadeh, the longtime head of Iran's military-nuclear program, last November also significantly delayed Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions.
5. The Biden team says it seeks a "longer, stronger, broader" deal, but this is not possible unless the White House sets forth a new Iran policy that is not held hostage by the JCPOA.
6. The Iranian strategy is clear: wield the threat of nuclear escalation to extort massive economic concessions in the form of American sanction relief and a return to the JCPOA.
7. The regime is currently enriching uranium at 60 percent and threatening to go up to 90 percent, and is quickly moving toward industrial-scale production capabilities.
8. The Islamic Republic can now produce advanced centrifuges in large quantities, and can enrich uranium three to ten times faster, to all levels, and in clandestine facilities.
9. The IAEA's 2015 decision to close its investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program was a serious mistake, as the Archive findings and the IAEA's discoveries from its visits of Iranian nuclear sites demonstrated that the Islamic Republic was much closer to weaponization than was previously believed.
10. A "longer, stronger" deal must prevent Iran from being a "nuclear threshold country," and must address all three elements of Tehran's illicit nuclear program: fissile materials, weaponization and the means of delivery.

3. Iran's elections were a "personalized regime disguised as a state of institutions" and a "closed regime disguised as a democracy."
4. Iran held elections to convince the world that it was a democracy, despite the obvious rigging.
5. Bashar al-Assad of Syria also held presidential elections whose legitimacy is not recognized by most of the world, despite the fact that he could have simply imposed his desired status quo.
6. Khamenei and Assad are mocking the concept of democracy by presenting a highly tattered version of it, showing the world how easy it is to rig and falsify elections.
