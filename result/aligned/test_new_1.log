The sub-events of news article:
1. Unlike in December 2014, Israel has virtually no chance of preventing the latest Palestinian attempt to get Israel condemned at the UN Security Council.
2. The key to fending off the latest Palestinian attempt lies with US President Barack Obama.
3. A leaked draft of the proposed resolution expresses “grave concern” over dwindling prospects of a two-state solution and calls on Israel to “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem.”
4. The draft further urges the “intensification and acceleration of international and regional diplomatic efforts and support aimed at achieving, without delay, an end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967.”
5. The draft does not explicitly set a 12-month deadline for negotiations on a final peace deal with Israel and an imposed full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and East Jerusalem within three years, as a resolution proposed in late December 2014 did.
6. For a resolution to pass it needs nine votes from the council’s 15 members.
7. Only a US veto can stop the resolution.
8. Since 2014, the makeup of the Security Council has changed in the Palestinians’ favor, and there is virtually no chance for Israel to stave off a resolution critical of settlements.
9. The US thus remains the only wildcard in the upcoming diplomatic showdown at Turtle Bay.
10. In February 2011, a resolution condemning Israel’s settlements — without establishing deadlines for an Israel withdrawal — got 14 yes votes but stumbled over Washington’s veto.
11. The US needs regional Arab allies in its fight against the Islamic State group and may not want to antagonize them over the Palestinian question.
12. Obama might still be bitter over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s blatant effort to thwart the nuclear deal with Iran by addressing the US Congress and trying to get American Jews to oppose their government.
13. Failure to block the resolution would give ample ammunition to domestic political opponents trying to portray the Democrats as anti-Israel, and threatens to erode Jewish support for the party ahead of the November presidential elections.

The sub-events of news article:
1. The Palestinian Authority has circulated a draft Security Council resolution to UN diplomats, demanding that Israel cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem.
2. The draft resolution blames specifically only Israeli settlers for "acts of terror, violence, destruction, harassment and provocation," while not mentioning the constant violence committed by Palestinians against Israeli civilians.
3. The draft resolution reportedly has the support of enough members of the Security Council to be adopted, absent a veto by the United States.
4. The Obama administration may decide to abstain, if not actually vote yes in concert with the prevailing sentiment among other Security Council members.
5. The Obama administration may back another course, reportedly being developed by France, which favors putting the Security Council on record as endorsing parameters of a two-state solution along the lines of what the Palestinians have been seeking with the support of the Arab states.
6. Alternatively, Obama may decide that the United States should sponsor its own resolution, laying out Obama’s proposal for a two state solution that is largely the same as the Palestinian approach, freezing all settlements and pushing Israel virtually all the way back to the insecure pre-1967 lines.
7. The Palestinian leadership’s true intentions are to establish the pre-1967 lines, with minor adjustments, as the new Palestinian state’s permanent border with Israel, but Israel would not be left alone to remain a Jewish state even then.
8. Hamas remains committed to ridding Israel of all Jews – by genocide, if that becomes the most expedient method.
9. 394 members of the 435-member House of Representatives wrote President Obama a letter last week urging Obama to direct a veto of any such “one-sided United Nations Security Council resolutions.”

2. Abbas has tested the limits of Western leniency since the end of the American-sponsored talks two years ago, which Abbas himself torpedoed.

4. The PA set up roadblocks to prevent teachers from marching on Ramallah, arrested the leaders of the teachers’ union, and threatened legal action unless they returned to work when teachers launched an unprecedented strike over the PA’s broken promises to raise their wages.
5. In 2015, 60 percent of the nearly 200 violations of press freedom in Palestinian territories occurred in the PA-governed West Bank, with only 40 percent occurring in Hamas-ruled Gaza.
6. Abbas is using the final year of President Barack Obama’s term in office as an opportunity for the “consolidation of power at home” and to “further isolate Israel.”
7. Abbas’s increasingly tyrannical government in the West Bank does not only handicap political expression—it also sets back the very legitimacy of the Palestinian national project.
8. Other experts have raised concerns about the PA’s corruption and its effect on the viability of a future Palestinian state.
9. American and European support for the Palestinian Authority now totals hundreds of billions of dollars—possibly trillions if non-governmental activities are included.
10. Donors should insist on fiscal and legal reforms, as well as the establishment of robust and independent institutions—judiciary and education included.

The sub-events of news article:
1. As of Saturday morning, there have been several days of virtual dueling between Israel and Gaza, with mortars fired toward Israel and responses from Israeli tanks and aircraft.
2. There have been fierce words of threat from both sides, but so far only one death has been reported in Gaza, with no injuries or property damage in Israel.
3. The duel is dangerous and could escalate to casualties in Israel, leading to a repeat of the 2014 conflict that resulted in the deaths of 71 Israeli soldiers and civilians and approximately 2200 Gazan deaths.
4. Both sides claim they do not want or intend an escalation, but tension continues.
5. There are two possible explanations for the actions on the Gaza front: Gazan fringe groups wanting to excite action by firing mortars, with measured Israeli responses, then Hamas being unable to restrain its fighters from making their own responses; or Israeli activity against Gazan tunnels, viewed as threatening border settlements with the sudden attack by terrorists coming out of the ground.
6. Israel has discovered and sealed two tunnels in recent weeks, and several have collapsed on the Gazans digging them.
7. Israel may have developed technology capable of locating and responding to the tunnels, and a Gazan captured by Israel may have provided details of tunnel construction and location.
8. Israeli forces have entered Gaza to a depth of 100-200 meters, in search of tunnels and/or to clear areas to facilitate subsequent efforts against the tunnels or snipers.
9. Gaza's entire tunnel operation is a microcosm of Palestinian failure, with no tangible military payoff and more damage to Gazan infrastructure than to Israel.
10. Israel has tightened its control over what goes into Gaza.
11. It is difficult to predict what Donald Trump would do about Israel and Palestine, but one comment he made about moving the Palestinians to Puerto Rico was seen as unwise.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Hamas security forces in Gaza arrested a group of Salafi activists, members of Salafiya Jihadiya, who were planning to cross the Gaza-Egypt border to join Islamic State in Sinai.
2. The arrests were presented as part of an impressive operation by Hamas, fulfilling promises its representatives made to Egypt during a visit to Cairo two months ago.
3. Despite the promises by Gaza’s rulers to stop the smuggling to and from Sinai and the recent arrests, Hamas continues to maintain a delicate and complicated web of interests and alliances with Islamic State in Sinai.
4. Wounded members of Islamic State are still being brought into Gaza for medical treatment at almost the same rate as before the Hamas delegation’s visit to Cairo two months ago.
5. Arms smuggling from the Gaza Strip to Sinai and vice versa continues, albeit at a reduced rate, supervised by members of Hamas’s military wing.
6. The transfer of wounded Islamic State fighters is not the work of some low-ranking activist looking for a quick way to make money. It is a deliberate policy of Hamas that began in mid-2015.
7. The most problematic factor for Cairo may be the smuggling of arms between Gaza and Sinai. There’s been a dramatic reduction in the scope, but Hamas still manages to bring quantities of arms into the Gaza Strip and to move arms and ammunition from Gaza to Sinai.
8. Several former Hamas activists have crossed the border in recent weeks to join the fighting in Sinai against the Egyptian army.
9. Egypt’s response to this, it must be said, shows a degree of confusion and perhaps a lack of clear strategy.
10. It is doubtful, then, that Cairo will again open the Rafah crossing for periods longer than just a day or two, even with Ramadan approaching.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton added a last-minute amendment to a Department of Energy spending bill, specifying that taxpayer money could not be utilized for similar purchases in the next budget year.
2. Senate Democrats blocked the bill on Wednesday, describing Cotton’s amendment as a “poison pill.”
3. Cotton has been a particularly strong voice of opposition to the White House’s Iran policy, having previously drawn stark criticism for convincing 46 of his fellow congressmen to sign a letter to the Iranian government announcing that the US government in the near future might elect to simply not enforce the agreement reached between the Obama administration and its Iranian counterpart.
4. The Obama administration had previously promised Congress that it would not change Treasury Department rules which would effectively give the Iranians access to the US dollar and the American financial system as a result of implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
5. The perceived betrayal of that promise was viewed as potentially giving away virtually the last bit of leverage that the US government had over Iran and its nuclear ambitions.
6. The ongoing separation of the Iranian and American financial systems is a contributing factor in keeping some investors and potential partners out of Iran.
7. The World Bank is still noticeably reluctant to reengage with Tehran following the implementation of the nuclear deal.
8. The push-back from Cotton and other critics of the deal is a contributing factor in this, but so too is the anti-Western sentiment that is regularly being expressed by the Iranian regime.
9. The most recent reminder of the possible consequences of falling afoul or lingering or re-imposed economic sanctions comes in the form of the arraignment of Reza Zarrab, who was the key-figure in a scandal that emerged three years ago involving Turkish evasion of sanctions on Iran.

Cotton has been a particularly strong voice of opposition to the White House’s Iran policy, having previously drawn stark criticism for convincing 46 of his fellow congressmen to sign a letter to the Iranian government announcing that the US government in the near future might elect to simply not enforce the agreement reached between the Obama administration and its Iranian counterpart.
4. The Obama administration had previously promised Congress that it would not change Treasury Department rules which would effectively give the Iranians access to the US dollar and the American financial system as a result of implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
5. The perceived betrayal of that promise was viewed as potentially giving away virtually the last bit of leverage that the US government had over Iran and its nuclear ambitions.
6. The ongoing separation of the Iranian and American financial systems is a contributing factor in keeping some investors and potential partners out of Iran.
7. The World Bank is still noticeably reluctant to reengage with Tehran following the implementation of the nuclear deal.
8. The push-back from Cotton and other critics of the deal is a contributing factor in this, but so too is the anti-Western sentiment that is regularly being expressed by the Iranian regime.
9. The most recent reminder of the possible consequences of falling afoul or lingering or re-imposed economic sanctions comes in the form of the arraignment of Reza Zarrab, who was the key-figure in a scandal that emerged three years ago involving Turkish evasion of sanctions on Iran.

1. Frederic C. Hof, Obama's former top Syria adviser, charged that the Obama administration's failure to protect Syrian civilians was because it was so intent on pursuing a nuclear agreement with Iran.
2. Hof countered that the Obama administration did not hesitate to intervene in Iraq and Syria to protect civilians from ISIS and Yazidis.
3. Hof explained that the Obama administration's fear and dismissal of making things better in Syria "by being there" applied only to those parts of Syria experiencing mass murder and massive displacement at the hands of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
4. David Samuels, the writer of the profile, explained that "by eliminating the fuss about Iran’s nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey."
5. Hof credited Rhodes for spelling out Obama’s foreign policy framework so clearly, but suggested that the next administration turn to the "thoughtful (if fallible) and experienced (if imperfect) foreign policy practitioners—yes, the thoroughly disrespected ‘Blob’—to undo the damage they have done."
6. Richard Cohen of The Washington Post made a similar critique, stating that the Obama administration's foreign policy has resulted in Russia having more influence in the Middle East than the United States, and Iran and its proxies being everywhere.

The sub-events of news article:
1. President Trump's rhetoric as Commander in Chief may affect his personal culpability over potential crimes under international law.
2. Incitement may be enough to create criminal culpability, and President Trump is responsible for ensuring US military and operatives act consistent with US and international law.
3. President Trump has expressed his preference for torture and killing innocent family members of terror suspects.
4. For any conviction to occur, there would have to be a court willing to entertain investigation and prosecution, as well as sufficient evidence of the alleged crime.
5. National courts, including US courts, could enforce criminal and/or civil provisions of international law, particularly to the degree such have been adopted as part of such country's laws.
6. Sovereign immunity may preclude prosecution while in office, but other avenues may be suitable, such as civil and criminal liability, as Trump remains owner of a global business empire.
7. Judgments against Trump's business empire could be secured in national courts.
8. Violations of international humanitarian law as adopted in US law may be the basis for impeachment proceedings.
9. The US is not currently party to the International Criminal Court, but the ICC's codes and practice have been influenced by western democracies, particularly America's European allies.
10. The ICC was not intended to be a court of primary jurisdiction and continues to preside as a tribunal of complementary jurisdiction that would only act if national courts are unwilling or unable to intercede.
11. The ICC continues to further the standards and consensus on war crimes, the crime of aggression, and crimes against humanity.
12. The more realistic investigation and prosecution of Trump may come from national courts, within western democracies or the US.
13. Plaintiffs and prosecutors could seek remedy to Trump in ways generally not a realistic option before, as Trump has assets all around the globe.
14. Trump's rhetoric and actions, such as the "Mexico Wall" and "Muslim Ban," add to the body of evidence of discrimination and possible persecution.
15. Trump's alliance with Vladimir Putin, whose Kremlin has been linked to violations in Georgia, Ukraine, and Crimea, raises concerns about the US adopting similar tactics.
16. Trump's own words would reveal intent as well as action, where ambiguity or silence may have been a more clever precedent.
17. Impeachment may be a more likely consequence of possible violations as ever more developed international humanitarian law also becomes part of US standards.
18. Unlike previous US Commanders in Chief, President Trump could be hurt in an unprecedented manner, where perhaps he is most sensitive, in his personal wealth.

2. Trump's tweets also claimed that a "lower court" failed to approve a request for wiretapping his headquarters, which means that a higher court did.
3. The FBI, after being duly authorized by the Justice Department, succeeded in convincing a special tribunal set up in accordance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that despite the danger of being accused of improper interference in the political process, there was enough “probable cause” to suspect that Trump and/or his underlings were in contact with a foreign entity or foreign intelligence service.
4. If the FBI did wiretap Trump's headquarters, Trump himself may have offered the noose from which he might ultimately hang, politically speaking.
5. Democrats will be particularly incensed to learn that while FBI Director James Comey was concealing the possibility that the GOP presidential candidate might be guilty of treason, he found it necessary to publicize an extremely damaging letter about Hillary Clinton’s emails just nine days before the elections.
6. The new mayhem will undoubtedly expand polarization in Washington as many Republicans jump to Trump’s defense.
7. It takes only a few Republicans who haven’t lost their conscience to turn the demand for an independent investigation of Russiagate affair into an ultimatum that can’t be refused.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Twin bombings of churches in Egypt suggest Daesh militants are lashing out as they face increasing pressure in Iraq and Syria.
2. Daesh's Egyptian affiliate has been centered in the Sinai Peninsula, but has been unable to seize population centers there and has lost top militants to Egyptian military strikes.
3. Daesh has attacked Egyptian Coptic Christians before, but their campaign against the minority picked up in December with a Cairo church bombing that killed 29 people.
4. Daesh and its supporters online have been "methodically introducing more radical sectarian concepts" to Egyptian militants since the December bombing.
5. Daesh began a systematic campaign to target Coptic Christians in Egypt in December 2016.
6. As Daesh is "squeezed in Iraq and Syria it often conducts spectacular attacks elsewhere in an attempt to regain the narrative, boost morale and win recruits."
7. In Iraq and Syria, Daesh has faced consecutive defeats over the past year and is on the verge of losing control of Iraq's second city Mosul.
8. After Sunday's bombings in Tanta and Alexandria, the group said it had deployed two Egyptian suicide bombers against the "crusaders."
9. President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi declared a three-month state of emergency in response to the bombings.
10. The Copts, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt's 90 million people, have been attacked by militants for years, more so after the military overthrew President Muhammad Mursi in 2013.
11. Daesh's "sectarian attacks fuel those ideologically inclined to support the group, while showing it's still 'expanding' despite battlefield setbacks."
12. The three church attacks in December and April suggest an expanded presence of militant cells west of the Suez Canal.
13. Daesh's Egyptian affiliate, Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, had carried out several attacks targeting the police on the mainland before pledging allegiance to Daesh in November 2014.

The number of the sub-event most relevant to the image is 
 10. The image shows a group of people, presumably Coptic Christians, mourning the victims of a terrorist attack on a church in Egypt. The article mentions that Daesh has been targeting Coptic Christians in Egypt, and that the recent church bombings are part of a systematic campaign to do so. The image is therefore most relevant to sub-event 10, which discusses Daesh's attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt.
