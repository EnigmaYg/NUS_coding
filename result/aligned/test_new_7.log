1. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has reportedly agreed to cooperate with Israel in the manhunt for six escaped inmates, some of whom are believed to be hiding in the West Bank.
2. The report, published in the Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar, claims that the PA will assist in locating the escapees in exchange for Israel's commitment to capture them alive and improve conditions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.

4. Four of the escapees were serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis, while the other two were held on charges of attempted murder and administrative detention.
5. The PA's cooperation, if confirmed, would mark a significant shift in its stance, as it had previously expressed support for the escapees and was seen as unlikely to assist Israel in their capture.
6. The report in al-Akhbar is based on an unnamed source within the PA and has not been commented on by Israeli authorities.
7. The newspaper is closely linked to Hezbollah and Hamas, which often accuses the PA of betraying the Palestinian cause by cooperating with Israeli security agencies.

1. A Chinese admiral and pundit, Rear Adm. Lou Yuan, threatened to sink two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and kill thousands of American sailors to resolve China's territorial disputes.
2. The Chinese military has deployed an array of weaponry specifically to target American flattops.
3. A U.S. Navy test in 2005 proved that even if hit, carriers are really hard to sink.
4. The last time anyone permanently sank a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in combat was during World War II.
5. To even try to sink an American flattop, you first must hit it, which is not easy due to the air wing, escorting destroyers, cruisers, and submarines that surround the carrier.
6. China or another country could attempt to target the carriers with submarines, cruise missiles, and ballistic rockets.
7. Shooting anything at an aircraft carrier is a costly, difficult operation, and the carrier's attackers could face withering counterfire from the vessel's defenders.
8. If a country were to sink an American carrier, the United States would likely deploy all its remaining military might, including its surviving eight or nine carriers, against the country behind the sinking.

The sub-events of news article:
1. China has built a mock-up of a Ford-class aircraft carrier, two Arleigh-Burke-class guided-missile destroyers, and other carrier-shaped targets in the Taklamakan desert in western Xinjiang Province.
2. The mock-ups are likely intended for target practice for China's growing arsenal of anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs).
3. ASBMs have never been used in combat before, and there is debate over their reliability in hitting moving targets.
4. China has previously tested ASBMs against a carrier-like target in 2013 and successfully test-fired DF-21D and DF-26B missiles at moving maritime targets near the Paracel Islands in 2019.
5. China's return to land-based ASBM target tests is likely intended to limit the controversy and observability of tests in the open commons of the Pacific Ocean.
6. The land-based tests may also prove less expensive or logistically complicated to orchestrate, and the smaller rail-based target may allow missile units to repeatedly practice striking a moving target.
7. China has been expanding and enhancing its maritime surveillance capabilities with radars deployed on a network of artificial islands, additional satellites launched into space, and new types of robotic spy submarines, surveillance drones, and maritime patrol aircraft.
8. Practice against realistic and moving target tests, and forming spotter-shooter kill chains seem like necessary prerequisites before simulating more complex tactics used in combat scenarios against a reactive enemy with air defenses.

3. ASBMs have never been used in combat before, and there is debate over their reliability in hitting moving targets.
4. China has previously tested ASBMs against a carrier-like target in 2013 and successfully test-fired DF-21D and DF-26B missiles at moving maritime targets near the Paracel Islands in 2019.
5. China's return to land-based ASBM target tests is likely intended to limit the controversy and observability of tests in the open commons of the Pacific Ocean.
6. The land-based tests may also prove less expensive or logistically complicated to orchestrate, and the smaller rail-based target may allow missile units to repeatedly practice striking a moving target.
7. China has been expanding and enhancing its maritime surveillance capabilities with radars deployed on a network of artificial islands, additional satellites launched into space, and new types of robotic spy submarines, surveillance drones, and maritime patrol aircraft.
8. Practice against realistic and moving target tests, and forming spotter-shooter kill chains seem like necessary prerequisites before simulating more complex tactics used in combat scenarios against a reactive enemy with air defenses.

3. After the Shah's regime fell in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran took control of seventy-nine F-14 Tomcat jets.
4. In the first six months of the Iran-Iraq War, the F-14 Tomcat reportedly racked up at least fifty air-to-air victories with only one aircraft damaged.
5. Iraqi pilots changed tactics to avoid engaging F-14 Tomcats, and Iranian pilots used the planes' sensors to coordinate other aircraft.
6. Iranian engineers made several improvements to the F-14 Tomcat, including adding bomb racks to transform them into ground-attack aircraft.
7. By the end of the Iran-Iraq War, the F-14 Tomcat had made at least two hundred kills, losing only eight to enemy action.
8. Due to U.S. sanctions, spare parts for the F-14 Tomcat were impossible to import, and the number of operational aircraft dwindled to around thirty in 1988.
9. Today, the number of operational F-14 Tomcat jets in Iran is estimated to have increased to forty, though their readiness varies.

The sub-events of news article:
1. The U.S. Air Force Reaper Drones were crucial to victories in the War on Terrorism by delivering lethal, decisive and precise hellfire missile attacks upon terrorist and insurgent targets.
2. The Reaper may not be stealthy enough, small enough or fast enough to survive a war against any major opponent armed with advanced air defenses or sophisticated air-to-air weapons.
3. Iran shot down a U.S. Global Hawk drone last year, raising the question as to whether certain larger, less stealthy drones might prove too vulnerable for certain major power wars.
4. The concept of drone swarms makes sense with respect to survivability and success against sophisticated enemies.
5. A smaller target is simply less visible to an enemy and therefore more difficult to hit.

The number of the sub-event most relevant to the image is

The image shows a Chinese stealth drone. The article talks about the U.S. Reaper Drone and the Global Hawk drone, which are not stealth drones. The article also talks about the concept of drone swarms, which is not related to the image. However, the article does mention that a smaller target is simply less visible to an enemy and therefore more difficult to hit. This is related to the image because the Chinese stealth drone is a smaller target and therefore more difficult to hit.

5. Carriers are armed with a multitude of self-defense missiles and systems that would likely have no problem tracking and intercepting a Kornet.
6. A Kornet hit would likely only kill people within a very small radius of the impact and leave only a small hole in the hull.
7. Damage control teams on ships are trained to deal with far more devastating damage than a Kornet hit.
8. The thermobaric version of the Kornet has very little penetrative capabilities and is unlikely to make its way through the hull of an aircraft carrier.

Barlev wrote, "I told her that increasing the work permits for Palestinians in Israel, both from Judea and Samaria and Gaza, which we are already carrying out, is a key to reducing tensions, just like implementing the plan to establish a joint industrial zone on the outskirts of Gaza and more. American assistance for such projects can help a lot."

4. Gantz’s office published a generic statement devoid of details, saying, “The defense minister emphasized the shared interest in strengthening security cooperation, preserving security stability, and preventing terrorism and violence.”
5. The details of the meeting were subsequently publicized, revealing the far-reaching concessions that Gantz had made to the Palestinians.
6. Gantz appears to be violating the 1994 Paris Protocol agreed to between Israel and the P.A. by making changes to the agreement without bringing any legislation to the Knesset for debate.
7. Abbas is personally leading a campaign to prosecute Gantz in the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes.

The sub-events of news article:
1. There is a consensus that there is no chance in the foreseeable future to reach a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
2. The term "no partner for peace" has worn out due to repeatable use.
3. The voices that say the two-state solution is dead have gotten louder due to the growing unrest in the West Bank, the absence of a Palestinian leader who is willing to reach a peace deal, and the shift of Israeli society toward the right side of the political map.
4. Israeli expert on democracy, Prof. Matti Steinberg, said the current Israeli reality is pretty clear: it's either a two-state solution or deterioration into apartheid.
5. The dissipation of hate toward Israel by all Arabs states in the Middle East, thanks largely to the Abraham Accords, changed, without doubt, Israel's status in the Gulf region, and the new alliances with some Arab countries prove that.
6. The current trend appears to be calling for a temporary solution to the conflict by limiting the scope of Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
7. The two-state solution may have drifted away from the political agenda, but it's not gone.
8. Israel will never openly declare apartheid to be the case, but the international community might.
9. The difficulty of understanding the term "apartheid" is understandable. But it's just as important to understand that this is a process of a slow or fast deterioration into a startling reality.
10. The public and political discourse on the diplomatic solution to the conflict must be restored, at least as long as the Palestinian leadership is still committed to the Oslo Accords.
11. The Palestinian leadership is perceived as undemocratic, however, other Arab societies in the Middle East, including some of our friends, also have this kind of mindset.
12. The Biden administration can provide the sane and realistic discourse, with comfortable and improved circumstances for Israel.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote a book in the early 2000s titled “The Israeli Leopard” that was never published.
2. Excerpts from the book were published on Friday by the Haaretz newspaper, revealing Netanyahu's views on corruption, bloated governments, and the dangers of over-concentration of centralized power.
3. Netanyahu, now leader of the opposition, is currently on trial in three corruption cases, including fraud, breach of trust, and bribery.
4. In the book, Netanyahu compared corruption to "a cancer that grows in the darkness" and argued that it "distorts competition, hurts citizens’ morale, and discourages them."
5. Netanyahu also criticized the concentration of power in Israel, stating that "for years immense financial power has been concentrated in the government, the labor federation and the parties."
6. The book also contains advice on maintaining a small government, which Netanyahu himself quickly jettisoned on becoming prime minister again.
7. Netanyahu is reportedly trying to negotiate a plea deal with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, which would include dropping the bribery charge in Case 4000 and the entire Case 2000.
8. The main sticking point in the plea deal negotiations is that prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude, which would see Netanyahu barred from office for seven years.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Former Supreme Court president Aharon Barak acknowledged that opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu had asked him to speak with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit about the possibility of reaching a plea deal in the former premier’s graft trial.
2. Barak said that in recent months, senior figures in Netanyahu’s Likud party asked him to initiate talks with Mandelblit.
3. Barak stressed that any plea deal must include a clause that Netanyahu will be convicted of “moral turpitude” — a legal designation which would bar him from public office for seven years.
4. According to multiple television reports over the weekend citing unnamed sources, talks on a potential plea deal in the former prime minister’s criminal trial have made significant progress, and the state prosecution believes the ex-Israeli leader will sign such a deal within days.
5. Netanyahu, he insists, must first accept as a basic condition the framework of the deal: that he will be convicted of fraud and breach of trust; that he will remain an MK until the court determines his punishment and sentences him to 3-6 months in jail that will be commuted to community service; and that he will agree that his actions will be designated as carrying “moral turpitude” — barring him from public service for seven years.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Defense Minister Benny Gantz expressed sorrow at the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian man, Omar As’ad, who suffered heart failure after being bound, gagged and abandoned at a construction site in the middle of winter by Israeli soldiers last month.
2. Gantz said the Israel Defense Forces would take action against any “deviations” from its values.
3. IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohai and head of the IDF Central Command Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs also condemned the soldiers’ actions.
4. According to an IDF probe, on January 12, soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion set up an impromptu checkpoint in the central West Bank village of Jiljilya, stopping cars and checking the identification documents of people inside.
5. As’ad was the first to pass through the checkpoint and refused to identify himself when asked and yelled at the soldiers.
6. The soldiers tackled As’ad to the ground and bound his hands with zip ties, then moved him to a nearby construction site, where he was left on the ground in the near-freezing January night.
7. The soldiers also gagged As’ad to prevent him from calling out and telling others about the checkpoint.
8. When the Netzah Yehuda soldiers decided to pack up the checkpoint roughly half an hour later, they untied the four Palestinians and let them go.
9. By that time, As’ad was unresponsive. The soldiers left him on the ground at the construction site.
10. As’ad, an American citizen who had lived in the US for many years, was found dead a few hours later with one ziptie still around one of his hands and a blindfold over his eyes.
11. An autopsy conducted by the Palestinian Authority and reviewed by the IDF determined that As’ad had died of a stress-induced heart attack, brought on by being tackled to the ground, bound and gagged.
12. Kohavi said the soldiers’ decision to leave As’ad on the ground in the freezing night was “grave and unethical.”
13. Fuchs similarly denounced the decision, as well as the initial choice to violently detain As’ad.
14. Gantz also called for the IDF, Shin Bet and police to crackdown on “nationalistic crime and Jewish terror” in the West Bank.
15. The past year saw a major rise in violent attacks by Israeli extremists against Palestinians and, to a lesser extent, against Israeli left-wing activists and security forces.
16. Gantz has called for the military and law enforcement to take a harsher stance against this violence.
17. Gantz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and the head of the police’s West Bank division, Uzi Levi, to receive an update on the ongoing joint effort to combat “nationalistic crime.”

The sub-events of news article:
1. Defense Minister Benny Gantz expressed sorrow at the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian man, Omar As’ad, who suffered heart failure after being bound, gagged and abandoned at a construction site in the middle of winter by Israeli soldiers last month.
2. Gantz said the Israel Defense Forces would take action against any “deviations” from its values.
3. IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohai and head of the IDF Central Command Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs also condemned the soldiers’ actions.
4. According to an IDF probe, on January 12, soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion set up an impromptu checkpoint in the central West Bank village of Jiljilya, stopping cars and checking the identification documents of people inside.
5. As’ad was the first to pass through the checkpoint and refused to identify himself when asked and yelled at the soldiers.
6. The soldiers tackled As’ad to the ground and bound his hands with zip ties, then moved him to a nearby construction site, where he was left on the ground in the near-freezing January night.
7. The soldiers also gagged As’ad to prevent him from calling out and telling others about the checkpoint.
8. When the Netzah Yehuda soldiers decided to pack up the checkpoint roughly half an hour later, they untied the four Palestinians and let them go.
9. By that time, As’ad was unresponsive. The soldiers left him on the ground at the construction site.
10. As’ad, an American citizen who had lived in the US for many years, was found dead a few hours later with one ziptie still around one of his hands and a blindfold over his eyes.
11. An autopsy conducted by the Palestinian Authority and reviewed by the IDF determined that As’ad had died of a stress-induced heart attack, brought on by being tackled to the ground, bound and gagged.
12. Kohavi said the soldiers’ decision to leave As’ad on the ground in the freezing night was “grave and unethical.”
13. Fuchs similarly denounced the decision, as well as the initial choice to violently detain As’ad.
14. Gantz also called for the IDF, Shin Bet and police to crackdown on “nationalistic crime and Jewish terror” in the West Bank.
15. The past year saw a major rise in violent attacks by Israeli extremists against Palestinians and, to a lesser extent, against Israeli left-wing activists and security forces.
16. Gantz has called for the military and law enforcement to take a harsher stance against this violence.
17. Gantz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and the head of the police’s West Bank division, Uzi Levi, to receive an update on the ongoing joint effort to combat “nationalistic crime.”

The sub-events of news article:
1. The head of the military’s Central Command condemned soldiers for leaving an elderly Palestinian man on the ground at a construction site, where he subsequently died of heart failure, after they detained him in the middle of the night.
2. Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs described the incident as an “extremely grave ethical failure” and said the officers involved should have used greater discretion in deciding to detain the 78-year-old man, Omar As’ad, in the first place as well as to then leave him unconscious in a half-constructed building.
3. IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi similarly denounced the soldiers’ actions on Tuesday in remarks made to officers preparing to become company and battalion commanders.
4. According to an Israel Defense Forces probe presented to IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi on Monday, a group of some 30 soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion set up an impromptu checkpoint in the central West Bank village of Jiljilya on January 12, stopping cars and checking the identification documents of people inside.
5. As’ad, an American citizen who had lived in the US for many years, was found dead a few hours later with one ziptie still around one of his hands and a blindfold over his eyes.
6. An autopsy conducted by the Palestinian Authority determined that he had died of a stress-induced heart attack, brought on by being bound and gagged.
7. The Central Command chief said their decision to leave him, unconscious on the ground in the middle of a near-freezing winter night, was not made out of malice, but because “they cared more about completing their mission” than about ensuring As’ad’s well-being.
8. In the wake of the probe, two junior officers were dismissed from their positions and barred from command roles for the next two years, and the commander of the Netzah Yehuda Battalion will be formally censured.
9. Fuchs defended the decision to not take disciplinary action against the soldiers involved in As’ad’s death, saying the responsibility was ultimately the commanders’.
10. Fuchs also defended the decision to set up an impromptu checkpoint inside the village, saying the practice has allowed soldiers to arrest terrorist operatives, find weapons and otherwise prevent attacks.
