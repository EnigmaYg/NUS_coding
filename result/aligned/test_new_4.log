2. Rounds of talks have been going on for the last few weeks with the US, Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the Taliban as major players, while the Afghan National Unity Government and India remained out of the pail.
3. The Taliban refused to accept the joining of the Afghan government’s delegation to the parleys in Qatar.
4. Keeping out a segment of public leaders, particularly Pakhtun nationalists, was not only bound to create suspicion and concerns but also seemed elusive.
5. The 1998 Geneva Accords were negotiated between the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan but unfortunately the major guarantors failed to honour their main provisions regarding ending military support to the warring groups.
6. Dr Najeebullah offered his adversaries major concessions, including declaring a six-month unilateral ceasefire, approving a new constitution that recognised Islam as the state religion, introducing an electoral and multiparty system, implementing economic reforms to respect private property, granting amnesty to opposition leaders, releasing more than 16,000 political prisoners, and offering the opposition half of the posts in a government of national reconciliation.
7. The acrimony between key personalities and the parties they represented resulted in a civil war with devastating effect on the country.
8. The US has, in its own wisdom, incapacitated the al Qaeda network which is no longer considered strong enough to threaten their vital national interests and social order.
9. The Taliban are in a belligerent mood trying to advance their influence on ground using the negotiating table as part of the tactics.
10. The immediate withdrawal of the US, without bolstering the National Unity Government with the presence of neutral forces to the satisfaction of all stakeholders, may plunge the country into chaos.
11. Projecting the Taliban as the sole player within Afghanistan is a departure from the path of reconciliation as it neglects other major players within society.
12. The Taliban, with guns in hand and freedom to move in all directions, will provide no free choice to those sitting on the sidelines.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Israel's Security Cabinet implemented a law freezing Palestinian Authority funds, deducting NIS 502,697,000 (US $138,000,000) from the funds designated for transfer to the Palestinian Authority.
2. The funds were frozen because in 2018, the Palestinian Authority transferred the same amount to terrorists imprisoned in Israel and their families and to released prisoners.
3. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came under increasing pressure to implement the tax freeze following 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher’s brutal rape and murder earlier in the month.
4. Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said the move amounted to a “theft of Palestinian public money” and showed “Israel’s enactment of racist laws in support of the occupation” which “undermined the two-state solution.”
5. A PA official warned that the freeze “could jeopardize the Palestinian economy and undermine the PA’s ability to pay its salaries on time.”
6. Israel views the Palestinian payments as incitement to murder or pay-to-slay, while the Palestinian Authority counter claims that the payments are a source of welfare for families who have lost their main breadwinner.
7. The freeze comes as the Palestinians face major budget cuts made last year after the United States slashed funding for the UN’s Palestinian refugee program UNRWA and for development programs in the Palestinian territories.

1. Germany's Bundestag has voted to define the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement as anti-Semitic, becoming the first major European parliament to do so.
2. The motion, "Resist the BDS Movement – Fighting Antisemitism," was sponsored by the Bundestag's two largest parties – Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian-Democratic Union and the Social Democrat party – as well as the Green Party and the Free Democratic Party.
3. The motion claims that "the arguments, patterns and methods of the BDS movement are anti-Semitic" and that BDS' "don't buy" stickers "arouse associations [with] the Nazi slogan 'Don't buy from Jews'".
4. The passing of the motion will "prevent 'organizations which express themselves in an antisemitic manner, or question the right of Israel to exist' from using 'premises and facilities under Bundestag administration'".
5. It will also require the Bundestag "not to financially promote organizations that do not respect Israel's right to exist".
6. The motion could serve as a precedent for other parliaments to label BDS anti-Semitic.
7. The Bundestag also voted on two other anti-BDS resolutions: one calling on the German government to outlaw the BDS altogether and another calling on the government to condemn "anti-Semitism within" the BDS movement.
8. The AfD's proposed resolution to outlaw BDS was rejected with 431 votes against and 62 votes in favour.
9. Germany has waged a long-term campaign against BDS, including demanding that "Germany's GLS Bank — the country's most long-established ethical investment bank — close the account of a pro-BDS group calling itself 'Jewish Voice'".
10. Much of this crackdown comes at the behest of Israel, with whom Germany has historically maintained close relations.

1. President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt and the chief of Sudan’s military council Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan met in Cairo to discuss wide-ranging cooperation between the two countries.
2. Egypt and Sudan have had a history of ups and downs in their relations, but there is a feeling that the meeting could mark the beginning of solid relations on all fronts.
3. Egypt fears that political chaos in Sudan would lead to security chaos, and the fact that the ruling military council is not in full control of the country is pushing major Arab governments to support the transitional ruling council.
4. Egypt has been demanding that Sudan stop offering refuge to militant Islamists, including leading figures from the Muslim Brotherhood.
5. Al-Burhan made no final promises, but was clearly committed to working with Egypt on security matters.
6. Egypt and Sudan have a number of longstanding disagreements beyond security, including Khartoum’s support for Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam.
7. Al-Burhan and his second in command, Hamdan Daglo, are pursuing an alliance with the Cairo-Abu Dhabi-Riyadh axis, suggesting the future trajectory of Khartoum’s relations.

9. The longstanding dispute over Halayeb and Shalatin, the triangle of land on the Egyptian and Sudanese border that both countries claim, was not on the agenda of the Cairo talks between Al-Sisi and Al-Burhan.
10. To secure truly positive prospects for Egypt-Sudan relations, it is important that Cairo takes into account the views of Sudan’s revolutionary leaders as well as its military council.
11. Egypt’s priority on Sudan is to support the military council and the traditional opposition, but Cairo is also aware that it should not antagonise public opinion in Sudan.
12. It is too early to make any final judgements on the path Sudan’s foreign policy is likely to take.

2. Greenblatt mustered an Orthodox minyan — a quorum of ten adult Jewish males — for morning services Wednesday at the synagogue, which dates to the 19th century.
3. The conference wrapped up on its second day without news of whether Jared Kushner, the peace team’s boss and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, had extracted the $50-70 billion in pledges he is seeking to seed the infrastructural changes he says the Palestinian economy needs as a predicate for peace.
4. The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the conference, in part because Trump has favored Israel by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and because Trump and Congress have cut off all U.S. funding to the Palestinians.
5. The same day the conference opened, on Tuesday, officials of the United Nations Work and Relief Agency, which administers aid to Palestinian refugees and their descendants, garnered $113 million in pledges to help make up for the $360 million the Trump administration had cut in funding for the agency.
6. The Bahrain conference, while inconclusive in its immediate goals — Kushner says he will roll out the political component of his plan later this year — was yet another signal of growing acceptance of Israel in the Arab world.
7. Bahrain for the first time allowed Israeli journalists to enter to cover the conference.

10. To achieve Israeli/Palestinian peace, it is crucial for the Palestinian leadership to accept the existence of Israel and abandon the idea of ending its existence through mass population transfer.
11. Votes against the UN resolutions supporting the Palestinian claim of a "right of return" would contribute to this goal.
