4. Eban dismissed China as a “decisive factor in the Middle East” and observed that “the really important Nixon talks on the Middle East are not taking place in Peking” but “will be taking place soon in Moscow.”
5. Eban said that peace talks with Egypt hinged on two “crucial” points: demilitarization of the Sinai peninsula and Israel retaining permanent control of Sharm el-Sheikh.
6. Eban said that Egypt now commands the necessary prestige to enable it to initiate peace talks and is recognized in this position by both the US and the Soviet Union.
7. Eban said that he would much prefer a change of Soviet policy without secret contacts than secret contacts and no change of Russian policy.
8. Eban said that China’s presence in the Middle East was mainly in the field of propaganda.

10. Eban said that the Palestinian problem “had to be settled by the Arabs themselves” and that “as far as Israel is concerned, we would be glad to live alongside a Palestinian state but this is for them to decide, not for us.”
11. Eban claimed that the Soviet Union “has decided to allow Jewish emigration for two reasons: because it has come to realize that it cannot smother by force their Jewishness and because of the intensity of protests throughout the world’s progressive circles about this issue.”

The sub-events of news article:
1. Some Israeli Cabinet ministers are concerned about reports of "one-sided" Israeli gestures to Egypt concerning the West Bank residents.
2. The Israeli gestures reportedly include a cessation of administrative arrests in the West Bank, cancellation of the prohibition on political conventions, permitting West Bank residents who left the country in 1967 to be reunited with their families, and a dissolution of the military government headquarters in West Bank cities.
3. One minister commented that "Israel has not left itself any leverage with which to conduct the forthcoming negotiations on autonomy."
4. Another minister added that the gestures were most likely the work of journalists, and that he found it hard to believe that Begin would agree to such acts.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Iranian-backed Shiite militias and Sunni tribes have joined Iraq's military in a major operation to retake Tikrit from the Islamic State group, while the U.S.-led coalition has remained on the sidelines.
2. The campaign for Tikrit is a dress rehearsal for the real contest: The fight to recapture Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the extremists' biggest stronghold.
3. The Tikrit operation is aimed at stopping Islamic State fighters from closing in on Samarra, a Shiite holy city just to the south.
4. Directing the offensive with the aid of dozens of Iranian military advisers is a powerful Iranian general, Ghasem Soleimani, commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force.
5. The U.S.-led coalition forces are not providing air power in the Tikrit operation because the Iraqis haven't requested them to.
6. Liberating Tikrit without the backing of coalition airstrikes will put Iraq's security forces to the ultimate battle-readiness test.
7. Iran has long been influential in Iraq, but never so much so as over the past year, when the Iraqi military collapsed in the face of the Sunni extremists' onslaught.
8. Embedding coalition advisers and forward air controllers with Iraqi military units presents a twofold challenge: Frontline positions would put their lives in danger and it raises the potential for coalition forces and Iranian soldiers to share a battlefield.
9. The U.S.-led mission has hit a roadblock in its efforts to support the Iraqi government, as both the Iraqi and U.S. government agree that airstrikes have pushed the militants back but there will come a point where airstrikes alone will not be enough.
10. Most of the battlefield successes in Iraq have been coordinated efforts, with Iraqi and Kurdish forces and Shiite militias fighting on the ground and the U.S.-led coalition providing air power.
11. The military operation to retake Mosul is planned for as early as April, but many are skeptical about whether the Iraqi military will be ready for the fight.
12. The failure so far to make headway in Tikrit does not bode well, as Iraqi forces are bogged down on the outskirts of the city, unable to penetrate the extremists' defenses.
13. The Islamic State group has littered major roadways with mines that slow any ground advance and require painstaking clearance operations before troops can safely move through.
14. The battle for Tikrit is likely to involve Iraq's first serious urban warfare challenge, involving street battles that Iraqi security forces are not trained for.
15. Concerns are also mounting over the Shiite militias' battlefield conduct in a largely Sunni region where some residents are said to have initially welcomed the Islamic State militants as a better alternative to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.
16. Winning over the Sunni tribes is essential because they know the terrain of the Sunni-majority areas under Islamic State control and can fight with and advise the Shiite fighters.
17. Heavy Iranian involvement only threatens to exacerbate sectarian tensions.

4. American delegate Henry Cabot Lodge referred to the 1950 Tripartite Declaration by the United States, Britain, and France and to a public statement made by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that should these three powers find that any of the Middle East states was preparing to violate frontiers or armistice lines, the “Big Three” would immediately take action both within and outside the United Nations to prevent such a violation.

5. For example, no country reported that General Qassem Suleimani, commander of the elite Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, violated a UN-mandated travel ban despite “a number of media reports with photographs and videos” showing him in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
6. The report included examples of such photos.
7. One country that was not named also reported that Iran tried to import a nuclear compressor illegally.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decried an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program hundreds of times.
2. The agreement finalized Tuesday morning in Vienna will relieve Iran of crippling international sanctions in return for Iran limiting its uranium enrichment, ridding most of its stockpile of enriched uranium and submitting to agreed-upon inspections of its nuclear facilities.
3. The deal stipulates that Iran freeze and store — but not dismantle — much of its nuclear infrastructure, and requires inspectors to request access to some Iranian facilities before entering.
4. Sanctions are set to be lifted once Iran fulfills its commitments to deactivate centrifuges, restructure its nuclear facilities and transfer or dilute its uranium stockpile.
5. Sanctions could be restored within 65 days if a committee of representatives from world powers and Iran determines that Iran has violated the agreement.
6. Portions of the accord will expire between 10 and 25 years from the date the accord is adopted.
7. The United Nations Security Council is expected to endorse the accord in a resolution.
8. Netanyahu has made opposing Iran’s nuclear program the defining issue of his premiership, and has consistently criticized the potential agreement since negotiations began in 2013.
9. The agreement also was criticized by Israeli opposition leaders, and the Israeli public has long been skeptical of a deal.
10. The only thing standing in the way of the deal’s implementation now is a vote in Congress.
11. Senators and congressmen will have two months to parse the deal’s details, and will vote to accept or reject it when Congress reconvenes in September.
12. Obama has promised to veto a rejection, and overriding that veto would require a two-thirds majority in both houses.
13. Israel will need to build a broad coalition of the deal’s opponents — including former members of the Obama administration — if it is to convince enough lawmakers to reject the deal.
14. Republicans have staunchly opposed a deal.
15. Some experts said that Netanyahu’s March speech before Congress damaged the effort to fight the deal by forcing Democratic members of Congress to choose between backing Israel and supporting Obama.
16. Should the effort in Congress fail, some Israeli politicians have declared that there’s only one avenue left to prevent a nuclear Iran: a military strike.
17. Experts have assessed that an Israeli strike on Iran would not be able to destroy its nuclear program.
18. A strike has grown more likely, as the deal has left Iran with the capability to enrich uranium, giving it the ability to produce a bomb.

13. Israel will need to build a broad coalition of the deal’s opponents — including former members of the Obama administration — if it is to convince enough lawmakers to reject the deal.
14. Republicans have staunchly opposed a deal.
15. Some experts said that Netanyahu’s March speech before Congress damaged the effort to fight the deal by forcing Democratic members of Congress to choose between backing Israel and supporting Obama.
16. Should the effort in Congress fail, some Israeli politicians have declared that there’s only one avenue left to prevent a nuclear Iran: a military strike.
17. Experts have assessed that an Israeli strike on Iran would not be able to destroy its nuclear program.
18. A strike has grown more likely, as the deal has left Iran with the capability to enrich uranium, giving it the ability to produce a bomb.

3. The agreement would have been better without its inspections regime, Steinitz said.
4. The complicated mechanism created by the agreement to regulate the inspection of hitherto undisclosed military sites gives Iran about a month to hide any wrongdoing.
5. If Western or Israeli intelligence agencies produce evidence of an Iranian violation at any given undeclared location, inspectors will not be able to conduct surprise visits.
6. It will take at least 24 days until the Iranians have to grant the IAEA access to any suspect site.
7. The fact that the Iranians have about a month before inspectors can enter a site suspected to host violations will actually embolden them to cheat.
8. The international community will no longer be able to use indications of Iranian illicit nuclear projects against them, but will have to submit all evidence to the Iranians and give them enough time to clear their tracks.
9. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the agreement's inspections regime "absurd," echoing Steinitz's arguments.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Olli Heinonen, the former deputy director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the recently-signed nuclear deal’s provision allowing Iran more than three weeks notice before accepting international inspectors will help the country cheat in its nuclear obligations.
2. Iran has signed an IAEA additional protocol permitting short-notice inspections but is delaying ratification for eight years.
3. Components for nuclear bombs or warheads can be put together in a relatively small space, some 239 square yards in size.
4. With a dispute settlement process that gives the Iranians 24 days before allowing inspectors in, hiding nuclear arms development work will be made easier.
5. The West will be able to monitor larger Iranian facilities, but smaller ones could escape detection.
6. Certain activities would leave traces that would be detectable even after Iran cleaned up, but many activities could be effectively hidden once a location was sanitized.
7. Iran delayed IAEA inspectors’ access for several months in 2003; and renovated the Kelaya electric company building in the interim. By the time Iran allowed inspectors in, there were traces of enriched uranium at the facility, but not at the site that had been sanitized.
8. William Tobey, a nuclear nonproliferation expert, wrote earlier this week that process for gaining access to a suspected nuclear site may actually take longer than 24 days due to imprecision in the language of the deal.

The image is a satellite photo of the Parchin military base in Iran. The photo shows two buildings, one of which is labeled as "building suspected to contain high explosive testing chamber". The other building is labeled as "base of demolished building". There are also several other buildings and structures visible in the image.

The news article is about the Iran nuclear deal. The article discusses the fact that Iran will be allowed to take its own samples from the Parchin military base and do its own testing of the site. This is despite the fact that the IAEA has repeatedly requested to inspect the site, and has warned that Iran is conducting nuclear weapons testing there.

The image is relevant to the news article because it shows the Parchin military base, which is the subject of the article. The image also shows some of the buildings and structures that are mentioned in the article.

1. IAEA inspectors will be given access to suspicious sites only after 24 days' notice, which can be used to remove evidence.
2. Iran has the chance to propose “alternative means” to address IAEA suspicions, which will stretch the period.
3. Former Iraq weapons inspector Charles Duelfer said Iran can hide material in a few hours, allowing room for Iran to maneuver and potentially hide much of what it is doing regarding weapons design or component testing.
4. Secretary Perry is not aware of the recently disclosed secret side deals to the Iran nuclear agreement concluded between the IAEA and Iran.
5. US Senator Tom Cotton and Congressmen Mike Pompeo were told that the secret side deals will not be shared with other nations, with Congress, nor with the U.S. public.
6. One of these side deals concerns inspection of the Parchin military base which the IAEA has not been allowed to visit and where it is believed Iran has conducted nuclear-warhead tests.
7. The other concerns how the IAEA and Iran will resolve outstanding issues on possible military dimensions (PMDs) of Iran’s past nuclear program which Iran has consistently refused to divulge over the years.

4. The OU will withhold or rescind its kosher certification if a food producer refuses to accept such inspection rules or violates them.
5. President Obama has asserted that the Deal’s inspection regime is sufficient because Uranium and other nuclear materials have a half-life of eons and can be detected with sophisticated sensors even if removed, but this argument assumes all work related to a nuclear weapons program involves nuclear materials, which it does not.
6. The Obama Administration and its five negotiating partners should have rejected the agreement on the basis of insufficient inspection, and the U.S. Congress should vote to disapprove the Deal on this basis in the next 60 days.

2. The agreement diverges from normal inspection procedures between the IAEA and a member country by essentially ceding the agency’s investigative authority to Iran.
3. Iran has consistently refused to allow a significant investigation of Parchin, despite repeated requests by the international community to disclose the full extent of its past nuclear work, including any possible military dimensions (PMD).
4. The IAEA seeks to establish the scope of Iran’s overall atomic program, including in those three more specific areas of uranium work, plutonium work, and ballistic missile work.
5. Full Iranian disclosure is considered a minimum to establishing a robust verification regime.
6. PMD-related transparency is seen as not just another issue but as a prerequisite to verifying Iranian compliance across all issues.
7. A former CIA analyst, Fred Fleitz, responded to the news that Iran would be allowed to provide International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors with environmental samples from suspected nuclear sites by calling the agreement a “dangerous farce,” and arguing that, without “unfettered” access for inspectors, Iran would be able to clean up suspected nuclear sites.
8. Earlier this month, satellite imagery showed that Iran was further sanitizing Parchin.
9. David Albright, a former weapons inspector and head of the Institute for Science and International Security, wrote that the P5+1 powers’ failure to insist that Iran account for its past nuclear work will “make a mockery of the nuclear deal.”

1. The State Department denied the UN atomic watchdog agreed to let Iran inspect its own nuclear facilities, rejecting revelations of a secret side deal between the Islamic Republic and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
2. The Associated Press reported on a previously undisclosed side deal between Iran and the IAEA that would allow Tehran to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it has been accused of using to develop nuclear arms at least a decade ago.
3. State Department spokesman John Kirby dismissed the report, saying in “no way” would the UN nuclear agency cede its oversight to Iran.
4. Olli Heinonen, in charge of the Iran investigation as IAEA deputy director general from 2005 through 2010, said he could think of no similar arrangement — a country essentially allowed to carry out much of the probe of suspicions against it.
5. Republican lawmakers have been severely critical of the broader agreement to limit Iran’s future nuclear programs, signed by the Obama administration, Iran and five world powers in July.
6. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi questioned the significance of the disclosure, noting it relates to investigations of past military work, not nuclear dealings going forward.
7. Pelosi asserted that House Democrats have the votes to uphold any Obama veto of a congressional resolution disapproving of the Iran agreement.
8. The director general of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, defended the agreement the agency reached with Iran concerning the Parchin military site, saying the arrangements are technically sound and consistent with long-established practices.
9. Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman of Iran’s nuclear agency, called the AP report “media speculation” without denying its substance.
10. The document seen by the AP is a draft that one official familiar with its contents said doesn’t differ substantially from the final version.
11. The document suggests that instead of carrying out their own probe, IAEA staff will monitor Iranian personnel as they inspect the Parchin nuclear site.

5. The Obama administration is facing stiff opposition to the agreement but is nonetheless notching victories among Democrats who could provide critical votes.

8. Critics also warn that the agreement sets the stage for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon when many of the terms of the deal run out in 10 to 15 years, and that it stays silent on Iran’s other contested actions, such as the support for terror groups.

The deal was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The deal was controversial and was opposed by some members of the U.S. Congress. The deal was also opposed by the government of Israel.

The sub-events of news article:
1. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is conducting a campaign against the nuclear deal with Iran, hoping to defy Capitol Hill arithmetic and inspire enough American lawmakers to thwart it.
2. Netanyahu has good reasons to be skeptical about the accord six world powers signed with Iran last month, fearing the cementing of the ayatollahs’ regime, increased terrorism, the establishment of Iran as a regional power, and perhaps even mushroom clouds over Israel.
3. Netanyahu's relentless and vociferous lobbying against the deal is causing severe climate change in the already-not-so-warm ties between Washington and Jerusalem.
4. The US administration was, is and will remain willing to provide Israel with military assistance, and has even pledged to be more generous than usual because of the Iran deal.
5. Israel’s aggressive lobbying, which includes speaking to US lawmakers about a “moral duty” to oppose the deal, is proving corrosive.
6. US President Barack Obama has openly criticized the Israeli government’s “unprecedented” effort to scuttle the deal, but insists that it will go unpunished.
7. Talks about upgrading Israel’s military capabilities are conducted by human beings, not robots. Israel’s interlocutors in the Pentagon will naturally not be as well-disposed toward the Jewish state as they would have been had Jerusalem not been fighting a bitter campaign seeking to kill the president’s most important foreign policy initiative.
8. Netanyahu believes that his public fight with the administration will lead Democrats to want to “mend fences with Jewish voters,” especially ahead of the 2016 presidential elections, and press the government to be especially generous to Israel when it finally discusses an increase in US military aid.
9. Netanyahu’s confrontation with the White House and his call on American Jews to oppose the deal is liable to have at least two other undesired side effects: turning support for Israel into a partisan issue and leading to serious rifts in the American Jewish community.

4. The deal will not subject Iran to a comprehensive inspections structure, allowing the regime to violate the agreement and develop a covert nuclear program.
5. The deal will lift key arms embargos, giving Iran international legitimacy to arm terror groups with conventional weapons and ballistic missiles in eight years.
6. The agreement entitles Iran to develop advanced centrifuges after 10 years, paving the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons with virtually zero "breakout time."

The people in the front row include the US Secretary of State, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the foreign ministers of Iran, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, China, and Russia.
