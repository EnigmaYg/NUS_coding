News article:
(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) Oman will open its embassy in the Israeli-occupied West Bank according to the country's foreign ministry's statement on Wednesday on Twitter. "In continuation to Oman authority's support to the brotherly Palestinian people, it has decreed to open a new diplomatic mission in Palestine at the level of the embassy," the ministry said. A delegation from the ministry of foreign affairs will head directly to Ramallah to initiate the required procedures, the ministry added. Oman's decision came during the second and last day of the United States-hosted conference in Bahrain which the US said, aims to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and encourage investing in the Gaza strip and the West Bank. The US has revealed the economic part of its Mideast peace plan or what widely become known as 'deal of the century.' Oman has not publicly revealed or confirmed if it is attending the conference or not. Several Arab and foreign investors are invited to attend the conference. Earlier in February 2018, Oman's State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, visited Al-Aqsa Mosque in a rare public visit of an Arab official to the Occupied Territories. The Manama conference has been held on Tuesday, Wednesday 25-26 June and led by the US President Donald Trump's son-in-law and Senior Adviser, Jared Kushner. The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the conference and previously declared that it will not accept any settlement which does not include an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are participating in the US economic workshop. For Egypt, an official economic delegation from the ministry of finance will attend the conference 'to hear out the propositions,' a high-ranking Egyptian official told Daily News Egypt on condition of anonymity. Managing Director and Chairperson of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, World Bank Group President, David Malpass, and FIFA President, Gianni Infantino also attended the event. Kushner announced that the 'deal of the century' will include $50bn in investments in the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon in its first phase. Out of the total amount, $13.38bn would be grants, $25.689bn would be subsidised loans, and $11.6bn would be private investments.

News article:
The US-organised economic workshop in Bahrain failed to deliver tangible results over the long-awaited Middle East peace plan but it opened the door for closer Israeli-Gulf ties, analysts say. Despite this, the normalisation of ties between the Gulf oil monarchies and the Jewish state -- staunch US allies who have common concerns over Iran -- remains unlikely without progress in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they say. In an unprecedented interview of a senior Gulf official by an Israeli journalist, Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa said on the sidelines of the two-day workshop in Manama that Israel is part of the region's heritage. "Israel is part of this heritage of this whole region, historically, so the Jewish people have a place amongst us," he said in the interview broadcast late Wednesday on Israel's Channel 13 television. Sheikh Khalid, a member of the ruling family of the tiny state, called in a separate interview with the Times of Israel for improved relations with Israel, but reiterated his country's commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative. Neil Partrick, a London-based Middle East analyst, said the Bahraini foreign minister's comments "will be the main achievement" of the workshop "as far as the US and Israel are concerned". Meanwhile, an Israeli journalist published on her Twitter account an interview with prominent UAE businessman Mohammed Alabbar, who was among a group of business leaders who attended the Bahrain workshop. "Young people and our children... want to live a life that has hope and optimism and a better future," Alabbar, chief of real estate giant Emaar Properties, told the journalist when asked what message he wants to send Israeli audiences. - 'Clear' message - After getting special permission, a handful of Israeli journalists attended the conference in Bahrain, with which their country has no diplomatic relations -- like all Arab countries excluding Jordan and Egypt. "Countries such as Bahrain are more willing to float the carrot of overt engagement, but I think it would be highly premature to expect anything beyond flirtation without meaningful change on the ground," said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group think-tank. "The Gulf message is actually somewhat clear in my view: Israel could be a useful, stable ally in a volatile region -- but only if there is an agreement with the Palestinians," she told AFP. In recent years Israel has been courting Arab nations which do not recognise the Jewish state, and in October Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held surprise talks in Muscat with the ruler of Oman. These efforts at rapprochement came as Iran -- the arch-foe of Israel and regional rival Saudi Arabia -- was bolstering its influence in several Arab countries. US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, launched the long-awaited Middle East initiative at the conference, which the Palestinian Authority boycotted over fears it sought to buy off the Palestinians and deprive them of an independent state. - Normalisation 'some way off' - Partrick said it remained unlikely the conference in Bahrain "will lead directly to full diplomatic relations with Israel without the Palestinian leadership backing the final and political 'deal'". He said the "full and proper political normalisation with Israel is still some way off", especially after the United States recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017. According to the International Crisis Group, normalisation of ties between Arab countries and Israel still depends on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "If the Bahrain workshop secures a place in future history books, it will be for exposing the limits of Arab-Israeli rapprochement," it said in a report on Wednesday. It underlines that "Israel's overt acceptance in the region requires it to resolve its conflict with the Palestinians," it said. The Palestinians have boycotted the US administration since Trump broke with decades of consensus by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city last year. US officials have hinted the political part of the Middle East plan -- which could come out later this year -- will not mention the creation of an independent Palestinian state, a goal of decades of US diplomacy.

News article:
The head of the Mossad intelligence service said Monday that Israel was renewing ties with Oman. “Just recently, renewal of formal relations with Oman was declared and the establishment of a representative office of the foreign ministry in that country,” Yossi Cohen said at the Herzliya Conference, hosted by the Interdisciplinary Center this week. “That is only the visible tip of a much broader secret effort,” he said, adding that in addition to Israel’s historic treaties with Jordan and Egypt, other Arab countries had discreetly joined “the states of peace, some of them in an unseen manner.” “We do not yet have with them official peace treaties but there is already a communality of interests, broad cooperation and open channels of communication,” he added. Israel and Oman agreed to open trade representative offices in the 1990s, but in 2000 the Gulf sultanate closed them after the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Israel’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on Cohen’s remarks. In October, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held surprise talks with Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Muscat. The recent moves have raised Palestinian fears of a normalization of ties. Advertisement Last week Oman said it would open an embassy in the Palestinian territories in support of the Palestinian people, in a first for a Gulf state. The announcement was greeted warily by senior Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi, who warned Oman against using the new embassy as a step towards establishing formal relations with Israel. “If this has a political price attached then certainly there will be ramifications,” she said. Mutual concerns about Shiite Iran have lately highlighted common interests between some Arab countries and Israel. In an unprecedented step, a handful of Israeli journalists invited by the White House flew openly to Bahrain last week for a US-sponsored workshop unveiling economic planks of a broader plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace. The Gulf state has no diplomatic relations with Israel. Advertisement On Monday Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement that Foreign Minister Israel Katz had visited Abu Dhabi for a UN climate conference, where he met United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and an unnamed “high ranking UAE official.” “I shall continue to work together with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to advance the normalization policy,” Katz posted on Facebook. That policy, he wrote, was based on “Israel’s capabilities in the areas of security and intelligence and also in various civilian fields.” The United Arab Emirates do not have formal diplomatic ties with the Jewish state but Culture Minister Miri Regev paid a visit to Abu Dhabi in October. The statement did not say when Katz was there but described his visit as the first by a senior Israeli minister since the Bahrain conference. In his Monday speech, Cohen said that a potentially one-time-only window of opportunity had opened for Israel to achieve a regional peace agreement in light of shared opposition to Iran and Islamist terror groups, as well as improved ties with the US and Russia. “The Mossad has identified at this time a rare opportunity — perhaps the first in the history of the Middle East — to reach a regional understanding that would lead to an inclusive regional peace agreement,” he said. According to the Mossad chief, the opportunity comes from a shared interest with countries throughout the region in fighting Iran and Islamic terror groups, like the Islamic State, and from the close relations with the White House and the Kremlin. Advertisement “This creates a window of opportunity that is perhaps one-time-only,” he said. Cohen in his speech accused the Iranian government of being behind a number of strikes on oil facilities and ships in the Persian Gulf in recent months, as well as an attack on the Bahraini embassy in Baghdad last week. “I say to you, with certainty, based on the best sources of both Israeli and Western espionage, that Iran is behind these attacks. They were approved by Iranian leadership and carried out, in large part, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its proxies,” he said. He accused Tehran of trying “to start a fire” in in the Middle East. The Mossad chief warned that Iran was extending the range of its activities and had established a 300-person cell inside Africa for that purpose. Cohen also noted that Iran has been accused of conducting and planning a number of terrorist activities inside Europe in recent years. In an apparent reference to reported Israeli strikes on Iranian targets in Syria early Monday, the head of the Mossad said Israel was not interested in a conflict with its neighbor. According to Cohen, Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Syria have started transferring their forces farther from the border with Israel in a bid to avoid further strikes by the Israeli military. “Iran and Hezbollah are asking to move their bases to northern Syria, an area that they mistakenly believe will be difficult for us to reach. In addition, they are establishing bases and precision missile factories in Iraq, to the east, and Lebanon, to the west,” he said. Israel has for years warned that Iran and Hezbollah were attempting to establish factories in Lebanon to produce precision-guided missiles, which would present a far greater threat to Israel than the less advanced projectiles that currently fill the terror group’s arsenals.

News article:
Israel is renewing formal relations with Oman and plans to open a diplomatic mission in the Sultanate, Yossi Cohen, the head of Israel's intelligence agency Mossad, has claimed. Speaking at a conference yesterday in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, Cohen claimed that "just recently, renewal of formal relations with Oman was declared and the establishment of a representative office of the foreign ministry in that country". He added that the move "is only the visible tip of a much broader secret effort," presumably referring to Israel's efforts to normalise relations with Arab and Muslim states. Cohen claimed that though "we [Israel] do not yet have with [other Arab states] official peace treaties, […] there is already a communality of interests, broad cooperation and open channels of communication". Israel's Foreign Ministry has declined to comment on Cohen's remarks, the Times of Israel reported. Likewise Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – who has long sought to emphasise Israel's normalisation drive – has not commented on the renewal of ties. Cohen also spoke of "a rare opportunity — perhaps the first in the history of the Middle East — to reach a regional understanding that would lead to an inclusive regional peace agreement". He pointed to Israel and many Gulf states' shared goal of countering Iranian influence in the region, and claimed with "certainty" that Iran was responsible for a number of recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Though the US and Saudi Arabia have accused Iran of orchestrating the attacks, Iran has vehemently denied these claims. The UAE has also softened its accusations against Iran, claiming there is "insufficient information" to hold Iran accountable. READ: Israel foreign minister visits Abu Dhabi Cohen's claims come less than a week after Oman announced that it would open a diplomatic mission to the Palestinians in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank. Oman's Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a tweet that "in continuation of the Sultanate's support for the Palestinian people, the Sultanate has decided to open a new diplomatic mission to the State of Palestine at the level of an embassy". The ministry also said that a delegation "will travel to Ramallah to initiate the opening of the embassy," without providing further details or a timescale. Oman's announcement was made against the backdrop of last week's "Peace to Prosperity" conference in the Bahraini capital Manama, during which the economic aspects of the long-awaited "deal of the century" were discussed. The majority of Gulf states attended the conference, despite the Palestinian factions' appeal for Arab countries to boycott the summit. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has since arrested – and subsequently released – a Palestinian businessman who attended the conference, while the besieged Gaza Strip witnessed mass protests condemning Arab states' participation in the summit. Other Arab countries, including Morocco and Iraq, also saw widespread protests. READ: Hamas condemns Bahrain minister's comments on Israel Oman has come under scrutiny in the past for normalising relations with Israel. In the 1990s, Israel and Oman agreed to open trade representative offices in their respective countries, but these were closed in 2000 after the outbreak of the Second Intifada. In December 2018, Netanyahu made a landmark visit to the Sultanate and met with Oman's Sultan Qaboos Bin Said. Netanyahu subsequently boasted that, during the meeting, Bin Said had granted permission for Israel's flag carrier airline El Al to fly over Omani airspace. "Therefore, only one small thing remains for us to do," Netanyahu told journalists as he pointed to Saudi Arabia on a map. Without similar permission from the Saudis, Muscat's promise was seen as worthless, as the Sultanate borders states with no diplomatic ties to Israel. Oman's Foreign Minister has since tried to downplay his country's relations with Israel, in February reiterating the Sultanate's commitment to the two-state solution and "a peaceful process to find a settlement for the Palestinian cause that guarantees their rights and the interests of all".

News article:
The Israeli Foreign Ministry has not commented on the Mossad chief’s remarks yet. This comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Oman in late October 2018 to discuss “a number of issues of mutual interest to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East”, according to a joint statement by Netanyahu and Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Netanyahu’s Office, in turn, described the one-day visit as “a significant step in implementing the policy outlined by Prime Minister Netanyahu on deepening relations with the states of the region while leveraging Israel's advantages in security, technology and economic matters”. Muscat and Tel Aviv have no diplomatic relations, and the last Israeli leader to visit Oman was then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres in 1996. After the two countries agreed on opening bilateral trade representative offices in the 1990s, the second Palestinian intifada, which started in 2000, prompted the Gulf sultanate to close them. In mid-March 2019, Netanyahu revealed that Tel Aviv had developed ties with 6 states in the region despite their animosity towards Israel over the past decades. "We are doing this with large parts of the Arab and Muslim world through an accelerated process of normalisation […] These days Israel is making contact with half a dozen important Arab and Muslim nations, which were, until recently, hostile to Israel,” he said. Apart from Egypt and Jordan, most Arab and Muslim states in the region do not recognise Israel and deny it the right to exist, something that is mainly attributed to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which remains unresolved.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry has not commented on the Mossad chief’s remarks yet. This comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Oman in late October 2018 to discuss “a number of issues of mutual interest to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East”, according to a joint statement by Netanyahu and Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Netanyahu’s Office, in turn, described the one-day visit as “a significant step in implementing the policy outlined by Prime Minister Netanyahu on deepening relations with the states of the region while leveraging Israel's advantages in security, technology and economic matters”. Muscat and Tel Aviv have no diplomatic relations, and the last Israeli leader to visit Oman was then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres in 1996. After the two countries agreed on opening bilateral trade representative offices in the 1990s, the second Palestinian intifada, which started in 2000, prompted the Gulf sultanate to close them. In mid-March 2019, Netanyahu revealed that Tel Aviv had developed ties with 6 states in the region despite their animosity towards Israel over the past decades. "We are doing this with large parts of the Arab and Muslim world through an accelerated process of normalisation […] These days Israel is making contact with half a dozen important Arab and Muslim nations, which were, until recently, hostile to Israel,” he said. Apart from Egypt and Jordan, most Arab and Muslim states in the region do not recognise Israel and deny it the right to exist, something that is mainly attributed to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which remains unresolved. However, various media reports have suggested that Tel Aviv is holding non-official talks with many of these states.

US special Middle East peace envoy Jason Greenblatt on Tuesday published an Arabic version of the Trump administration’s economic proposal for the Palestinians, a key element of its vision for peace with Israel. The so-called “Peace to Prosperity” document was published by the White House last month, ahead of a June 25-26 economic workshop on the proposal held in Bahrain last week. But despite the fact that US officials repeatedly asserted the plan would benefit the Palestinian people, it was only released in English. The Palestinian Authority boycotted the Bahrain conference, which was initiated by US President Donald Trump’s special adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. “While Palestinian leadership boycotted and tried (unsuccessfully) to undermine our workshop, Palestinians and the region deserve a chance to judge our economic plan for themselves,” Greenblatt tweeted Tuesday. “I’m pleased to share our Peace to Prosperity vision in Arabic!” He included a link to the document on the White House website. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The plan, whose English version Kushner said during a panel in Bahrain had been downloaded half a million times, calls for $50 billion in investment over 10 years in the Palestinian territories and Israel’s Arab neighbors. Listing a slew of projects to develop roads, border crossings, power generation and tourism, the US framework sets an optimistic goal of creating a million Palestinian jobs. The Trump administration has, however, hinted that its political plan for peace — due later in the year — will not mention a Palestinian state, abandoning longstanding US policy. Advertisement The Palestinian Authority and its rival Hamas have both denounced the economic initiative, saying it amounts to a bid by the administration to buy off their aspirations for an independent state. The PA says that Kushner’s plan is a pretext by a pro-Israel Trump administration to impose a political solution that it says will adopt Israel’s positions on solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel supported the conference and, in unprecedented scenes, Israeli academics and journalists openly traveled to Bahrain despite the lack of diplomatic relations. No Israeli officials were invited to attend. The PA has boycotted the Trump administration since December 2017, when the US president officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Washington has also halted aid to the Palestinians, pressuring them to resume peace negotiations with Israel. In 2018 Kushner appealed directly to the Palestinian people, urging them to not let their “scared” leadership reject the still-unpublished peace plan. The interview he gave with the East Jerusalem-based Al Quds newspaper was seen as an attempt by the Trump administration to reach out to the Palestinian people, despite the official boycott.

News article:
Discussions of last week’s Bahrain conference has stressed the point that the conference was designed to deal only with economic issues. It was to be followed by a conference that would be attended by representatives of Israel and the Palestinian Authority at which the political issues would be discussed and, hopefully, a peace agreement would be reached. What appears to have been overlooked is that the Bahrain conference directly addressed the most important political issue in the Israeli/Palestinian dispute, an issue that must be resolved if peace is to be attained: the Palestinian claim of a “right of return.” That is the claim that calls for the mass migration to Israel from the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria of about 40,000 surviving Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 Arab wars against Israel plus about 5,500,000 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of Palestinian refugees. All of them are now served by the UN Relief and Works Agency, which keeps them classified as Palestinian refugees, who are deliberately segregated from other members of the Arab communities among which they live. Their mass migration to Israel would end Israel as a majority-Jewish state and thus end the existence of the State of Israel. The claim of a “right of return” is thus designed to attain the long-term objective of the anti-Zionists: the end of a Jewish state in the Middle East. The goal of the Bahrain conference was to make a major initial contribution to the cause of peace. That would be done by providing significant help for the economic development of the above-mentioned five political entities, West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. New job opportunities would be created through investments, totaling $50 billion, that would help all their residents, including the “Palestinian refugees,” who would become fully integrated into the communities in which they have lived for all or most of their lives. Mahmoud Abbas and his colleagues in the Palestinian Authority leadership have rejected the proposed assistance program. They have made it clear that they are not interested in a program designed to provide a better life for the millions of Palestinians who are classified as “refugees” if it means giving up their plan to end the existence of the majority-Jewish state through mass immigration. On the other hand, it appears that the leadership of some Arab states and also some Palestinian businessmen are sympathetic to the Bahrain conference proposals and are indeed prepared to accept the existence of the State of Israel in the Middle East. The question that is open now is whether these supporters of economic progress will be prepared to assert themselves in the period ahead, help keep the basic concept of a two-state solution alive and ultimately lead to its implementation. We’ll have to wait a while and see whether the Bahrain conference does have such positive results. What is clear, however, is that there is no point to entering into a discussion now of borders, the status of East Jerusalem, and other political issues, if the Palestinian Authority continues to insist on its claim of a “right of return.” It should be quite obvious that no government of Israel will sign a peace agreement that embodies a program to end Israel’s existence as a State. It so happens that in the Camp David negotiations of 2000, in which Prime Minister Barak and PLO leader Arafat represented the two sides, President Clinton, in his “Clinton Parameters,” came up with a similar proposal for the “right of return” issue, a proposal which also called for a program of substantial financial assistance to the “Palestinian refugees.” The Parameters made it clear that the proposed peace agreement would not compel Israel to accept Palestinian immigrants based on the “right of return,” but that President Clinton would help get the cooperation of a number of countries throughout the world that would accept Palestinian refugees as immigrants and that he would seek to raise the billions needed to resettle the migrants. As we know, Arafat did not accept the Clinton proposal, which would indeed have provided the two-state solution. In analyzing the problem that we continue to face in any effort to attain an Israeli/Palestinian peace, we need to note that it was close to a hundred years ago that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini developed the ideology of most emphatic rejection of Jewish migration to the Palestinian Mandate. The State of Israel has now been in existence for 71 years, but the Palestinian leadership continues to adhere to al-Husseini’s ideology: no Jewish-majority state. As we in AJIRI have noted, this outlook, which rejects peace, is supported by the UN General Assembly through its annual enactment of the resolutions that extend the mandates of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) and the Division for Palestinian Rights (DPR). CEIRPP and DPR are committed to advancing the Palestinian claim of a “right of return.” How, indeed, can we expect the Palestinian leadership to give up a claim that the UNGA endorses year after year? What the outcome of last week’s Bahrain conference demonstrates is that it is critically important for all relevant decision makers on the international scene to understand that to attain an Israeli/Palestinian peace we need a Palestinian leadership that accepts the existence of the State of Israel and gives up the idea of ending Israel’s existence through a large-scale population transfer. Votes against the CEIRPP and DPR would play an important role in achieving that result. That would be an important step forward in realizing the promise of the Bahrain conference.

News article:
Oman's Sultan Qaboos received Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in October 2018 Oman said Wednesday that it will open an embassy in the Palestinian territories in support of the Palestinian people, in a first for a Gulf Arab state. The announcement coincided with a US-led economic workshop in Bahrain to unveil a Middle East peace plan which is not expected to recognise an independent Palestinian state. "In continuation of Oman's support for the Palestinian people, the Sultanate of Oman has decided to open a diplomatic mission at the level of embassy in the State of Palestine," the foreign ministry said on Twitter. A delegation from the ministry will travel to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, to take the necessary measures to open the embassy, it said. The announcement was cautiously welcomed by a senior Palestinian official. "We think maybe first of all it will help us educate the Omani government as to the real nature of the occupation and also working with Palestine directly," Hanan Ashrawi told journalists. But she warned Oman against using the new embassy as a step towards establishing formal relations with Israel. "If this has a political price attached then certainly there will be ramifications," she said. In Muscat, the Palestinian ambassador to Oman said the opening of an embassy in Ramallah was a "historical decision". "It is an important and indicative step with profound implications, especially at this time, as the Palestinian issue passes through a critical stage," Tayseer Farhat told AFP. "This step represents political and moral support." Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries to have established diplomatic ties with the Jewish state. But Oman was the first Gulf state to receive Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in October 2018. A US ally bordering Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Oman has frequently served as a mediator in the Arab world. - Diplomatic role - Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank, believes the step by Oman will enhance its diplomatic role. "The good offices of Omani diplomacy have averted regional crises in the past and would be welcome in the Israel-Palestine context," Dickinson told AFP. "Muscat is one of the few remaining regional powers that can truly talk to all sides -- a vitally important role in a moment of such heightened regional tension," she said. Oman is not participating in the Bahrain workshop, where US President Donald Trump's administration hopes to raise $50 billion of investments to improve the economic conditions of Palestinians. The conference is boycotted by the Palestinian Authority, which fears the US administration is dangling money to impose pro-Israeli political solutions. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, is leading the "Peace to Prosperity" initiative which he called the "Opportunity of the Century" for the Palestinians. But Kushner, a staunch supporter of Israel, said the Palestinians needed to accept the economic framework before any eventual progress on reaching a long-elusive comprehensive peace deal. Last year, Oman's state minister for foreign affairs, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, held talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah. He also made a rare visit by an Arab official to the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque complex in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. "Now Oman will have a direct presence in Ramallah. Muscat has an uncanny ability to see a middle road when most others are picking sides," Dickinson said. Muscat has previously mediated in regional disputes including US-Iranian tensions and in the conflict in Yemen.

JERUSALEM: Israel´s foreign ministry said Sunday the country will this week host six journalists from Arab countries including, for the first time, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The visit comes as Israel seeks to improve ties with Gulf Arab countries, with which it has no formal diplomatic relations. Those states have resisted offering Israel formal recognition due to its continuing occupation of Palestinian territory, but their relations have warmed of late, largely due to common concerns over Iran. The journalists will visit Jerusalem´s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, parliament and holy sites, among others, the foreign ministry said in a statement. It said it had “the aim of exposing the journalists — some of whom come from countries that do not have diplomatic relations with Israel — to Israeli positions on diplomatic and geopolitical issues”. Jordan is also participating, the ministry said. Jordan is one of only two Arab countries, along with Egypt, that have diplomatic relations with Israel. In another recent sign of a thaw, a group of Israeli journalists attended the US-led economic conference on Israeli-Palestinian peace in the Gulf state of Bahrain in late June.

YERUSHALAYIM (AP/Hamodia) — Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz told a closed-door session of the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday that Israel is taking part in a maritime intelligence and security mission in the Gulf aimed at protecting commercial shipping from Iranian seizures. Katz also reportedly welcomed Britain’s announcement Monday that it would also join the U.S.-led operation, making it the only country so far to officially agree to do so. It was not immediately clear whether Israel will contribute naval vessels to the mission. The Kan public broadcaster last month said that Israel would furnish intelligence but not ships. The disclosure was made during testimony in which Katz said that he recently met with a “high ranking persona” from the United Arab Emirates to improve ties between Israel and Arab states. Katz told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday that the two reached “substantial agreements,” adding that he was working toward “transparent normalization and signed agreements” with Gulf states. He added: “We do not have a conflict with them.” “My goal, with the full backing of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, is to work toward an overt normalization, to extend it and turn it public, and to get to the signing of diplomatic [peace] agreements with the Gulf states. This is the challenge; this is the goal,” he said, mentioning a timetable of a few years. Katz visited the UAE for a U.N. conference earlier this year. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said he met with a senior UAE official there. Netanyahu visited Oman last year.

News article:
The US wants to step up international naval patrols to protect shipping in the Arabian Gulf after warships were forced to escort a UK-flagged tanker this week to counter the threat of an Iranian attack. Washington wants allies over the coming weeks to send ships to the region to secure commercial shipping and prevent further attacks that could harm the world oil supply. “We’re engaging now with a number of countries to see if we can put together a coalition that would ensure freedom of navigation both in the Straits of Hormuz and the Bab Al Mandeb,” said Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Probably over the next couple of weeks we’ll identify which nations have the political will to support that initiative and then we’ll work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities that will support that.” The announcement came on the same day that US President Donald Trump tweeted that "sanctions will soon be increased, substantially," on Iran. Mr Trump accused Iranian leaders of "secretly enriching'" in breach of the nuclear deal Tehran signed with world powers in 2015. Vessel-tracking agencies showed at least two British warships shadowed the tanker, Pacific Voyager, through the Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday. The military escort followed concerns of a response by Iran after the seizure by British marines last week of a vessel suspected of carrying Iranian crude to Syria. #UPDATE: Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose and minehunter HMS Ramsey currently escorting British oil tanker Pacific Voyager through the Strait of Hormuz pic.twitter.com/pN73aCsSgJ — ELINT News (@ELINTNews) July 9, 2019 Gen Dunford released details of the plan after meetings on Tuesday with acting US Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. This week, a senior Emirati official told The National that the UAE supported a collective, co-ordinated response to protect shipping and counter threats in the Gulf. The official did not refer to a specific plan, such as the one mentioned by Gen Dunford, but said there had been a lot of co-ordination with the US and other allies after the recent tanker attacks. Just over a year ago, the US administration pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal that set strict limits on uranium enrichment and use in exchange for sanctions relief. The White House has placed strict sanctions on Iran since withdrawing from the deal. Tension in the region escalated after four tankers were sabotaged with mines off the coast of Fujairah in May. Less than a month later, two more tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman. The US has blamed Tehran for all attacks. An F/A-18 fighter jet on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, in the Arabian Sea. AP Photo Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have also stepped up drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, a move the US has said was directed by Tehran. Dozens of civilians have been wounded and at least one killed in Yemeni rebel drone attacks on Abha airport in southern Saudi Arabia. Gen Dunford said the US would provide “command and control” ships but other countries should provide craft to patrol waters between the American naval vessels. The third part of the mission would involve coalition members escorting their countries’ commercial vessels, he said. Gen Dunford said the size of the campaign could be adjusted based on the number of countries that committed to it. “So with a small number of contributors we can have a small mission," he said. "And we’ll expand that as the number of nations that are willing to participate identify themselves.” Although oil markets have not reacted to the tension with any major price increases, about 21 million barrels a day pass through the Strait of Hormuz – the chokepoint between the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. That means as much as a fifth of the world’s oil supply could be affected if Iran closed the narrow channel, as it has threatened to do. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday that any disruption to oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz would be a “major obstacle” for his country’s economy. His government was studying contingency plans to deal with possible disruptions, including alternative routes for oil exports, Mr Abdul Mahdi said. The US has repeatedly said that any attempt by Iran to close the Strait would result in a swift military response. US officials said that part of the reaction to the May and June attacks involved co-ordinating closely with regional partners and allies to determine what steps to take next. They had publicly discussed plans to protect the Strait of Hormuz, but Gen Dunford disclosed that the coalition would also seek to bolster security in the Bab Al Mendab off the west coast of Yemen. While no ships in that crucial channel have been hit, Houthi rebels have attacked vessels there. Bab Al Mandeb is only 20 kilometres wide at its narrowest point, The US has deployed military vessels and aircraft to carry out symbolic manoeuvres in contested or tense areas but the USS Abraham Lincoln has stayed away from the Strait of Hormuz. Photo: US Navy Almost 4 million barrels of oil are shipped daily through the strait to Europe, the US and Asia, as well as commercial goods. The channel leads north to the Suez Canal. This week, the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it intercepted an unmanned, bomb-laden vessel used to strike commercial shipping near Bab Al Mandeb. Last year, Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter, stopped shipments through the strait because of a Houthi attack on a tanker. Riyadh resumed them 10 days later. Washington’s plan is largely in line with its often stated aim of protecting the free movement of shipping through international waters. The US has sent military vessels and aircraft to conduct symbolic manoeuvres in contested or tense areas to demonstrate its commitment to free navigation. But the American carrier group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln, which was sent to the Gulf to respond to Iranian threats, has stayed out of the Strait of Hormuz to avoid unnecessary escalation. The group has remained hundreds of kilometres from the vital strait. "You don't want to inadvertently escalate something," Capt Putnam Browne, the commanding officer of the Lincoln, said in June. Iran has repeatedly threatened to hit US vessels. “Our missiles will destroy their aircraft carriers if they make a mistake,” Hossein Nejat, a commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said on Tuesday night. Mr Nejat said the US was “well aware of the consequences of a military confrontation with Iran” and that American bases were within range of Iranian ballistic missiles.

The US wants to step up international naval patrols to protect shipping in the Arabian Gulf after warships were forced to escort a UK-flagged tanker this week to counter the threat of an Iranian attack. Washington wants allies over the coming weeks to send ships to the region to secure commercial shipping and prevent further attacks that could harm the world oil supply. “We’re engaging now with a number of countries to see if we can put together a coalition that would ensure freedom of navigation both in the Straits of Hormuz and the Bab Al Mandeb,” said Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Probably over the next couple of weeks we’ll identify which nations have the political will to support that initiative and then we’ll work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities that will support that.” The announcement came on the same day that US President Donald Trump tweeted that "sanctions will soon be increased, substantially," on Iran. Mr Trump accused Iranian leaders of "secretly enriching'" in breach of the nuclear deal Tehran signed with world powers in 2015. Vessel-tracking agencies showed at least two British warships shadowed the tanker, Pacific Voyager, through the Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday. The military escort followed concerns of a response by Iran after the seizure by British marines last week of a vessel suspected of carrying Iranian crude to Syria. #UPDATE: Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose and minehunter HMS Ramsey currently escorting British oil tanker Pacific Voyager through the Strait of Hormuz pic.twitter.com/pN73aCsSgJ — ELINT News (@ELINTNews) July 9, 2019 Gen Dunford released details of the plan after meetings on Tuesday with acting US Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. This week, a senior Emirati official told The National that the UAE supported a collective, co-ordinated response to protect shipping and counter threats in the Gulf. The official did not refer to a specific plan, such as the one mentioned by Gen Dunford, but said there had been a lot of co-ordination with the US and other allies after the recent tanker attacks. Just over a year ago, the US administration pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal that set strict limits on uranium enrichment and use in exchange for sanctions relief. The White House has placed strict sanctions on Iran since withdrawing from the deal. Tension in the region escalated after four tankers were sabotaged with mines off the coast of Fujairah in May. Less than a month later, two more tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman. The US has blamed Tehran for all attacks.

Gen Dunford said the US would provide “command and control” ships but other countries should provide craft to patrol waters between the American naval vessels. The third part of the mission would involve coalition members escorting their countries’ commercial vessels, he said. Gen Dunford said the size of the campaign could be adjusted based on the number of countries that committed to it. “So with a small number of contributors we can have a small mission," he said. "And we’ll expand that as the number of nations that are willing to participate identify themselves.” Although oil markets have not reacted to the tension with any major price increases, about 21 million barrels a day pass through the Strait of Hormuz – the chokepoint between the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. That means as much as a fifth of the world’s oil supply could be affected if Iran closed the narrow channel, as it has threatened to do. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday that any disruption to oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz would be a “major obstacle” for his country’s economy. His government was studying contingency plans to deal with possible disruptions, including alternative routes for oil exports, Mr Abdul Mahdi said. The US has repeatedly said that any attempt by Iran to close the Strait would result in a swift military response. US officials said that part of the reaction to the May and June attacks involved co-ordinating closely with regional partners and allies to determine what steps to take next. They had publicly discussed plans to protect the Strait of Hormuz, but Gen Dunford disclosed that the coalition would also seek to bolster security in the Bab Al Mendab off the west coast of Yemen.

The United States is pursuing an international coalition to protect strategic waterways between Iran and Yemen, said chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford on Tuesday. “We’re engaging now with a number of countries to see if we can put together a coalition that would ensure freedom of navigation both in the Straits of Hormuz and the Bab al-Mandab,” he said. “And so I think probably over the next couple of weeks, we’ll identify which nations have the political will to support that initiative and then we’ll work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities that’ll support that.” However, Dunford noted that there hasn’t been “any activity against U.S. forces since the downing of the remotely piloted aircraft earlier in June. And so we are watching that very carefully. I think it’s too early to draw our conclusion about the last couple of weeks.” U.S. President Donald Trump decided not to retaliate militarily against Iran for shooting down the drone that was part of a series of recent attacks by the regime in response to the U.S. maximum pressure campaign against Tehran since withdrawing in May 2018 from the 2015 nuclear deal, reimposing sanctions lifted under it, in addition to enacting new financial penalties.

News article:
Washington proposed on July 9 stepping up efforts to safeguard strategic waters off Iran and Yemen where it blames Iran and its proxies for tanker attacks. Iran denies the charges, Reuters reports. But with Washington's allies reluctant to commit new weaponry or fighting forces, a senior Pentagon official told Reuters on Thursday that the United States' aim was not to set up a military coalition but to shine a "flashlight" in the region to deter attacks on commercial shipping. Because of fears of confrontation, any involvement by Washington's allies is likely be limited to naval personnel and equipment already in place – near the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf and the Bab al-Mandab strait in the Red Sea, two Gulf sources and a British security source said. "The Americans want to create an 'alliance of the willing' who confront future attacks," a Western diplomat said. "Nobody wants to be on that confrontational course and part of a US push against Iran." Addressing such concerns or possible misunderstandings, Kathryn Wheelbarger, one of the most senior policy officials at the Pentagon, told Reuters in an interview that the new initiative was "not about military confrontation." READ: Iran says it has seized foreign tanker as Gulf tensions deepen Under Washington's proposal, the United States would provide coordinating ships and lead surveillance efforts while allies would patrol nearby waters and escort commercial vessels with their nation's flags. Iran has said foreign powers should leave securing shipping lanes to Tehran and other countries in the region. France, which has a naval base in the United Arab Emirates, does not plan to escort ships and views the US plan as counterproductive to easing tensions because Tehran would see it as anti-Iran, a French official said. The British security source said it was not viable to escort every commercial vessel, a view shared by several other countries. A senior Western official based in Beijing said there was "no way" China would join a maritime coalition. A South Korean official said Washington had yet to make any official request. A decision by Japan to join such an initiative would be likely to inflame a divide in Japanese public opinion over sending troops abroad. Japan's military has not fought overseas since World War Two. "The Americans have been talking to anyone interested about setting something up, mainly looking to Asia as it's of vital importance to their security of (oil) supply and asking for ships, but it's gone a bit quiet," a Gulf official said. India has deployed two ships in the Gulf to protect Indian-flagged vessels since June 20. Other Asian oil importers are unlikely to have anything but a symbolic presence, such as the involvement of a liaison officer, officials and diplomats said. "It's just impossible. The Strait is already too crowded," an Asian official said of an escort system in the Strait of Hormuz which is 21 miles (33 km) wide at its narrowest point. A second Gulf official said: "We're not going to do anything like that, we are not going to do anything on our own." Rising tension Tensions rose further on Thursday after Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had seized a foreign tanker smuggling fuel. A U.S. military commander in the region said the United States would work "aggressively" to ensure free passage of vessels in and around the Strait of Hormuz. Tension has mounted since US President Donald Trump last year quit a 2015 nuclear pact under which Iran agreed to curtail its atomic programme in return for relief from economic sanctions crippling its economy. France, Britain and Germany, which with Russia and China are party to the agreement, have tried to rescue the deal and defuse tensions. Failure to secure support for the maritime initiative would be a blow to efforts by the United States, and its Sunni Muslim allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to isolate Shi'ite Muslim Iran and Iran-backed forces in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are already patrolling the coastline off Yemen where they are leading a coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, though the UAE has said it is scaling down its presence there. Asked what role Riyadh could play in the US initiative, a Saudi military official said it would be the role that the Saudi-led coalition has been playing for the past few years in the Red Sea as part of the war in Yemen, including escorting and securing commercial shipping. READ: US investigates disappearance of UAE oil tanker in Strait of Hormuz The United States does not want to go it alone. "There are enough resources in the region now for the job at hand. The Americans want an international stamp on this effort," one of the Gulf sources said. "They (the United States) also don't want to bear the financial burden." Technical and financial aspects, such as refuelling, bunkering and maintenance costs, still need to be ironed out before countries sign up, the source said. Policing burdens would largely fall on the United States, which has protected shipping lanes in the region for decades with its Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. It also heads the Combined Maritime Forces, a 33-nation naval alliance that carries out security and counterpiracy operations in the region. Britain has a base in Oman and China has a military base in Djibouti, which lies off the Bab al-Mandab strait. Beijing has had to tread softly in the region because it has close energy ties with both Iran and Saudi Arabia. Small ships Riyadh and Abu Dhabi support US sanctions on Iran, which lacks a strong conventional naval fleet but has many speed boats, portable anti-ship missile launchers and mines. A US State Department official, who asked not to be named, said Bahrain would host a working group meeting on maritime and aviation security in the autumn as part of a follow-up to a global conference in Warsaw in February that gathered some 60 nations to discuss stability in the Middle East. READ: Iran ready to talk if US lifts sanctions, Pompeo skeptical Gulf states, which are big purchasers of Western arms, have invested more in air and land capabilities than in naval assets, and have little experience coordinating large naval missions. The majority of vessels are small patrol craft and corvettes that would struggle on extended missions, said Tom Waldwyn, research associate for The Military Balance at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Wheelbarger, the US Pentagon official, suggested small, quick ships would be helpful. She said several countries has expressed interest in the initiative but did not name them.

Washington proposed on July 9 stepping up efforts to safeguard strategic waters off Iran and Yemen where it blames Iran and its proxies for tanker attacks. Iran denies the charges, Reuters reports. But with Washington's allies reluctant to commit new weaponry or fighting forces, a senior Pentagon official told Reuters on Thursday that the United States' aim was not to set up a military coalition but to shine a "flashlight" in the region to deter attacks on commercial shipping. Because of fears of confrontation, any involvement by Washington's allies is likely be limited to naval personnel and equipment already in place – near the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf and the Bab al-Mandab strait in the Red Sea, two Gulf sources and a British security source said. "The Americans want to create an 'alliance of the willing' who confront future attacks," a Western diplomat said. "Nobody wants to be on that confrontational course and part of a US push against Iran." Addressing such concerns or possible misunderstandings, Kathryn Wheelbarger, one of the most senior policy officials at the Pentagon, told Reuters in an interview that the new initiative was "not about military confrontation." READ: Iran says it has seized foreign tanker as Gulf tensions deepen Under Washington's proposal, the United States would provide coordinating ships and lead surveillance efforts while allies would patrol nearby waters and escort commercial vessels with their nation's flags. Iran has said foreign powers should leave securing shipping lanes to Tehran and other countries in the region. France, which has a naval base in the United Arab Emirates, does not plan to escort ships and views the US plan as counterproductive to easing tensions because Tehran would see it as anti-Iran, a French official said. The British security source said it was not viable to escort every commercial vessel, a view shared by several other countries. A senior Western official based in Beijing said there was "no way" China would join a maritime coalition. A South Korean official said Washington had yet to make any official request. A decision by Japan to join such an initiative would be likely to inflame a divide in Japanese public opinion over sending troops abroad. Japan's military has not fought overseas since World War Two. "The Americans have been talking to anyone interested about setting something up, mainly looking to Asia as it's of vital importance to their security of (oil) supply and asking for ships, but it's gone a bit quiet," a Gulf official said. India has deployed two ships in the Gulf to protect Indian-flagged vessels since June 20. Other Asian oil importers are unlikely to have anything but a symbolic presence, such as the involvement of a liaison officer, officials and diplomats said. "It's just impossible. The Strait is already too crowded," an Asian official said of an escort system in the Strait of Hormuz which is 21 miles (33 km) wide at its narrowest point. A second Gulf official said: "We're not going to do anything like that, we are not going to do anything on our own." Rising tension Tensions rose further on Thursday after Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had seized a foreign tanker smuggling fuel. A U.S. military commander in the region said the United States would work "aggressively" to ensure free passage of vessels in and around the Strait of Hormuz. Tension has mounted since US President Donald Trump last year quit a 2015 nuclear pact under which Iran agreed to curtail its atomic programme in return for relief from economic sanctions crippling its economy. France, Britain and Germany, which with Russia and China are party to the agreement, have tried to rescue the deal and defuse tensions. Failure to secure support for the maritime initiative would be a blow to efforts by the United States, and its Sunni Muslim allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to isolate Shi'ite Muslim Iran and Iran-backed forces in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are already patrolling the coastline off Yemen where they are leading a coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, though the UAE has said it is scaling down its presence there. Asked what role Riyadh could play in the US initiative, a Saudi military official said it would be the role that the Saudi-led coalition has been playing for the past few years in the Red Sea as part of the war in Yemen, including escorting and securing commercial shipping.

The Americans want an international stamp on this effort," one of the Gulf sources said. "They (the United States) also don't want to bear the financial burden." Technical and financial aspects, such as refuelling, bunkering and maintenance costs, still need to be ironed out before countries sign up, the source said. Policing burdens would largely fall on the United States, which has protected shipping lanes in the region for decades with its Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet.

Wheelbarger, the US Pentagon official, suggested small, quick ships would be helpful. She said several countries has expressed interest in the initiative but did not name them.

AL KHARJ, Saudi Arabia: US Central Command chief Kenneth McKenzie pledged Thursday to work "aggressively" to ensure maritime safety in strategic Gulf waters after a spate of attacks blamed on Iran. "We are currently talking with the international community about the importance of the right of freedom of navigation in the Middle East," McKenzie told reporters at Prince Sultan air base near Riyadh. "We are going to work very aggressively with our partners... to come to a solution that will enable the free passage of critical oil and other commodities... through the region." His comment comes after US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, last week said the US aims to form a coalition to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Gulf amid fraught relations between Washington and Tehran. Tensions in the area -- through which nearly a third of the world´s oil is transported -- have spiked in recent weeks, with the US blaming Iran for multiple attacks on tanker ships in the region, and Tehran shooting down an American drone. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that he hopes more than 20 countries, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, would work together on building maritime security. McKenzie said the US was in "exploratory talks" with potential partners to ensure free passage through strategic waterways, including the Strait of Hormuz. This is "not a United States problem, it´s an international problem... We´re eager to be part of an international solution", McKenzie added. He refused to confirm a CNN report that US President Donald Trump´s administration plans to send 500 troops to Saudi Arabia, in what would serve as a show of force to Iran. The troops will be stationed at the Prince Sultan air base, CNN reported, citing two officials at the US Defense Department.

News article:
Iran announced Thursday that it had seized a foreign oil tanker and its crew of 12 for allegedly smuggling oil through the Persian Gulf’s Strait of Hormuz. This was followed by the United States announcement that it had jammed and destroyed an Iranian drone that came close to an American ship (a claim Iran denied). They were the latest Iranian provocations in the strategic channel as tensions between Tehran and Washington have flared. The strait, through which about 20 percent of all oil traded worldwide travels, is shallow and only 24 miles at its narrowest point, making large ships such as aircraft carriers and oil tankers easy targets because they are limited to a few predictable transit lines. Making matters worse, Iran has based small mine- and missile-armed motorboats, truck-mounted anti-ship missiles and torpedo-armed mini-submarines that can suddenly ambush and interdict ships all along the coast of the Gulf. This program raises questions about whether the military can swiftly adapt itself for the next generation of warfare — and to the asymmetric threats posed by Iran. Thankfully, the U.S. Navy has the perfect ship — small and maneuverable — to defend U.S. interests and international commerce by ensuring the right of passage through this strategic area. And it’s no mere coincidence that this is the case: Predicting that future conflicts were more likely to occur in dicey coastal waterways around countries like Iran and North Korea, the Navy almost two decades ago embarked on building the littoral combat ship, specially designed for skirmishes in shallow coastal areas. Too bad the ships are still virtually unusable after 16 years and $30 billion, with each ship costing a whopping 250 percent more than the original price tag. While they were technically made operational a decade ago, they’ve been plagued by so many technical issues that the Navy doesn’t seem to consider them ready for service in the Gulf. They didn't send any overseas at all for 19 months until this June because of constant breakdowns and fears about their vulnerability to modern threats. This is particularly unfortunate because now the Navy faces exactly the kind of situation it was anticipating when it decided to build these ships. Tensions over Iran’s nuclear program have risen in recent months as President Donald Trump pulled out of a deal to slow Tehran’s technical progress and has slapped harsh sanctions on the country. With the crippling measures in place, Iran is using its heavily armed motorboats to harass commercial shipping in retaliation for the economic hardship. The Navy is by now well aware of the long-suffering program’s deficiencies and is ready to cut its losses. By 2018 it had downsized its order from 52 ships to just 32 and is now aggressively seeking a new frigate to take its place. But the House and Senate are having none of that. Each chamber’s version of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act currently being debated on Capitol Hill includes funding to build three more littoral combat ships than the Navy wanted. Astoundingly, it gets worse: Legislators are cutting funding for the anti-submarine and mine warfare modules necessary for the existing ships to perform their missions. The irony is that the littoral combat ship program was intended to be inexpensive and easy to construct, the start of a more cost-effective and flexible approach to military planning for an age of asymmetric warfare and splintering power centers. The inability of the U.S. Navy and its congressional allocators to successfully manage this program raises questions about whether the military can swiftly adapt itself for the next generation of warfare — and to the asymmetric threats posed by Iran. The Navy entered the 1990s with a fleet of robust frigates, destroyers and cruisers designed to battle Soviet submarines, jet bombers and surface warships in the Atlantic. But these powerful vessels were overly expensive for the routine global presence and policing missions that came to define the American naval agenda after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Even more problematic were the potential vulnerabilities of such hulking ships to ambushes by small boats and submarines fielded by the coastal navies of adversaries like Iran and North Korea. Thus, the littoral combat ship was conceived in the early 2000s as, in the words of then-Navy Secretary Gordon England, a “small, fast, maneuverable and relatively inexpensive” shallow-draft corvette weighing one or two thousand tons that could battle low-rent adversaries in their coastal waters while freeing 9,000-ton destroyers with 300-person crews to carry out missions more appropriate for their size. The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act currently being debated on Capitol Hill includes funding to build three more littoral combat ships than the Navy wanted. But Pentagon planners just couldn’t keep things that simple. Rather than cheaply adapting an existing ship — which would have been eminently doable — the Navy fell prey to the tendency in military procurement to go for, as the lingo puts it, “exquisitely” tailored designs full of cutting-edge technologies. Those had to be concurrently developed from scratch at great expense. In this approach, unprecedented degrees of automation would allow core crews of just 40 cross-trained personnel to perform multiple tasks, thereby reducing operating costs. Plug-and-play “mission modules” would allow each littoral combat ship to be reconfigured for either surface warfare, mine-clearing or anti-submarine duties on short notice. And their hulls would allow radar stealth and extraordinary speeds of 50 miles per hour using a unique dual-engine propulsion system. The Navy told congressional overseers the lightly armed vessels would cost a mere $220 million per ship. But these best-case estimates overlooked that across-the-board innovation meant the newly developed systems had no consistent baseline to adapt to. Cascading delays and cost overruns eventually rocketed prices up to $550 million per ship, and ballooned the vessels to three to four times the originally proposed weight. Furthermore, the Navy illogically elected to pay for the development and procurement of two entirely different designs. While both types had their strengths, doing things that way meant paying for two separate development, testing and training programs as well as separate spare part inventories. That means 10 out of the 35 scheduled littoral combat ships need to be dedicated to training and testing missions. Shortfalls with the radical new manning scheme became evident once the ship began sea trials, with the 40-person crews overworked, inadequately trained and inefficient. The specialized mission modules by themselves have cost $7.6 billion and proved so difficult to integrate that the Navy abandoned the swappable module concept entirely. So now each littoral combat ship will be dedicated to just one mission: surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare or mine warfare, with fixed crews of 65 to 75. Even so, littoral combat ships repeatedly broke down and the USS Milwaukee even had to be towed back to port due to engine failures — with four experiencing engineering casualties in a matter of months in 2016. One 2014 report estimated the ships have a 46-percent higher operating cost than the larger multirole frigates they have replaced. The vessels’ supporters point out that ambitious new technologies inevitably encounter teething issues. But unlike the similarly troubled F-35 stealth jet, the littoral combat ship was dedicated to fighting second-rate adversaries. And it may not even do that very well. Don’t just take my word for it: In 2017, the Pentagon’s department of testing and evaluation estimated that “neither LCS variant is survivable in high intensity combat.” And in 2016, the USS Coronado struggled to prevent simulated swarms of Iranian attack boats from closing within range to perform a deadly attack. Now, in proposed 2020 budgets, Congress is looking to cut $33 million to $120 million out of the $197 million requested by the Navy to finish developing the mine warfare module — even though these sums are peanuts compared to the price of three unnecessary ships. Mine and anti-submarine warfare abilities, long neglected by the Navy, are areas where the littoral combat ship might still make useful contributions, and are pertinent to the situation in the Persian Gulf. The littoral combat ship program embodies many of the pathologies dogging American military procurement. Proponents still argue that it’s the least expensive solution for a navy struggling to maintain personnel and ship count, and that once the bugs are worked out and its armament upgraded it will be effective at the low-intensity coastal missions it was designed for. Though there’s fortunately some utility to be squeezed out of the over-engineered littoral combat ship, that doesn’t make it any less damning that the Pentagon blew billions on “inexpensive” vessels designed to combat relatively weak adversaries — and still hasn’t deployed a single littoral combat ship to the Persian Gulf theater. In short, the Littoral Combat Ship program embodies many of the pathologies dogging American military procurement, starting with a tendency to chase overly ambitious and expensive projects at the expense of practical and affordable solutions that could be promptly put in action. And rather than correcting these military excesses, Congress is making the problem worse by ordering additional ships the Navy doesn’t want while cutting off funding that would ensure those same ships can actually perform the missions they were intended for. All of which is making America’s sailors — and the country — less safe as water-based encounters with Iran increase.

Those had to be concurrently developed from scratch at great expense. In this approach, unprecedented degrees of automation would allow core crews of just 40 cross-trained personnel to perform multiple tasks, thereby reducing operating costs. Plug-and-play “mission modules” would allow each littoral combat ship to be reconfigured for either surface warfare, mine-clearing or anti-submarine duties on short notice. And their hulls would allow radar stealth and extraordinary speeds of 50 miles per hour using a unique dual-engine propulsion system. The Navy told congressional overseers the lightly armed vessels would cost a mere $220 million per ship. But these best-case estimates overlooked that across-the-board innovation meant the newly developed systems had no consistent baseline to adapt to. Cascading delays and cost overruns eventually rocketed prices up to $550 million per ship, and ballooned the vessels to three to four times the originally proposed weight. Furthermore, the Navy illogically elected to pay for the development and procurement of two entirely different designs. While both types had their strengths, doing things that way meant paying for two separate development, testing and training programs as well as separate spare part inventories. That means 10 out of the 35 scheduled littoral combat ships need to be dedicated to training and testing missions. Shortfalls with the radical new manning scheme became evident once the ship began sea trials, with the 40-person crews overworked, inadequately trained and inefficient. The specialized mission modules by themselves have cost $7.6 billion and proved so difficult to integrate that the Navy abandoned the swappable module concept entirely. So now each littoral combat ship will be dedicated to just one mission: surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare or mine warfare, with fixed crews of 65 to 75. Even so, littoral combat ships repeatedly broke down and the USS Milwaukee even had to be towed back to port due to engine failures — with four experiencing engineering casualties in a matter of months in 2016. One 2014 report estimated the ships have a 46-percent higher operating cost than the larger multirole frigates they have replaced. The vessels’ supporters point out that ambitious new technologies inevitably encounter teething issues. But unlike the similarly troubled F-35 stealth jet, the littoral combat ship was dedicated to fighting second-rate adversaries. And it may not even do that very well. Don’t just take my word for it: In 2017, the Pentagon’s department of testing and evaluation estimated that “neither LCS variant is survivable in high intensity combat.” And in 2016, the USS Coronado struggled to prevent simulated swarms of Iranian attack boats from closing within range to perform a deadly attack. Now, in proposed 2020 budgets, Congress is looking to cut $33 million to $120 million out of the $197 million requested by the Navy to finish developing the mine warfare module — even though these sums are peanuts compared to the price of three unnecessary ships. Mine and anti-submarine warfare abilities, long neglected by the Navy, are areas where the littoral combat ship might still make useful contributions, and are pertinent to the situation in the Persian Gulf. The littoral combat ship program embodies many of the pathologies dogging American military procurement. Proponents still argue that it’s the least expensive solution for a navy struggling to maintain personnel and ship count, and that once the bugs are worked out and its armament upgraded it will be effective at the low-intensity coastal missions it was designed for. Though there’s fortunately some utility to be squeezed out of the over-engineered littoral combat ship, that doesn’t make it any less damning that the Pentagon blew billions on “inexpensive” vessels designed to combat relatively weak adversaries — and still hasn’t deployed a single littoral combat ship to the Persian Gulf theater. In short, the Littoral Combat Ship program embodies many of the pathologies dogging American military procurement, starting with a tendency to chase overly ambitious and expensive projects at the expense of practical and affordable solutions that could be promptly put in action. And rather than correcting these military excesses, Congress is making the problem worse by ordering additional ships the Navy doesn’t want while cutting off funding that would ensure those same ships can actually perform the missions they were intended for. All of which is making America’s sailors — and the country — less safe as water-based encounters with Iran increase.

News article:
Iran announced Thursday that it had seized a foreign oil tanker and its crew of 12 for allegedly smuggling oil through the Persian Gulf’s Strait of Hormuz. This was followed by the United States announcement that it had jammed and destroyed an Iranian drone that came close to an American ship (a claim Iran denied). They were the latest Iranian provocations in the strategic channel as tensions between Tehran and Washington have flared. The strait, through which about 20 percent of all oil traded worldwide travels, is shallow and only 24 miles at its narrowest point, making large ships such as aircraft carriers and oil tankers easy targets because they are limited to a few predictable transit lines. Making matters worse, Iran has based small mine- and missile-armed motorboats, truck-mounted anti-ship missiles and torpedo-armed mini-submarines that can suddenly ambush and interdict ships all along the coast of the Gulf. This program raises questions about whether the military can swiftly adapt itself for the next generation of warfare — and to the asymmetric threats posed by Iran. Thankfully, the U.S. Navy has the perfect ship — small and maneuverable — to defend U.S. interests and international commerce by ensuring the right of passage through this strategic area. And it’s no mere coincidence that this is the case: Predicting that future conflicts were more likely to occur in dicey coastal waterways around countries like Iran and North Korea, the Navy almost two decades ago embarked on building the littoral combat ship, specially designed for skirmishes in shallow coastal areas. Too bad the ships are still virtually unusable after 16 years and $30 billion, with each ship costing a whopping 250 percent more than the original price tag. While they were technically made operational a decade ago, they’ve been plagued by so many technical issues that the Navy doesn’t seem to consider them ready for service in the Gulf. They didn't send any overseas at all for 19 months until this June because of constant breakdowns and fears about their vulnerability to modern threats. This is particularly unfortunate because now the Navy faces exactly the kind of situation it was anticipating when it decided to build these ships. Tensions over Iran’s nuclear program have risen in recent months as President Donald Trump pulled out of a deal to slow Tehran’s technical progress and has slapped harsh sanctions on the country. With the crippling measures in place, Iran is using its heavily armed motorboats to harass commercial shipping in retaliation for the economic hardship. The Navy is by now well aware of the long-suffering program’s deficiencies and is ready to cut its losses. By 2018 it had downsized its order from 52 ships to just 32 and is now aggressively seeking a new frigate to take its place. But the House and Senate are having none of that. Each chamber’s version of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act currently being debated on Capitol Hill includes funding to build three more littoral combat ships than the Navy wanted. Astoundingly, it gets worse: Legislators are cutting funding for the anti-submarine and mine warfare modules necessary for the existing ships to perform their missions. The irony is that the littoral combat ship program was intended to be inexpensive and easy to construct, the start of a more cost-effective and flexible approach to military planning for an age of asymmetric warfare and splintering power centers. The inability of the U.S. Navy and its congressional allocators to successfully manage this program raises questions about whether the military can swiftly adapt itself for the next generation of warfare — and to the asymmetric threats posed by Iran. The Navy entered the 1990s with a fleet of robust frigates, destroyers and cruisers designed to battle Soviet submarines, jet bombers and surface warships in the Atlantic. But these powerful vessels were overly expensive for the routine global presence and policing missions that came to define the American naval agenda after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Even more problematic were the potential vulnerabilities of such hulking ships to ambushes by small boats and submarines fielded by the coastal navies of adversaries like Iran and North Korea. Thus, the littoral combat ship was conceived in the early 2000s as, in the words of then-Navy Secretary Gordon England, a “small, fast, maneuverable and relatively inexpensive” shallow-draft corvette weighing one or two thousand tons that could battle low-rent adversaries in their coastal waters while freeing 9,000-ton destroyers with 300-person crews to carry out missions more appropriate for their size. The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act currently being debated on Capitol Hill includes funding to build three more littoral combat ships than the Navy wanted. But Pentagon planners just couldn’t keep things that simple. Rather than cheaply adapting an existing ship — which would have been eminently doable — the Navy fell prey to the tendency in military procurement to go for, as the lingo puts it, “exquisitely” tailored designs full of cutting-edge technologies.

The head of Iran’s navy said Tuesday that Tehran is observing all US ships in the Gulf region and keeps an archive of their movements. “We observe all enemy ships, particularly (those of) America, point-by-point from their origin until the moment they enter the region,” Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi said, according to a report on Iran’s Young Journalists news site, cited by Reuters. “We have complete images and a large archive of the daily and moment-by-moment traffic of the coalition forces and America,” Khandazi added, noting that the images of the vessels were captured using drones. The senior naval officer also said that Iran will hold joint naval exercises with “allied countries” for the first time in March 2020, without specifying which nations would take part in the exercises. Khandazi’s statement came amid elevated tensions in the Gulf after Iranian authorities seized a British-flagged tanker there on Friday. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Monday said the UK wanted to establish a European-led maritime protection force for the Gulf but emphasized that London was not seeking a confrontation. “We will now seek to put together a European-led maritime protection mission to support the safe passage of both crew and cargo in this vital region,” Hunt told parliament. “We will seek to establish this mission as quickly as possible,” he said, adding: “It will not be part of the US maximum pressure policy on Iran.” Advertisement Hunt described Friday’s incident as an act of “state piracy.” Hunt also said that a British warship, HMS Duncan, that is being dispatched to the region, would arrive by July 29, joining the HMS Montrose currently in the Gulf. According to the foreign secretary, all British-flagged ships would be asked to give the British authorities notice when they plan to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, where Friday’s incident happened, “to enable us to offer the best protection we can.” But he added: “It is, of course, not possible for the Royal Navy to provide escorts for every single ship or indeed eliminate all risks of piracy.” Iran released new video showing the ship’s crew for the first time on Monday, an apparent attempt to show they were unharmed. None of the 23 are British nationals. The crew is mostly Indian, and also includes Filipino, Russian and Latvian nationals. Advertisement Friday’s seizure of the Stena Impero came amid already heightened tensions between the US and Iran stemming from US President Donald Trump’s decision last year to pull the US from Iran’s nuclear accord with world powers and reinstate sweeping sanctions on Iran. Iranian officials say the seizure of the British oil tanker was a justified response to the Royal Navy’s role impounding its Grace 1 supertanker with some 2 million barrels of crude off the coast of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory located on the southern tip of Spain. Iran’s government spokesman Ali Rabiei said Monday that there are diplomatic solutions to the current crisis, but he also defended Iran’s actions. “When you illegally seize a ship in Gibraltar… we don’t deem it as necessary to show tolerance,” he said. “Some countries have asked for the immediate release of the British tanker. Well, we ask those countries to make the same request to Britain first.” Britain says it acted lawfully off the Gibraltar coast to prevent illegal oil shipments to Syria that would have violated European Union sanctions while Iran broke international maritime law by forcing the Stena Impero to change course and go to Iran. Britain says the tanker was in Omani waters at the time, which Iran disputes. As the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers unravels, the US has expanded its military presence in the region, while Iran has begun openly exceeding the uranium enrichment levels set in the accord to try to pressure Europe into alleviating the pain caused by the sanctions. European nations are trying to save the nuclear deal and have tried to come up with ways to keep trading with Iran but have run smack into Trump’s sanctions, which also target Iranian oil exports.

GENEVA (Reuters) — Iran observes all U.S. ships in the Gulf region and has an archive of images of their daily movements, the head of Iran‘s navy, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, said on Tuesday, according to the Young Journalists Club news site. Iran and the United States came to the brink of war last month after the Islamic Republic shot down a U.S. drone, nearly prompting a retaliatory attack, which President Donald Trump called off at the last minute. Tensions have also spiked between Iran and Britain after the Islamic Republic seized a British-flagged tanker last Friday because it had collided with a fishing vessel, according to Iranian officials. British Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar in early July, accusing it of violating sanctions on Syria. “We observe all enemy ships, particularly [those of] America, point by point from their origin until the moment they enter the region,” Khanzadi said, noting that images were recorded using Iranian drones. “We have complete images and a large archive of the daily and moment-by-moment traffic of the coalition forces and America.” Iran will hold joint naval exercises with allied countries for the first time by the end of the Iranian calendar year, which is in March 2020, Khanzadi said. He did not specify which countries might take part in the exercise.

Iran and the United States came to the brink of war last month after the Islamic Republic shot down a U.S. drone, nearly prompting a retaliatory attack, which President Donald Trump called off at the last minute. Tensions have also spiked between Iran and Britain after the Islamic Republic seized a British-flagged tanker last Friday because it had collided with a fishing vessel, according to Iranian officials. British Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar in early July, accusing it of violating sanctions on Syria. “We observe all enemy ships, particularly [those of] America, point by point from their origin until the moment they enter the region,” Khanzadi said, noting that images were recorded using Iranian drones. “We have complete images and a large archive of the daily and moment-by-moment traffic of the coalition forces and America.” Iran will hold joint naval exercises with allied countries for the first time by the end of the Iranian calendar year, which is in March 2020, Khanzadi said. He did not specify which countries might take part in the exercise.

Iran’s navy chief on Tuesday reportedly said that his country observes all U.S. ships in the Gulf region and archives images of their daily movements. “We observe all enemy ships, particularly [those of] America, point-by-point from their origin until the moment they enter the region,” Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi said, according to Reuters. “We have complete images and a large archive of the daily and moment-by-moment traffic of the coalition forces and America.” {mosads}Khanzadi added that Iran will hold joint naval exercises by March 2020 with a select group of unspecified allied countries, Reuters reported. Tensions have heated up between Iran and the U.S. since May, when the Trump administration announced the deployment of a carrier strike group to the region due to unspecified threats from Iran. Last month, the Islamic Republic shot down a U.S. surveillance drone that it claimed had been flying over Iranian airspace. The move nearly prompted a retaliatory strike from the U.S. until President Trump called it off at the last minute. And last week, Trump said a U.S. Navy vessel shot down an Iranian drone in a “defensive action” in the Strait of Hormuz, adding that “this is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters.” The strain has also continued to escalate between the two countries in light of Iran’s breach of two key limits of the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew from in 2018 before reimposing harsh sanctions on Iran.

Topic: History Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: IranIranian NavyHistoryWarNavies Ouch. On April 14, 1988, the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts struck an Iranian mine while escorting tanker ships through the Persian Gulf. The carrier USS Enterprise led a retaliatory raid. Tensions have escalated in the Persian Gulf region in the aftermath of U.S. president Donald Trump’s decision unilaterally to withdraw the United States from the agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. military has implicated Iranian agents in several summer 2019 attacks on civilian ships sailing near Iran. The U.S. Navy sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her strike group to the region. The U.S. Air Force deployed B-52 bombers and F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. If war breaks out, American forces could target Iran’s small navy as well as the vessels belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps militia. (This first appeared in July 2019.) The battle could be brief. Iran’s fleet has a long history of waging losing fights with the United States and other Western powers. During World War II, the Allied powers worried that Iran, while technically neutral, might sympathize with and aid the Nazis, potentially depriving the Allies of the country’s oil. On Aug. 25, 1941, Commonwealth and Soviet forces invaded. British and Australian warships steamed into Abadan Harbor as part of a surprise attack. HMS Shoreham opened fire first, striking the Iranian warship Palang. Soon virtually the entire Iranian fleet was in ruins and commander-in-chief Adm. Gholamali Bayandor lay dead. The British and Soviets divided up Iran and deposed its shah. In the two decades following the war, the new regime rebuilt the navy with mostly British-made ships, some of which remain in service today. The new Iranian navy fought hard during the bloody Iran-Iraq war between 1980 and 1988. Iran’s attacks on tanker ships—some strictly neutral, others admittedly supplying Iraq—incited international rage. In 1987, Washington approved Kuwait’s request to “reflag” its tankers as American vessels, in order to allow the U.S. Navy to escort the ships through the Persian Gulf. The Americans’ Operation Earnest Will, lasting from July 1987 to September 1988, included several smaller efforts that resulted in the destruction of Iranian forces. The Navy converted two oil-service barges into “sea bases” for Special Operations Forces and armed helicopters, and the U.S. Army placed attack copters aboard Navy ships. On Sept. 21, 1987 Little Bird helicopters from the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment attacked the Iranian vessel Ajr as she laid mines, forcing the crew to abandon ship. A few days later, Little Birds sank three Iranian patrol boats. On Oct. 16, 1987, an Iranian missile struck a Kuwaiti tanker, injuring 19 people. In response, a U.S. task force targeted two inoperable oil platforms that IRGC forces were using as bases for armed speedboats. American warships surrounded the platforms, compelling the Iranian crews to evacuate. U.S. commandos climbed aboard one platform to gather up any documents the Iranians had left behind. Four U.S. destroyers opened fire, setting the platforms ablaze. On April 14, 1988, the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts struck an Iranian mine while escorting tanker ships through the Persian Gulf. The carrier USS Enterprise led a retaliatory raid. Two U.S. destroyers and an amphibious assault ship carrying a battalion of U.S. Marines assaulted an oil platform the Iranians were using as a staging base. The Iranians fired back, drawing heavy return fire from the destroyers and Marine Cobra helicopters. Marines stormed the platform, capturing one surviving Iranian gunner. Iranian speedboats raided three civilian cargo ships. As the Iranians withdrew, Enterprise’s A-6 bombers zeroed in, sinking one speedboat with cluster bombs. The Iranian missile boat Joshan fired a Harpoon anti-ship missile at a group of American warships—and missed. The Americans fired back with Harpoon and Standard missiles then sank the damaged Joshan with their guns. While the U.S. ships fought off Iranian air attacks, Tehran’s 1960s-vintage destroyers joined the battle. Sahand and Sabalan both fired without effect at A-6s overhead. The A-6s shot back with Harpoons and laser-guided bombs, sinking Sahand and badly damaging Sabalan. At least 56 Iranians died in the fighting. Two U.S. Marines perished when their helicopter crashed. Battered, the Iranian fleet pulled back, and since then has been hesitant to make good on its periodic threats against Iran’s neighbors and the United States.

News article:
KABUL, July 24 (Reuters) - The United States believes a proposed European initiative to bolster maritime security in the Gulf would complement ongoing U.S. efforts there instead of being a “stand-alone” operation, the top U.S. general said on Wednesday. Washington in June first proposed some sort of multinational effort open to all allies and partners to bolster maritime security in the Gulf after accusing Iran of attacking oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz, a critical maritime chokepoint between Iran and Oman. Britain called this week for a European-led naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the strait after Iran seized a British-flagged tanker, raising questions about whether the U.S. initiative would move ahead separately. Asked about the British proposal, U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said his discussions “right now wouldn’t indicate that that’s a stand-alone effort that’s separate from ours.” “I view that as a European contribution to maritime security that would be complementary, if not integrated, with what the United States is doing,” Dunford told a small group of reporters traveling with him in Afghanistan. He did not say whether he had discussed the matter directly with Britain. Dunford said the U.S. military’s Central Command, which is headquartered in Tampa, Florida, would host a “force generation conference” on Thursday on the U.S. initiative. Such events usually aim to see what kinds of military assets partner nations might be able to contribute. Washington’s major European allies have distanced themselves from President Donald Trump’s Iran strategy and opposed his decision last year to abandon an international agreement that gave Iran access to trade in return for accepting curbs on its nuclear program. Reuters reported on Tuesday that the British proposal for a European-led initiative had won some support in European capitals and quoted one diplomat saying it was easier to rally around the British proposal than the American one. NOT LINKED TO ‘MAXIMUM PRESSURE’ U.S. officials have sought to distinguish their new maritime effort from Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, which has sought to force Tehran back to the negotiating table by imposing harsh sanctions. They stress that the United States is not creating a coalition to confront Iran militarily and say the new initiative will not be operational in the way that, say, the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria had been. Instead, it is about increasing intelligence sharing, surveillance and international presence to deter more attacks on tankers in the waterway, like the ones seen in recent months. “This is not related to the pressure campaign on Iran. It’s focused on freedom of navigation,” Dunford said. Under a plan initially detailed on July 9, the United States would provide coordinating ships and lead surveillance efforts while participants in the coalition patrolled nearby waters and escorted commercial vessels with their nation’s flags. The United States would not escort other nations’ commercial vessels. Dunford said the U.S. plan would allow “those countries that are going to escort their ships to have the benefit of the information and the situational awareness that we have every day.” Dunford stressed that, in some ways, the initiative was already underway - albeit on a small scale. “We shared intelligence in the two British operations that have taken place over the last 10 days,” Dunford said. “So, to me, it grows as contributions increase and as countries decide to escort the ships that have their flag.” (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)

They stress that the United States is not creating a coalition to confront Iran militarily and say the new initiative will not be operational in the way that, say, the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria had been. Instead, it is about increasing intelligence sharing, surveillance and international presence to deter more attacks on tankers in the waterway, like the ones seen in recent months. “This is not related to the pressure campaign on Iran. It’s focused on freedom of navigation,” Dunford said. Under a plan initially detailed on July 9, the United States would provide coordinating ships and lead surveillance efforts while participants in the coalition patrolled nearby waters and escorted commercial vessels with their nation’s flags. The United States would not escort other nations’ commercial vessels. Dunford said the U.S. plan would allow “those countries that are going to escort their ships to have the benefit of the information and the situational awareness that we have every day.” Dunford stressed that, in some ways, the initiative was already underway - albeit on a small scale. “We shared intelligence in the two British operations that have taken place over the last 10 days,” Dunford said. “So, to me, it grows as contributions increase and as countries decide to escort the ships that have their flag.” (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)

News article:
KABUL, July 24 (Reuters) - The United States believes a proposed European initiative to bolster maritime security in the Gulf would complement ongoing U.S. efforts there instead of being a “stand-alone” operation, the top U.S. general said on Wednesday. Washington in June first proposed some sort of multinational effort open to all allies and partners to bolster maritime security in the Gulf after accusing Iran of attacking oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz, a critical maritime chokepoint between Iran and Oman. Britain called this week for a European-led naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the strait after Iran seized a British-flagged tanker, raising questions about whether the U.S. initiative would move ahead separately. Asked about the British proposal, U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said his discussions “right now wouldn’t indicate that that’s a stand-alone effort that’s separate from ours.” “I view that as a European contribution to maritime security that would be complementary, if not integrated, with what the United States is doing,” Dunford told a small group of reporters traveling with him in Afghanistan. He did not say whether he had discussed the matter directly with Britain. Dunford said the U.S. military’s Central Command, which is headquartered in Tampa, Florida, would host a “force generation conference” on Thursday on the U.S. initiative. Such events usually aim to see what kinds of military assets partner nations might be able to contribute. Washington’s major European allies have distanced themselves from President Donald Trump’s Iran strategy and opposed his decision last year to abandon an international agreement that gave Iran access to trade in return for accepting curbs on its nuclear program. Reuters reported on Tuesday that the British proposal for a European-led initiative had won some support in European capitals and quoted one diplomat saying it was easier to rally around the British proposal than the American one. NOT LINKED TO ‘MAXIMUM PRESSURE’ U.S. officials have sought to distinguish their new maritime effort from Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, which has sought to force Tehran back to the negotiating table by imposing harsh sanctions.

Topic: Security Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: IranMilitaryTechnologyWorldNavy "We will escort our ships to the degree that the risk demands it." The U.S. military could escort American ships through key waterways in the Middle East, Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters on Wednesday. "We will escort our ships to the degree that the risk demands it," Esper said at a Pentagon media availability. However, Esper stressed on Wednesday that he was not announcing that U.S. Navy ships and aircraft would immediately begin escorting U.S. commercial ships through the Strait of Hormuz to deter Iranian aggression. "I'm not saying that right now," Esper said. "I'm just saying this is one of the things I'm going to see with CENTCOM next week as I understand their concept of the operations. Again, to the degree of course United States vessels need an escort, we will be there. We will be available to them." Iran has recently seized foreign ships as tensions with the United States and Europe have risen sharply over the past few months, prompting U.S. Central Command to announce on July 19 that it was developing Operation Sentinel, a multinational mission to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Oman. "This maritime security framework will enable nations to provide escort to their flagged vessels while taking advantage of the cooperation of participating nations for coordination and enhanced maritime domain awareness and surveillance," a CENTCOM news release says. The U.S. military will determine whether a U.S. commercial ship requires an escort if they face the threat of being stopped or seized, Esper said. Esper said he will discuss with CENTCOM commanders exactly what escorting U.S. commercial ships would involve. He also explained that U.S. warships do not need to be right next to a commercial ship in order to protect it. "As long as you're in the area that you can react quick enough to deter a provocation, that's the key," Esper said. "I don't necessarily mean that every U.S.-flagged ship going through the Strait [of Hormuz] has a destroyer right behind it." Operation Sentinel is meant to stop the Iranians from taking provocative actions that could lead to a war, Esper said. Should the Iranians attempt to capture a U.S.-flagged commercial ship, the U.S. military would intervene. "Absolutely, we would want to prevent it," Esper said. "We would want to prevent the Iranians seizing or stopping a ship, certainly for any arbitrary reason whatsoever." This first appeared in Task and Purpose here.

News article:
The United States is rallying allies to create an international security force to protect shipping from the threat posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz, as the British navy began escorting UK-flagged ships through the waterway after the seizure an oil tanker by Iranian forces last week. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Japan, France, Germany, South Korea, Australia and other nations had already been approached to join the security initiative. "Every country that has an interest in ensuring that those waterways are open and crude oil and other products can flow through the Strait of Hormuz needs to participate," Mr Pompeo said in an interview on Fox News on Thursday. The US initiative follows recent attacks on vessels in the area that Washington has blamed on Iran. The two countries are in an increasingly tense stand-off over US sanctions that seek to cut off Iran's vital oil exports. Mr Pompeo said in earlier interview with Bloomberg TV that he would be willing to travel to Iran for talks on the current crisis. Tensions have been building since the US pulled out of a 2015 international accord with Iran to curb its nuclear programme, and re-imposed sanctions that had been lifted as part of the agreement. Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State. Bloomberg "Sure. If that's the call, I'd happily go there," Mr Pompeo said. "I would welcome the chance to speak directly to the Iranian people." Iran has rejected US offers to renegotiate the deal while under the pressure of sanctions and has demanded that the European signatories, including Britain, find ways to restore its access to global markets. Britain angered Iran with the seizure of a loaded Iranian tanker off its Mediterranean territory of Gibraltar this month on suspicion that it was carrying oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions. The seizure of the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impera in Omani waters by Iran's Revolutionary Guard on July 19 was seen as a retaliation by Tehran. In response, the British government announced on Thursday that its navy had begun escorting vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, despite saying earlier that it did not have the capacity to do so. "The Royal Navy has been tasked to accompany British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz, either individually or in groups, should sufficient notice be given of their passage," a government spokesperson said. “Freedom of navigation is crucial for the global trading system and world economy, and we will do all we can to defend it.” Also on Thursday, the US Central Command hosted an international meeting in Tampa, Florida, to discuss security for shipping in the Middle East. The meeting at MacDill Air Force Base was attended by the UAE among other countries, including Britain and European nations, The National has learned. A UAE tanker was among four attacked in Fujairah port in May, while two others were hit by explosions weeks later after passing through the Strait of Hormuz. Centcom spokesman Major John Rigsbee told The National the meeting was attended by "senior representatives from allies and partner nations" but declined to name the countries taking part. He said the security initiative, dubbed "Operation Sentinel", was designed "to enhance maritime domain awareness and promote maritime stability in response to recent events in the Arabian Gulf region". US President Donald Trump and new US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper, left, participate in a full honours welcome ceremony at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. EPA In the absence of a formal coalition, each country is responsible for protecting its shipping in the region, according to newly confirmed US Defence Secretary Mark Esper. “The Brits are escorting their ships and we will escort our ships, and I assume other countries will escort their ships,” he said on Wednesday. But Mr Esper said that the US, with its superior naval fleets, would "come to the aid of our allies, depending on the situation". Centcom's meeting on Thursday was the third hosted by the US administration since the standoff with Iran began. Besides the targeting of shipping, tensions have been raised by Iran's downing of a US surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz that almost led to retaliatory US strikes before President Donald Trump called them off at the last moment. In another apparent provocation, Iran reportedly test fired a ballistic missile that travelled 1,000 kilometres on Thursday. A Pentagon official told CNN the Shahab-3 missile did not pose a threat to shipping or US bases in the region. Mr Trump cited the failure of the 2015 nuclear accord to curb Iran's missile development as one of the reasons for pulling the US out of the deal in May last year.

The State Department said it’s “very supportive” of a European initiative to safeguard ships in the Strait of Hormuz, even as the United States pursues its own operation to secure the narrow waterway. “We welcome any effort by the Europeans, by our allies, by our partners,” said Morgan Ortagus, the State Department’s spokesperson. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an interview with Bret Baier on "Special Report" on Thursday, said countries should unite to protect the waterway. “Every country that has an interest in ensuring that those waterways are open and crude oil and other products can flow through the Strait of Hormuz needs to participate to protect, not only their own interest, but the fundamental understanding of free and open waterways,” Pompeo said. The Pentagon announced U.S. Central Command hosted senior representatives from allied nations Thursday at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida to discuss the U.S. initiative, Operation Sentinel. IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD SEIZES ONE UK-OPERATED TANKER IN STRAIT OF HORMUZ, BRIEFLY DETAINS ANOTHER Last week, the State Department briefed about 100 diplomats from around 60 countries to discuss the U.S. operation, according to a senior U.S. official. The Trump administration stressed that other nations need to contribute more to security in the strait as most of the commerce that passes through is headed to ports outside the United States. Shortly after that briefing, a British shipping company announced Iran had seized one of its tankers traveling through the strait. The UK announced the British navy will now escort British-flagged ships through the Strait. While the State Department said it welcomed the European initiative, the administration’s Iran policy diverges with European allies on the Iran nuclear agreement. The U.S. withdrew from the deal last year and restored sanctions against Iran. The United Kingdom, France and Germany are trying to hold the agreement together and have refused to join the U.S. “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. Iran claimed it is also securing the strait. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “The whole world should be thankful to the Revolutionary Guard for maintaining the security in the Strait of Hormuz," said Hassan Rouhani, the President of Iran. Iran has also demanded the British release the tanker it seized. The UK claimed the Iranian ship violated European Union sanctions trying to deliver oil to Syria when Royal Marines seized it earlier this month. The shipping firm operating the British-flagged tanker in Iran said the company is in contact with the 23 sailors Iran seized. “Crew members have been able to talk directly to their families for a limited time,” said Erik Hanell, CEO and president of Stena Bulk. “We await a decision from the local authorities on our request to attend the vessel.”

News article:
South Korea plans to join a US-led maritime force in the Middle East by sending a naval unit, which includes a destroyer, to help guard oil tankers sailing through the Strait of Hormuz, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday.Tensions between Iran and the United States have increased since Washington pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.Attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz off the coast of Iran in recent months further soured ties, prompting US officials to call for allies to join a planned maritime security mission.The Maekyung business newspaper, citing an unidentified senior government official, said South Korea had decided to send the anti-piracy Cheonghae unit operating in waters off Somalia, possibly along with helicopters.Seoul’s defence ministry said the government was exploring measures to protect its ships in the area but no decision had been made.“It is obvious that we have to protect our ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz, isn’t it? So we’re considering various possibilities,” deputy ministry spokesperson Ro Jae-cheon told a regular news briefing on Monday.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week Washington had asked South Korea, Japan, France, Germany, Australia and others to take part.US national security adviser John Bolton visited Seoul last week and discussed the issue with senior officials, including the defence minister, but Ro said there was no official request made during that meeting.The Cheonghae unit has been stationed in the Gulf of Aden since 2009, working to tackle piracy in partnership with African countries as well as the United States and the European Union.The 302-strong unit operates a 4,500-ton destroyer, a Lynx anti-submarine helicopter and three speed boats, according to South Korea’s 2018 defence white paper.

Since 12 May, several oil tankers have been attacked in the Strait of Hormuz. The United States and its allies have blamed Iran for the incidents, while Tehran has denied its involvement. The incidents began not long after Washington on 5 May started building up its military presence in the Middle East, deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, Patriot missiles, B-52 bombers, F-15 fighters and other hardware to the region. US National Security Adviser John Bolton said at the time that the deployment came in response to an unspecified threat and was intended to send a "message" to Iran. On 19 July, the United States invited more than 60 nations to a closed-door briefing on a new initiative to achieve maritime security in the Middle East. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said on Monday that Washington hopes that Moscow will be supportive of the efforts to engage China in negotiations on nonproliferation. "We think in today's world China has to be part of this, and I hope [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin will support us," Pompeo said at the Economic Club of Washington. In May, US President Donald Trump said he would soon launch bilateral talks with Russia on a new nuclear arms control deal that could see both countries reduce their arsenals, adding that the negotiations could eventually be expanded to include China. However, Chinese officials have ruled out any participation in US-Russian arms control negotiations even if they could be revived. Pompeo emphasized that the United States and Russia have a strategic dialogue and said that he hopes this dialogue will help both countries to solve the issues of proliferation.

News article:
Dubai : Efforts to secure safe passage through the Strait of Hormuz are ramping up as the US said a second warship arrived in the area and South Korea may deploy its own unit as part of a multinational force. The strait is a vital thoroughfare for the energy industry, accounting for about a third of the world’s oil and a quarter of the gas transported by tanker. The US and Europe are both seeking to establish separate maritime security initiatives, and the UK said last week that further measures would be taken to respond to Iran, without giving detail on those plans. Tensions have flared in the strait in recent weeks as Iran pushes back against US sanctions that are crippling its oil exports. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard is still holding a UK vessel it detained earlier this month, the Stena Impero, in retaliation for British forces seizing an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar for allegedly violating sanctions against Syria. Why is the Strait of Hormuz important? The Strait of Hormuz is the busiest, most important waterway for the world’s oil industry. More than a third of the world’s seaborne oil passes through the strait, which connects the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and is situated between Oman and Iran. In 2016, the Energy Information Administration estimated that 18.5 million barrels of oil passed each day through the shipping lane, which is only two miles wide. What’s been going on there? Over the last several months, the United States has accused Iran of attacking and harassing commercial shipping vessels on the waterway, as well as over the Gulf. And American warships have had close encounters with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. In recent weeks, the US and its allies have found themselves responding in a tit-for-tat with Iran. This isn’t the first time that the Strait of Hormuz has been the site of international conflict. During the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the waterway became a point of contention for the warring countries. Iran placed sea mines in the paths of ships, and Iraq retaliated by firing missiles at them. What steps are being taken by various nations? ■ United States: The US has by far the biggest foreign naval presence in the Gulf region. More American warships have arrived to the Mideast amid heightened tensions with Iran, replacing other ships on duty. The Bahrain-based 5th Fleet oversees the Navy’s presence in the Gulf and surrounding Mideast waters. On July 19, the US Central Command announced that it was “developing a multinational maritime effort, Operation Sentinel, to increase surveillance of and security in key waterways in the Middle East to ensure freedom of navigation”. The statement added that “this maritime security framework will enable nations to provide escort to their flagged vessels while taking advantage of the cooperation of participating nations for coordination and enhanced maritime domain awareness and surveillance”. ■ Britain: The UK has deployed the HMS Duncan, one of its Type 45 destroyers, to shepherd British-flagged ships through the strait, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement Sunday. It will operate alongside the Royal Navy’s HMS Montrose Type 23 frigate until late August, it said. ■ South Korea: Meanwhile, South Korea is considering sending its Cheonghae naval unit to the strait for participation in a US-led coalition, Maeil Business Newspaper reported Monday, citing an unidentified government official. South Korea’s 302-personnel Cheonghae unit includes the destroyer Dae Jo-yeong, an anti-submarine helicopter and three speed boats, according to the latest annual defence white paper. It’s been stationed in the Gulf of Aden since 2009 for anti-piracy operations and has also been utilised in recent years to help evacuate South Korea citizens from Libya and Yemen. The unit’s key missions are to protect vessels, support safe passage and participate in maritime security operations, according to the white paper. A defence ministry spokeswoman, Choi Hyun-soo, said the government is considering ‘various options to ensure South Korean vessels’ safety’ but nothing has been finalised. ■ Denmark: Denmark said on Friday it welcomed a British government proposal for a European-led naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the Strait of Hormuz and would consider a military maritime contribution. “The Danish government looks positively towards a possible contribution to such initiative,” Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said in a statement. “The initiative will have a strong European footprint”. The backing contrasts with a lukewarm response shown by European allies to a similar American call first voiced at Nato in late June, which was resisted by France and Germany. They worried the US-led military alliance would be dragged into a possible confrontation with Iran. EU-member Denmark is among the world’s biggest seafaring nations and home to the world’s biggest container shipping firm A.P. Moller-Maersk, which sails in the high-tension area. “The Royal Danish Navy is strong and capable and would be able to contribute actively and effectively to this type of engagement,” said Danish Defence Minister Trine Bramsen. A final decision would still need to be discussed in parliament. ■ France: France said on Thursday it was not willing to send extra military assets to the Gulf, but would share information and coordinate its currently deployed assets. ■ Germany: Foreign Minister Heiko Maas did not tell lawmakers that Germany wants to take part in a British plan for a European-led naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, a ministry spokesman told Reuters on Thursday. Speedboats from Iran's Revolutionary Guard circle the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero. Image Credit: AP How has Iran reacted? Iran on Sunday slammed as “provocative” the British proposal for a European-led naval mission. “We heard that they intend to send a European fleet to the .... Gulf which naturally carries a hostile message, is provocative and will increase tensions,” said government spokesman Ali Rabiei. He said Iran believed the security of the Gulf had to be maintained by countries in the region. “We are the biggest agent of maritime security in the ... Gulf,” Rabiei said, quoted by ISNA news agency. Regional diplomacy

News article:
Dubai : Efforts to secure safe passage through the Strait of Hormuz are ramping up as the US said a second warship arrived in the area and South Korea may deploy its own unit as part of a multinational force. The strait is a vital thoroughfare for the energy industry, accounting for about a third of the world’s oil and a quarter of the gas transported by tanker. The US and Europe are both seeking to establish separate maritime security initiatives, and the UK said last week that further measures would be taken to respond to Iran, without giving detail on those plans. Tensions have flared in the strait in recent weeks as Iran pushes back against US sanctions that are crippling its oil exports. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard is still holding a UK vessel it detained earlier this month, the Stena Impero, in retaliation for British forces seizing an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar for allegedly violating sanctions against Syria. Why is the Strait of Hormuz important? The Strait of Hormuz is the busiest, most important waterway for the world’s oil industry. More than a third of the world’s seaborne oil passes through the strait, which connects the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and is situated between Oman and Iran. In 2016, the Energy Information Administration estimated that 18.5 million barrels of oil passed each day through the shipping lane, which is only two miles wide. What’s been going on there? Over the last several months, the United States has accused Iran of attacking and harassing commercial shipping vessels on the waterway, as well as over the Gulf. And American warships have had close encounters with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. In recent weeks, the US and its allies have found themselves responding in a tit-for-tat with Iran. This isn’t the first time that the Strait of Hormuz has been the site of international conflict. During the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the waterway became a point of contention for the warring countries. Iran placed sea mines in the paths of ships, and Iraq retaliated by firing missiles at them. What steps are being taken by various nations? ■ United States: The US has by far the biggest foreign naval presence in the Gulf region. More American warships have arrived to the Mideast amid heightened tensions with Iran, replacing other ships on duty. The Bahrain-based 5th Fleet oversees the Navy’s presence in the Gulf and surrounding Mideast waters. On July 19, the US Central Command announced that it was “developing a multinational maritime effort, Operation Sentinel, to increase surveillance of and security in key waterways in the Middle East to ensure freedom of navigation”. The statement added that “this maritime security framework will enable nations to provide escort to their flagged vessels while taking advantage of the cooperation of participating nations for coordination and enhanced maritime domain awareness and surveillance”. ■ Britain: The UK has deployed the HMS Duncan, one of its Type 45 destroyers, to shepherd British-flagged ships through the strait, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement Sunday. It will operate alongside the Royal Navy’s HMS Montrose Type 23 frigate until late August, it said. ■ South Korea: Meanwhile, South Korea is considering sending its Cheonghae naval unit to the strait for participation in a US-led coalition, Maeil Business Newspaper reported Monday, citing an unidentified government official. South Korea’s 302-personnel Cheonghae unit includes the destroyer Dae Jo-yeong, an anti-submarine helicopter and three speed boats, according to the latest annual defence white paper. It’s been stationed in the Gulf of Aden since 2009 for anti-piracy operations and has also been utilised in recent years to help evacuate South Korea citizens from Libya and Yemen. The unit’s key missions are to protect vessels, support safe passage and participate in maritime security operations, according to the white paper. A defence ministry spokeswoman, Choi Hyun-soo, said the government is considering ‘various options to ensure South Korean vessels’ safety’ but nothing has been finalised. ■ Denmark: Denmark said on Friday it welcomed a British government proposal for a European-led naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the Strait of Hormuz and would consider a military maritime contribution. “The Danish government looks positively towards a possible contribution to such initiative,” Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said in a statement. “The initiative will have a strong European footprint”. The backing contrasts with a lukewarm response shown by European allies to a similar American call first voiced at Nato in late June, which was resisted by France and Germany. They worried the US-led military alliance would be dragged into a possible confrontation with Iran. EU-member Denmark is among the world’s biggest seafaring nations and home to the world’s biggest container shipping firm A.P. Moller-Maersk, which sails in the high-tension area. “The Royal Danish Navy is strong and capable and would be able to contribute actively and effectively to this type of engagement,” said Danish Defence Minister Trine Bramsen.

South Korea says looking into 'various options' to protect ships in Persian Gulf Iran Press TV Mon Jul 29, 2019 04:41PM South Korea says it is examining "various options" to protect ships sailing through the Strait of Hormuz, refuting earlier reports that it will join a US-led military coalition to deter what Washington calls Iran's threat to shipping in the Persian Gulf region. "It is obvious that we have to protect our ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz, isn't it? So we're considering various options," said Col. Roh Jae-cheon, the South Korean defense ministry's deputy spokesman, in a briefing on Monday. "Some news reports have mentioned a dispatch of troops close to the current Cheonghae Unit, but nothing has been decided," he stressed, referring to the South Korean Navy's anti-piracy unit that has been working off the shores of Somalia, in the Gulf of Aden, for the past decade. The latest remarks by South Korean Defense Ministry official refuted previous media reports denoting that the country had decided to send a naval unit to the Strait of Hormuz to protect its ships. Earlier on Monday, Reuters reported that South Korea planned to contribute to a US-led maritime force in the Middle East by sending a naval unit, which includes a destroyer, to help guard oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz. Quoting South Korea's Maekyung business newspaper, which in turn cited an unnamed senior government official, Reuters said Seoul had decided to dispatch the anti-piracy Cheonghae unit operating in waters off Somalia, possibly along with military choppers. US Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on July 9 that Washington was proceeding with plans to form the so-called international maritime security force purportedly aimed at ensuring freedom of navigation in waters off Iran and Yemen. A number of oil tankers were suspiciously targeted near the Persian Gulf last month, with the US and its ally Saudi Arabia quickly blaming the Islamic Republic for the suspicious attacks. However, Tehran has rejected the accusations as unfounded, saying the suspicious incidents in the Sea of Oman appear to be false flags by "foreign players" meant to frame the Islamic Republic. Furthermore, Iran recently stopped a British vessel Stena Impero after it breached international maritime laws by crossing a prohibited maritime passage in the Strait of Hormuz. The vessel was transferred to Iran's Bandar Abbas for legal proceedings. It also stands accused of colliding with an Iranian fishing boat and ignoring its distress calls despite causing major damage to the boat. The crew of the Iranian boat also sustained critical injuries. Iran's move was immediately interpreted as a retaliatory response by Tehran to the UK's impounding of the Iran-operated oil supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar, two weeks earlier. Iranian officials have denied the claim. Tehran has strongly condemned the seizure as "maritime piracy" and has vowed to employ all its political and legal capacities to secure the release of Grace 1 and uphold its rights. Last week, US National Security Advisor John Bolton visited South Korea. His trip to the South increased speculation on a possible dispatch of soldiers and military vessels to the Persian Gulf region, an issue he was highly expected to raise during the visit and ask for South Korea's contribution to help get the the US-led initiative done. However, the deputy spokesman of South Korea's defense ministry confirmed on Monday that Seoul Bolton made no official request during his meeting with Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo last Wednesday. "We are keeping close tabs on the situation of the Strait of Hormuz to brace for various possibilities," Roh added. Washington has engaged in significant regional military buildup, including by sending an aircraft carrier, a bomber task force, an assault ship, and around 1,500 additional forces to the Middle East. Iran has repeatedly said that it does not seek military confrontations with the US, yet stands ready to defend its interests in the region.

News article:
Earlier, Washington’s senior European partners Germany, the UK and France expressed hesitation in supporting the US-led maritime security operation, citing their commitments under the Iran nuclear deal and their opposition to the US policy of “maximum pressure” against Iran. On Wednesday, Germany said that while it was not ruling out a ‘protective naval mission’ in the region, it prefers the idea of a European-led coalition to the US plans. Also Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance has not received any official request to take part in any security missions in the Strait of Hormuz. The UK announced a “European-led maritime protection mission” separate to the US proposal last week, saying it would be charged with supporting the “safe passage of both crew and cargo” through the Persian Gulf following the July 20 seizure of a UK-flagged tanker off the coast of Iran. Denmark, the Netherlands, and Italy have also reportedly expressed interest in London's proposal. The US had previously invited Germany, France, the UK, Australia, Japan, Norway, Belgium, South Korea and other countries to join its coalition. On Wednesday, a Belgian lawmaker tweeted that Brussels was considering the idea. Earlier, Japan promised to “listen carefully” to the US proposal, but refrained from committing, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe citing Tokyo’s “friendly ties with Iran.” Iran has warned both the US and the UK against moving forward with their coalition plans, and has vowed to “protect” its “1,500 miles of Persian Gulf coastline” and the surrounding waters. An estimated one third of all sea-bound oil supplies in the world pass through the Strait of Hormuz each day, with the sea passage sandwiched between Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Musandam, an exclave of Oman. The strait is just 39 km wide at some points, making it a key strategic chokepoint for global energy supplies.

The Navy wants to assure you that is not dispatching an entire fleet to the Strait of Hormuz a part of efforts to escort American commercial ships and has no plans on initiating a sequel to World War II's Battle of the Atlantic with its Iranian adversaries. "We will escort our ships as they come along, but we won't be there in great numbers, Vice Adm. Michael Gilday testified on Wednesday during his Senate confirmation hearing to become chief of naval operations. "The idea is for the regional partners to bear the lion's share of the burden." In response to Iranian provocations against commercial shipping vessels in the region over the last several months, the U.S. military is working with partners in the Middle East to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Oman. The nascent mission is called Operation Sentinel. Defense Secretary Mark Esper had previously told reporters on July 24 that the U.S. military "will be available" to escort U.S. merchant ships in the Strait of Hormuz. "In some cases, that may be strictly an overhead capability," Esper said at a media availability. "It may mean that there is a U.S. Naval warship within proximity to deter that. I don't necessarily mean that's every U.S.-flagged ship going through the strait has a destroyer right behind it." On Wednesday, Gilday said that not many U.S.-flagged or U.S.-owned ships transit the Strait of Hormuz. "The coalition that we're building in the Arabian Gulf and specifically in the Strait of Hormuz is going to be a 80- or 90-percent coalition effort," Gilday said. "A much smaller U.S. effort is primarily focused on providing intelligence support to the rest of the coalition." Since May, the Pentagon has sent additional ships, aircraft, and troops to the Middle East in response to intelligence that Iran had launched a coordinated campaign against U.S. forces and allies in the region. The U.S. military has "taken great care not to be provocative against Iran" in light of attacks on foreign ships and the shooting down of U.S. drones by Iran and its proxies, Gilday said. The additional U.S. forces that have been sent to the Middle East are meant to help de-escalate tensions with Iran so the State Department can succeed in bringing Iran back to negotiations about its nuclear program, he said. If confirmed by the Senate, Gilday would replace Adm. John Richardson, who is expected to retire in September after serving as CNO for four tumultuous years that have included two deadly ship collisions, U.S. sailors captured by Iran, the continuing fallout of the Fat Leonard Scandal, and a growing number of scandals in the Navy's special warfare community, including a SEAL platoon being sent home from Iraq amid investigations into drinking and an alleged sexual assault. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) asked Gilday how he would help Naval Special Warfare Command fix "what appears to be a troubling culture that may need attention." Gilday said ethics are extremely important to him and it is important for sailors to live up to the Navy's values, especially in combat. "I commit, senator, to getting a better understanding of those issues; to holding people accountable, if and where they need to be held accountable; to getting after the root causes and ensure if there is a problem with the culture or the community that is addressed very quickly and very firmly," Gilday said.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed on Monday that the United States will keep the Strait of Hormuz open to maritime traffic amid increasing tensions with Iran, which has repeatedly rejected U.S. overtures to come to the negotiating table. “We are gonna keep it open,” said Pompeo at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “We are going to build up a maritime security plan. Countries from all across the world who have a vested interest in keeping those waterways open will participate.” Since the United States withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, reimposing sanctions lifted under it alongside enacting new financial penalties against Iran, the regime’s activities in the Strait of Hormuz have included attacking oil tankers from numerous countries to shooting down a U.S. drone in June. U.S. President Donald Trump called off retaliatory strikes against Iran for that action, saying that such a response was “not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.” Nonetheless, the United States conducted a cyber-attack against Iran.

The United States has sought the help of other nations, including Germany, to protect the Strait of Hormuz. A source in Germany’s Foreign Ministry told Radio Farda that the United States “recently presented its concept for a maritime surveillance mission … to a number of allies, including Germany, and asked for contributions.” “The German government has taken note of this, but not promised to make any contribution,” said the source. Officials in Oman have been in contact with “all parties” to restore calm in the area, said Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi on Sunday following talks with Iranian officials in Tehran. “We have a responsibility when it comes to the Strait of Hormuz.” The United States, Great Britain and other allies will meet on Wednesday in Bahrain to discuss forming a coalition, with the United Kingdom possibly in a leading position, to protect the Persian Gulf, reported Sky News.

The request the US has made is a serious and complex one, that's why we're giving this request serious consideration. We will ultimately as we always do, decide what's in our sovereign interests." Australia vows to remain in lock-step with US "Admittedly, we have areas of difference with China. We work closely with our key partners, with our strongest alliance partner, the US, and our key trading partner, China, to pursue those issues of stability and security and prosperity." Australia is considering a "serious and complex" request from the United States to help protect oil shipments against Iranian interference in the Persian Gulf.the defence and foreign ministers of both countries met for discussions that spanned tensions with China over the South China Sea andDefence Minister Linda Reynolds confirmed she and Foreign Minister Marise Payne had canvassed the US request at Sunday's meeting but that "no decision had been made".Describing the US-Australia alliance as "unbreakable", Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hoped the junior ally would partner with America on "some of the most pressing foreign policy challenges of our time, including Iran's unprovoked attacks on international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. I am very confident that we will have a global coalition."The US has been trying to convince allies to join an international coalition to protect shipping routes in the strategic passageway, following Iran's seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker . The move came after British forces captured an Iranian oil tanker near Gibraltar , that the United Kingdom claimed was heading for Syria in a breach of European Union sanctions.While waging so many disputes across vast areas of the globe simultaneously, the Trump administration is naturally drawing on as much support as it can garner from traditional allies, including Australia.This year's round of AUSMIN talks was preceded by a bold announcement of theSecretary Esper had briefed travelling media on his flight to Sydney from Hawaii, that he would like to see the weapons deployed within "months", but did not say where they would be based or whether he had a more precise timetable in mind.Since the Cold War, America had been bound by a treaty controlling the proliferation of such missiles, but formally withdrew from it on Friday last week Even without details on numbers and locations,When asked about the issue,but emphasized that it was "not in anybody's interest for the Indo-Pacific to become more adversarial.""The presence of the US and its military forces in this region has been a force for stability for decades and Australia has consistently welcomed that force and presence," she said.The missile pronouncement is only the latest in a series of more belligerent statements the Trump administration is directing towards China.On the sidelines of the ASEAN-centered East Asia Summit of foreign ministers,Without mentioning China by name, the ministers expressed "serious concerns about negative developments in the South China Sea" and cited "credible reports of disruptive activities in relation to long-standing oil and gas projects" in the region. The trio "expressed strong opposition to any coercive unilateral actions that seek to alter the status quo and increase tensions in the area."The statement was equally blunt on unnamed "countries and their proxies" which are "willing to pursue their objectives by undertaking malicious cyber activities" and the three countries agreed to deepen practical cooperation to better deter, mitigate, attribute, and counter malicious cyber activity, and provide clear and consistent messages of the consequences of such activities".it is diplomatically brutal by the standards of Australian diplomacy and risks carrying consequences.Secretary Pompeo continued that blunt rhetoric after the AUSMIN talks, saying the world had "watched for too long as China began to behave in ways it had not done before".The US Defence Secretary went further,"This includes using predatory economics and debt for sovereignty deals and promoting state-sponsored theft of other nations' intellectual property," he said.Senator Payne's remarks were predictably more even-keeled towards Australia's most important trading partner. She stated:Australian foreign policy is built on trying to balance security alliances and shared concerns about China's rise with the economic interests of maintaining its relations with its biggest two-way trading partner Prime Minster Scott Morrison has stressed the importance of achieving both, most recently at a speech at the Asia Society in Sydney.he said.But with the Trump administration keen on placing missiles in US-friendly nations, and with Australia weighing its options for Persian Gulf naval patrols, Beijing's interest in how the Morrison Government balances its foreign policy has never been more intense.

Japan won't join the US mission either, according to Mainichi Shimbun, a local media outlet, which added that Tokyo, however, might send warships independently in order to protect its vessels in the region. Esper said that the current US administration's goal with the proposed naval mission "has always been to internationalise it" but regardless of nations' commitments, Washington would continue to provide both air and Navy-based surveillance in the turbulent region. "Nobody wants to be drawn into conflict with Iran. That's why we first proposed the idea of a coalition of like-minded allies and partners. I think the key is that there is a unity of effort, a shared commitment, if you will, to preserving freedom of navigation in the straits, in the Gulf and deterring provocative behaviour that could lead to a miscalculation that can escalate into a conflict. We want to avoid that", Esper concluded. Operation Sentinel was proposed after several incidents involving oil tankers in the region: in May, four vessels - two Saudi, one Norwegian and one Emirati - were allegedly "sabotaged" near the UAE port of Fujairah; a month later, two oil tankers - Japanese and Norwegian - were targeted in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz. Both episodes were immediately blamed on Tehran, which, in turn, vehemently denied its involvement and urged Washington and its regional allies to stop "warmongering" and "false flag ops".

Washington urges Australia to ‘be partner’ in confronting Iran in Persian Gulf standoff Russia Today – The US is seeking to pull Australia into its escalating row with Tehran, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting Canberra’s help to secure shipping routes against “unprovoked attacks” in the Strait of Hormuz. Pompeo and Pentagon chief Mark Esper met with their Australian counterparts, Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Defense Minister Linda Reynolds, in Sydney on Sunday. The US hopes Australia “will partner” with Washington and “confront the Islamic Republic of Iran’s unprovoked attacks on international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz,” Pompeo told reporters after the talks. Minister Reynolds confirmed that the US is seeking Australian help in dealing with Tehran but “no decision has been made” so far. The request the US has made is a serious and complex one, that’s why we’re giving this request serious consideration. “We will ultimately as we always do, decide what’s in our sovereign interests,” Reynolds said. The US has been trying to assemble an international naval mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf after several incidents, involving Iranian forces and foreign oil tankers, occurred in the waterways. In late July, Washington formally invited Germany to join the mission in order to help secure maritime traffic and “combat Iranian aggression” in the region. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas declined the request, saying that Berlin wanted to “avoid further escalation in the Strait of Hormuz.” Britain, whose tanker ‘Stena Impero’ was seized by Iran last month, also proposed dispatching an EU-led squadron to the Strait of Hormuz. Germany and several other European nations indicated that they are willing to consider this idea. Iran maintains that the British tanker was boarded after it had violated maritime rules as it was crossing the Strait of Hormuz.

SYDNEY, Australia (AFP) — The United States is struggling to piece together an international coalition to protect cargo ships traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, with allies concerned about being dragged into conflict with Iran. Tensions have risen in the Gulf since the United States decided in May 2018 to withdraw from a landmark accord to limit Iran’s nuclear program and began to reintroduce sanctions. But even as a series of ships have been seized in the narrow maritime thoroughfare — vital for the world’s supply of crude — European countries have been reticent about a US plan to send in military escorts. On Sunday, Australia became the latest ally seeming to give the plan a wide berth.

News article:
The US defense secretary said it's time for Tokyo to "strongly consider" joining the US-led mission. Some US allies have rejected the call, saying a European approach is the only way to tackle the unfolding crisis. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday urged Japan to join a US-led maritime security operation in the Persian Gulf. "Any and every country that has an interest in freedom of navigation and freedom of commerce needs to really consider being involved in this type of monitoring of the strait," Esper said during his first official trip abroad. Following bilateral talks, Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said he would consider how Tokyo could contribute to protecting ships in the strategic thoroughfare. However, he noted that Japan would have to take into account its relations with regional actors, including Iran. Since May, several tankers have been attacked in the Strait of Hormuz, one of the most trafficked sea passages in the world. The White House has accused Iranian forces of sabotaging ships in the strategic strait. In response, the US established a multinational operation to guarantee freedom of navigation. The UK joined it earlier this week after a British-flagged tanker was seized last month.

Akhoondi Germany opts for 'EU mission' But other US allies have rejected calls to join. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Berlin would not participate in a US-led mission due to divergent strategies on Iran. Instead, Maas said the German government is pursuing an EU observer mission in the Persian Gulf as a way to guarantee security interests in the region. "It will certainly take some time to convince the EU of this," Maas said during a visit to Poland. German officials have supported the plan, saying a European approach is the only way forward. They argue that joining a US-led operation could unintentionally drag them into a military conflict if war breaks out. "Germany should now take a lead role in an EU mission," the government's transatlantic coordinator, Peter Beyer, told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper.

The US defense secretary said it's time for Tokyo to "strongly consider" joining the US-led mission. Some US allies have rejected the call, saying a European approach is the only way to tackle the unfolding crisis. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday urged Japan to join a US-led maritime security operation in the Persian Gulf. "Any and every country that has an interest in freedom of navigation and freedom of commerce needs to really consider being involved in this type of monitoring of the strait," Esper said during his first official trip abroad. Following bilateral talks, Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said he would consider how Tokyo could contribute to protecting ships in the strategic thoroughfare. However, he noted that Japan would have to take into account its relations with regional actors, including Iran. Since May, several tankers have been attacked in the Strait of Hormuz, one of the most trafficked sea passages in the world. The White House has accused Iranian forces of sabotaging ships in the strategic strait. In response, the US established a multinational operation to guarantee freedom of navigation. The UK joined it earlier this week after a British-flagged tanker was seized last month.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Berlin would not participate in a US-led mission due to divergent strategies on Iran.

"It will certainly take some time to convince the EU of this," Maas said during a visit to Poland. German officials have supported the plan, saying a European approach is the only way forward. They argue that joining a US-led operation could unintentionally drag them into a military conflict if war breaks out. "Germany should now take a lead role in an EU mission," the government's transatlantic coordinator, Peter Beyer, told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper.

News article:
Britain has urged Australia to join the US-led mission to protect commercial ships travelling through the Strait of Hormuz from the threat of Iranian capture. Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison said he had spoken to his British counterpart Boris Johnson, who requested Canberra’s assistance in escorting ships through the Arabian Gulf. "I spoke to Boris Johnson last night and indicated to him that we were looking very carefully at our participation in this initiative, which we would see as an international initiative," Mr Morrison told reporters including Australian Associated Press on Thursday. Britain joined the US naval mission earlier this week, having previously favoured an EU-led task force being set up to protect merchant shipping in the region. However, none of Britain’s European partners committed to sending reinforcements to the Strait of Hormuz and London despatched HMS Duncan, a Type 45 Destroyer to the Strait to join HMS Montrose, a Type 23 frigate, in the Strait of Hormuz. Tensions between Britain and Iran have been rising since British forces impounded an Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 near Gibraltar last month, which it said was carrying oil to Syria in a breach of EU sanctions. Iran seized a commercial tanker flying the British flag in the Strait of Hormuz two weeks after in what was seen by many as retaliation for the Grace 1 seizure. Around 20 per cent of the world’s oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz every year. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had encouraged Australia to join in the American mission on Sunday when he met Mr Morrison on Sunday. US relations with Iran are at an all-time low since President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal, of which Britain is still a signatory. Mr Morrison said the matter was a separate issue to nuclear tensions between the Washington and Tehran. "This is about safe shipping lanes and ensuring that we can restore at least some stability to what is a very unstable part of the world at the moment," Mr Morrison said. "We've engaged with both the US and the UK in understanding what role Australia could play here." However, he was warned by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd against the move. Mr Rudd told the Sydney Morning Herald: "The idea Australian forces could in some way end up involved in a gulf crisis involving Iran is something we should take extremely seriously. "It is uncertain which way American strategy towards Iran is going to go particularly given National Security Adviser John Bolton's longstanding pathology towards the Iranians. "This region is a tinderbox and fools rush in where angels fear to tread."

Japan is mulling over deployment of the country's Self-Defence Forces to the Gulf of Oman and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait in order to escort Japanese tankers in the region amid an escalation in tensions in the Middle East, Nikkei reported on Friday. The reports also noted that Tokyo had no plans to join the US mission. Tensions in the Persian Gulf have been on the rise over the past several months. Both Washington and London announced plans to build their own coalitions in order to patrol the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Later in August, UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace stated that Britain would join a US-led maritime mission, while Germany and other countries plan to establish a European coalition.

News article:
To avoid Iran ire, Japan may send ships off Yemen: Report Press TV – Japanese government sources say Tokyo is not willing to join a US-led naval mission purportedly aimed at protecting shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf, but is mulling over sending ships off Yemen. The sources told Kyodo news agency that the administration of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is reluctant to participate in the US-led coalition of escorting vessels through the Strait of Hormuz to counter the alleged “Iran threat” amid concerns about possible damage to Tokyo-Tehran friendly ties. Earlier this week, US Pentagon chief Mark Esper urged Japan to “strongly consider” getting “involved in this type of monitoring of the strait.” As a compromise, the sources said, Japan is considering sending Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyers and P-3C Orion surveillance planes to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait between war-torn Yemen and the Horn of Africa. “We can’t just do nothing,” a senior Abe administration official said. The Japanese ships would not be part of the US-proposed mission, though the area of their operations would overlap. The Japanese government sources noted that Abe hopes to discuss the issue with US President Donald Trump during a meeting on the sidelines of a G7 summit in France later this month. The United States has been trying to persuade its allies into an international coalition with the declared aim of providing “security” for merchant shipping in the Strait of Hormuz — though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass —and other strategic Middle Eastern shipping lanes. Washington claims Tehran has played a role in two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June, without providing any credible evidence to support the accusations, which Iran has categorically rejected. Germany and France have so far rebuffed requests from the Trump administration to join the military coalition in the Persian Gulf. US pressures Germany to join coalition A spokesman for the US embassy in Berlin confirmed that Ambassador Richard Grenell and other top diplomats have pressured Germany to join the mission to no avail. “We’ve formally asked Germany to join France and the UK to help secure the Straits of Hormuz,” a senior embassy official told The Washington Free Beacon. “Members of the German government have been clear that freedom of navigation should be protected.” Recently, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas stressed that his country would not join the US-led mission, and warned that it was rather difficult to make progress on the initiative. Many German politicians have reportedly expressed grave reservations about a US-orchestrated naval mission in the Persian Gulf and fear that any such move could increase the risk of a military aggression on Iran. Iran Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami warned this week that a US-led naval coalition “will only increase regional insecurity.” Tehran says, over the course of history, Iran has been and will continue to be the most principal preserver of security and shipping freedom in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Sea of Oman.

To avoid Iran ire, Japan may send ships off Yemen: Report Iran Press TV Sat Aug 10, 2019 06:11AM Japanese government sources say Tokyo is not willing to join a US-led naval mission purportedly aimed at protecting shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf, but is mulling over sending ships off Yemen. The sources told Kyodo news agency that the administration of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is reluctant to participate in the US-led coalition of escorting vessels through the Strait of Hormuz to counter the alleged "Iran threat" amid concerns about possible damage to Tokyo-Tehran friendly ties. Earlier this week, US Pentagon chief Mark Esper urged Japan to "strongly consider" getting "involved in this type of monitoring of the strait." As a compromise, the sources said, Japan is considering sending Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyers and P-3C Orion surveillance planes to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait between war-torn Yemen and the Horn of Africa. "We can't just do nothing," a senior Abe administration official said. The Japanese ships would not be part of the US-proposed mission, though the area of their operations would overlap. The Japanese government sources noted that Abe hopes to discuss the issue with US President Donald Trump during a meeting on the sidelines of a G7 summit in France later this month. The United States has been trying to persuade its allies into an international coalition with the declared aim of providing "security" for merchant shipping in the Strait of Hormuz – though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass –and other strategic Middle Eastern shipping lanes. Washington claims Tehran has played a role in two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June, without providing any credible evidence to support the accusations, which Iran has categorically rejected. Germany and France have so far rebuffed requests from the Trump administration to join the military coalition in the Persian Gulf. US pressures Germany to join coalition A spokesman for the US embassy in Berlin confirmed that Ambassador Richard Grenell and other top diplomats have pressured Germany to join the mission to no avail. "We've formally asked Germany to join France and the UK to help secure the Straits of Hormuz," a senior embassy official told The Washington Free Beacon. "Members of the German government have been clear that freedom of navigation should be protected." Recently, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas stressed that his country would not join the US-led mission, and warned that it was rather difficult to make progress on the initiative. Many German politicians have reportedly expressed grave reservations about a US-orchestrated naval mission in the Persian Gulf and fear that any such move could increase the risk of a military aggression on Iran. Iran Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami warned this week that a US-led naval coalition "will only increase regional insecurity." Tehran says, over the course of history, Iran has been and will continue to be the most principal preserver of security and shipping freedom in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Sea of Oman.

News article:
SEOUL: A South Korean anti-piracy naval contingent has been dispatched to the Gulf of Aden on a rotational mission, following speculation that the 300-strong force could join a US-led coalition patrolling the Strait of Hormuz amid tensions with Iran. A ceremony took place on Tuesday for the 30th rotation of the Cheonghae Unit at the port city of Busan. The contingent on board the 4,400-ton destroyer Kang Gam Chan is scheduled to conduct operations to protect vessels off the Somali coast for six months from September. “As of now, the Kang Gam Chan will sail to the Gulf of Aden to carry out its routine mission,” said Defense Ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo. “We’re reviewing various options of protecting our vessels.” Capt. Lee Sang-keun, head of the 30th rotational batch, said: “We’re fully ready to conduct missions wherever our people need help.” A senior officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said on condition of anonymity: “The unit is heading for the Gulf of Aden first, then it could be dispatched to the Strait of Hormuz at the order of command.” But the officer said no formal decision has been made for the unit to join the US-led campaign. According to officials in Seoul, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper raised the issue of South Korea potentially joining the campaign during a one-on-one meeting with his counterpart Jeong Kyeong-doo on Aug. 9. Jeong reportedly expressed support for the US-led initiative to safeguard freedom of navigation, while asking for Washington’s help to resolve a trade feud with Japan. The Trump administration is maintaining its push for allies to join the coalition to protect commercial shipping in the waterway, through which 20 percent of the global oil supply flows. The route is vital for South Korea, as about 70 percent of oil imports come via the waterway. Currently, only the UK and Israel have joined the campaign. Iran has warned that such an international naval presence in the Strait of Hormuz will increase the “risk of combustion” in the region. A day after Esper visited Seoul, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Sayyed Abbas Moussawi urged South Korea to remain neutral, citing economic ties between the two nations. “(South) Korea’s possible joining of the coalition is not a good signal for us, and it will make things complicated,” Moussawi was quoted by the Yonhap news agency as saying. Rep. Kim Jong-dae of the Justice Party expressed concern that Seoul’s possible partaking in the mission would compromise the country’s economic ties with one of the largest oil exporters. “Iran is one of the largest trade partners with South Korea. Are you sending troops to the waters of Iran to protect shipping of oil from Iran? It’s absurd,” the lawmaker said in a news conference at the National Assembly on Wednesday. HIGHLIGHTS • Dispatch follows speculation that it could join US-led coalition patrolling Strait of Hormuz. • The Trump administration is maintaining its push for allies to join the coalition to protect commercial shipping in the waterway. “Once sending forces to the region, we should bear the burden of economic damage. I don’t think we’re prepared for that risk now,” added Kim, a member of the National Assembly’s Defense Committee. “I was told by a military source that the Kang Gam Chan was fitted with underwater search systems to detect torpedoes and mines ... The unit is also known to have recently been involved in training exercises to thwart drone attacks. These are clear steps to prepare for the Hormuz dispatch.” As for whether the destroyer has been armed with new defense equipment, Defense Ministry spokeswoman Choi said: “That is something that can be done depending on the needs at the site. There hasn’t been any big change (in weapons systems).” Some civic groups said the dispatch of the Cheonghae Unit must be approved by Parliament. “The Cheonghae Unit has been sent to the Gulf of Aden for the sake of international peacekeeping, but the Strait of Hormuz is a spot where military tensions between the US and Iran are escalating,” said Park Jin-seok, a member of Lawyers for Democratic Society. “Sending troops to the volatile region is against the law.”

Australia is the latest country to announce it is joining the United States-led mission to protect shipping through the Strait of Hormuz amid heightened tensions with Iran. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia would provide a frigate, a P8 maritime surveillance aircraft and support staff to the mission after a series of attacks on international merchant vessels, which the United States has blamed on Iran, and the seizure of a British tanker. "This destabilising behaviour is a threat to Australia's interests in the region," Mr Morrison told a news conference in Canberra. "The government has decided that it is in Australia's national interest to work with our international partners to contribute. Our contribution will be limited in scope and it will be time-bound," he said. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper requested Australia’s help patrolling the strategic waterway during a visit to Sydney earlier this month. Washington, which has by far the strongest Western naval contingent in the Gulf, has been calling for its allies to join it in an operation to guard shipping through the vital Strait of Hormuz. The dog-leg channel is a vital shipping route for oil and gas from the Gulf to world markets. However, Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the waterway if it is barred from selling oil due to US sanctions imposed after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal last year. Mr Trump applied widespread sanctions in May designed to block all of Iran's oil exports, the lifeblood of Tehran's economy. Iranian officials denounced the new penalties as "economic warfare". Read More Mike Pompeo warns Iran will unleash 'turmoil' next year Canberra, although keen to avoid stoking tensions, was widely expected to join the U.S.-led maritime coalition. Australia is a staunch ally of the United States, which in recent months has called on its partners to do more to defend global security. Earlier this week, Bahrain became the first Gulf nation to formally say it planned to join the US led operation. European nations initially discussed the idea of their own separate force although Germany was reluctant to provide warships and then the UK’s new Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that he intended to join the US mission. Australia’s move follows a spate of incidents – including the seizure of ships – involving Iran and Western powers, in particular, Britain and the US, centred on the vital Gulf channel. The new naval coalition was formed in response to increased tension in the Strait of Hormuz after attacks on oil tankers, which the US blamed on Iran. A British warship has already been sent to join a US-led task force. American commercial ships have been told to notify the British and US naval authorities in advance of their planned movements through Gulf waters. Iran seized the British flagged Stena Impero on July 19 in an international shipping channel just days after UK Marines stormed an Iranian vessel off Gibraltar on suspicion it was breaching EU sanctions to transport oil to Syria. The Stena Impero is still being detained but since the Iranian flagged Grace 1, now renamed Adrian Darya-1, has left Gibraltar attention has turned to the release of the British vessel. Iran's Deputy Transport Minister Mohammad Rastad said the case of Stena Impero had been submitted to a court in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, the semi-official news agency Tasnim reported, without giving a date when it would be heard.

Australia will join the United States in a security mission to protect merchant vessels travelling through key Middle East waterways after Iran seized a British-flagged vessel, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday. Foremost among the areas to be patrolled is the Strait of Hormuz, between Oman and Iran, through which about one-fifth of the world's seaborne crude flows out of the Gulf. Global commodity trading has been rocked in recent months by the seizure of the British tanker and a series of attacks on international merchant vessels that the U.S. and Britain have blamed on Iran, though it denies involvement. Britain this month became the first U.S. ally to announce its participation. "This destabilising behaviour is a threat to Australia's interests in the region," Morrison told a news conference in Canberra. "Our contribution will be limited in scope and it will be time-bound." Morrison said Australia would send a P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane to the Middle East for one month before the end of 2019, while an Australian frigate would be deployed for six months from January. Australia is a staunch ally of the United States, which in recent months has urged partners to do more for global security. Iran has denounced U.S. efforts to set up the coalition and insisted countries in the region can protect waterways and work towards signing a non-aggression pact. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Wednesday told the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI): "No amount of foreign military presence can prevent insecurity in this region. You cannot have an island of security ... while the U.S. is waging an economic war against Iran." The Gulf state of Bahrain, which hosts the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, this week became the first Arab country to announce it would join the new mission, through a tweet from its ambassador to the United States. The Bahraini government was unable to provide further details when asked by Reuters. Sources briefed on the U.S. plan had told Reuters that foreign participation could include anything from sending vessels and personnel to offering bases, logistical support, liaison officers or financing. Bahrain already serves as headquarters to the U.S.-led Combined Maritime Forces, a 33-nation alliance that carries out security and anti-piracy operations in the region. Israeli media this month quoted Foreign Minister Israel Katz as telling a closed-door meeting that Israel was part of discussions and intelligence-sharing within the new coalition, though Israeli officials declined to confirm or deny this. Katz told Israel's Ynet TV: "In general, Israel is involved in what is happening in the region in everything regarding the confrontation with Iran, putting the brakes on Iran ... The United States, which is spearheading a sanctions policy, certainly sees a partner in Israel." Most European countries, which disagree with a U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran, have been reluctant to sign up to the U.S.-led mission for fear of adding to tension in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington in 2018 from a big-power deal that had scrapped international sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
SYDNEY/DUBAI (Reuters) - Australia will join the United States in a security mission to protect merchant vessels traveling through key Middle East waterways after Iran seized a British-flagged vessel, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks during a joint press conference at the Istana Presidential Palace in Singapore, 07 June 2019. Wallace Woon/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Foremost among the areas to be patrolled is the Strait of Hormuz, between Oman and Iran, through which about one-fifth of the world’s seaborne crude flows out of the Gulf. Global commodity trading has been rocked in recent months by the seizure of the British tanker and a series of attacks on international merchant vessels that the U.S. and Britain have blamed on Iran, though it denies involvement. Britain this month became the first U.S. ally to announce its participation. “This destabilizing behavior is a threat to Australia’s interests in the region,” Morrison told a news conference in Canberra. “Our contribution will be limited in scope and it will be time-bound.” Morrison said Australia would send a P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane to the Middle East for one month before the end of 2019, while an Australian frigate would be deployed for six months from January. Australia is a staunch ally of the United States, which in recent months has urged partners to do more for global security. Iran has denounced U.S. efforts to set up the coalition and insisted countries in the region can protect waterways and work towards signing a non-aggression pact. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Wednesday told the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI): “No amount of foreign military presence can prevent insecurity in this region. You cannot have an island of security ... while the U.S. is waging an economic war against Iran.” The Gulf state of Bahrain, which hosts the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, this week became the first Arab country to announce it would join the new mission, through a tweet from its ambassador to the United States. The Bahraini government was unable to provide further details when asked by Reuters. Sources briefed on the U.S. plan had told Reuters that foreign participation could include anything from sending vessels and personnel to offering bases, logistical support, liaison officers or financing. Bahrain already serves as headquarters to the U.S.-led Combined Maritime Forces, a 33-nation alliance that carries out security and anti-piracy operations in the region. Israeli media this month quoted Foreign Minister Israel Katz as telling a closed-door meeting that Israel was part of discussions and intelligence-sharing within the new coalition, though Israeli officials declined to confirm or deny this. Katz told Israel’s Ynet TV: “In general, Israel is involved in what is happening in the region in everything regarding the confrontation with Iran, putting the brakes on Iran ... The United States, which is spearheading a sanctions policy, certainly sees a partner in Israel.” Most European countries, which disagree with a U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran, have been reluctant to sign up to the U.S.-led mission for fear of adding to tension in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington in 2018 from a big-power deal that had scrapped international sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program.

News article:
Australia has said yes to an invite from the United States to join a coalition of countries that will deploy naval ships to the Strait of Hormuz. The coalition will protect oil tankers and cargo ships from any Iranian attack. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has emphasized that his country’s involvement will be "modest, meaningful and time limited." On Wednesday morning the Prime Minister said, “This [Iran’s] destabilizing behavior is a threat to Australia's interests in the region. The government has decided that it is in Australia's national interest to work with our international partners to contribute. Our contribution will be limited in scope and it will be time bound." The Strait of Hormuz serves as the gateway to the Persian Gulf and any threat to the movement of the oil tankers will affect global oil prices. About one third of the world’s oil passes through the strait every year. Australia is particularly vulnerable as it must import over 90 percent of its fuel needs, most of it coming from the Middle East. It does get refined products from refineries in South Korea, China and Singapore. Middle East tensions, always high, were elevated again with U.S. President Donald Trump re-imposing sanctions that had been suspended by the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal. Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018. On July 4, an Iranian tanker was seized in Gibraltar, a British territory. British forces said the ship was heading to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran’s response was to use its Revolutionary Guard to seize the British oil tanker Stena Impero plus an Iraqi tanker it claimed was "smuggling fuel for some Arab countries." Responding to the question as to if the Australians would use force, the chief of the Australian Defense Force, General Angus Campbell, said, "Our people are very well-trained, and they'll be operating under international law. Their presence will be to support the security of the shipping.” Australia will send a P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft for one month in December followed by a six-month deployment of a Royal Australian Navy frigate for the first half of 2020. The reason for the coalition, aside from protecting the oil tankers, may be that the U.S. does not want to be burdened with the task of being an escort in and out of the Persian Gulf. The U.S. has a staggering amount of firepower in the area including the USS Abraham Lincoln, a Nimitz Class nuclear aircraft carrier. Trump has approved the U.S. force act as sentinels at the entrance to the gulf but wants other countries who are more dependent on Middle Eastern oil to pick up the bulk of the costs.

Australia to Join Strait of Hormuz Tanker Protection Mission By Phil Mercer August 25, 2019 Australia will send a warship and surveillance aircraft to the Persian Gulf to join an international effort to combat Iran's actions in the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world's most important shipping lanes. Australia has for several weeks been considering joining the U.S.-led military effort, which also includes Britain and Bahrain. Tensions in the region increased after United Kingdom forces helped authorities in Gibraltar seize an Iranian tanker, believing it was carrying oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions. Iran retaliated by impounding a British ship in the Persian Gulf. Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on a visit to Sydney, urged Australia to join efforts to counter "Iran's unprovoked attacks on international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz." The government in Canberra has decided to send a warship, surveillance aircraft and military personnel to join the U.S.-led mission. The navy frigate is scheduled to arrive in January. Officials believe any disruption to the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz is a "potential threat" to the Australian economy. Up to 30% of Australia's imports of refined oil is transported through the key shipping route that connects the Persian Gulf with the Arabian Sea. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it is vital oil tankers move freely through the narrow waterway. "Our decision is based on our national interest, and solely on our national interest. We have considered Australia's interest in this matter, our commitment to issues such as freedom of navigation, shipping. I went through the precise details of how much of our own oil supplies come through this pathway, and so there is a clear interest here," he said. Prime Minister Morrison has traveled to France for the G7 meeting, where Australia's involvement in the Strait of Hormuz would be discussed with world leaders. Australia has insisted its role is to de-escalate rising tensions in the region. In Canberra, the opposition Labor party has supported the military deployment, stating it was "an appropriate response". But many of the United States' allies in Europe, including Germany, have been reluctant to join the military effort, for fear of provoking open conflict with Iran.

Japan to dispatch forces to Hormuz Strait if Iran gives consent: report MNA – Japan is considering sending a Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer separately from the US-led coalition to the Persian Gulf and it will perform a mission in the Strait of Hormuz if Iran gives its consent, a Japanese newspaper reported. Japan will not join the United States in a security mission to protect merchant vessels passing through key Middle Eastern waterways and will instead consider deploying its military independently, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Tuesday. “Such a mission would be to collect information in the area based on a provision regarding survey and research activities under the Defense Ministry Establishment Law. The government is expected to make a final decision on the dispatch after the UN General Assembly meeting to be held in New York later this month,” notes the report. “According to several sources, the government’s current plan is to perform the mission in areas around the Strait of Hormuz, in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait off Yemen, and elsewhere. If Iran gives its consent, the Japanese government plans to expand the scope of its mission to the Strait of Hormuz itself.” US is leading a mission in the Persian Gulf, known as the international maritime security construct (IMSC). It has asked its allies to join the initiative. The United Kingdom, Bahrain and Australia are presently the only other countries to join the US in the Strait of Hormuz, but the UK has appealed to European allies to join the mission to safeguard shipping lanes. Key Washington allies Germany and Japan have refused to join, and France has expressed reservations about the US’ provocative initiative. On August 6, Israeli regime’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that they will be part of the US-led anti-Iran coalition. Iran reacted to the announcement, warning that Washington and Tel Aviv would be responsible for the consequences of such a decision. Tehran has condemned US efforts to form a coalition, highlighting that regional countries can provide the region with security.

News article:
TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japan will not join the United States in a security mission to protect merchant vessels passing through key Middle Eastern waterways and will instead consider deploying its military independently, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Tuesday. Japan has been reluctant to join the United States, its most important ally, in its efforts to set up the coalition because of its close economic ties with Iran, a major supplier of oil. Citing unidentified government sources, the Yomiuri said Japan was considering a plan to send its Maritime Self-Defense Force (SDF) on information-gathering missions in the areas around the Strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab shipping lane between Yemen, Djibouti and Eritrea. It would also consider including the Strait of Hormuz in the SDF's sphere of activity if Iran agrees, the paper said. Iran has denounced U.S. efforts to set up the coalition and says countries in the region can protect waterways and work towards signing a non-aggression pact. The Japanese government is set to make a final decision, including whether the plan is feasible, after the United Nations General Assembly later this month, the Yomiuri said. Global commodity trading has been rocked in recent months by the seizure of a British tanker and a series of attacks on international merchant vessels that the U.S. and Britain have blamed on Iran. Tehran denies involvement. Britain last month became the first U.S. ally to announce its participation, although most European countries have been reluctant to sign up for fear of adding to tension in the region.

News article:
WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump hinted on Monday that his administration could publish some parts of its plan for Middle East peace even before Israel’s September 17 do-over elections. Trump was asked during his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi, on the sidelines of the G7 conference in France, if the entire plan could be released before the election. “No, of course not,” he replied, echoing a statement he made last week. But he then told journalists that they “may see what the deal looks like before the election." >> Trump’s vile 'disloyalty' smear reflects fury over broken promise of Jewish reward for backing Israel | Analysis He also said that he believes “a deal will happen” because the Palestinians will want his administration to renew the financial aid it had cut off from them over the previous two years. Trump said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s failure to form a coalition government, which caused Israel to go to new elections, had “complicated” his administration’s work on the peace plan. The Trump administration team working on this issue, which is led by Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, was preparing to release the plan after the previous election in April, and was caught by surprise when another election was called. A selective leak or release of parts of the plan before September 17 could help Netanyahu secure an election victory, especially if the parts that will be published will be those more favorable to Israel. In the run-up to the April election, Trump and senior officials in his administration made multiple diplomatic gestures that were seen as advantageous to Netanyahu. Less than a month before Israelis last headed to the polls, Trump invited Netanyahu to the White House for a ceremony in which he recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Trump also featured one of Netanyahu’s campaign posters, which featured a picture of them together, on his own social media accounts. In addition, he publicly praised Netanyahu in a press conference during the election. Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also visited Israel during the election, and his itinerary included a publicized visit to the Western Wall alongside the prime minister. In the midst of a challenging campaign marred by the prime minister's corruption charges, nearly all Israeli news outlets offered broad coverage to the Trump administration's gestures towards Netanyahu. When the prime minister was struggling to assemble a government, Trump took to Twitter to say that he hoped a coalition would be formed. After the new election was called, Kushner and the team working with him on the peace plan, which includes Trump’s special envoy Jason Greenblatt, Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Kushner’s adviser Avi Berkowitz, decided to publish the plan’s economic chapter. The administration also organized a conference in Bahrain focused on the economic future of the region. No Palestinian or Israeli officials participated, although private business executives from Israel and the Palestinian territories arrived independently. The political chapter of the peace plan has not yet been revealed. The Palestinian leadership is convinced that the plan will be heavily tilted towards Israel, and has been boycotting the Trump administration on all levels except for certain security officials since December 2017, when Trump announced his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and added that he “took Jerusalem off the table."

News article:
Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here or for early 7AM access via Debut Inbox JI INTERVIEW — In an interview with JI’s Jacob Kornbluh on Tuesday, Efraim Sneh, former deputy defense minister under Ehud Olmert, expressed concern that President Donald Trump could endorse Israeli annexation in exchange for muted criticism of a new potential Iran deal. “There is a danger” that the Trump administration may announce its support for Israel annexing parts of the West Bank “to compensate” for a possible “rapprochement with Iran,” Sneh said in a phone interview. Sneh noted that he had advocated for flexibility on the Israeli-Palestinian front to help the Obama administration put together a coalition to counter Iran. Today, he said, a “boding rapprochement with Iran — which was now only delicately hinted — can be an incentive to that kind of measure,” he said. “Very dangerous steps by the Israeli government could be endorsed just for this purpose.” Sneh is one of 25 Israeli former defense officials who sent a letter to members of Congress on Tuesday expressing their appreciation for the passage of H. Res. 246, which affirmed “strong support for a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states.” [JewishInsider] On the U.S.-Israel relationship: “This administration will do everything needed to help Netanyahu win. There’s a very strong alliance between the close circle of Trump and the close circle of Netanyahu. It’s a political alliance, not a strategic alliance between the two countries. Unfortunately, there is no more bipartisanship support for Israel. It was destroyed. It will be restored only when a different government is formed in Israel.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms On the possibility of war between Israel and Hezbollah: “I think we are in a very combustible situation. But no responsible Israeli government can accept the Iranian entrenchment in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.” Sneh also observed that while it is “critically necessary” for Israel to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from developing targeted missiles, it’s a mistake for Netanyahu to break with Israel’s ambiguity over its strikes against Iranian targets. Sneh predicts that a war between Israel and Iranian proxies is just a matter of time. “If this entrancement will continue, war is unavoidable.” HEARD YESTERDAY — National Security Advisor John Bolton said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Trump’s willingness to meet with his Iranian counterpart doesn’t suggest he’s softened his stance on Iran. “He’ll meet with anybody to talk. He is a negotiator. He is a dealmaker,” Bolton said. “But talking with them does not imply… changing your position. I think if you look at what President Trump has said about the Iran nuclear deal, which he called the worst deal in U.S. diplomatic history — a view I think is amply justified by the facts — he is not going to make the same mistakes that President Obama made.” Advertisement Iranian-American journalist Jason Rezaian writes: “Like it or not, talks with Iran are coming soon: No matter how hard Trump’s Iran advisers try to demonize the Islamic republic, the regime is still being taken seriously by all the other major world powers… Tehran’s ability to exploit the divide between the United States and the rest of the world should be of grave concern. That growing rift serves to normalize the Iranian regime’s worst behaviors.” [WashPost] ON THE GROUND — Tensions between Israel and its neighboring enemies remained high on Wednesday, after Hezbollah vowed a “surprise” and “calculated” retribution against Israel. The purported strike “is being arranged in a way which wouldn’t lead to a war,” a Hezbollah source told Reuters. “The direction now is for a calculated strike, but how matters develop, that’s another thing.” An Associated Press headline on Tuesday declared that “Israel’s shadow war with Iran bursts into the open.” AP’s Aron Heller wrote that the events of the past few days “have raised tensions at a particularly fraught time. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is looking to project strength three weeks before national elections, while Iran has taken a series of provocative actions in recent months aimed at pressuring European nations to provide relief from crippling U.S. sanctions.” Meanwhile, three Hamas police officers were killed in explosions in Gaza late Tuesday. Israel said it was not involved in the suspected suicide bombings, which are believed to have been carried out by Salafi militants challenging Hamas’s rule. Robert Malley and Naysan Rafati of the International Crisis Group write… “Israel-Iran tensions could threaten prospects for Trump-Rouhani meeting: In the midst of French efforts to de-escalate tensions between Tehran and Washington… the conflict between Israel and Iran may have entered a dangerous new stage… Previous escalations between Iran and Israel in Syria have been contained… The current escalation is drawing in a far wider range of actors and is hitting closer to Iran’s core interests, making it that much more difficult to prevent, contain or control.” [Axios] Seth Frantzman writes… “Israel’s strategy against Tehran: Revealing the Iranian threat: Air strikes on Iran’s network of proxies force the network out of the shadows. It can’t hide in villas in southern Syria, or launch drones at night, or stockpile ballistic missiles in Iraq if it is looking over its shoulder and increasingly making mistakes through its aggressive and open threats. Iran is used to playing a double game of moderates and hard-liners, sending its smiling foreign minister to the recent G7 while boasting of its allies’ drone technology striking Saudi Arabia.” [NationalReview] Advertisement Jonathan Spyer writes: “The Iran-Israel war is here: This war is a very 21st-century affair. For now it involves only small circles among the Israeli and Iranian populations… But it won’t necessarily stay that way. A single kinetic and successful Iranian response to Israel’s airstrikes could rapidly precipitate an escalation to a much broader contest. State-to-state conflict has returned to the Middle East.” [WSJ] TALK OF THE CITY — A 64-year-old hassidic Jewish man was brutally attacked with a rock at a park in Crown Heights yesterday. Rabbi Avraham Gopin was walking through Brooklyn’s Lincoln Terrace Park when a man threw a rock at him. Gopin approached the man, who punched him in the face and then hit him with another rock, knocking out several of his front teeth. The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the attack, and released videofootage of the alleged attacker. New York City Councilman Chaim Deutsch (D-Brooklyn) told JI’s Jacob Kornbluh on Tuesday that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is spending too much time on the campaign trail and not devoting enough attention and resources to the surge of violent antisemitic attacks in Brooklyn. “Whether he is here or not, de Blasio should make sure that his administration is on top of things, especially when he had made that commitment to open [a mayoral hate crimes] office in June,” Deutsch said. “We are in a moment where we need to tackle these issues head on. We can’t just ignore them thinking it’s going to go away. The mayor needs to realize that if he makes a commitment, he needs to make good on it.” In June, de Blasio declared the immediate opening of a mayoral office to combat the rise in antisemitism, which “will work to root out hate and make our streets safer.” But little action appears to have been taken since then. “We are already in August, and I still haven’t heard anything about it being active or anyone being hired,” Deutsch said. “The commitment was made by the mayor that he’s going to have this open by June. We are waiting for this [to be] implemented.” [JewishInsider] On Tuesday, de Blasio tweeted that “the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating this despicable act of violence, and we will find the attacker. This city will stop at nothing to protect our communities from hate and violence.” TALK OF THE NATION — Incoming Harvard freshman deported after visa revoked — by Shera S. Avi-Yonah and Delano R. Franklin:“U.S. officials deported [Ismail B.] Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, Friday night shortly after he arrived at Boston Logan International Airport. Before canceling Ajjawi’s visa, immigration officers subjected him to hours of questioning — at one point leaving to search his phone and computer — according to a written statement by Ajjawi. University officials are currently working to resolve the matter before classes begin on Sept. 3, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email.” [TheCrimson; WashPost] Advertisement TOP TALKER — New York Times columnist Bret Stephens deactivated his Twitter account on Tuesday after inviting David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at The George Washington University — who called him a ‘bedbug’ — to his home to meet his wife and kids and insult him to his face. “Time to do what I long ago promised to do,” he wrote. “Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologize for any part I’ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I’ve ever hurt.” Stephens defended his action in an interview on MSNBC Live with Stephanie Ruhle: “Analogizing people to insects is always wrong. We can be better… There’s a bad history of being analogized to insects that goes back to a lot of totalitarian regimes in the past.” Karpf responded to Stephens in Esquire: “No one has freer speech than a public intellectual with a regular column in the paper of record. Stephens is free to say whatever he wants. With that freedom comes the discomfort that people will disagree with you. If Stephens is going to have this social power, he is going to have to learn to wield it more responsibly.” [Esquire] George Washington University’s provost, Forrest Maltzman, invitedthe Times columnist for a campus discussion on civil discourse. Stephens toldThe Washington Post that he accepted the invitation “and we will find a date in the fall.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) mocked Stephens in a tweet: “Imagine being on Twitter and having the worst thing you’re called in a given day is ‘bedbug.’ My own friends roast me harder than that

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to arrange "a dramatic diplomatic gesture" from US President Donald Trump to help him win the upcoming Israeli election, reported Haaretz. According to the paper, recent weeks have seen "intensive talks" between Netanyahu's advisers and people close to Trump "over a potential statement by the American president, in which he could commit to protecting Israel in the future from any existential threat". The idea of a presidential statement was reportedly "born out of the broader initiative of creating a 'defence pact' between the United States and Israel", said Haaretz, a pact "under discussion since the 1990s" but never implemented. While "discussions on the subject have been revived" in recent months, signing such a pact "would require the involvement of the Pentagon and other US government agencies", with negotiations potentially lasting for months. READ: Netanyahu seeks Trump go-ahead for Israel's West Bank annexation to help win election The chances of completing such an agreement before the 17 September elections, therefore, are "almost non-existent". Meanwhile, the pact also has its opponents amongst Israeli military officials both past and present, which could present Netanyahu with a problem. #IsraElex19: Israeli Elections 2019 Everything you need to know >> Other options apparently being discussed include a "joint announcement about the start of negotiations over a future defence pact". This would "help Netanyahu politically in the short-term and could also help Trump as the president strives to present himself as Israel's greatest supporter." Another potential "gesture" is "a presidential statement by Trump that the United States under his leadership will help Israel militarily in any case of a future existential threat". Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked in a radio interview if the US would support Israel during a military conflict.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in talks with advisers close to U.S. President Donald Trump about the possibility of arranging a dramatic diplomatic gesture ahead of Israel’s Sept. 17 elections, according to a report in Israeli daily Haaretz. One option reportedly being discussed is an American statement of intent for the creation of a “defense pact” with Israel. Such a “pact” could consist of a statement by Trump that the United States is committed to Israel’s defense, or it could be a more significant declaration by both leaders of their intention to enter into a formal mutual defense agreement at some future date. The two countries already have very close military and intelligence cooperation, but the idea of a formal defense pact is highly controversial in the Israeli defense establishment, due to concerns that Israel’s operational flexibility would be severely limited by such an agreement. Two weeks before the April election, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in talks with President Trump for a diplomatic gesture designed to help boost Netanyahu’s election bid ahead of the Sept. 17 Israeli election. According to Haaretz, the two leaders’ advisers have discussed a statement from Trump in which he pledges to safeguarding Israel against any future threat to its existence. Netanyahu is also reportedly in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin for a similar gesture, such as an official visit to Israel or a meeting of the three countries’ national security advisers, according to the outlet. {mosads}An official defense pact between Israel and the U.S. has been under discussion since the 1990s but never solidified, though the idea has come into focus again in recent months. There is likely not enough time until the Sept. 17 election to reach a deal in negotiations, as signing such a defense pact would require involvement by the Pentagon and other U.S. federal agencies, Haaretz noted. Some leaders within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are skeptical of such an agreement, Haaretz reported, with some expressing concerns it would “tie the hands” of the IDF later on. In turn, some diplomats have reportedly discussed instead holding a joint announcement of the beginning of negotiations about a defense pact, according to Haaretz. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump’s most vocal allies in the Senate, said last month on a conference call with the Jewish Institute for National Security of America that he has discussed the idea with Trump. Last week, asked by conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt whether the U.S. would support Israel in a military conflict, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded “We’re constantly in conversations about that, making sure that we collectively have defense systems capabilities that are appropriate for their needs.” “I have every confidence this president, who moved our embassy and who made clear Israel’s rights in the Golan Heights, will do all that is necessary to ensure that our great partner in Israel will be protected,” Pompeo added, according to Haaretz. The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s peace plan will be released “immediately” after Israel’s elections later this month. Netanyahu made the remark at a Likud campaign event in the northern city of Kiryat Ata, while assailing his political rivals for their positions on Iran and an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. “Who do you want to be dealing with talks over the Deal of the Century of President [Donald] Trump, which will be coming in just a bit, immediately after the elections?” he asked supporters. He did not give a specific date for the release of the long-delayed proposal. Last Wednesday, US special envoy Jason Greenblatt tweeted that the Trump administration had decided against releasing the plan until after elections, after Trump appeared to toy with the idea of rolling it out before the September 17 vote.

I believe it will likely be very soon after the election.” Last month, Trump was asked by reporters at the G7 summit whether he planned to introduce the political portion of his administration’s peace plan before Israel’s elections. He first said, “No of course not,” but moments later added, “but I think you may see what the deal is before the election,” sparking confusion as to Washington’s intentions. Trump’s Mideast peace plan was supposed to roll out over the summer, but unveiling of the plan was delayed after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following the April elections and called a fresh vote. Advertisement The US has so far kept the political elements of its plan under wraps, while the economic aspects of it were presented in June by Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner at an American-led conference in Bahrain. The economic side of the plan would see a $50 billion investment package for the Palestinians and the wider region. The Palestinians skipped the Bahrain conference and have rejected the peace plan outright, pressing on with their boycott of the administration since Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December 2017 and cut Palestinian aid. The Trump administration has since cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians, including all of its support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees and nearly $200 million earmarked for humanitarian programs in the West Bank and Gaza. Netanyahu says he is willing to wait and see the contents of the plan, but has reiterated he will not compromise on Israel’s security or evacuate settlements. No details have been published so far about how the plan tackles key issues such as a potential independent Palestinian state, Israeli control over the West Bank, the fate of Jerusalem and the so-called right of return for Palestinians to homes from which their families fled or were expelled after Israel’s creation in 1948. US officials have indicated that they will back “Palestinian autonomy” and self-governance, but stop short of endorsing the establishment of a Palestinian state.

News article:
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) said he would work with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he’s elected president, voicing openness to working with a leader criticized by many Democrats. “I would do everything I could to work with Prime Minister Netanyahu if he is in power and if I am lucky enough to serve as president, and to support the U.S.-Israel relationship,” O’Rourke said in an interview with Haaretz published Thursday. {mosads}Several 2020 Democrats have panned Netanyahu over his policies regarding the Palestinians, with O’Rourke blasting him as “racist” in April and saying, “We must be able to transcend his current leadership.” The Texas Democrat doubled down on his support for the two-state solution this week, noting that his potential efforts to work with Netanyahu are “not mutually exclusive to ensuring that the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people is not compromised or undermined or ended all together.” “It is the only way that I think you achieve those goals of human dignity and security, self-determination and the safety that people should be able to depend on in their day-to-day lives,” he told Haaretz. While the relationship between Washington and Jerusalem continues to enjoy bipartisan support in Washington, Netanyahu in particular has come under withering criticism from Democrats over the ongoing occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The prime minister was further criticized for his recent decision to block Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) from visiting Israel over the support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. Across the aisle, Netanyahu has seen his stock among the GOP rise due to his close relationship with President Trump. Jerusalem scored significant wins after Trump declared last year the U.S. would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the capital city and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights this year.

News article:
Jason Greenblatt, a key architect of President Donald Trump's troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, announced his resignation Thursday. His departure places another question mark over the much-delayed initiative, which the White House has touted as the "opportunity of the century," but has yet to see the light of day and has been rejected in advance by the Palestinians. Greenblatt, who worked for two and a half years alongside Trump's powerful son-in-law Jared Kushner, said in a statement that his plan had been "a vision for peace." Kushner lauded him as someone "trusted and respected by all of the leaders throughout the region." A senior administration official said Greenblatt was going to spend more time with his family but left on good terms and "holds the confidence of the president." For all the warm words, Greenblatt's departure only adds to the sense that Trump's promise to transform the US approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is floundering. Just a week ago, Greenblatt signaled the latest pushback to the plan's unveiling, saying it would not be released until after Israel's September 17 election, which will decide whether Trump ally Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power. Ilan Goldenberg, a Middle East negotiator in former US president Barack Obama's government, said another election -- the US presidential polls in November next year -- could be the real reason for a hold up. "Let me translate this for you," he tweeted after Greenblatt's announcement. "Kushner's Mideast peace plan will not see the light of day before November 2020 if at all (my bet is on never)." 'Good riddance' Trump has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history. He has slashed aid to the Palestinians, while making big concessions to the Israelis, including formalizing US recognition of the divided city of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. According to the Republican, his concept for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolves around encouraging massive economic investment, hoping that money will speak louder than political divides. However, Palestinian leaders have dismissed the plan as one-sided and failing to address their wish to end Israeli occupation and the expansion, encouraged by Netanyahu, of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land. Greenblatt "was an apologist for the most extreme, hardline government in the history of Israel," Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, told AFP. "Nobody ever saw him as evenhanded or neutral in any way. He was totally committed not to peace but to the justification of all Israeli violations," she said. "I think the Palestinians as a whole are going to say good riddance." Critics of the Trump push have also criticized his choice of key personnel: Kushner and Greenblatt, a former lawyer for Trump's businesses, are both Orthodox Jews and have long ties to Israel, but no previous foreign policy or diplomatic experience. One of the aides tapped by the White House on Thursday to fill Greenblatt's shoes, Avi Berkowitz, only graduated from Harvard Law School in 2016. 'Vision' Israeli authorities, however, were sorry to see Greenblatt go. Netanyahu thanked Greenblatt "for his dedicated work for security and peace and for never hesitating to tell the truth about the state of Israel to its detractors." A senior Trump administration official echoed that sentiment, underlining Greenblatt's role in the steadily intensifying nature of Washington's support for Israel. "Jason was instrumental, together with others in the administration, when the president recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights," the official said. "Jason has also been instrumental in helping to reframe the discussions about the conflict, using the approach that a real peace can only be built on truth." The question is when Greenblatt's plan will finally emerge and whether it will gain traction. According to the White House official, "the vision is now complete and will be released when appropriate."

News article:
While in Argentina on Thursday, first daughter Ivanka Trump responded to the sudden resignation news of the administration's Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt by talking up the peace plan that Greenblatt played a heavy role in designing along with her husband Jared Kushner. Asked if Greenblatt's departure would affect the yet-to-be-released Middle East peace plan, Trump replied to Bloomberg senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs: "No." The president's daughter and senior White House adviser said Greenblatt's exit had been planned "for some time" and that his job was hard on his six children. "We love Jason, so he's always additive to the team," Trump said. "But the plan's in a great place." Trump declined to comment further, telling Jacobs it was the "wrong trip." “No,” Ivanka told me in Argentina when I asked if Greenblatt exit will affect peace plan. Departure planned “for some time.” Job hard on his 6 kids. “We love Jason, so he’s always additive to the team. But the plan’s in a great place.” She wouldn’t say more. “Wrong trip.” https://t.co/h7Y5ASJTWd — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) September 5, 2019 President Donald Trump on Twitter Thursday morning announced that Greenblatt "will be leaving to pursue work in the private sector" after nearly three years with the administration and said "Jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer." "His dedication to Israel and to seeking peace between Israel and the Palestinians won't be forgotten," the president continued. "He will be missed. Thank you Jason!" The special envoy for Middle East peace has worked hand-in-hand with senior White House adviser Kushner on the peace plan since early 2017. But its release has been long delayed, most recently due to Israel's September 17 election in which the country's longest-serving prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is up for reelection. Greenblatt has traveled with Kushner to the Middle East to gather support for the plan, the details of which have not been revealed. Palestinian leaders so far have voiced disapproval of the proposal. Like Kushner, Greenblatt lacked government experience before joining the Trump administration. But Greenblatt, who was a top lawyer for the Trump Organization, made a positive impression on Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the start of his service as an envoy. The date of Greenblatt's departure and whether he will still be with the administration if and when the plan is unveiled, remains unclear. Kushner stated that Greenblatt "has done a tremendous job leading the efforts to develop an economic and political vision for a long sought after peace in the Middle East," and said that Greenblatt will continue to be a "close friend and partner." Ivanka Trump, promoting the administration's Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative in South America this week, often defends her husband when he faces criticism.

News article:
1. Here we go again: A New York Times expose has revealed that Israel is once again considering taking military action against Iran’s nuclear program. According to the report, Netanyahu sees an opportunity with the more pliable US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, after his predecessor vociferously opposed such action. “More than a decade after they first raised the subject with American officials, Israeli officials have been considering the possibility of a unilateral strike against Iran. Unlike with Bush and Obama, there is greater confidence that Trump wouldn’t stand in the way,” Ronen Bergman and Mark Mazzetti write. “The threat of war could be a bluff, or an election ploy. But it also represents a dangerous confluence of interests: an American president often reluctant to use military force and an Israeli prime minister looking to deal with unfinished business,” they add. If it were an election bluff, one might expect to find the story leading Likud mouthpiece Israel Hayom, but instead the daily buries its report in the expose on the bottom of page 9, and leads not with the threat but rather information about the strike that was called off. Electioneering in Israel is also not so subtle. A Twitter user named Amir Peleg points out that a Likud ad showing Democtratic Camp politico Ehud Barak and Joint List Ayman Odeh together mimics another ad showing Hezbollah leader Hassaan Nasrallah and Iranian leader Hassan Rouhani together, with the text on both reading “They don’t want you to vote for us.” Colin Kahl, who had a key role in crafting the Obama administration’s Iran policy, also thinks the threat is serious, though Netanyahu isn’t actually planning on leading the charge: “As the top Pentagon civilian overseeing Middle East policy during much of the period discussed here, my sense was that Netanyahu was serious about striking Iran, but his main goal was to use the threat to get the US to do it. That remains the case today,” he tweets. As the top Pentagon civilian overseeing Middle East policy during much of the period discussed here, my sense was that Netanyahu was serious about striking Iran, but his main goal was to use the threat to get the US to do it. That remains the case today. https://t.co/8cO7RGtIdQ — Colin Kahl (@ColinKahl) September 4, 2019 2. We were thiiiis close: While the newer plans make the biggest headlines, much of the 10,000-word expose is focused on how close Israel came to striking Iran around 2012. Ultimately, according to Netanyahu, it was not US opposition that drew him back, but a lack of support at home. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “If I’d had a majority, I would have done it. Unequivocally,” Netanyahu was quoted as saying by the Times. Former diplomat Alon Pinkas notes that the upshot of that admission is that it was Likud ministers who stopped the attack. “Not president Shimon Peres, IDF chief Gabi Ashkenazi or Mossad head Meir Dagan. Likud ministers in the cabinet.” It’s worth noting that the Likud-led cabinet of 2012, with relative moderates such as Dan Meridor and Benny Begin, was a very different animal from the cabinet of today. Michael Oren, then ambassador to the US, tells the Times that he was pretty much in the same mode as all of us journalists back then, sleeping with one eye open and a phone nearby: “I went to bed every night, if I went to bed at all, with the phone close to my ear. I was ready to be called in by Israel and sent to the White House or the State Department to tell them we had attacked, or if they already knew from their own sources, straight to CNN.” Am I the only news person who wakes up every morning thinking "Please don't attack Iran (during my shift)"? Posted by Josh Davidovich on Monday, August 20, 2012 Among other tidbits in the monster piece (helpfully rounded up by JTA’s Ben Sales, among others), is the fact that the US built a massive replica of the Fordo nuclear site to test dropping bunker-busting bombs on it, and would send US officials to Israel every few weeks knowing Israel would not attack then, in a move it called “bibisitting.” Bibi himself embraced the bibisitting concept in a campaign ad in 2015, meaning the US was bibi-sitting the bibi-sitter. Advertisement 3. Bombs over Beirut? Israel Hayom isn’t the only paper to care little about the New York Times expose, which fails to make anything more than a perfunctory plop in Hebrew-language media. Even Yedioth Ahronoth, whom Ronen Bergman writes for, only runs the story on page 10 (with a write-up by different author.) Instead, most Hebrew news reports about Iran are focused on Iranian proxy Hezbollah and the threats of a third Lebanon war, after six years of reportedly bombing the group in Syria only. Channel 12 news reports that the army has decided to deploy a number of Patriot anti-missile batteries in the north of the country, possible presaging more violence. On Army Radio, Foreign Minister Israel Katz continues to threaten attacks on Hezbollah and hints that Lebanese civilian infrastructure could be inbounds as well: “What was in 2006, when Israel differentiated between Hezbollah and Lebanon, won’t happen this time. … If Hezbollah hits us from Lebanon we’ll strike back at dual-purpose sites, anything that can serve Hezbollah and the Lebanese population.” Several reports, seemingly fed by the army, have accused Hezbollah of hiding military equipment in civilian areas, likely laying the groundwork to justify such attacks. In Israel Hayom’s English site, columnist Rachel Avraham says Hezbollah is pursuing a “callous strategy” by placing missiles in homes, quoting ex-minister Naftali Bennett claiming that some homes in Lebanon are actually built around missiles: “This happens primarily in Shiite villages but not only. You got villages where 30 to 40% of the houses are hosting missiles right now. The rest of the villages are booby-trapped,” she quotes him saying. 4. The price is wrong: The Israeli media is also closely following the demise of the nuclear deal and Tehran’s threats to walk back from the agreement and possibly ratchet up enrichment. In Yedioth, columnist Ben-Dror Yemini lashes out at France for trying to extend a $15 billion line of credit to Iran as part of a plan to salvage the pact. “The French proffer to Iran is actually anti-Israel. What it means in the immediate term is another green light to Tehran to continue entrenching itself along the northern axis, and that means more bases in Syria and Iraq, more help for Hezbollah, [and] more money for Qassem Soleimani.” France isn’t the only one trying to pay off Iranians. The Financial Times reports that US diplomat Brian Hook, who heads up the Iran talks portfolio for the State Department and clearly was a Nigerian prince with money stashed away in a previous life, offered the captain of an Iranian tanker millions of dollars to pilot the ship somewhere where the US could have it impounded. Hard to overstate how out of ordinary this is. For a high ranking State Dep. official to attempt to bribe a ship captain. Then when the guy didn’t bite they sanctioned him. Kind of following their model in dealing with #Iran FM Zarif: Come see #Trump or we will sanction you. pic.twitter.com/tdqRpkFhs8 — Bahman Kalbasi (@BahmanKalbasi) September 4, 2019 5. London calling: A lightning trip by Netanyahu to the UK to meet with Boris Johnson is also seen through a security lens. Army Radio notes air force chief Amikam Norkin and operations head Aharon Halija are joining the trip, calling it a “security flight.” Meeting the two in London will be US Defense Chief Mark Esper. Haaretz notes that while talks with Johnson will focus on Iran, those with Esper will laser in on Israel’s “security needs.” What’s the difference? “In recent weeks, there have been intensive talks between some of Netanyahu’s advisers and people close to US President Donald Trump over a potential statement by the American president, in which he could commit to protecting Israel in the future from any existential threat,” the paper reports. Yedioth Ahronoth calls the visit part of a “diplomatic blitz,” describing the maneuver as something “that has become routine during election campaigns for Netanyahu.” Standing next to the wobbly Johnson could also make Netanyahu, who has presided over a transition government for going on nine months, look like the picture of staid stability. Definitely the UK's turn to be Most Dysfunctional Democracy on the planet this week. Painful to watch, but US, Israel, others appreciate the break from contending for the top spot. Advertisement — Dan Shapiro (@DanielBShapiro) September 4, 2019 “Entangled by corruption allegations that make his electoral performance hard to predict, Netanyahu is relying heavily on external events and support to bolster his campaign,” The Guardian notes. 6. Like an election on Stuxnet: For those charged with doing the diplomacy behind the blitzing, the election has already kicked off, as Israel’s envoy in Wellington marks the official start of voting almost two weeks before the rest of the country will get a chance. In the meantime, electioneering is kicking into high gear, the spin machine running like an Iranian centrifuge infected by a Dutch mole. “The centrist Kahol Lavan slate is looking to draw votes from the left and from Yisrael Beitenu on the right. Labor-Gesher is dispatching cars with full-size replicas of the Iron Dome anti-missile system mounted on them,” Haaretz reports in a roundup of all the silly-season madness. “The Democratic Union is trying to position itself as the only address in its political bloc for those who don’t want to strengthen Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, while United Torah Judaism is reaching out to non-ultra-Orthodox voters.” Despite all the craziness, Bloomberg’s Ivan Levingston notes that the whole campaign is singularly focused on Netanyahu: “Missing in virtually all the political messaging is any reference to the fundamental issues Israel faces: relations with the Palestinians, potential conflicts with Iran, Lebanon, or Syria, a widening budget deficit, and the divide between religious and secular Jews. Instead, Israel’s second national vote in five months has become a referendum on Netanyahu.” Haaretz’s Allison Kaplan-Sommer notes that many on the left, already decided on being against Netanyahu, are torn on who they are for. “Dizzying rounds of political musical chairs as the opposition fails to unite into a large-scale bloc against Netanyahu has many left-wingers frustrated, confused and undecided. Some are considering voting for parties they never considered supporting in the past. Some even confess quietly that, for the first time ever, they are toying with the idea of not voting at all,” she writes. 7. Out, damn extremist: On the right, Likud has chosen Itamar Ben Gvir of Otzma Yehudit as its enemy du jour after he refused overtures to drop out and save the right-wing camp.

Hard to overstate how out of ordinary this is. For a high ranking State Dep. official to attempt to bribe a ship captain. Then when the guy didn’t bite they sanctioned him. Kind of following their model in dealing with #Iran FM Zarif: Come see #Trump or we will sanction you. pic.twitter.com/tdqRpkFhs8 — Bahman Kalbasi (@BahmanKalbasi) September 4, 2019 5. London calling: A lightning trip by Netanyahu to the UK to meet with Boris Johnson is also seen through a security lens. Army Radio notes air force chief Amikam Norkin and operations head Aharon Halija are joining the trip, calling it a “security flight.” Meeting the two in London will be US Defense Chief Mark Esper. Haaretz notes that while talks with Johnson will focus on Iran, those with Esper will laser in on Israel’s “security needs.” What’s the difference? “In recent weeks, there have been intensive talks between some of Netanyahu’s advisers and people close to US President Donald Trump over a potential statement by the American president, in which he could commit to protecting Israel in the future from any existential threat,” the paper reports. Yedioth Ahronoth calls the visit part of a “diplomatic blitz,” describing the maneuver as something “that has become routine during election campaigns for Netanyahu.” Standing next to the wobbly Johnson could also make Netanyahu, who has presided over a transition government for going on nine months, look like the picture of staid stability. Definitely the UK's turn to be Most Dysfunctional Democracy on the planet this week. Painful to watch, but US, Israel, others appreciate the break from contending for the top spot. Advertisement — Dan Shapiro (@DanielBShapiro) September 4, 2019 “Entangled by corruption allegations that make his electoral performance hard to predict, Netanyahu is relying heavily on external events and support to bolster his campaign,” The Guardian notes. 6. Like an election on Stuxnet: For those charged with doing the diplomacy behind the blitzing, the election has already kicked off, as Israel’s envoy in Wellington marks the official start of voting almost two weeks before the rest of the country will get a chance. In the meantime, electioneering is kicking into high gear, the spin machine running like an Iranian centrifuge infected by a Dutch mole. “The centrist Kahol Lavan slate is looking to draw votes from the left and from Yisrael Beitenu on the right. Labor-Gesher is dispatching cars with full-size replicas of the Iron Dome anti-missile system mounted on them,” Haaretz reports in a roundup of all the silly-season madness. “The Democratic Union is trying to position itself as the only address in its political bloc for those who don’t want to strengthen Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, while United Torah Judaism is reaching out to non-ultra-Orthodox voters.” Despite all the craziness, Bloomberg’s Ivan Levingston notes that the whole campaign is singularly focused on Netanyahu: “Missing in virtually all the political messaging is any reference to the fundamental issues Israel faces: relations with the Palestinians, potential conflicts with Iran, Lebanon, or Syria, a widening budget deficit, and the divide between religious and secular Jews. Instead, Israel’s second national vote in five months has become a referendum on Netanyahu.” Haaretz’s Allison Kaplan-Sommer notes that many on the left, already decided on being against Netanyahu, are torn on who they are for. “Dizzying rounds of political musical chairs as the opposition fails to unite into a large-scale bloc against Netanyahu has many left-wingers frustrated, confused and undecided. Some are considering voting for parties they never considered supporting in the past. Some even confess quietly that, for the first time ever, they are toying with the idea of not voting at all,” she writes. 7. Out, damn extremist: On the right, Likud has chosen Itamar Ben Gvir of Otzma Yehudit as its enemy du jour after he refused overtures to drop out and save the right-wing camp.

News article:
Jason Greenblatt, a key architect of President Donald Trump's much-delayed Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, announced his resignation Thursday. Greenblatt, who worked alongside Trump's powerful son in law Jared Kushner, said in a statement it had been "the honor of a lifetime" to work in the White House. A senior administration official said Greenblatt was going to spend more time with his family but left on good terms and "holds the confidence of the president." His departure places another question mark over the troubled plan, which Trump has touted as the "deal of the century," but has yet to see the light of day and has been rejected in advance by the Palestinians. Just a week ago, Greenblatt signalled the latest pushback to the plan's unveiling, saying it would not be released until after the September 17 Israeli election that will decide whether Trump ally Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power. Trump has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history. He has slashed aid to the Palestinians, while making big concessions to the Israelis. According to the Republican, his vision for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolves around encouraging massive economic investment. However, Palestinian leaders have dismissed the plan as one-sided and failing to address their wish to end Israeli occupation. Netanyahu said after news of Greenblatt's departure that he thanked him "for his dedicated work for security and peace and for never hesitating to tell the truth about the state of Israel to its detractors." Trump tweeted that Greenblatt "has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer." However, Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, told AFP: "I think the Palestinians as a whole are going to say good riddance."

News article:
The long-awaited US plan for Middle peace will be unveiled within weeks, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, contrary to expectations that it could be delayed after one of its architects resigned last week. President Donald Trump's administration pushed back the unveiling of the plan earlier this year after Israel unexpectedly headed back to new elections to be held September 17. Fresh questions arose on Thursday when Jason Greenblatt, Mr Trump's Middle East adviser, resigned. But Mr Pompeo dismissed speculation of a substantial new delay. "We've been consulting broadly throughout the region for two and a half years now and I think in the coming weeks we'll announce our vision," Mr Pompeo said during a visit to his home state of Kansas. "And hopefully the world... will see that as a building block, a basis on which to move forward," he said. He said Middle East peace was "a difficult problem, one that ultimately those two peoples will have to resolve for themselves, but we've worked hard on that". The Palestinian Authority has cut off formal contact with the Trump administration, saying it was not an honest broker after taking a series of pro-Israel decisions such as recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The administration has started to describe its upcoming proposal as a "vision" rather than a plan, leading observers to wonder whether Washington will offer more of a statement of principles rather than seek to broker a major agreement. Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the pother architect of the plan, launched the administration's peace initiative in June with a conference in Bahrain to attract $50 billion worth of in investment in the region once the Palestinians agreed to a political deal. The Palestinian leadership boycotted the conference, accusing the Trump administration of ignoring key political issues and trying to buy its acceptance of Israeli rule. Mr Kushner has repeatedly said that the other, political component of the peace plan would follow. Meanwhile, Israeli-Palestinian violence across the Israel-Gaza border claimed two lives since Friday. Israeli aircraft and tanks struck a number of Hamas military targets in response to rockets fired from the Palestinian enclave, the military said on Saturday. The exchange came after two Palestinian teenagers were killed by Israeli fire during the weekly Palestinian protests on the Gaza border on Friday. Later on Saturday, a drone launched from southern Gaza crossed into Israeli airspace, the army said, and "dropped what seems to be an explosive device" near the security fence, damaging a military vehicle before returning to Gaza. In response, an Israeli aircraft targeted the squad which launched the drone, the army said.

US puts Kushner's 'coffee boy' in charge of Mideast peace Iran Press TV Sun Sep 8, 2019 06:09PM US President Donald Trump's new Middle East envoy is a 30-year-old White House administrative assistant who used to run errands and get coffee for his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a new report states. Trump announced Thursday that Avi Berkowitz will replace former envoy Jason Greenblatt, who announced his resignation the day before. A Harvard Law School graduate who finished his studies in 2016, Berkowitz has zero foreign policy experience except for being Kushner's right-hand-man. He also joined the Trump campaign in 2016. The Business Insider, in a 2017 article, quoted former White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks as saying that Berkowitz's main duties had been "daily logistics like getting coffee and coordinating meetings" as Kushner's close aide. A former employer of the new man in charge of America's Middle East peace efforts also said on Twitter that he was "not very impressive and needed significant hand-holding to handle even simple assignments. But Mideast peace? I'm sure he's got this!" A Middle East expert described Berkowitz as "a glorified intern," according to the Telegraph. Jasmine El-Gamal, a former Middle East advisor to the Pentagon said the appointment shows the Trump administration's "lack of seriousness" in their plans to broker peace in the Middle East. "They are not even pretending otherwise by hiring a qualified person as an envoy," she told the British media outlet. Berkowitz's background as a Zionist, a trait he shares with both Kushner and Greenblatt, has also raised concerns in various political circles. The young diplomat inherits America's so-called "deal of the century" peace deal, which was masterminded by Kushner and Greenblatt as the ultimate solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The deal, which has already been rejected by the Palestinians and the international community, seeks to do away with Palestinian's right to statehood in exchange for basic economic opportunities. Berkowitz and Kushner's Zionist affiliations only lays bare the inherent bias that comes with any US-brokered peace talks between Palestine and the Tel Aviv regime. Washington showed that it does not even care enough to hide the bias, as Trump thanked Greenblatt for his "dedication to Israel" upon his departure. The Telegraph cited experts as saying that Berkowitz could be a disposable player that the Trump administration has brought on board only to kick out later in order to save face in the event of the peace deal's anticipated failure. Upon the unveiling of the deal of the century's first installment at a conference in Bahrain in June, which was boycotted by Palestinian officials, Kushner's creation was met with widespread criticism. "I would give this so-called plan a C- from an undergraduate student," said Daniel Kurtzer, a former US ambassador to Israel. Kushner is expected to drop the next, political phase of the plan soon, shortly after Israel's election on September 17. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

US defends plans for Trump-Taliban meeting at Camp David Iran Press TV Sun Sep 8, 2019 08:40PM The US has defended plans for a meeting between President Donald Trump and Taliban's leaders at Camp David as prospects of a deal shatter between the two sides. Hours after Trump called off the secret meeting, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told NBC on Sunday that "it was appropriate to have the Taliban set foot on Camp David." "The president ultimately made the decision that if we could get that, if we could get commitments and then put in place a verification regime that would give us confidence that we could observe that those commitments were being honored, that it was a useful effort to try and get all of those parties in one place so that we could have serious conversations about how to reduce America's risk so that there won't be other secretaries of state that have to travel to Dover to go see these amazing American heroes who have given so much for our country," said the US secretary of state. Reports of such a meeting faced backlash from lawmakers, including Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney, tweeting that "no member of the Taliban should set foot" at Camp David "ever." "Never should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn't renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop," said Illinois Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger. Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy also asked whether the broken deal could gain legitimacy just by being signed on the US soil. "How on earth would legitimacy of a deal in Afghanistan been enhanced by it being signed in America rather than Afghanistan?" he tweeted, asking what the point was "of dragging [Afghan President Ashraf] Ghani and Taliban leaders all the way to Camp David?" US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad presented a draft US-Taliban agreement to Ghani at the beginning of the month, which outlined plans for a US withdrawal from the country in exchange for a Taliban pledge not to plot attacks on the United States and its allies. Prior to the cancellation of negotiations, American officials had expressed hope that an end to the longest US war was near.

US defends plans for Trump-Taliban meeting at Camp David Iran Press TV Sun Sep 8, 2019 08:40PM The US has defended plans for a meeting between President Donald Trump and Taliban's leaders at Camp David as prospects of a deal shatter between the two sides. Hours after Trump called off the secret meeting, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told NBC on Sunday that "it was appropriate to have the Taliban set foot on Camp David." "The president ultimately made the decision that if we could get that, if we could get commitments and then put in place a verification regime that would give us confidence that we could observe that those commitments were being honored, that it was a useful effort to try and get all of those parties in one place so that we could have serious conversations about how to reduce America's risk so that there won't be other secretaries of state that have to travel to Dover to go see these amazing American heroes who have given so much for our country," said the US secretary of state. Reports of such a meeting faced backlash from lawmakers, including Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney, tweeting that "no member of the Taliban should set foot" at Camp David "ever." "Never should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn't renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop," said Illinois Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger. Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy also asked whether the broken deal could gain legitimacy just by being signed on the US soil. "How on earth would legitimacy of a deal in Afghanistan been enhanced by it being signed in America rather than Afghanistan?" he tweeted, asking what the point was "of dragging [Afghan President Ashraf] Ghani and Taliban leaders all the way to Camp David?" US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad presented a draft US-Taliban agreement to Ghani at the beginning of the month, which outlined plans for a US withdrawal from the country in exchange for a Taliban pledge not to plot attacks on the United States and its allies. Prior to the cancellation of negotiations, American officials had expressed hope that an end to the longest US war was near.

FILE PHOTO: US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wave after Trump's address at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem May 23, 2017. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo Asharq Al-Awsat US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a possible mutual defense treaty between the two nations, a move aimed at lending support to the embattled leader just days before Israelis go to the polls. "I had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty, between the United States and Israel, that would further anchor the tremendous alliance between our two countries," he tweeted. He added that he looked forward to continuing those discussions later this month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York. The timing of Trump's tweet, just days before Israel's election on Tuesday, appeared aimed at buttressing Netanyahu's effort to remain in power by showcasing his close ties to Trump. Opinion polls predict a close race, five months after an inconclusive election in which Netanyahu declared himself the winner but failed to put together a coalition government. Netanyahu's Likud party is running neck-and-neck with the centrist Blue and White party led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, who has focused heavily on looming corruption charges Netanyahu faces. Some Israeli officials have promoted the idea of building on Netanyahu's strong ties to the Trump administration by forging a new defense treaty with the United States, focused especially on guarantees of assistance in any conflict with Iran. But some of Netanyahu's critics have argued that such an agreement could tie Israel’s hands and deny it military autonomy.

US President, Donald Trump said, on Saturday, that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the possibility of moving forward on a “mutual defense” treaty between the allies, just three days before Israeli voters go to the polls. “I had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty, between the United States and Israel,” Trump tweeted. He said such an agreement would “further anchor the tremendous alliance” between the two countries. “I look forward to continuing those discussions after the Israeli Elections when we meet at the United Nations later this month!” Trump added, giving a tacit last-minute endorsement to Netanyahu’s re-election bid. Taking to the same medium, Netanyahu thanked “his dear friend” Trump. “The Jewish State has never had a greater friend in the White House,” the Israeli premier tweeted. “I look forward to our meeting at the UN to advance a historic Defense Treaty between the United States and Israel.” Netanyahu also pledged to “continue full steam ahead with our common battle against terrorism,” congratulating Trump “on your latest success against Bin Laden’s son.” This comes as Israel prepares for new elections, set for Tuesday, PNN reports.

News article:
The outgoing US envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, days after elections that left the Israeli leader’s political future in doubt. Greenblatt is the architect of the Trump administration’s long-awaited Middle East peace plan, which has raised widespread skepticism and has already been dismissed by the Palestinians. Netanyahu and Greenblatt were joined by US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, and by Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer. Neither Netanyahu nor Greenblatt delivered public remarks after their meeting, held Friday afternoon at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem. The office of Blue and White chairman Benny Gantz said Friday evening that the US embassy had contacted them and requested to schedule a meeting with Netanyahu’s rival for the premiership. A date has not yet been set. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Earlier a spokesman for Gantz had denied media reports that Greenblatt and Gantz would convene, saying there had never been an invite to meet, though “we would be happy to meet when the opportunity arises.” Netanyahu and Greenblatt’s meeting took place three days after the Israeli elections, which failed to produce a clear winner. Both Netanyahu and Gantz seek to secure the premiership despite neither having a clear path to a stable governing coalition. The administration of US President Donald Trump had said it would release its long-anticipated plan for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal shortly after the September 17 election, though no date had been set. Advertisement But Israel’s election deadlock could complicate its plans. Israel has had a transitional government since the end of 2018, when the Knesset dissolved ahead of election held on April 9. Those elections did not produce a majority coalition for Netanyahu, and the prime minister, rather than risk letting Gantz try to muster a majority instead, pushed through a vote to again dissolve parliament, triggering Tuesday’s election and more political paralysis. Under Israeli law and precedent, a transitional government, such as the one Netanyahu has now headed for nine months, is limited in terms of its capacity to take far-reaching decisions that would deeply affect the future of the state. For example, ahead of Tuesday’s vote, Netanyahu promised to immediately annex the Jordan Valley area — about 25% of the West Bank – if he were able to build a new coalition. He would almost certainly not be allowed to do that were he to attempt it amid the current post-election deadlock. In an interview published Wednesday, Greenblatt said the administration had not yet decided whether it will unveil the plan during or after the current coalition negotiations. “It’s too soon to tell. How will the election affect the plan? Our plan is different than what people have been talking about for so many years. We think we listened very hard to Israelis, Palestinians, the region, just about every expert.” Earlier this month, Greenblatt announced his intention to quit his position shortly after the plan is unrolled. He later clarified that he may stay on longer to see the peace proposal through. “Although I have announced my departure, I am trying to stay until the plan is launched,” Greenblatt told an event in New York, according to Jewish Insider. “If the plan is launched soon, I will stay. And if the plan is launched and we get traction, I hope to stay longer — and I have my family’s support for it.” Advertisement Greenblatt, a former lawyer with the Trump Organization, has been working for the last two and a half years on the administration’s peace plan together with the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. The White House announced on September 5 that the envoy would be stepping down to return to New Jersey to be with his wife and six children. Greenblatt will be replaced by Avi Berkowitz, a senior aide to Kushner who has been present at many of the meetings and discussions related to the peace proposal.

In early September Greenblatt announced his resignation, which will go into effect in the coming weeks, after his two-and-a-half-year tenure. The Trump administration has stressed that Greenblatt's departure will not impact intentions to release its peace plan after Israel's election. In recent weeks, as part of his election campaign, Netanyahu repeatedly reiterated that Trump's plan will be presented immediately after the election and would pose a "challenge" to Israel. Netanyahu used this as a justification for his declaration that he would annex the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea, should he be reelected, as well as the move to green light a West Bank settlement days before the election. Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit had objected to Netanyahu's recognition of the settlement close to Jericho, but walked back his objection after he said that he was presented with important details concerning the peace plan. "President Trump said that after the election he will present his peace plan, immediately after the election, even several days after the election, and it's right around the corner. This poses a big challenge to us and it also presents us with a big opportunity. It will be a historic opportunity, a rare window of opportunity to apply Israeli sovereignty on our communities in Judea and Samaria as well as on communities that are important to our tradition and future," Netanyahu said during his annexation declaration last week. "The important question facing us in this election is who will handle the negotiations with Trump, who will enlist him to our cause, who will be the next prime minister of Israel — myself or Gantz and Lapid. Gantz and Lapid said that they would uproot 80,000 settlers. With me, no one will get uprooted," Netanyahu added. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

News article:
Tel Aviv- Asharq Al-Awsat The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, denied there was a crisis or differences in relations between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Friedman denied there has been a rift in US-Israeli relations recently, neither on a personal level between Netanyahu and Trump, nor on the level of the two countries. He said Trump's plan to settle the Palestinian issue, “deal of the century,” would be announced later in 2019 when Israel was ready. Speaking to Israel's Jerusalem Post (JP), Friedman said the plan would make Israel stronger, safer, and satisfy all its supporters, regardless of their religious affiliations. The Ambassador said he was very confident the deal will be announced in 2019, without specifying an exact date, noting that its announcement was delayed because of the Israeli elections. The right-wing newspaper asked the Ambassador what he thought of Netanyahu's statements, ahead of the elections, in which he said he intended to annex Jordan’s al-Aghwar and north of the Dead Sea to Israel. Friedman said the US administration prefers to deal with the annexation in a comprehensive framework without limitations. Also, the Jerusalem Post asked Friedman about US silence after Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and Netanyahu's announcement that he would annex the Jordan Valley if re-elected. “We like to approach all these issues holistically, and hopefully we will have a chance to do so. In the interim, the statements made by the prime minister are ones we don’t see as being inconsistent with a political solution, and so we kind of held our tongue because there was really nothing that called for comment beyond what we said.” The envoy noted that from the US perspective, it wants to deal with all these issues in the context of an overall “resolution of the conflict, rather than piecemeal.” Asked about an Israeli-US Security pact, Friedman asserted that any comments on it were “premature”, noting that conceptually it would be limited, at least on the Israeli side. “An attack on Israel could provoke an overwhelming response by the strongest nation on earth. Beyond that, what are Israel’s obligations, how does it work, how does it impact on freedom of operation – the details really have to be sorted through and [then] people can assess whether it is a good or a bad idea.” The Ambassador was harshly criticized taking a sledgehammer and inaugurating the City of David’s Pilgrimage Road under Palestinian homes. However, he told JP he was very proud of that move and completely comfortable with what had happened. The envoy went on to say that he understood the Palestinian perspective and Palestinians had every right to their wishes, political aspirations, beliefs, and their personal narratives. However, he claimed they “don’t have a right to their own facts… To resent the fact that science has corroborated what most of us already knew, I’m not sympathetic to that grievance.”

Tel Aviv- Asharq Al-Awsat The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, denied there was a crisis or differences in relations between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Friedman denied there has been a rift in US-Israeli relations recently, neither on a personal level between Netanyahu and Trump, nor on the level of the two countries. He said Trump's plan to settle the Palestinian issue, “deal of the century,” would be announced later in 2019 when Israel was ready. Speaking to Israel's Jerusalem Post (JP), Friedman said the plan would make Israel stronger, safer, and satisfy all its supporters, regardless of their religious affiliations. The Ambassador said he was very confident the deal will be announced in 2019, without specifying an exact date, noting that its announcement was delayed because of the Israeli elections. The right-wing newspaper asked the Ambassador what he thought of Netanyahu's statements, ahead of the elections, in which he said he intended to annex Jordan’s al-Aghwar and north of the Dead Sea to Israel. Friedman said the US administration prefers to deal with the annexation in a comprehensive framework without limitations. Also, the Jerusalem Post asked Friedman about US silence after Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and Netanyahu's announcement that he would annex the Jordan Valley if re-elected. “We like to approach all these issues holistically, and hopefully we will have a chance to do so.

Related Finance ministry reveals new amendments to customs law Egypt's finance minister Mohamed Maait affirmed on Monday the keenness of the government on promoting international cooperation to cut down the time needed for customs clearance, rationalizing custom duties and toughening up supervision on customs outlets. The aforementioned measures would contribute to improving the international trade movement and place to a higher level Egypt's rank by the World Bank. "A set of agreements on the Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters will be signed with some countries in the coming period," the minister said in statements. These agreements come to ensure the establishment of bilateral cooperation in the accurate assessment of goods, to determine taxes and customs duties, implement customs laws and identify prohibited goods such as weapons and narcotics and to address customs violations, the minister explained. The Egyptian Customs Authority, in cooperation with the US Customs Administration, finalized the draft of the preliminary agreement on "mutual assistance in customs matters" between Egypt and the US in preparation for referral to the competent authorities to review and take the necessary measures towards putting it into effect. The cooperation agreement with Belarus is expected to be signed during the sixth session of the Egyptian-Belarus Economic Committee, which will be held in September in the Belarus capital, Maait added. Maait explained the initial formula will be reviewed before referral to the competent authorities to take the necessary measures towards its entry into force. The minister pointed out that coordination is currently underway with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to start a round of negotiations with the EU on the mechanisms to provide information on goods exchanged between the two sides (brand, value and country of origin).

TICAD7 will be held between August 28-30 in Yokohama, Japan, under the theme “Africa and Yokohama, Sharing Passion for the Future.” More than 4,500 heads of state and governments, as well as representatives of international and regional organizations, civil societies, NGOs, and the private sector are expected to attend.

He added that launching the Africa Agenda 2063 and the Free Trade Zone in Africa are milestones in African efforts to reach the aspired regional and economic integration in the continent.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi has urged African countries to encourage private-public cooperation, saying that the private sector is a major driver of social and economic growth in the continent. "The private sector serves a main driver of providing permanent job opportunities and improving income level, thus contributing to eliminating poverty…and increasing long-term economic growth," El-Sisi told the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) attended by a number of African leaders and representatives of international organisations including the World Bank. El-Sisi called for strengthening cooperation between the Egyptian and Japanese private sectors, and invited Japanese investors to invest in the resource-rich continent. On Wednesday, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to offer enhanced trade insurance to boost private sector investment in Africa,which he said stood at $20 billion over the past three years. El-Sisi, who holds the rotating presidency of the the 55-nation African Union (AU), said African countries are looking to draw investors to infrastructure and energy projects in the region, home to 1.2 billion people. African countries, El-Sisi says, have made progress on improving investment environment in the continent by establishing a 2063 African development agenda, adopting the 2012 the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) and launching the execution phase of a free African trade zone to promote intra-African free trade. Separately, El-Sisi said during talks with Japan's trade minister on the sidelines of the gathering that Cairo is looking to boost cooperation with Japan to promote reliance on gas and clean energy in Egypt's public transportation system. Egypt also looks to draw Japanese investors to a planned economic zone near the Suez Canal which will be international industrial and logistics hub, he added. The three-day event concludes on Friday in Yokohama, south of Tokyo. Search Keywords: Short link:

He also expressed the ministry's readiness to develop security cooperation with all EU counterterrorism bodies to confront possible terrorist threats, especially by sharing information on terrorist elements, their movements and their funding sources in areas with tension in the Middle East and Europe. The minister said terrorism poses a threat to most countries in the world, warning of the dangers of providing a safe haven to terrorist elements who hide behind religious misconceptions and promote a culture of violence and destruction.

The Regional Information Technology and Software Engineering Centre (RITSEC), and the Finnish Embassy in Cairo launched a new initiative supporting the development of information and knowledge society and technology transfer from the north to the Arab world and Africa. To celebrate the launch of the Regional Knowledge and Innovation Initiative, Finnish Ambassador to Egypt Laura Kansikas-Debraise hosted a reception in her residence this week. The event, reported a Finland Embassy in Cairo statement, was attended by the Finnish delegation headed by Tarja Halonen, the chairman of the board of Trustees of Helsinki University and former president of the Republic of Finland. In addition to several prominent Egyptian education officials present were President of the RITSEC Hisham El-Sherif, former Minister of Family and Population and former Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Moushira Khattab, Minister of Military Production Mohamed Al-Assar, former Foreign Minister Mohamed El-Orabi along with a galaxy of media representatives. In collaboration with the RITSEC, two meetings were held in Cairo; the Egyptian-Finnish Education Forum and the Egyptian-Finnish University Education Forum. On 7 September, a joint forum was held with the Ministry of Education, led by Tarek Shawki, the Minister of Education and Technical Education. The following day another joint forum with the Ministry of Higher Education, hosted by Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, was held in the attendance of a high-level Finnish delegation from Helsinki University and other Finnish education specialists. The inaugural ceremony was attended by Halonen, Kansikas-Debraise, El-Sherif, and a high-level Finnish education delegation including Leena Krokfors from the Faculty of Educational Sciences, the University of Helsinki. An agreement was signed between the Regional IT Institute (RITI), and the University of Helsinki to help in the transfer of Finland's successful practices and models to the Arab world and Africa through a newly established Cairo-based “Finnish Regional Knowledge and Innovation Centre”. The agreement should serve the efforts to build knowledge-based economies, digital societies, creative initiatives and societal innovation in both Africa and the Arab world via Cairo. The Cairo based Finnish Regional Knowledge and Innovation Centre will have several targets such as the transfer of international experience in the field of scientific and educational excellence, supporting and contributing to leading initiatives in education (early childhood, school and special needs), and the encouragement of scientific exchange and missions. For decades, Finland has been one of the leading countries in the field of education. Helsinki University is the leading university in Finland and the world's first in the field of education. Since the early 1990s, the regional centre has been the leader in the introduction of technology, Internet and the initiative of the information society to Egypt, the Arab world and Africa.

The European University in Egypt (EUE) in Cairo will teach degrees under the "academic direction" of the prestigious London School of Economic (LSE) as part of a deal signed with the University of London. The move is part of Egypt's 2030 vision to develop education, the country's Ambassador to the UK Tareq Adel said on Tuesday. In his speech at an event to mark the signing of the deal, Adel explained that "this step will reflect on the quality of education in Egypt." In August the University of Hertfordshire launched a branch in Egypt, which will be closely followed by Coventry University, as a result of a push by the British government and the advocacy group Universities UK. Partnerships between British education institutions in the UK and Egypt is highly controversial given that the torture and murder of Italian student Giulio Regeni, who was completing research at Cambridge University in the UK, remains unsolved. In 2018 over 200 academics signed a letter opposing this partnership, saying that government officials and university managers seemed to "have forgotten" what happened to Regeni and accused them of "masking human rights abuses in order to make short-term profits in the global education 'market'." READ: Egypt's tuk tuk ban threatens thousands of livelihoods In early 2016 Regeni's body was found dumped by the side of the road in Egypt showing clear signs of torture. Despite international condemnation the Egyptian government has repeatedly delayed investigations into his death. On its part the British government was accused of inaction and putting business interests above human rights. After a 100,000-strong petition demanding government intervention, the British government eventually said it was "appalled" by the murder. The letter signed by the academics questioned "the wisdom and legitimacy of this move to do business as usual with an authoritarian regime that systematically attacks research, education and academic freedom." READ: UK bathroom giant moves to Egypt despite severe repression on workers Academics in Egypt have been asked to get security approval before travelling and must gain approval from the Foreign Ministry to organise international conferences. Five female staff members and 530 female students have been dismissed from universities since the July 2013 coup, according to the international rights group We Record. The pursuit against academics in Egypt is part of a wide-scale campaign against any opposition or perceived opponents to the current regime. It is estimated that there are 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. Under the current regime an unprecedented number have died from torture, medical neglect, or have been sentenced to death. Note: A previous version of this news piece incorrectly stated that LSE was opening a branch in Cairo, this was amended on 13 September 2019 at 13.15 to clarify that degrees will be taught under the academic direction of LSE.

News article:
Egypt has proposed nine initiatives to help tackle the impact of global warming, reports Mahmoud Bakr During his trip to New York for the 74th UN General Assembly, President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi participated in the 2019 Climate Summit. The summit aims to combat climate change and agree long- and short-term limits on emissions. It offers an opportunity for countries to raise their game when it comes to limiting greenhouse emissions which have reached record levels and continue to rise as countries water down their commitments to combating climate change. Al-Sisi’s address to the summit highlighted the perspectives of Egypt, Africa and developing countries on climate change. The impact of climate change impacts all aspects of our lives, yet Africa’s own global warming gas emissions are minute. There is a dire need for sustainable, appropriate funding and technology and capacity building so developing countries can offset the phenomenon. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the goal of inviting world leaders to the climate summit is to encourage countries to present “concrete action” to the UN in the hope of boosting the Paris Agreement on climate change and the ambitious goals that are the cornerstone of the 2030 Sustainable Development plan. On meeting many aspects of the 2030 sustainable development agenda, he warned, “we are not on the right track.” Guterres said more international cooperation on climate change was needed and called on world leaders to come to the UN with ideas and concrete plans instead of “just talk”. He warned that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century means the world must be carbon-neutral by 2050. “We must reduce emissions drastically in the coming decade, and we want more and more countries to come here and make a commitment to the 2050 carbon neutrality pledge and make reductions,” he said. He asserted that the goal is to reduce emissions by 45 per cent in the coming decades, raise the $100 billion needed each year to help developing countries adapt to, and mitigate, the effects of climate change, and promote investments supporting renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. “We can plant differently and use the land differently and cities can have different strategies to reduce emissions,” he said. “There are many tangible measures that we hope countries, cities and companies will announce at the summit.” Egypt’s Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad attended meetings of the various climate change alliances, including the Adaptation Alliance headed by Egypt, in partnership with the UK. Fouad reported on Cairo’s efforts to increase international cooperation and noted that Egypt had presented nine initiatives on climate change. She said the alliance was working on uniting global efforts to address the impact of climate change and support Third World countries which suffer most from the effects of global warming. Fouad added that Egypt is honouring its commitments under the Paris Agreement and supports raising adaptation goals. “We made a political announcement at the summit focused on funding adaptation, supporting early warning systems, responding to natural disasters, including adaptation in national plans, and calling on advanced countries to increase funding for adaptation,” she said. Fouad reiterated Egypt’s full support and commitment to climate action through the alliance it co-chairs with the UK. “We have several ambitious initiatives needed to meet adaptation needs and flexibility and a precise plan of implementation that relies on increasing funding and support for developing countries that suffer the most from the impact of climate change.” Egypt, she said, will always support global group action, which is why, in 2015 at the Paris conference, President Al-Sisi launched the African Adaptation Initiative to encourage advanced countries to honour their commitments to help African states confront the adverse effects of climate change. The initiative also fine-tunes African demands and concerns, including early warning systems, funding, national plans and investment packages for the private sector. Fouad said Egypt has submitted initiatives that protect the most vulnerable through Risk-Informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) and which will provide security for more than a billion people facing climate change, as well as initiatives on small-scale agriculture. Egypt succeeded in changing the global climate change agenda by including adaptation as a priority at the Climate Summit, and convinced 107 countries to sign the political declaration presented by Egypt that sets adaptation as a top priority in environmental action. By chairing the Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Alliance on Adaptation and Mitigation, Egypt has shown it can lead the world on global environmental issues that serve the interests of all countries, said Fouad. The minister of environment was also a key speaker at the World Climate Resilience Day, held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, where she addressed more than 400 young people on building a future capable of confronting climate change. The beginning, she said, is in the hands of the young, and must include education that combines action against climate change, protection of biodiversity and the curbing of desertification. “Youth must be given a chance to lessen the impact of climate change and adapt to it through their innovative solutions and new projects.” Fouad also called on states to move faster in confronting the impact of climate change. Africa, she said, remains vulnerable to climate change: 1,000 natural disasters that have impacted on the lives of more than 200 million people across the continent and caused the death of 400,000. *A version of this article appears in print in the 26 September, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly under the title: Confronting climate change Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Previously, we went over Maryam Rajavi’s description of the Iranian people’s struggle from freedom from the beginning of the 20th Century until the 1979 revolution. Today, we will look at the true goal of the anti-monarchic revolution that was cruelly snatched from the people by the mullahs. In 1979, days after the Shah fled the country, Massoud Rajavi, the only leader of the Iranian Resistance still alive, thanks to an international campaign by his Geneva-based brother, was released from prison. Massoud, who would later become Maryam Rajavi’s husband, set about rebuilding the Iranian Resistance group the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI or MEK), which had been gutted by opportunists while the leaders were locked in the Shah’s dungeons. Despite that huge task, Maryam Rajavi notes that Massoud was unwilling to let Regime Founder Ruhollah Khomeini, who had stolen the people’s revolution to establish his theocratic dictatorship, get away with his “bloodthirsty” actions in the name of Islam. Maryam Rajavi recounts that in a meeting in Tehran with Massoud, shortly after his release, Khomeini offered Massoud anything he wanted in order to encourage the people of Iran, who’d just been denied the freedom they fought for, to support the Regime. Maryam Rajavi quoted Khomeini as saying to Massoud, “You are young and young people listen to you. Write down a few sentences and say that those who are not religious are not entitled to engage in political activities. And then all paths will be available to you”. But Massoud refused. Maryam Rajavi quoted him as replying that he could not do so “because the Iranian people’s revolution pursued freedom, and in our view, Islam is a religion of freedom”. Indeed, Massoud and his supporters began their struggle anew against the second dictator they’d faced, with Masoud soon establishing the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) in Tehran in 1981. Then, Khomeini realised that the Iranian Resistance would not sacrifice their goals and convictions in order to win political ranks or positions. Maryam Rajavi said: “[Massoud] did not let Khomeini establish eternal rule for his Satanic Caliphate under the banner of Islam. Employing the rallying cries of peace and freedom, he did not let Khomeini continue his unjust eight-year war with Iraq.” Despite Iraq asking for peace talks in 1982, after two years of war, Khomeini dragged the conflict on until 1988, when he was eventually forced by Massoud and his National Liberation Army of Iran to agree to peace. Khomeini planned to “[conquer] Quds (Jerusalem) via Karbala” and Iraq, apparently at any cost. The war left 1 million Iranians dead, 1 million more wounded, 4 million displaced from the warzone, $1 trillion worth of damages and 50 cities burnt to the ground. In our next piece, we will learn about the Resistance’s 40-year struggle against the Regime.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print Municipality of Paris’ 1st District hangs a large banner in protest to Zarif’s visit Iranians residing in France, supporters of the Iranian Resistance, and human rights organizations took part in a rally against the visit to Paris by Javad Zarif, the mullahs’ foreign minister. Hundreds of Iranians took part in the protest, which started in the early hours of Friday August 23 at Place du Trocadero in Paris. Demonstrators carried a large banner that read “Expel Zarif.” They chanted: “Zarif is a terrorist, expel him.” One of the placards carried by the demonstrators had the writing: “End making concessions to the mullahs.” Another placard read: “Shut down the Iranian regime’s espionage centers in Europe.” The Paris District 1 municipality installed a large banner on the city hall opposing Zarif’s visit. The banner read: “Iran’s Mullahs and its Foreign Minister violate our principles. We do not welcome them.” Banner against Javad Zarif’s presence in France – Municipality of Paris’ 1st District, August 23, 2019 France is Zarif’s last stop on a European tour that began last weekend. His visits to Finland, Sweden, and Norway have been met with loud protests by Iranians residing in each of these countries. The protests highlighted widespread human rights abuses in Iran and the role of the mullahs’ regime in terrorism and crisis-making in the region. In response to objections to the trip, the Swedish Foreign Minister stated that her government had not invited Zarif and he had come to Sweden at his own request. Continuing protests have so enraged Zarif that in an interview with the state-run Press TV on August 21, he railed at Iranian protesters demanding his expulsion from Sweden. “Ask anyone of those individuals standing outside to attend any meetings by Iranians (meaning the regime’s Revolutionary Guards and agents) and then see whether they would survive. They would not stay alive for a minute…. They cannot stay in Iraq either because the people of Iraq (meaning the regime’s proxies in that country) will eat them alive.” Supporters of the Iranian Resistance pointed out that the mullahs’ regime faces an explosive domestic situation, with continuing protests and demonstrations nationwide and increasing international isolation, and that it is struggling to survive. Activists have expressed the belief that the regime is in its final phase, and have argued that foreign invitations to the Foreign Minister would embolden that regime to intensify the repression and killing in Iran, as well as terrorism and crisis in the region. The protesters emphasized that Zarif represents a regime that maintains the world’s highest per-capita rate of executions, is the most active state sponsor of terrorism, is the primary source of crisis and chaos in the region, and is the main patron of Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad in his massacre of the people of Syria. Zarif and his ministry’s mission is to defend and whitewash the mullahs’ crimes, and to coordinate and facilitate terrorist plots abroad. In 2018 alone, five of the regime’s diplomat-terrorists, including an ambassador, were expelled from Europe for their direct role in terrorist conspiracies against the Iranian Resistance and dissidents. Another four operatives, including an accredited diplomat, are in prison and awaiting trial in Belgium for plotting to bomb the Free Iran gathering in Paris in 2018, attended by hundreds of French and international dignitaries.

News article:
Previously, we looked at the history of the Resistance, but here we will look at where it is headed. To do that, we must look at where the Regime is headed. Maryam Rajavi assessed that the Regime will only become violent and repressive as the fight for freedom continues, contracting their ranks, suppressing their people, increasing their demonization of the Iranian Resistance, which the mullahs now admits is the main threat to their continued rule. She said that the Resistance has been fighting the Regime for four decades and cannot be exterminated, no matter how much the Regime tries. Instead, with every death, the Resistance gains more supporters and grows stronger. Maryam Rajavi explained that on an international level, the Regime will try to wait out the next 16 months until the next US presidential election with the hope that the winner will start appeasing them again. Even though evidence suggests this won’t happen no matter the winner. Any US president would want to negotiate a new deal on their own terms. She said the mullahs are counting on the international community’s inaction and tolerance to Iran’s terrorist operations and warmongering to allow them to survive. This should not be allowed. Maryam Rajavi said that the Iranian Resistance has constantly warned about Iran circumventing the six UN Security Council resolutions and have urged the nuclear deal signatories to obtain a complete halt to Iran’s uranium enrichment and unhindered access to all suspect sites. Maryam Rajavi then quoted a speech she made at a French Senate meeting in April 2015. She said: “The experience of the Iranian Resistance shows that the mullahs only understand the language of force and firmness. The time has come for major powers to stop appeasing and giving concessions to the murderous religious tyranny, the central banker of terrorism, and the world’s record holder of executions, and to recognize the right of the people of Iran for resistance and freedom.” Maryam Rajavi then cited a speech from July of that year, when the agreement was signed. She said: “An agreement that overlooks the human rights of the Iranian people and fails to emphasize and acknowledge them, will only encourage further suppression and incessant executions on the part of this regime. It will also trample upon the rights of the people of Iran, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the UN Charter… because the people of Iran have been the main victims of this ominous nuclear program.” Basically, Maryam Rajavi predicted exactly the scenarios we see now. Over the past three months alone, we have seen Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei bragging about trying to lessen US pressure using “bargaining chips and leverage”, which Maryam Rajavi says is a reference to the terrorist operations in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and refusing to talk to the US Iranian attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz The downing of a U.S. drone by Iran, which President Hassan Rouhani praised the Iranian Revolutionary Guards for Iran boosting its uranium enrichment to 4.5% and threatening to do more In our next piece, we will discuss how the Regime is fuelling tensions elsewhere to push back against or distract the international community.

Previously, we looked at the history of the Resistance, but here we will look at where it is headed. To do that, we must look at where the Regime is headed. Maryam Rajavi assessed that the Regime will only become violent and repressive as the fight for freedom continues, contracting their ranks, suppressing their people, increasing their demonization of the Iranian Resistance, which the mullahs now admits is the main threat to their continued rule. She said that the Resistance has been fighting the Regime for four decades and cannot be exterminated, no matter how much the Regime tries. Instead, with every death, the Resistance gains more supporters and grows stronger. Maryam Rajavi explained that on an international level, the Regime will try to wait out the next 16 months until the next US presidential election with the hope that the winner will start appeasing them again. Even though evidence suggests this won’t happen no matter the winner. Any US president would want to negotiate a new deal on their own terms. She said the mullahs are counting on the international community’s inaction and tolerance to Iran’s terrorist operations and warmongering to allow them to survive. This should not be allowed. Maryam Rajavi said that the Iranian Resistance has constantly warned about Iran circumventing the six UN Security Council resolutions and have urged the nuclear deal signatories to obtain a complete halt to Iran’s uranium enrichment and unhindered access to all suspect sites. Maryam Rajavi then quoted a speech she made at a French Senate meeting in April 2015. She said: “The experience of the Iranian Resistance shows that the mullahs only understand the language of force and firmness. The time has come for major powers to stop appeasing and giving concessions to the murderous religious tyranny, the central banker of terrorism, and the world’s record holder of executions, and to recognize the right of the people of Iran for resistance and freedom.” Maryam Rajavi then cited a speech from July of that year, when the agreement was signed. She said: “An agreement that overlooks the human rights of the Iranian people and fails to emphasize and acknowledge them, will only encourage further suppression and incessant executions on the part of this regime. It will also trample upon the rights of the people of Iran, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the UN Charter… because the people of Iran have been the main victims of this ominous nuclear program.” Basically, Maryam Rajavi predicted exactly the scenarios we see now. Over the past three months alone, we have seen Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei bragging about trying to lessen US pressure using “bargaining chips and leverage”, which Maryam Rajavi says is a reference to the terrorist operations in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and refusing to talk to the US Iranian attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz The downing of a U.S. drone by Iran, which President Hassan Rouhani praised the Iranian Revolutionary Guards for Iran boosting its uranium enrichment to 4.5% and threatening to do more In our next piece, we will discuss how the Regime is fuelling tensions elsewhere to push back against or distract the international community.

News article:
Previously, we looked at the history of the Resistance and where it is headed, but here we will look at how the Regime is disrupting the Middle East in order to attack or distract the world. Maryam Rajavi said: “The regime is fuelling tensions in a bid to push back against the international community. They foment turmoil and chaos to hide their fear of being overthrown. They want firmness to be replaced with the policy of appeasement. And they want to allay fears and anxiety of their Bassij forces and Revolutionary Guards and to preserve their internal balance and equilibrium.” The Regime is incredibly unstable and could not handle sustained “confrontation” from the West or any of its countries, so they seek to distract by, among other things, announcing the will to create “a young, Hezbollahi government”, as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei did on May 22. Maryam Rajavi said: “The reality is that schism and instability are among the signs that the regime is in its final chapter. The clerical regime is not going to find a way out of its inevitable downfall.” Now, Regime apologists have a long history of appeasing the mullahs and ignoring its crimes at home and abroad, essentially protecting what Maryam Rajavi terms “the greatest sponsor and godfather of international terrorism”. Maryam Rajavi said: “Instead of the regime, they targeted its arch-nemesis, namely the Iranian Resistance, levelling fictitious accusations against it. They blacklisted the Mojahedin instead of Khamenei’s network, and the National Liberation Army of Iran instead the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Of course, we proudly prevailed in more than 20 courts. They did not find even a single piece of incriminating evidence against the [Resistance]. This history is reminiscent of the ancient Iranian myth where the hero Siavash safely passes through flames of accusations against him.” But now the tides are changing and the “obscuring curtains” are being peeled back and everyone can see that the Regime is the source of war and warmongering, who are certainly not protecting Iran from a future of war, turmoil and secessions following the overthrow of the Regime. Maryam Rajavi said: “As the Iranian Resistance said from the outset, fighting against this regime is equivalent to seeking peace because it eliminates the source of war and turmoil… Now, everyone can see that so long as this regime remains in place, war and crises will continue and intensify in the region. Therefore, anyone who seeks freedom for Iran, anyone who wants to save Iran from destruction and chaos, anyone who wants global and regional peace and stability, must rise up to demand the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime.” In our next piece, we will look at the lies of the appeasement policy and the Resistance’s historical mission.

News article:
The wave of murders, committed on the fatwa of Iranian Regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini, began in the notorious prisons of Evin and Gohardasht, in Tehran and Karaj, respectively. It spread quickly across the country. Many victims, members of the opposition MEK, had already served their prison terms and were just awaiting their release date, many were elderly or teenagers, many had not even been convicted for their peaceful political activities. It didn’t matter to the “death commissions”, who sent the victims to be killed after five-minute kangaroo trials. Iran HRM wrote: “The victims were hanged by forklift trucks and cranes or from beams in half-constructed buildings, in groups of five or six at half-hourly intervals all day long. Others were killed by firing squads. The number of those executed were too many to be buried individually. They were collectively ditched in purpose dug trenches constituting mass graves.” There are over 120 mass graves across Iran filled with the remains of the 1988 massacre’s victims, but many families were never told about the killings, never provided with death certificates, and never given the location of the graves. They were ordered never to mourn them in public. Those who tried to find the graves have been arrested and tortured, with the Regime trying to erase all evidence of the massacres by building over the mass graves. In fact, Iran has arrested (and in some cases tortures and executed) the following people fore merely drawing attention to the 1988 massacre: MEK supporter Ali Saremi, who gave a speech at Khavaran Cemetery outside Tehran, the site of one of the unmarked mass graves Mansoureh Behkish, who lost six siblings during the 1988 massacre, who posted online about Iran’s human rights violations Human rights defender Raheleh Rahemipour, who filed a complaint with the UN about the enforced disappearances of her brother and his infant daughter, Golrou Maryam Akbari-Monfared, who asked the UN to help her find the truth about the fate of her forcibly disappeared siblings who were members of the MEK Importantly, no one has been punished for their role in the massacre and many of them still hold high-ranking positions in Iran today. That is why the international community should hold the Regime to account as failure to act is emboldening the Regime’s human rights violations. Iran HRM wrote: “We urge the international community, the UN Security Council, the UN Human Rights Council and its member states, as well as other relevant United Nation agencies, the European Union, all advocates of human rights and justice to end the immunity of those responsible for the 1988 massacre.” They advocate for referring Iran’s dossier of human rights violations to the UN Security Council and for the UN to launch an international independent fact-finding mission to determine the fates of the 1988 massacre victims.

The conference, titled, “Iran: Massacred Human Rights: 31st anniversary of massacre of 30,000 political prisoners in 1988,” brought together French lawmakers, mayors and human rights activists who appealed to the French government and the United Nations to hold Iranian officials accountable for their “ongoing crime against humanity.” Iranian opposition leader hommage au côté de Jean-François Legaret – pic.twitter.com/cOwIsOr0CF — MichèledeVaucouleurs (@MdeVaucouleurs) August 30, 2019 Jean-François Legaret, Mayor of Paris’ District 1, told the conference: “Beyond our solidarity, we must remember the international principles against mass killings, especially that of the 1988 massacre in Iran. There must be no impunity for the mullahs in Iran.” Other speakers at the event included French mayors Guy Schmidt and Jean-Claude Jegoudez, former French lawmakers Jean-Pierre Brard and François Colcombet, NCRI Women’s Committee Chair Sarvnaz Chitsaz, and NCRI Representative in France Dr. Saleh Radjavi. Survivors of the 1988 massacre and victims’ relatives gave first-hand accounts of the atrocities committed by the mullahs’ regime. Background on Iran’s 1988 Massacre: • More than 30,000 political prisoners were massacred in Iran in the summer of 1988. • The massacre was carried out on the basis of a fatwa by Khomeini. • The vast majority of the victims were activists of the opposition People’s Mojahedin (PMOI, Mujahedin-e Khalq or MEK). • Death Commissions approved all the death sentences. • Alireza Avaei, a member of the Death Commissions, is today Hassan Rouhani’s Justice Minister. • The perpetrators of the 1988 massacre have never been brought to justice. • On August 9, 2016, an audio tape was published for the first time of Khomeini’s former heir acknowledging that that massacre took place and had been ordered at the highest levels. • It’s time for the UN to investigate Iran’s 1988 massacre.

News article:
In our last piece, we focused on the key discriminations and inequalities against women, which Maryam Rajavi had gone through in her speech. Here, we will talk about Iranian women’s widespread participation in the struggle against the two dictatorships. Maryam Rajavi said: “Let me add that they have always been at the forefront of the struggle since the outset of the mullahs’ theocratic rule, and more significantly, they have been the trailblazers and leaders of this struggle. Those days, women faced more difficulties than men in joining the democratic struggle.” She explained that young Muslim women faced huge problems in resisting the regime before the founding of the PMOI (MEK) because there was no precedent for female activists in Iran. The MEK broke a glass ceiling in that regard. Many more women joined the struggle against Regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini in the 1980s, seeking “wanted freedom, equality, and a democratic Islam”. Maryam Rajavi explained that the regime continued imposing restrictions and applying huge pressure on women to deprive them of their rights, but the leading role of MEK women did not abate. Maryam Rajavi said: “These days, you have seen an exhibition [at Ashraf 3] that displays parts of the history of the Iranian people’s resistance over the past 40 years. It reminds us of the tortuous and blood-soaked path paved by women of the Iranian Resistance. You saw the images showing cages where prisoners were detained. Some of the women held in these cages for a long time, are now sitting here among you. You have seen images of the torture chambers called the residential units, where female prisoners were sadistically mistreated and harassed 24 hours a day. You can see the survivors of the 1988 massacre.” Maryam Rajavi said that much has been written about the struggle of Iranian women against the Regime and their sorrowful times in the mullahs’ torture chambers, where tens of thousands of women tortured and executed, ranging from teenage girls like 13-year-old Fatemeh Mesbah to elderly women like 70-year-old Mother Zakeri. But their stories remain largely unknown by the rest of the world. Their enduring resistance against the interrogators and the Revolutionary Guards, in spite of torture, and their rejoining of the MEK show their perseverance and strength. Maryam Rajavi said: “These women have proven their capabilities in the military field as well. Another chapter of this struggle was overcoming the hardships and complexities related to the presence of women in the ranks of an army fighting the enemy, the formation of combat units, being trained and assuming the command, fighting against all obstacles in camps Ashraf and Liberty and continuing to resist for 14 years.” This shows that the women following Maryam Rajavi cannot be kept down. In our next piece, we will look at the MEK’s promises to Iranian women.

You can see the survivors of the 1988 massacre.” Maryam Rajavi said that much has been written about the struggle of Iranian women against the Regime and their sorrowful times in the mullahs’ torture chambers, where tens of thousands of women tortured and executed, ranging from teenage girls like 13-year-old Fatemeh Mesbah to elderly women like 70-year-old Mother Zakeri. But their stories remain largely unknown by the rest of the world. Their enduring resistance against the interrogators and the Revolutionary Guards, in spite of torture, and their rejoining of the MEK show their perseverance and strength. Maryam Rajavi said: “These women have proven their capabilities in the military field as well. Another chapter of this struggle was overcoming the hardships and complexities related to the presence of women in the ranks of an army fighting the enemy, the formation of combat units, being trained and assuming the command, fighting against all obstacles in camps Ashraf and Liberty and continuing to resist for 14 years.” This shows that the women following Maryam Rajavi cannot be kept down. In our next piece, we will look at the MEK’s promises to Iranian women.

In our last piece, we focused on the key discriminations and inequalities against women, which Maryam Rajavi had gone through in her speech. Here, we will talk about Iranian women’s widespread participation in the struggle against the two dictatorships. Maryam Rajavi said: “Let me add that they have always been at the forefront of the struggle since the outset of the mullahs’ theocratic rule, and more significantly, they have been the trailblazers and leaders of this struggle. Those days, women faced more difficulties than men in joining the democratic struggle.” She explained that young Muslim women faced huge problems in resisting the regime before the founding of the PMOI (MEK) because there was no precedent for female activists in Iran. The MEK broke a glass ceiling in that regard. Many more women joined the struggle against Regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini in the 1980s, seeking “wanted freedom, equality, and a democratic Islam”. Maryam Rajavi explained that the regime continued imposing restrictions and applying huge pressure on women to deprive them of their rights, but the leading role of MEK women did not abate. Maryam Rajavi said: “These days, you have seen an exhibition [at Ashraf 3] that displays parts of the history of the Iranian people’s resistance over the past 40 years. It reminds us of the tortuous and blood-soaked path paved by women of the Iranian Resistance. You saw the images showing cages where prisoners were detained. Some of the women held in these cages for a long time, are now sitting here among you.

WASHINGTON: Protesters have vowed to confront Iranian President Hassan Rouhani over the country’s “medieval regime” when he addresses the UN on Wednesday. People started gathering last week near the UN’s headquarters in New York and their numbers will continue to grow, according to the political director for the Organization of Iranian American Communities (OIAC), which coordinates anti-Tehran activism in the US. The OIAC’s Dr. Majid Sadeghpour said the international community should not be “fooled” by Iran's representatives. “No amount of economic and political concessions can moderate the behavior of this medieval regime,” he said. “The mullahs understand only the language of power and firmness. Maximum pressure must be applied to help the Iranian people free themselves from the yoke of the mullahs. We began protesting last week in anticipation of the opening of the UN General Assembly’s 74th Session and the appearance of Iran's officials, and we will continue protesting until the Iranian regime is held responsible for its ongoing atrocities against the people of Iran.” Protestors were holding daily vigils to remind the world about Iran's history of terror and brutality against its people, he added, and Trump and the UN must “reject the false pretenses of moderation” from Rouhani and his representatives. Sadeghpour said Rouhani and other Iranian officials should be held accountable for the killing of more than 120,000 Iranian civilians, including the 30,000 murdered during a gruesome nationwide purge in 1988. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has previously addressed protests against the Iranian government, is expected to join former Sen. Joseph Lieberman in speaking to protesters at next week’s rallies. Trump had previously accused Iran of terrorism and violence, but appeared to soften his stance when he said he would meet Rouhani if he came to the opening session of the UN’s 74th General Assembly. But a week ago, after a coordinated drone and cruise missile attack targeted Saudi Aramco oil fields in the Kingdom’s Eastern Province, Trump said the US military was “locked and loaded,” suggesting the US was ready to go to war with Iran. Trump said he would move to block Rouhani and his team from attending the UN meeting, but he later relented. On Friday he revealed details of additional sanctions against Iran, which he described as the toughest ever imposed. The Treasury Department decided to take action against Iran’s central bank after US officials concluded Tehran was responsible for the drone and missile attacks on Saudi oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais.

A police K-9 unit works at a security checkpoint outside the UN headquarters on the first day of the general debate at the UN General Assembly, Tuesday, September 24, 2019, in New York. (AP) Asharq Al-Awsat President Donald Trump's personal lawyer and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told a crowd of several hundred protesters outside the United Nations on Tuesday that he supports regime change in Iran. "I am speaking in my individual capacity. I am for regime change. Down with the tyrants in Iran. Down with the ayatollah and the mullahs and all the crooks," he told the crowd, referring to Iran's clerical leadership. The rally on Tuesday, organized by opposition groups in exile and The International Convention for the Future of Iran, took place a day before Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is set to deliver his remarks before the UN General Assembly. It's one of several high-profile anti-Iranian government events taking place on the sidelines of the UN gathering this week. At the General Assembly, US President Donald Trump said all nations have a duty to act against Iran and "no responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust." He said Washington has imposed the highest level of sanctions on Iran and says as long as Iran's "menacing behavior continues" sanctions will not be lifted and instead will be tightened. He added that Iran's leaders have lashed out at others for 40 years for the problems that they alone have created.

News article:
A member of Prime Minister Imran Khan's cabinet has warned that, if left unchecked by the international community, the fallout of India's controversial move in Kashmir could lead to a nuclear conflict between the two longtime rivals. Speaking to Newsweek, Sayed Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari, who serves as Khan's special assistant for overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, discussed the Pakistani leader's upcoming visit to New York as part of the United Nations General Assembly. Bukhari said Khan's trip would be "very Kashmir-centric," revolving around India's decision last month to consolidate control over its share of the disputed border territory and the ongoing human rights concerns that have since emerged there. Kashmir has been the subject of three out of four major wars between India and Pakistan since their 1947 partition at the hands of their former colonizer, the United Kingdom. Asked if he was concerned that another major conflict could erupt between the neighbors as the situation in India-administered Kashmir deteriorated, Bukhari said, "Absolutely." "We're extremely concerned that this could snowball into a nuclear war, you have two nuclear countries," Bukhari told Newsweek. "We're extremely worried about an escalation." While India and Pakistan's effective border has for decades been defined by the Line of Control splitting the Himalayan valley of Kashmir, the territorial dispute remains unsettled and deadly clashes have continued on both sides of the frontier. The sensitive situation witnessed a major escalation in February when tensions in Kashmir erupted into cross-border attacks. The unrest began with a suicide attack that killed 40 Indian security personnel in the India-administered Kashmir town of Pulwama and was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed, one of several Islamist militant groups New Delhi accuses Islamabad of backing. Less than two weeks later, Indian aircraft conducted airstrikes against alleged insurgent training camps in the town of Balakot, part of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, resulting in Pakistani counterstrikes and an aerial dogfight that led to the loss of at least one Indian fighter jet. The pilot of the fallen Indian MiG-21 Bison survived a landing in Pakistani-administered Kashmir and was captured. In what Khan termed a gesture of peace, the Indian pilot was returned, though Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi argued this was simply a matter of following international conventions. Ties between the two countries continued to deteriorate as President Donald Trump publicly considered playing a mediating role, something welcomed by Khan but rejected by Modi, who argued Kashmir matters were strictly a bilateral issue. The Indian leader then made the historic decision last month to repeal Articles 370 and 35a, revoking the special autonomous status afforded to India-administered Kashmir, the country's only majority-Muslim state, and sending it swaths of security forces to crack down on the restive region. Amnesty International India and the United Nations Human Rights Office have since described to Newsweek desperate living conditions in India-administered Kashmir, as have Pakistan-administered Kashmir—known as Azad Kashmir—Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider and Pakistani Ambassador to the United States Asad Majeed Khan. Now, Bukhari says "it's gone from bad to worse" as Modi has "put everyone on a 24/7 lockdown." An apparent media blackout has limited the capabilities of local and international outlets to cover the situation, but persistent reports have emerged of state-sponsored violence and arbitrary detentions. Former India-administered Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah has reportedly been under house arrest for "disturbing public order" since early last month in what Amnesty International India called "a blatant abuse of the law by the Indian government and latest in the series of human rights violations taking place in Kashmir." "The continuation of draconian laws against political dissidents despite promises of change signals a dishonest intent on part of the Indian Government," the organization said in a statement sent to Newsweek, describing the Public Safety Act as having "a long history of being misused" in India-administered Kashmir. "It has been more than 40 days since Kashmir has been under a blackout," the statement added. "Thousands of political leaders, activists and journalists continue to be silenced through administrative detention laws which run counter to international human rights standards." Bukhari told Newsweek that Pakistan exhausted its attempts to reach out to India diplomatically and Modi's recent move proved the final straw. "If I'm going to be completely honest, we were calling up until the last minute, we're anti-war, when we stopped calling was when they repealed the articles and the atrocities began in Kashmir." Now, he said Khan's goal was to raise awareness about "the genocide and the ethnic cleansing going on" in India-administered Kashmir. He said Pakistan has had success in gaining the support of certain countries, with nations like China, Turkey, Malaysia and Iran speaking out on the issue. As for the U.S., Trump was set to meet with both Modi and Khan in the same week as part of his many anticipated engagements on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Bukhari expressed confidence, saying Trump "has a very good relationship with our leader, they get along like a house on fire, they're both unconventional politicians, they're both straight-shooters." But in a move that surprised a number of observers, Trump has invited the Indian leader to a Houston rally. Indian ambassador to the U.N. Syed Akbaruddin described the invitation as a sign of close relations between Trump and Modi. "The trajectory of India's ties with the U.S. is consistently on the upward swing," Akbaruddin said in a statement sent to Newsweek. "People to people ties has been a powerful factor in the strengthening of these bonds. The event in Houston is a reflection of those booming ties. Prime Minister Modi has already expressed his deep appreciation of President Trump's unprecedented gesture of participating at the event. The message of the growth of our ties is visible and clear to all." In response to Trump's invitation to Modi, Bukhari said he wouldn't "read into that too much." He deemed it more of an election strategy on the president's part, explaining "I don't think we need to be worried that's it's anti-Kashmir, or anti-people of Kashmir or anti-Pakistan." "Obviously it hurts us, but that's more of an emotion," Bukhari told Newsweek. While both Bukhari and Akbaruddin said their respective leaders would address climate change, the latter made no mention of Kashmir. Instead, he said Modi's focus would be to "articulate the vision of India's billion[-plus] people on a host of pressing global issues on the General Assembly's agenda," which also included sustainable development goals and universal health coverage, among the topics on which "India has a key role to play." India has consistently justified its decision on Kashmir by highlighting the death and destruction wrought by a three-decade insurgency there. New Delhi has charged Islamabad with sponsoring militants seeking to destabilize India-administered Kashmir and of having a hand in high-profile attacks across the country. Bukhari described India's argument today as "an old, stale narrative." He argued: "Khan has only stood for peace, we have our own problems, our economy, we're trying to rebuild our country, how could we be interested in terrorists moving across borders when we're promoting tourism?" "It's becoming such a boring argument, and it doesn't hold any weight. Maybe it did in the past, but not with this government. All these things we're doing to promote Pakistan, it sets us back," he added. "It makes zero sense what they're saying about terrorism because it affects us most." Bukhari explained there was major concern in Pakistan as to a potential "retaliation" after the lockdown ends. "What we're fearing is the instability not only in India-occupied Kashmir, but to the region as a whole, these people have been beaten and raped what do you think they're going to do? If Modi thinks they're going to just return to their ordinary lives, he's seriously mistaken." With tensions already flaring, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyan Jaishankar said at a news conference Tuesday that "Pakistan-administered Kashmir is part of India and we expect one day that we will have physical jurisdiction over it." Bukhari echoed previous statements from Khan in suggesting the possibility of a false flag attack staged by India and blamed on Pakistan. He said "our forces are on high alert and are mobilized, so if, God forbid, there was an attack from India, we are ready, but certainly what we're trying to do is address this on an international level and avoid that. No one wants a war between these two countries." Asked if he was optimistic about the situation being resolved peacefully, Bukhari told Newsweek: "Look, I guess we have to have faith, right? Otherwise, what else are we doing here? We hope that the Kashmiri people's prayers are heard."

News article:
A member of Prime Minister Imran Khan's cabinet has warned that, if left unchecked by the international community, the fallout of India's controversial move in Kashmir could lead to a nuclear conflict between the two longtime rivals. Speaking to Newsweek, Sayed Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari, who serves as Khan's special assistant for overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, discussed the Pakistani leader's upcoming visit to New York as part of the United Nations General Assembly. Bukhari said Khan's trip would be "very Kashmir-centric," revolving around India's decision last month to consolidate control over its share of the disputed border territory and the ongoing human rights concerns that have since emerged there. Kashmir has been the subject of three out of four major wars between India and Pakistan since their 1947 partition at the hands of their former colonizer, the United Kingdom. Asked if he was concerned that another major conflict could erupt between the neighbors as the situation in India-administered Kashmir deteriorated, Bukhari said, "Absolutely." "We're extremely concerned that this could snowball into a nuclear war, you have two nuclear countries," Bukhari told Newsweek. "We're extremely worried about an escalation." While India and Pakistan's effective border has for decades been defined by the Line of Control splitting the Himalayan valley of Kashmir, the territorial dispute remains unsettled and deadly clashes have continued on both sides of the frontier. The sensitive situation witnessed a major escalation in February when tensions in Kashmir erupted into cross-border attacks. The unrest began with a suicide attack that killed 40 Indian security personnel in the India-administered Kashmir town of Pulwama and was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed, one of several Islamist militant groups New Delhi accuses Islamabad of backing. Less than two weeks later, Indian aircraft conducted airstrikes against alleged insurgent training camps in the town of Balakot, part of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, resulting in Pakistani counterstrikes and an aerial dogfight that led to the loss of at least one Indian fighter jet. The pilot of the fallen Indian MiG-21 Bison survived a landing in Pakistani-administered Kashmir and was captured. In what Khan termed a gesture of peace, the Indian pilot was returned, though Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi argued this was simply a matter of following international conventions. Ties between the two countries continued to deteriorate as President Donald Trump publicly considered playing a mediating role, something welcomed by Khan but rejected by Modi, who argued Kashmir matters were strictly a bilateral issue. The Indian leader then made the historic decision last month to repeal Articles 370 and 35a, revoking the special autonomous status afforded to India-administered Kashmir, the country's only majority-Muslim state, and sending it swaths of security forces to crack down on the restive region. Amnesty International India and the United Nations Human Rights Office have since described to Newsweek desperate living conditions in India-administered Kashmir, as have Pakistan-administered Kashmir—known as Azad Kashmir—Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider and Pakistani Ambassador to the United States Asad Majeed Khan. Now, Bukhari says "it's gone from bad to worse" as Modi has "put everyone on a 24/7 lockdown." An apparent media blackout has limited the capabilities of local and international outlets to cover the situation, but persistent reports have emerged of state-sponsored violence and arbitrary detentions. Former India-administered Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah has reportedly been under house arrest for "disturbing public order" since early last month in what Amnesty International India called "a blatant abuse of the law by the Indian government and latest in the series of human rights violations taking place in Kashmir." "The continuation of draconian laws against political dissidents despite promises of change signals a dishonest intent on part of the Indian Government," the organization said in a statement sent to Newsweek, describing the Public Safety Act as having "a long history of being misused" in India-administered Kashmir. "It has been more than 40 days since Kashmir has been under a blackout," the statement added. "Thousands of political leaders, activists and journalists continue to be silenced through administrative detention laws which run counter to international human rights standards." Bukhari told Newsweek that Pakistan exhausted its attempts to reach out to India diplomatically and Modi's recent move proved the final straw. "If I'm going to be completely honest, we were calling up until the last minute, we're anti-war, when we stopped calling was when they repealed the articles and the atrocities began in Kashmir." Now, he said Khan's goal was to raise awareness about "the genocide and the ethnic cleansing going on" in India-administered Kashmir. He said Pakistan has had success in gaining the support of certain countries, with nations like China, Turkey, Malaysia and Iran speaking out on the issue. As for the U.S., Trump was set to meet with both Modi and Khan in the same week as part of his many anticipated engagements on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Bukhari expressed confidence, saying Trump "has a very good relationship with our leader, they get along like a house on fire, they're both unconventional politicians, they're both straight-shooters." But in a move that surprised a number of observers, Trump has invited the Indian leader to a Houston rally. Indian ambassador to the U.N. Syed Akbaruddin described the invitation as a sign of close relations between Trump and Modi. "The trajectory of India's ties with the U.S. is consistently on the upward swing," Akbaruddin said in a statement sent to Newsweek. "People to people ties has been a powerful factor in the strengthening of these bonds. The event in Houston is a reflection of those booming ties. Prime Minister Modi has already expressed his deep appreciation of President Trump's unprecedented gesture of participating at the event. The message of the growth of our ties is visible and clear to all." In response to Trump's invitation to Modi, Bukhari said he wouldn't "read into that too much." He deemed it more of an election strategy on the president's part, explaining "I don't think we need to be worried that's it's anti-Kashmir, or anti-people of Kashmir or anti-Pakistan." "Obviously it hurts us, but that's more of an emotion," Bukhari told Newsweek. While both Bukhari and Akbaruddin said their respective leaders would address climate change, the latter made no mention of Kashmir. Instead, he said Modi's focus would be to "articulate the vision of India's billion[-plus] people on a host of pressing global issues on the General Assembly's agenda," which also included sustainable development goals and universal health coverage, among the topics on which "India has a key role to play." India has consistently justified its decision on Kashmir by highlighting the death and destruction wrought by a three-decade insurgency there. New Delhi has charged Islamabad with sponsoring militants seeking to destabilize India-administered Kashmir and of having a hand in high-profile attacks across the country. Bukhari described India's argument today as "an old, stale narrative." He argued: "Khan has only stood for peace, we have our own problems, our economy, we're trying to rebuild our country, how could we be interested in terrorists moving across borders when we're promoting tourism?" "It's becoming such a boring argument, and it doesn't hold any weight. Maybe it did in the past, but not with this government. All these things we're doing to promote Pakistan, it sets us back," he added. "It makes zero sense what they're saying about terrorism because it affects us most." Bukhari explained there was major concern in Pakistan as to a potential "retaliation" after the lockdown ends. "What we're fearing is the instability not only in India-occupied Kashmir, but to the region as a whole, these people have been beaten and raped what do you think they're going to do? If Modi thinks they're going to just return to their ordinary lives, he's seriously mistaken." With tensions already flaring, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyan Jaishankar said at a news conference Tuesday that "Pakistan-administered Kashmir is part of India and we expect one day that we will have physical jurisdiction over it." Bukhari echoed previous statements from Khan in suggesting the possibility of a false flag attack staged by India and blamed on Pakistan. He said "our forces are on high alert and are mobilized, so if, God forbid, there was an attack from India, we are ready, but certainly what we're trying to do is address this on an international level and avoid that. No one wants a war between these two countries." Asked if he was optimistic about the situation being resolved peacefully, Bukhari told Newsweek: "Look, I guess we have to have faith, right? Otherwise, what else are we doing here? We hope that the Kashmiri people's prayers are heard."

News article:
The international community, especially the US, views Kashmir as a bone of contention between two nuclear-armed nations. A potential nuclear engagement between Pakistan and India is perceived to be a security concern arising out of this conflict. The two nations have gone to war over Kashmir four times — 1948, 1965, 1971, and 1999. However, there is a graver threat brewing in Kashmir. The US is ignoring Kashmir at its own peril.When Saddam’s forces invaded Kuwait, the Saudis feared they were next. Osama bin Laden offered to help protect Saudi Arabia with his battle-hardened Mujahideen fighters. The Saudis rejected his offer and instead invited the Americans to protect against a potential invasion by Saddam.Bin Laden was deeply offended. He loathed the idea of infidel forces setting their feet in the Holy Land. He turned against the US and declared a holy war (Jihad) against it. This background is important to understand why al Qaeda became anti-America. Another reason was the American support for Israel. Israel’s creation among the Palestinians is commemorated as the Nakba Day (the Day of the Catastrophe). Ever since, Israel has been on a never-ending quest to grab more and more Palestinian land by never defining its permanent borders.Israel is a nuclear-armed state, though it never officially acknowledges it. And the West has comfortably looked the other way. The US covertly and overtly supported Israel in its atrocious activities, always vetoing any UN resolution against Israel. All this generated a lot of anger against the US. Public opinion especially in the Arab world has been against Israeli actions and by extension against the US for its support.India is a similar US ally as it shares with Israel the occupation and annexation of a land that does not belong to it. Kashmir is the world’s most densely militarised zone with close to a million Indian soldiers deployed there. In a deja vu, the US is choosing to look the other way. This Sunday, President Trump will join Modi at a gathering of Indian-Americans in Houston, Texas. The event is dubbed with a Texas twang as “Howdy Modi!” The disgruntled youth of Kashmir will not forget this tacit American support.It is natural for the Kashmiris to be completely disillusioned eventually and follow the jihadists’ path. Those jihadists fought against the domestic tyrant (near enemy) as the concept of takfir dictated, without losing sight of the distant enemy supporting the near enemy. Chalmers Johnson in his book Blowback warned before 9/11 that the US government’s actions in foreign countries will have consequences. The heat from Kashmir will reach far and wide. Ignoring Kashmir will make ISIS task of recruiting angry young men very easy.With no education, job, and a promising future these Kashmiri men would be driven into the arms of ISIS and al Qaeda. Lawrence Wright in The Looming Tower explained how humiliation causes young disgruntled men to join terror groups to take revenge. Humiliation drove many to abandon their families and go on a kamikaze mission called 9/11. It caused the Afghans to fight against the Soviets, created the Taliban, and is continuing to cause resistance to aggression around the world. Kashmir is where every individual, regardless of age and gender, faced humiliation by the occupying Indian army. The world should brace for impact.If the US continues to ignore Kashmir, the future may cause terrorism created by Indian aggression in Kashmir to reach the West, because terrorists also believe in guilt by association. I sincerely hope that it doesn’t happen and if it does, the world would have enough decency to not ask “Why do they hate us?”Published in The Express Tribune, September 19, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
Prime Minister Imran Khan visited Saudi Arabia last week before heading to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly session. The main purpose of his visit to Riyadh was to garner the support of the Kingdom for Pakistan’s row with India over Kashmir. But just days before his meeting with the Saudi King and Crown Prince, the Saudi oil facilities were struck by missiles. The unprecedented attacks carried out through drones shut down the Kingdom’s half of oil production but significantly sparked fears of a war in the already volatile Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of being behind the attack, although Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed the responsibility. Against this backdrop, Prime Minister Imran visited Saudi Arabia and naturally much of the discussions remained focused on the brewing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. An official handout issued by the Prime Minister Office in Islamabad said Imran briefed the Saudi leadership about the current situation in Kashmir. The statement went on to say that the Saudi King and the Crown Prince expressed concerns over the situation and reiterated their support for the Kashmir cause. Interestingly, the statement carried by the official news agency of Saudi Arabia did not mention Kashmir. The Saudi statement only talked about the attack on oil facility and Prime Minister Imran’s condemnation. This shows that the developing situation in the Middle East has thrown yet another challenge for Pakistan on the foreign policy front. Any conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran will have serious implications for Pakistan. The major challenge for Islamabad is to stay away from this brewing Iran-Saudi tension. But it is not going to be easy given the fact that Pakistan has a strategic pact with Saudi Arabia, according to which, it has to come to the rescue of the Kingdom if it comes under attack. Suppose if the US and Saudi Arabia launched an attack against Iran, and Tehran retaliates, will Pakistan take sides or stay neutral? And this is not the only repercussion that Pakistan may face. The Iran-Saudi conflict will surely raise oil prices in the international market and this naturally will impact Pakistan’s economy which is already reeling from one shock to another.Also if current tensions in the Middle East translated into a serious conflict, this will certainly distract the world’s attention from the unrest in India-Occupied Kashmir. And this is something that Pakistan would never want. Since India revoked the special status of the disputed territory on August 5, Islamabad has launched a diplomatic offensive against India. One of the reasons that Kashmir gets global traction is because of the unprecedented converge given by the international press. This naturally has benefited Pakistan’s narrative. But the developing situation in the Middle East can potentially change that proposition.What has made Pakistan’s work cut out is the sudden deadlock in the Afghan peace process. With tension growing by the day with India over Kashmir, Pakistan was hoping that a peace deal in Afghanistan would help its cause. Peace in Afghanistan would not only have secured the western border but also opened a real possibility of reviving otherwise faltering ties with the US. And an improved relationship with Washington could only enhance Islamabad’s options on Kashmir. It was because of this reason that Pakistan felt more disappointed than any other country when President Trump suddenly pulled out of the peace talks with the Taliban. At a time when Pakistan wanted to solely focus on Kashmir, it now also has to deal with increased instability in Afghanistan as well as lurking fears of a possible conflict in the Middle East. Islamabad never wanted this three-way challenge. These testing times will undoubtedly test the mettle and skills of those sitting at the helm in Pakistan.Published in The Express Tribune, September 23, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan, continuing with his “Mission Kashmir”, raised Indian brutalities in held Kashmir during high-level engagements with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Turkish President Reccip Tayyip Erdogan and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly. Prime Minister Khan met Rouhani and discussed the current situation in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, created by India’s unilateral and illegal actions that pose a grave risk to regional peace and security, a PM House statement said on Tuesday. The Prime Minister emphasised the urgent need for India to lift the curfew and other restrictions imposed on the Kashmiri population for 50 days. He also thanked the Iranian leadership, especially Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for “expressing unequivocal support for the Kashmiri people and their legitimate rights”. Both sides reviewed their bilateral relations and discussed regional developments. Khan also met Turkish President Erdogan and discussed the ongoing situation in Indian-held Kashmir with him. The two leaders reaffirmed their desire to continue standing by each other in the face of all challenges, a press release said. Separately, the Prime Minister Imran Khan met his Italian counterpart Giuseppe Conte and briefed him on the legal, humanitarian and peace and security dimension of the situation in occupied Kashmir. The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, regional and multilateral issues of mutual interest, a PM House statement said. Earlier, Prime Minister Khan attended UN’s Climate Action Summit, and spoke to dozens of heads of states and governments, business leaders, and senior civil society representatives from around the world, who lined up to promise far-reaching steps to beat climate change at the UN’s New York headquarters. “We are raising our ambition and acting in ways to help lower world green house gas numbers,” Khan said at the gathering. Khan referred to the success of his government’s Billion Tree Tsunami project in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and said work had begun to plant 10 billion trees across Pakistan in the next four years. Pakistan, he said, had committed $50 million to an independent “eco-system restoration fund” aimed at conserving biodiversity, generating green jobs, alleviating poverty and energizing the country’s youth to become custodians of a green future. “We look forward to support from bilateral and multilateral partners. Pakistan’s contribution to global Green House Gases (GHG) was miniscule—less than 1 per cent—yet, the impact of climate change on Pakistan is far greater,” the Prime Minister said.

NEW YORK/ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday brushed aside the possibility of any talks between Pakistan and India unless and until the latter lifted curfew in the Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJK). “Unless and until they lift curfew, there is no chance of talking with India,” Imran Khan told a press conference here. To a question about the possibility of his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of ongoing 74th United Nations General Assembly session, he said before August 5, Pakistan tried everything and he himself spoke to Prime Minister Modi but sadly there was no positive response from the other side. But after August 5, there was no point in talking with India, he added. The prime minister described the August 5 unilateral and illegal Indian action - which eliminated the special status of an internationally accepted disputed territory by revoking Article 370 of their constitution and the continued oppression as just a beginning, saying the situation would worsen. Imran Khan said he feared change of demography by India in the occupied piece of land [IOJ&K] and also feared massacre of Kashmiris by 900,000 Indian troops after lifting of curfew. He said he was in New York to highlight what was going on in the IOJ&K and the potential it had for the two nuclear armed countries coming face to face. The blockade of eight million people in the IOJ&K by 900,000 Indian troops, he said, was unprecedented and inhuman. Expressing his disappointment over the international community’s attitude, the prime minister said the United Nations Security Council resolutions, which promised the resolution of dispute through a plebiscite for the Kashmiris to exercise their right of self-determination, had been pending for the last 70 years. “I am a bit disappointed by international community,” he said and questioned what would be the reaction of world if eight million Europeans, Jews or even eight Americans were put under siege. He highlighted the deteriorating situation in the IOJ&K and urged the world as well as the United Nations to intervene and help address the issue by saying, “Now it is the time for the UN and the world to act.” The prime minister thanked President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for raising the issue of Kashmir during his speech at the UN General Assembly. He said the Turkish president would be visiting Pakistan next month. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan Tuesday said Pakistan was trying to mediate on the situation in Middle East and he had also contacted the Iranian leadership in that respect. “Yes I spoke to President Hassan Rouhani of Iran yesterday. We are trying to mediate. I cannot say more about it,” Imran Khan told a news conference. When asked as if United States President Donald Trump had asked him for mediation, the prime minister said before his meeting with the US president he was also asked by the Saudi leadership to talk to the Iranian president. He said he did not believe that conflicts could help resolve anything. He in this context also referred to the situation in Afghanistan and said that Pakistan was trying to get the US-Taliban talks resumed. Prime Minister Imran Khan met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of 74th session of the UN General Assembly and thanked the Iranian leadership for expressing unequivocal support for the Kashmiri people and their legitimate rights. Both sides reviewed their bilateral relations and discussed regional developments, a PM House statement issued here Tuesday said. The prime minister underscored Pakistan’s desire to further strengthen good neighbourly relations with Iran and build mutually beneficial cooperation in diverse areas. He thanked the Iranian leadership, especially Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for expressing unequivocal support for the Kashmiri people and their legitimate rights. The prime minister also discussed the current situation in Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir, created by India’s unilateral and illegal actions that pose a grave risk to regional peace and security. Speaking on the gross human rights violations in IOJ&K, the Prime Minister emphasised the urgent need to lift curfew and other restrictions imposed on Kashmiri population for 50 days. Both sides agreed to fast track implementation of the bilateral agreements, concluded during the visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to Iran, earlier this year. Prime Minister Imran Khan met Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy on the sidelines of 74th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York and briefed him on the legal, humanitarian and peace and security dimension of the situation in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, regional and multilateral issues of mutual interest, a PM House statement issued here said. The prime minister called for the immediate lifting of all restrictions including the curfew, release of all prisoners, stop in the use of pellet guns, and respect for the human rights of Kashmiri people. He also underlined the importance of the international community acting urgently to ward off threats to peace and security and facilitate peaceful resolution of the dispute in Jammu and Kashmir. In the bilateral context the two sides agreed to enhance mutual cooperation in the political, trade and economic, defence production, cultural and educational domains.

News article:
Around two months after ending the special status of India-Occupied Kashmir (IOK), New Delhi’s next move is to ensure the total absorption of the occupied territory in the Indian Union. This would require implementing steps to allow Indian nationals to buy property, cast their vote and permanently settle in the disputed state, the implications of which will be far-reaching.A major impediment to annex IOK in the Indian Union was removed on August 5 when the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Act was passed. After two months, there is no indication that the Indian government intends to undo this action. On the contrary, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar asserted that India’s next move would be to seek control over Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.During this time, except for statements, speeches, and demonstrations in Pakistan and across the world, nothing substantial has been achieved to compel India to review its unilateral act of ending IOK’s special status. New Delhi has neither released the thousands of Kashmiris, including children, it arrested, nor restored communication networks or lifted the curfew in the Valley. Based on its past acts of annexing Hyderabad Deccan, Junagarh, Goa and occupying Siachen, India is now systematically implementing its age-old plan to transform the demographic complexion of the Muslim-dominated Kashmir Valley. And who can undermine the fact that India took advantage of the 1971 crisis in then East Pakistan and invaded it, which resulted in the creation of Bangladesh? Since then, India has repeatedly reminded the world of its role in the breakup of Pakistan and gotten away with blatant aggression.If the Kashmir Valley is emerging as the West Bank of India, it means India is replicating the Israeli policy of launching Jewish settlements and annexing a major chunk of the occupied land. In June 1967 during the Arab-Israeli war, Israel occupied the Palestinian territory of West Bank, including East Jerusalem which was at that time under Jordan’s control. UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338 calls upon Israel to withdraw its forces from the Arab-occupied areas including the West Bank. After 52 years, Israel has not only annexed East Jerusalem where the Al Aqsa Mosque is located but also shifted its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel, while violating the UNSC resolutions, has established hundreds of Jewish settlements causing a serious demographic tilt in favour of the Jewish population. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu recently announced that if re-elected, he will annex a sizeable part of the West Bank. Henceforth, it is the Israeli model of West Bank which India is duplicating in its occupied Valley of Muslim-majority Kashmir.Since India has already declared Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir as union territories, it needs to ensure that at least five million Indians settle in the Valley in the next few years. The remaining almost eight million Muslim Kashmiris will be neutralised either by displacement or by being pushed across the LoC. Till the time the Valley transforms into a non-Muslim territory, Indian military and paramilitary force will stay there and J&K State Assembly elections will not be held.Is it possible for India to replicate the Israelisation of West Bank as Indianisation of the Valley? Why is the Modi regime so confident that it will get away with this? Has any political or diplomatic damage been done to India in the last two months? Pakistan’s attempts of raising the Kashmir issue in the UNSC or in the annual General Assembly session under PM Khan’s “Kashmir mission” may not have a significant impact on the Indian psyche because of two main reasons.First, no resolution in the Security Council has been presented assailing India of unilaterally ending IOK’s special status. Nor has any pressure been exerted by Pakistan across the LoC to deter Indian authorities from committing severe human rights violations including arresting children, dishonouring Muslim Kashmiri women and depriving eight million people of basic necessities.Second, apart from statements and protest marches across the world, Kashmiris have been prevented from launching large-scale popular protests in the Valley. Using deception as a tool, the Modi regime tried to break the tempo of any popular resistance thereby arguing that the case is with the Indian Supreme Court and if the court declares the August 5 reorganisation act null and void, it will accept the verdict. The skilful and shrewd approach of Modi’s regime is to gain time and raise hope in the Valley for justice from the superior judiciary. And, while hearing petitions against the imposition of curfew and other punitive measures of the Indian government in IOK, the Indian Supreme Court refused to pass any order and merely asked the High Court of J&K and the state government to ease things for the people of the Valley. How can one expect the court to do anything if it’s reluctant to pass a judgment which will seriously impede the central government’s credibility?There are strong indications that India may get away with its absorption of the occupied territory and transforming the Valley into something like the Israeli-occupied once Palestinian-majority West Bank. So far, there is no major opposition in India against the BJP’s policy. The Indian security establishment and its political allies led by the BJP think that Pakistan lacks the capability to challenge India militarily or arrange the crossing of LoC by scores of Kashmiris in Azad Kashmir, to confront Indian security forces. That is why, they believe, PM Imran Khan recently warned that no Pakistani should attempt to cross the LoC.

Most importantly, by missing the September 19 deadline for presenting a resolution in the UNHRC on India’s violations of human rights in IOK, Pakistan missed a valuable opportunity to expose New Delhi at the international level.

News article:
Around two months after ending the special status of India-Occupied Kashmir (IOK), New Delhi’s next move is to ensure the total absorption of the occupied territory in the Indian Union. This would require implementing steps to allow Indian nationals to buy property, cast their vote and permanently settle in the disputed state, the implications of which will be far-reaching.A major impediment to annex IOK in the Indian Union was removed on August 5 when the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Act was passed. After two months, there is no indication that the Indian government intends to undo this action. On the contrary, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar asserted that India’s next move would be to seek control over Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.During this time, except for statements, speeches, and demonstrations in Pakistan and across the world, nothing substantial has been achieved to compel India to review its unilateral act of ending IOK’s special status. New Delhi has neither released the thousands of Kashmiris, including children, it arrested, nor restored communication networks or lifted the curfew in the Valley. Based on its past acts of annexing Hyderabad Deccan, Junagarh, Goa and occupying Siachen, India is now systematically implementing its age-old plan to transform the demographic complexion of the Muslim-dominated Kashmir Valley. And who can undermine the fact that India took advantage of the 1971 crisis in then East Pakistan and invaded it, which resulted in the creation of Bangladesh? Since then, India has repeatedly reminded the world of its role in the breakup of Pakistan and gotten away with blatant aggression.If the Kashmir Valley is emerging as the West Bank of India, it means India is replicating the Israeli policy of launching Jewish settlements and annexing a major chunk of the occupied land. In June 1967 during the Arab-Israeli war, Israel occupied the Palestinian territory of West Bank, including East Jerusalem which was at that time under Jordan’s control. UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338 calls upon Israel to withdraw its forces from the Arab-occupied areas including the West Bank. After 52 years, Israel has not only annexed East Jerusalem where the Al Aqsa Mosque is located but also shifted its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel, while violating the UNSC resolutions, has established hundreds of Jewish settlements causing a serious demographic tilt in favour of the Jewish population. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu recently announced that if re-elected, he will annex a sizeable part of the West Bank. Henceforth, it is the Israeli model of West Bank which India is duplicating in its occupied Valley of Muslim-majority Kashmir.Since India has already declared Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir as union territories, it needs to ensure that at least five million Indians settle in the Valley in the next few years. The remaining almost eight million Muslim Kashmiris will be neutralised either by displacement or by being pushed across the LoC. Till the time the Valley transforms into a non-Muslim territory, Indian military and paramilitary force will stay there and J&K State Assembly elections will not be held.Is it possible for India to replicate the Israelisation of West Bank as Indianisation of the Valley? Why is the Modi regime so confident that it will get away with this? Has any political or diplomatic damage been done to India in the last two months? Pakistan’s attempts of raising the Kashmir issue in the UNSC or in the annual General Assembly session under PM Khan’s “Kashmir mission” may not have a significant impact on the Indian psyche because of two main reasons.First, no resolution in the Security Council has been presented assailing India of unilaterally ending IOK’s special status. Nor has any pressure been exerted by Pakistan across the LoC to deter Indian authorities from committing severe human rights violations including arresting children, dishonouring Muslim Kashmiri women and depriving eight million people of basic necessities.Second, apart from statements and protest marches across the world, Kashmiris have been prevented from launching large-scale popular protests in the Valley. Using deception as a tool, the Modi regime tried to break the tempo of any popular resistance thereby arguing that the case is with the Indian Supreme Court and if the court declares the August 5 reorganisation act null and void, it will accept the verdict. The skilful and shrewd approach of Modi’s regime is to gain time and raise hope in the Valley for justice from the superior judiciary. And, while hearing petitions against the imposition of curfew and other punitive measures of the Indian government in IOK, the Indian Supreme Court refused to pass any order and merely asked the High Court of J&K and the state government to ease things for the people of the Valley. How can one expect the court to do anything if it’s reluctant to pass a judgment which will seriously impede the central government’s credibility?There are strong indications that India may get away with its absorption of the occupied territory and transforming the Valley into something like the Israeli-occupied once Palestinian-majority West Bank. So far, there is no major opposition in India against the BJP’s policy. The Indian security establishment and its political allies led by the BJP think that Pakistan lacks the capability to challenge India militarily or arrange the crossing of LoC by scores of Kashmiris in Azad Kashmir, to confront Indian security forces. That is why, they believe, PM Imran Khan recently warned that no Pakistani should attempt to cross the LoC. Whereas addressing a public meeting in Chakothi, the Azad Kashmir PM warned no one can dare stop Kashmiris from crossing the LoC. The Indian government is aware of Pakistan’s economic situation and political confrontation between the government and the opposition over the arrests of key PPP and PML-N leaders, and the proposed march on Islamabad by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to force the PTI government to quit.In the absence of any clear support for Pakistan in passing a resolution against India in the UNSC or calling a special session of the UN General Assembly, New Delhi is quietly working on implementing its plan to change Kashmir’s demography.

News article:
The lingering Kashmir issue came under renewed international focus with growing calls on Saturday for its peaceful settlement in accordance with the United Nations (UN) resolutions, just a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan's powerful speech at the UN General Assembly (UNGA).Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad said on Saturday that Kashmir "has been invaded and occupied" despite the UN resolution on the issue. While Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for a peaceful resolution of the dispute based on the UN Charter and Security Council resolutions.In his maiden address to the 74th session of the General Assembly on Friday, Prime Minister Imran tugged at world conscience over Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir, asking "will the world go for a market of 1.2 billion people, or for justice and humanity".Taking the podium later, Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamad discussed several issues facing the Muslim countries and drew the attention of the 193-member General Assembly towards the plight of the Muslims in conflict zones such as Kashmir, Palestine, Myanmar and others.Calling for settling the Kashmir dispute through "peaceful means", he regretted that despite the UN resolutions Kashmir "has been invaded and occupied"."There might be reasons for this action, but it is still wrong," said Mahathir, warning: "Ignoring the UN would lead to other forms of disregard for the UN and the rule of law."On the question of Palestine, Mahathir said the first action of the UN was the creation of Israel, seizing Arab land and expelling 90% of the Arab population."The result was terrorism when there was none before, or not on the present scale."He said that Malaysia accepts Israel as a fait accompli but cannot accept Jewish settlements or occupation of Jerusalem.Turning to the Rohingya issue, he noted many colonies in the West had expelled natives from their countries, but never as brutally as in Myanmar. "The Rohingya dare not return to Myanmar because they could not trust its military, due to the helplessness of the world in stopping atrocities."The Malaysian premier said that Muslims were accused of terrorism even if they did nothing, while their states were destabilised by regime change. "There were no massive migrations in the past, but now wars and regime change have forced people to flee their countries."Noting that democracy was not the easiest form of government to operate, especially when it is adopted overnight, he called for time for gradual change."Otherwise the result is violence, civil wars or new more harsh regimes."Earlier, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi raised the Kashmir issue in his address to the General Assembly on Friday, calling for a peaceful resolution of the dispute between Pakistan and India based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements.In a blunt speech at the annual General Assembly, the Chinese government's top diplomat also said that tariffs and trade disputes could plunge the world into recession and Beijing was committed to resolving them in a "calm, rational and cooperative manner".Yi said Kashmir issue was a dispute left from history and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. "China opposes any unilateral actions that complicated the situation," he said.Taking a clear swipe at US President Donald Trump, who started a damaging trade war on China nearly 15 months ago, Wang said the lessons of the Great Depression should not be forgotten."Erecting walls will not resolve global challenges, and blaming others for one's own problems does not work," he said.Earlier this week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a solution through dialogue for the Kashmir dispute in his address at the General Assembly.Erdogan criticised the international community for failing to pay attention to the Kashmir conflict, which he said, awaited solution for 72 years.Prime Minister Imran spoke to the General Assembly on Friday. In his address, he emphasised that the world community had a responsibility to ensure that the Kashmiris get their right to self-determination as enshrined in several Security Council resolutions, warning that if a conventional war started between Pakistan and India, anything could happen.The prime minister's powerful address touched nerves in India. Exercising right to reply to Imran's speech, Indian External Affairs Ministry First Secretary Vidisha Maitra lashed out at Pakistan for highlighting the plight of the Kashmiri people.She reiterated the Indian rhetoric, accusing Pakistan of "terrorism and hate speech" and "trying to play its wild card as the newfound champion of human rights".She said that Imran's warning of potential nuclear war over Kashmir was not appropriate to "statesmanship".Meanwhile, India's external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, on Saturday, termed Chinese Foreign Minister Yi's call for a peaceful resolution to Kashmir dispute an attack on his country's "sovereignty and territorial integrity".He claimed that Kashmir was India's internal matter and "we expect that other countries will ... desist from efforts to change the status quo through the illegal so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor."

News article:
NEW YORK: Prime Minister Imran Khan has said President Donald Trump headed the most powerful country in the world, and he is in the best position to do something about the issue of Kashmir. In an interview with American television network CNN, he said: “[Indian premier Narendra] Modi does not want international mediation as he knows the moment this issue becomes internationalised, the world will understand that Kashmiris are fighting for their right to self-determination and are being subjected to the worst human rights abuses by Indian forces.” Imran Khan warned that if Kashmir situation further worsens, it would remain neither in his nor in President Trump’s control. The prime minister urged the international community to move on this issue as it was a flashpoint between two nuclear-armed countries. “If it was something localised, the world would not have been pushed about it,” he stressed. In response to a question regarding Iran-US tensions, PM Imran said Pakistan does not want conflict near its borders. Conflict in the Persian Gulf could lead to an increase in global oil prices and a host of other issues, he noted. “To be fair with President Trump, all his instincts are against war. I also spoke to President Rouhani of Iran and let’s see where the situation leads,” he shared. The world needed to understand the gravity of the human rights situation in the Indian-occupied Kashmir and pressure India to lift the military curfew in the held Valley, Imran Khan said. He talked at length about the issues discussed in his address to the United Nations on Friday. Highlighting the situation of occupied Kashmir, the premier said the enormity of the situation could be gauged from the presence of 900,000 Indian troops in the occupied territory. Ruling out a meeting with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, PM Imran noted besieging Kashmiris for over 50 days is a testament to the hateful mindset of the Indian leader. Imran said Modi represented the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, that was established in 1925 after being inspired by Hitler and Nazism. “RSS believes in ethnic cleansing of Muslims in India. This ideology of racial superiority is also responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, who was considered soft on Muslims,” PM Imran said, referencing the slain Indian independence leader. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday met UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in New York and commended him for his clear articulation of the the UN position on Kashmir dispute. During the meeting with PM Imran, Guterres reiterated his deep concern over the human rights and humanitarian situation in Indian occupied Kashmir. Guterres reaffirmed that he would remain engaged on the issue and conveyed that his offer to help facilitate a peaceful solution continued to stand. Commending the secretary general for his clear articulation of the UN position on Kashmir dispute the prime minister briefed him on the 54 days long siege of over eight million Kashmiris amidst communications blackout. Such draconian lock down had no parallel in recent history and the need for its immediate lifting could not be stressed enough. The prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s rejection of Indian illegal and unilateral actions of August 5 as these were in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions. Noting that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights had comprehensively documented the previous gross human rights violations by India in Kashmir PM Imran underlined that India’s recent actions represented a new chapter of intensified human rights abuses. Imran highlighted the risks to regional peace and security that arose from India’s illegal and irresponsible actions underscoring the responsibility of the UN and international community to take urgent steps to save lives and help resolve the long standing Kashmir dispute.

The prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s rejection of Indian illegal and unilateral actions of August 5 as these were in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions.

News article:
NEW YORK: Prime Minister Imran Khan has said President Donald Trump headed the most powerful country in the world, and he is in the best position to do something about the issue of Kashmir. In an interview with American television network CNN, he said: “[Indian premier Narendra] Modi does not want international mediation as he knows the moment this issue becomes internationalised, the world will understand that Kashmiris are fighting for their right to self-determination and are being subjected to the worst human rights abuses by Indian forces.” Imran Khan warned that if Kashmir situation further worsens, it would remain neither in his nor in President Trump’s control. The prime minister urged the international community to move on this issue as it was a flashpoint between two nuclear-armed countries. “If it was something localised, the world would not have been pushed about it,” he stressed. In response to a question regarding Iran-US tensions, PM Imran said Pakistan does not want conflict near its borders. Conflict in the Persian Gulf could lead to an increase in global oil prices and a host of other issues, he noted. “To be fair with President Trump, all his instincts are against war. I also spoke to President Rouhani of Iran and let’s see where the situation leads,” he shared. The world needed to understand the gravity of the human rights situation in the Indian-occupied Kashmir and pressure India to lift the military curfew in the held Valley, Imran Khan said. He talked at length about the issues discussed in his address to the United Nations on Friday. Highlighting the situation of occupied Kashmir, the premier said the enormity of the situation could be gauged from the presence of 900,000 Indian troops in the occupied territory. Ruling out a meeting with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, PM Imran noted besieging Kashmiris for over 50 days is a testament to the hateful mindset of the Indian leader. Imran said Modi represented the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, that was established in 1925 after being inspired by Hitler and Nazism. “RSS believes in ethnic cleansing of Muslims in India. This ideology of racial superiority is also responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, who was considered soft on Muslims,” PM Imran said, referencing the slain Indian independence leader.

News article:
The leader of the Pakistani side of divided Kashmir is hopeful that India's clampdown in the Himalayan territory has reached a turning point -- bringing US pressure. Sardar Masood Khan was visiting Washington to meet lawmakers, media and experts after India on August 5 rescinded autonomy on its side and sharply curtailed ordinary people's communications. "There is a palpable shift in the United States," Khan, president of the section that Pakistanis call "Azad," or "Free," Kashmir, told AFP. "The pro-India sentiment here in the United States prior to the August 5 steps was very strong because of the strong economic and strategic ties between the United States and India. But this is changing fast," he said. As evidence, he pointed to how a number of lawmakers have criticized the Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policies in what had been India's sole Muslim-majority state. This week, 14 Democrats led by Representative Pramila Jayapal urged Modi to restore internet and cellular service for Kashmiris, saying in a letter that US residents had been unable to reach relatives. President Donald Trump has literally rallied behind Modi, joining him at a mass gathering last month in Houston, but the State Department has asked India to bring back communications and release detained political leaders. Khan said he was also grateful to US and international media, who have faced restrictions in Indian Kashmir. "The media has after decades spoken up for the people of Jammu and Kashmir and not the Indian establishment, so that's a major change," he said. India justifies its measures by saying it wanted to better integrate Kashmir and was trying to avoid trouble stirred up by Pakistan, which it accuses of arming and training guerillas. 'Seething with anger' Kashmir, the trigger for two full-fledged wars between the nuclear-armed powers, has long inflamed passions in both countries. Prime Minister Imran Khan, addressing the United Nations last week, accused India of plotting a "bloodbath" by sending in troops. But he has also publicly discouraged infiltration into the Indian side, which he said would hurt the cause. Sardar Masood Khan said that youths in Pakistani Kashmir were "seething with anger" and wanted to "fight for the rights of their brothers and sisters." "While we respect their sentiments and we share their sentiments, we do not want any unregulated activity across the Line of Control," he said. India also ended restrictions on non-Kashmiris buying land in the Himalayan territory formerly known as Jammu and Kashmir. Khan accused India of following an Israeli model, encouraging Hindus to settle in Kashmir and "reduce the Kashmiri or Muslim majority in the state." But Khan said he recognized the rights of Kashmir's historic Hindu community, known as Pandits. Some 200,000 Pandits fled the Kashmir Valley after an insurgency against India erupted in 1989. "They should be brought back, they should be reintegrated into the mainstream and they should be given all sorts of guarantees for their protection -- physical protection and protection of their rights," Khan said. 'Grateful' to China Khan, a former Pakistani ambassador to Beijing, hailed the role of China which arranged a rare Security Council meeting on Kashmir in August. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also mentioned Kashmir in his address to the United Nations, calling for neither side to "unilaterally change the status quo." "The people of Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan are grateful to China for speaking up for the Kashmiris," Khan said. The United States has questioned why Pakistan is not also raising concerns about China, which according to rights groups has detained around one million Uighurs and other Muslims in re-education camps in western Xinjiang region in a step Washington says is reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Khan -- who accused India of "genocide" in Kashmir -- said that the two situations were "completely different." "Occupied Kashmir is a disputed territory that doesn't belong to India and what they're doing now is colonization," he said. Speaking of his past experiences in Xinjiang, Khan said China was "taking affirmative action to develop the region economically" and to "integrate" ethnic groups. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, who was also visiting Washington, said China had no business raising Kashmir as New Delhi had not changed the status quo on the international front. But he also declined to join US criticism of China on Xinjiang, saying: "Human rights comments are a much greater part of the Western political culture than the Asian."

News article:
MULTAN: Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said that Pakistan’s stance on Kashmir has never been weak and the main problem it faces is the weak economy. Qureshi said former judge of Indian supreme court Justice Markandey Katju has rightly said that India had sown seeds for large-scale guerrilla war in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) by stripping the territory of its special status. Delivering the keynote address at the annual national conference titled ''Hazrat Bahauddin Zakariya (RA) Teachings and Social Harmony'' here Thursday, the minister said that senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad also portrayed a horrible picture of IOK on his return to India after staying there for six days. He said India has imposed curfew and restrictions in IOK for the last two months, but it failed to shatter the courage of brave Kashmiris. He said that the Kashmir fight was a long fight; it was not a T20, but a Test match which could only be won by a team which had a holistic approach. The minister said that the world is praising Pakistan’s narrative and the international media like New York Times, Washington Post, Telegraph, CNN, BBC and others were supporting Pakistan’s viewpoint. He said human rights organisations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which set the world’s narrative, are praising Pakistan’s approach. Regarding recent visit of Pakistani delegation led by Prime Minister Imran Khan to the United Nations, he said that they held 120 meetings with P5 global leaders and foreign ministers of different countries in seven-day stay and interacted with the media. On Saudi-Iran tensions, he said that Prime Minister Imran Khan discussed the issue with US President Donald Trump, Saudi crown prince, Iranian president and US secretary of state and tried to normalise the situation. About Islamophobia, he said that it was unjust to link terrorism with Islam. "Does terrorism has a religion," he asked. Shah Mehmood said that he was satisfied with his meeting with the Taliban delegation led by Mulla Abdul Ghani Baradar in Islamabad and discussion about resumption of dialogue with the US. About south Punjab youth job opportunities, he said that he would talk to Punjab chief minister about it. “We have the relationship of religion and faith with our Kashmiri brethren and we all are followers of Sufi saints,” he said, adding that the Sufi saints built mosques but never demolished temples. He said the Sufi approach towards life is aimed at making society inclusive and following bringing the nation together.

Foreign Office Spokesperson Dr Mohammad Faisal said on Thursday that Pakistan was not ready to join any arms race in the South Asian region.The spokesperson passed the remarks during the weekly FO briefing when asked in regards to India's recent acquisition of advanced jet fighters from France.“We [Pakistan] urge the world to refrain from pushing this region [South Asian region] into an arms race,” said the FO spokesperson.“Pakistan knows how to defend itself. It does not matter if its a Rafale or any other fighter jet. The whole world is a witness to the episode of February 27.”"The main focus of this [PTI] government is on youth development, education and health.”Voicing concern over the indefinite curfew and blatant human rights violations in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK), Dr Faisal said, “Pakistan demands the lifting of all sorts of restrictions and stoppage of human rights violations in the valley.”“We [Pakistan] do not expect any good from India. Those who are supporting New Delhi, they should remain standing with it. It does not make any difference.”“Pakistan is raising the situation of IOK on every platform. We are determined to resolve the matter as per the will of the people who are trapped in an open-air prison.”The spokesperson also welcomed the visit of US senators to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and hoped the atrocities in IOK would soon be exposed to the world.Faisal said despite Indian efforts to cover up brutalities in the valley, the plight of the Kashmiri people was being recognised across the world.Responding to a question about the Kartarpur Corridor, the FO spokesperson said a formal invitation had been extended to former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to attend the opening ceremony.Dr Faisal added the ceremony would happen as per the schedule.“Work on the Kartarpur Corridor is continuing with full speed and it will be completed on time.”“Pakistan is working on the dates of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit to be held in Islamabad which will be shared once they are finalised.”Islamabad also appreciated Turkey's role in finding a viable political solution to the conflict.During his press conference, Dr Faisal said commended Turkey's humanitarian efforts for graciously hosting over 3.5 million Syrian refugees on its soil.“Pakistan also recognises Turkey’s legitimate security concerns in the region.

(Adds background context) ISLAMABAD, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan is likely to visit Saudi Arabia and Iran, the foreign office in Islamabad said on Thursday, weeks after Islamabad said Washington had asked it to mediate with Tehran. "The possibility of a visit of the prime minister to Saudi Arabia and Iran is on the cards and I will update you as things unfold," foreign office spokesman, Mohammad Fasisal, told a news briefing. The announcement of the possible visit comes after Khan last month described a request by U.S. President Donald Trump, asking the Pakistani leader to help defuse tensions with Iran. Washington had blamed Tehran for an attack on the world's biggest crude oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. Faisal declined to comment when asked whether the visit was related to the mediation request. Tensions have elevated between Iran and Saudi Arabia since the attack, which took place on Sept. 14. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, has claimed responsibility, but Washington and Riyadh say they believe the attack came from the opposite direction and blame Iran. Iran denies involvement. Khan said after a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York that he was "trying and mediating" and had also spoken with Iran's President Hassan Rouhani. Khan has ramped up his government's engagement on the international stage, offering to negotiate regional tensions. He has separately proposed to Trump that Pakistan could help broker peace in neighbouring Afghanistan. Last week Pakistani government ministers met with both Taliban representatives and the U.S. peace envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, in Islamabad while Pakistan's foreign minister called for a resumption in stalled peace talks between the Taliban and Washington. The Taliban also met with Khalilzad, sources told Reuters, the first known contact since Trump halted talks last month, though officials said the talks did not represent a formal resumption of negotiations.

News article:
As Islamabad is becoming increasingly wary of an escalating conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has set out on a mission to defuse tension between the Middle Eastern rivals. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan held talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran on Sunday. He was also scheduled to meet with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other high-ranking Iranian officials. The purpose of his Iran visit, according to Pakistan's government, is to "promote peace and security in the region." It is Khan's second visit to Iran this year. "I told Prime Minster Imran [Khan] we welcome any gesture by Pakistan for peace in the region and appreciate his visit to our country," said Rouhani at a joint press conference with the Pakistani premier. Rouhani said that among other things, they also discussed the Yemen war and the US sanctions on Iran. "Regional issues have to be resolved through regional means and dialogue. We also emphasized that any goodwill gesture will be reciprocated with a goodwill gesture and good words," said the Iranian president. Pakistani foreign minister: 'Islamabad wants reduction in US-Iran tensions' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Pakistan's own worries Khan was also expected to visit Saudi Arabia, Pakistan's main ally in the Middle East, after concluding his Iran trip. During his visit to the US last month, Khan said that President Donald Trump had asked him to "mediate" between its ally Saudi Arabia and Tehran. The US leader, however, refuted Khan's claim. Read more: Convincing Trump on Kashmir — Pakistani PM Khan's toughest diplomatic test Nonetheless, Islamabad is stepping up efforts to defuse tensions between the Gulf neighbors as it fears that a possible US-backed war with Iran would spill over into Pakistan, unleashing sectarian violence between the country's majority Sunni and minority Shiite populations and devastating its already frail economy due to a potential oil crisis. Read more: US to send troops, missile defense system to Saudi Arabia after drone attack "Pakistan attaches high importance to bilateral ties with Iran," Khan was quoted as saying by his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party. "Pakistan is willing to play its role towards strengthening peace and stability in the region." Militant activities For years, ties between Iran and Pakistan have remained tense due to a deep mutual mistrust. Pakistan has generally tried to maintain close ties with both Saudi Arabia and Iran — bitter regional foes — but has drifted away from Tehran in the past few years. Both Islamabad and Tehran accuse each other of backing separatist groups, which are active in Pakistan's and Iran's Baluchistan provinces and seek independence from both countries. In March, President Rouhani demanded Pakistan act decisively against anti-Iranian terrorists, following a February attack that killed 27 members of the elite Revolutionary Guard in Sistan-Baluchistan. Iran claimed that a Pakistani suicide bomber was behind the attack, which was claimed by the Sunni jihadi group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), which Tehran says operates mostly out of Pakistan. Read more: Why did US declare an anti-Iran militant group terrorist? Shiite-majority Iran is wary of Islamabad's alleged support for various Sunni militant groups, which have been involved in launching attacks in Iran's eastern areas, and massacring Shiite citizens inside Pakistan. The sectarian strife in Pakistan has been ongoing for some time now, with militant Islamist groups unleashing terror on the minority Shiite groups in many parts of the country. Most of these outfits, including the Taliban, take inspiration from the hard-line Saudi-Wahabi Islamic ideology. 'Solidly allied with Riyadh' Iran is also angered by Pakistan's role in the Saudi-led military alliance that is operating against Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen. Read more: Pakistan's Yemen dilemma: Being neutral is not an option "It is obvious that the Pakistani-Iranian ties have not been cordial for quite some time. However, if the Pakistani government gives more importance to Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict, the relations will likely get acrimonious," said Tariq Peerzada, a foreign affairs expert in Islamabad. Read more: Examining Saudi-Pakistani ties in changing geopolitics Islamabad's over-enthusiasm to please Riyadh could further exacerbate its relations with Tehran. Security analysts say that Pakistan's support for Saudi Arabia has increased the Sunni-Shiite rift in the South Asian country. They also say that Sunni militant groups feel further emboldened by the fact that Raheel Sharif, Pakistan's ex-army chief, now heads the Saudi-led military alliance. Tehran is aware of Islamabad's cooperation with Riyadh. At the same time, it is aware of the concerns and limitations of its ties with Pakistan and wants to maintain "normal" relations with the neighboring country. "Pakistan remains solidly allied with Saudi Arabia, regardless of how intense the outreach may be from Tehran. There are decades of close military cooperation that are not about to be undone," said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. It remains to be seen whether Pakistani leader Khan can convince Iranian authorities that his country would not undermine Tehran's interests in the region. But experts say that since Pakistan is already part of the Saudi security alliance and has not done enough to allay Iran's concerns about its alleged role in backing anti-Iran militants on its soil, Khan's diplomatic efforts in Tehran are unlikely to yield results.

News article:
Foreign minister says Pakistan's main purpose of diplomatic initiative was to prevent any escalation in tensions. SCREENGRAB ISLAMABAD: [fbvideo link=" https://www.facebook.com/etribune/videos/445374942997484/"][/fbvideo] The threat of an immediate conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran has been averted thanks to Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi announced on Wednesday. Qureshi told the media that both the Saudi and Iranian leadership had agreed to pursue diplomatic options to resolve their differences. His statement came just hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan concluded a visit to Saudi Arabia as part of Pakistan’s efforts to defuse tensions in the Persian Gulf region. The prime minister had earlier travelled to Tehran, where he said Pakistan wanted to facilitate dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Qureshi said the Iranian leadership shared Pakistan’s perspective and expressed their willingness to hold direct talks or through any third party with Saudi Arabia. The Iranian leadership also said they never wanted war with Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Imran, according to Qureshi, took the same message to Saudi Arabia. In Riyadh, Imran, who was also accompanied by ISI DG Lt General Faiz Hameed and other senior officials, met Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “Pakistan’s main objective was to avert any conflict between the two countries, Qureshi said, adding that he could say with confidence that the “threat of an immediate conflict” between Saudi Arabia and Iran was now fading away. The two countries, he went on to say, agreed to pursue diplomatic options to resolve their differences. The mode of dialogue was being finalised, he added. According to officials familiar with the development, Pakistan suggested direct talks between the Saudi and Iranian authorities. The prime minister even proposed Islamabad as the venue for such talks, the officials added. The ISI DG, who in the last week of September quietly visited Iran and Saudi Arabia, is believed to have played a major role in laying the ground for de-escalation in the Middle East. Officials said he would be the focal person for future contacts between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Qureshi explained that the reason behind prime minister’s diplomatic initiative was the negative fallout of any conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia on Pakistan. He said war in the Middle East would not only jeopardise the regional security but also have devastating consequences for the world’s economy. “We have seen how the oil prices in the international market shot up after missile attacks on the Saudi oil facilities,” Qureshi recalled. “Just imagine the consequences of a war between major oil producing countries,” the foreign minister asked. Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have been on the rise since September 14 missile attacks on the Saudi oil facilities. Both Riyadh and Washington blamed Tehran, which strongly denied its involvement. Houthi rebels in Yemen on the other hand took responsibility. Before visiting Riyadh, Prime Minister Imran told CNN in an interview that President Trump had asked him to mediate between Saudi Arabia and Iran. On Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif acknowledged the Prime Minister’s peace efforts.

News article:
Pakistan has become a key player in settling growing tensions in the region after US President Donald Trump made a request to Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the recently concluded UN General Assembly to talk to Iran and Saudi Arabia. The two countries have traditionally had a tense relationship but this has grown worse a few months oil installations at Aramco were attacked by Houthi rebels, which Saudi Arabia says are backed by Iran. Iran has not openly acknowledged any support to the Houthis. Indeed, since the war in Yemen began in 2915 relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have been becoming increasingly strained. In the past, Pakistan’s efforts to act as mediator have not been particularly successful with former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif failing to bring about improvement after meeting with the Saudi leadership in 2016. PM Imran Khan has met Saudi Crown Prince Prince Muhammad bin Salman in Riyadh to discuss the situation and suggest all countries work towards peace. Prince Muhammad’s response is not known. Previously, Imran Khan, keeping his promise to President Trump met Iranian President Rouhani in Tehran and also put forward proposals for peace. Iran had agreed it sought peace in the region. One of the issues is the worsening relationship between the US and Iran after President Trump withdrew from an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons. There has also been a deployment of US troops in the waters close to Iran. While Islamabad’s ties with Riyadh and Tehran are both good, it may not be so easy to bring an end to hostilities between them given the animosity that exists and which is based on many factors including sectarian politics. For its own sake Pakistan will however be very eager to reduce temperatures in the region since any conflict in the Gulf would also affect it very badly. Pakistan shares a long border with Iran while Saudi Arabia is one of closest allies. For these reasons it is certain that the prime minister and his advisers on foreign relations would wish to achieve some kind of settlement. This would also earn them points with Washington given that President Trump had assigned them with a difficult task of acting as mediator. We hope for everyone’s sake that peace does prevail in the end.

ISLAMABAD: As Prime Minister Imran Khan has formally initiated efforts to broker patch-up between Iran and Saudi Arab, this is fourth attempt by any Pakistani leader to mediate between two Islamic countries. A couple of such efforts were made in past by former prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif and one by the former military dictator Gen (R) Pervez Musharraf. Although Gen Ziaul Haq also had one mediation plan on his credit, it was during Iran-Iraq war and the efforts were aimed to end it. In September 1980, he went to Tehran on an “Islamic peace mission” to end the war, however, efforts failed to make any headway as neither side was ready to submit. Iran thought Iraq was aggressor and the vice versa. This war continued for eight years ending on August 20, 1988, three days after the death of Zia in a plane crash. Regarding Iran-Saudi Arab patch, the first such effort was made in March 1997 when Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) conference organised in Islamabad. Mian Nawaz Sharif was the prime minister. A meeting between Iranian president Hashmi Rafsanjani and Saudi crown prince Abdullah was arranged on the sidelines of this conference. Comparing with efforts made to-date, the first one taking place in 1997 was the most consequential as Rafsanjani visited Saudi Arab 11 months later. This was the first-ever visit by a top Iranian leader to Saudi Arab since Iranian revolution of 1979. It was 10-day long. Second attempt was made by Gen (R) Pervez Musharraf in February 2007 when he went to Tehran in a bid to bridge differences between the two Islamic countries, however, efforts didn’t yield result. He was engulfed in a serious crisis back at home when filed reference against Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry triggering country-wide protests. Musharraf tried to calm down domestic situation through yet another international engagement. In April that year, he offered to mediate between Israel and Palestine. Israeli politely turned down the offer saying there was “already positive ongoing dialogue between the Israel and Palestine.” Third initiative to resolve Iran-Saudi Arabia differences was taken by Mian Nawaz Sharif in 2016 when he first visited Saudi Arabia and then Iran in the company of Gen Raheel Sharif. Initial response was very good. A press release issued then said that the leadership of both countries had responded positively to this gesture. Nawaz Sharif said he considered this a sacred mission to help ending the differences between the two and that he was proud to play the role of a mediator. Pakistan then decided to appoint a focal person for the purpose and that Iran and Saudi Arabia would also be requested to do the same. From then onward, no development was reported on this front until this recent initiative. Analysts view the latest attempt different from the past in a sense that it has been started on the request of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, though it remains unclear who first said: either US President Donald Trump or Mohammad bin Salman. Speaking to media in New York during United Nations General Assembly session, both of them had asked him for mediation. “Trump asked me if we could de-escalate the situation and may be come up with another deal. I immediately spoke to President Rouhani yesterday after the meeting with President Trump. I can’t say right now more than this but this is what we are trying and mediating,” Imran told media persons. Crown Prince “also asked me to talk to the Iranian president,” he said on September 25. However, two days later, Trump told AFP that it was Imran Khan who had approached him to suggest this, not him. “He actually asked me. He thought it would be a good idea to meet,” Trump reportedly said. On Sunday last, during his visit to Tehran, Imran Khan said: “This visit to Iran and the visit that I’ll undertake to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday is a Pakistan-led initiative.

News article:
Source: Xinhua| 2019-10-08 21:39:21|Editor: xuxin Video Player Close by Marwa Yahya CAIRO, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has called for "international mediation" after its talks with Sudan and Ethiopia over Ethiopia's construction of a huge dam on the Nile river reached "a deadlock." The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project has sparked Egypt's worry over Ethiopia's development needs, as well as concerns over its possible adverse effects on Egypt, including water scarcity and climate change. "Talks have reached a deadlock as a result of the Ethiopian side's inflexibility," Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation said in a statement on Saturday following the two-day ministerial negotiations held in Sudan's capital Khartoum. It said that Ethiopia presented a new proposal during the Khartoum talks, which was a "step back from all the principles previously agreed upon for the filling and operation of the dam." The proposal did not include the minimum annual drainage of the dam, or ways to deal with the cases of drought that might occur in the future, the statement added. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi tweeted later that Egypt would "continue to take necessary measures at the political level and in accordance with international law to protect its rights" in Nile waters. Meanwhile, Ethiopia denied on Sunday that the trilateral negotiations on the GERD ended in a stalemate. "Ethiopia stands ready to resolve any difference and outstanding concerns by consultation among the three countries," Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed tweeted. He added the government of Ethiopia will reinforce its efforts to make the ongoing trilateral dialogue a success and expects a similar commitment from the two downstream countries, Egypt and Sudan. During the negotiations, the three countries stressed the rights of the 11 basin countries of the Nile to utilize Nile waters based on principles of equitable utilization and avoiding significant harm. Tariq Fahmy, professor of the international relations in Cairo University, told Xinhua that Egypt should seek "international mediation" to resolve the dispute. He named two scenarios that could be adopted by the Egyptian side: seeking the African Union's support, and then refer the whole issue to the United Nations. He said that finding a fourth country for mediation between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia will be a second option, noting that international arbitration could not work without the approval of Ethiopia. The military action could be the last option on the table, Fahmy added. Egyptian Presidency's spokesman Bassam Radi said on Saturday that Egypt was looking forward to an "instrumental role" by the United States in the talks. He said that, as no breakthrough was achieved in the negotiations, there was a need for an "international instrumental role to overcome the current deadlock." The GERD, announced in 2011, is designed to promote Ethiopia's bid to become the continent's biggest power exporter, generating more than 6,000 megawatts. According to the World Bank, 66 percent of Ethiopia's population live without electricity, the third highest proportion in the world. But Egypt fears that Ethiopia is moving too fast to complete the dam and will create water and food scarcity to force millions of Egypt's farmers out of work. Egypt relies on the Nile river for 90 percent of its need of fresh water. "When the dam starts operating, it depends on how quickly its main reservoir can be filled from Nile water and this is the heart of the dispute," said Ahmad Abdel Monem, expert in water resources with the Middle East Studies Center. Ethiopia wants the reservoir to be filled in three to five years, with 35 billion cubic meters of water being released to downstream countries each year while the dam is being filled. Egypt called for the reservoir to be filled more slowly, over seven years, citing that its water supplies will be reduced during this period. Under the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement between Egypt and Sudan, Egypt takes 55.5 billion cubic meters of water from the Nile each year. Monem said Egypt will resort to legitimate methods in protecting its rights, especially international mediation, which should be done before Ethiopia proceeds with the filling process to avoid any disputes.

Madbouly accused Ethiopia of adopting radical positions in the latest round of negotiations on the Renaissance Dam, indicating that Egypt is moving to seek arbitration to reach agreement Egypt’s Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has accused Ethiopia of backtracking on all previous agreements related to the Nile water. In a statement delivered before parliament on Wednesday, Madbouly said that Ethiopia took a unilateral decision in 2011 to build its Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam (GERD). "This unilateral decision was in violation of international agreements, and despite this fact we choose dialogue to reach agreement with Ethiopia," said Madbouly. Madbouly said that Ethiopia displayed very radical positions in the latest round of negotiations held in Khartoum and rejected all proposals submitted by Egypt to solve the differences. “Ethiopia’s radical positions represent a violation of the declaration of principles reached by the presidents of Egypt, Sudan and the prime minister of Ethiopia in Khartoum on 23 March 2015,” said Madbouly. The prime minister added that “it is quite clear that Ethiopia wants to impose the status quo on Egypt, and so we find that it has become very difficult to reach agreements with Ethiopia and negotiations have reached a deadlock.” Madbouly indicated that Egypt is moving to implement Article 10 of the declaration of principles, which allows any of the three countries to seek a mediator that can resolve differences in a scientific way. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said that Egypt is proposing that the World Bank act as a mediator in this respect. Shoukry said that Egypt will never allow Ethiopia to impose the status quo and that Egypt has the power not only to protect its rights to the Nile water but also to resort to international law in this respect. Shoukry said that upon instructions from President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, all state authorities have moved to intensify communications with all concerned international organisations in order to overcome all obstacles. Madbouly said that irrespective of the GERD problem, Egypt has begun setting up a large number of desalination plants and rationalising the use of water. “We want to assure every Egyptian that the government is implementing a number of giant water projects until 2037,” said Madbouly. Parliament speaker Ali Abdel-Aal urged Ethiopia to exercise wisdom and to show respect for Egypt’s rights. “I want to tell MPs not to jump to hasty conclusions, we still have a lot of diplomatic and peaceful channels, but in the end, there is a red line that none should cross, and Egypt will never allow the loss of any drop of Nile water,” said Abdel-Aal.

News article:
On 2 April 2011, Ethiopia laid the foundation stone of the largest dam ever to be built in Africa and the tenth largest in the world, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. With an installed capacity of 6,450 Megawatts, the reservoir of the dam, named Lake Zenawi after the late Ethiopian prime minister who initiated the project, will hold as much as 74 billion m3 of water, which is more than Egypt’s annual quota of the Nile water estimated at 55.5 billion m3. The bone of contention is how long it will take to fill this reservoir. Based on the project schedule, though delayed, Ethiopia wants to start power generation from the dam by September 2020 when two of its 15 turbines go online producing 700 Megawatts of electricity. In other words, Ethiopia should be starting to fill the reservoir shortly. On the other hand, Egypt, which depends on the Nile as its sole source of fresh water, wants the filling of the reservoir to take place over seven years and has requested Addis Ababa to release 40 billion m3 of water per annum. Ethiopia has “summarily” rejected Egypt’s proposals, seeing them as a violation of its “sovereignty”. The two countries, along with Sudan, have been engaged in talks to mitigate the side-effects of the dam on downstream nations, and Ethiopia’s policy though successive regimes has been bent on buying as much time as possible until the dam is rendered a reality. This policy, aiming at attaining pre-set goals and making use of the turmoil and instability that unfolded in Egypt in the wake of the 25 January Revolution until 2014, is incommodious. As soon as President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi assumed office in Egypt in 2014 he met with top Ethiopian officials to discuss the project, embracing a new spirit that recognised Ethiopia’s right to development and the use of the River Nile, maybe for the first time by a sitting Egyptian president, without inflicting any harm on Egypt’s right to life. However, it seems that the Ethiopians have been reluctant to embrace Egypt’s new spirit as they are still beating about the bush, holding endless talks and meetings to no avail. For a long time, Egypt and Ethiopia have been at loggerheads over the use of the River Nile. Though the source of the “Tiqur Abbay” (literary the “Black Abay,” Amharic for the Blue Nile), Ethiopia believes it has never used the river enough to serve the welfare of its people. Many Ethiopians think that Egypt has historically engaged in activities bent on blocking Ethiopia from fully utilising the Nile, rhetoric that Cairo has repeatedly denied. One indication of this was when President Al-Sisi went to Addis Ababa in March 2015 and addressed the Ethiopian parliament for the first time by an Egyptian president, reiterating that Egypt was in no way against Ethiopia’s endeavours to utilise the Nile waters as long as this did not inflict any harm on Egypt’s historical rights to the river. But Ethiopia does not recognise that “historical right,” and the country at the top level denies that Egypt has a right to claim 55.5 billion m3 of the Nile’s water annually, as stated in the 1959 Agreement, which Ethiopia since its last emperor Haile Selassie I has not officially recognised. This situation has resulted in an impasse, especially because although based on Egypt’s proposals Cairo wants the release of 40 billion m3 of the Nile’s water per annum, which is lower than its due of 55.5 billion m3, in truth it loses roughly 10 billion m3 of this because of evaporation behind the Aswan High Dam. This means that Egypt would only receive 30 billion m3 of water, which would not meet the growing needs of its population, whether for potable water or for different agricultural plans. As a result of such huge projected losses, Egypt is braced for major impacts and has been taking harsh measures including the banning of the cultivation of rice, a daily staple for many Egyptians. Ethiopia, on the other hand, has not been willing, given the procrastination of the talks, to reach a win-win agreement. Rather, it seems determined to move ahead with its plans. It is hard to see how there can be any workable compromise between “Egypt’s inalienable rights to the Nile water” and “Ethiopia’s sovereignty” as a result. According to the international Water Poverty Index, 1,000 m3 of water is needed annually for each person on earth. Egypt’s share of the River Nile has not changed over time, however. Since the 1959 Agreement, Egypt has been allocated 55.5 billion m3 of water per annum, when its population at the time was roughly 20 million. In other words, under the original terms of the agreement, each Egyptian would receive some 2,000 m3 of water. But as Egypt’s population has expanded to reach over 100 million by 2019, and given the growing needs of water for agriculture that is vital to sustain the lives of all Egyptians, the amount of water per capita has dropped to an alarming level of just some 55.5 m3 per person annually at 2018 estimates. As a result, the message that President Al-Sisi delivered at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York in September this year was very much to the point: the water of the River Nile is “an existential issue” for Egypt and the lifeline of the Egyptians cannot be tampered with.

News article:
On 2 April 2011, Ethiopia laid the foundation stone of the largest dam ever to be built in Africa and the tenth largest in the world, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. With an installed capacity of 6,450 Megawatts, the reservoir of the dam, named Lake Zenawi after the late Ethiopian prime minister who initiated the project, will hold as much as 74 billion m3 of water, which is more than Egypt’s annual quota of the Nile water estimated at 55.5 billion m3. The bone of contention is how long it will take to fill this reservoir. Based on the project schedule, though delayed, Ethiopia wants to start power generation from the dam by September 2020 when two of its 15 turbines go online producing 700 Megawatts of electricity. In other words, Ethiopia should be starting to fill the reservoir shortly. On the other hand, Egypt, which depends on the Nile as its sole source of fresh water, wants the filling of the reservoir to take place over seven years and has requested Addis Ababa to release 40 billion m3 of water per annum. Ethiopia has “summarily” rejected Egypt’s proposals, seeing them as a violation of its “sovereignty”. The two countries, along with Sudan, have been engaged in talks to mitigate the side-effects of the dam on downstream nations, and Ethiopia’s policy though successive regimes has been bent on buying as much time as possible until the dam is rendered a reality. This policy, aiming at attaining pre-set goals and making use of the turmoil and instability that unfolded in Egypt in the wake of the 25 January Revolution until 2014, is incommodious. As soon as President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi assumed office in Egypt in 2014 he met with top Ethiopian officials to discuss the project, embracing a new spirit that recognised Ethiopia’s right to development and the use of the River Nile, maybe for the first time by a sitting Egyptian president, without inflicting any harm on Egypt’s right to life. However, it seems that the Ethiopians have been reluctant to embrace Egypt’s new spirit as they are still beating about the bush, holding endless talks and meetings to no avail. For a long time, Egypt and Ethiopia have been at loggerheads over the use of the River Nile. Though the source of the “Tiqur Abbay” (literary the “Black Abay,” Amharic for the Blue Nile), Ethiopia believes it has never used the river enough to serve the welfare of its people. Many Ethiopians think that Egypt has historically engaged in activities bent on blocking Ethiopia from fully utilising the Nile, rhetoric that Cairo has repeatedly denied. One indication of this was when President Al-Sisi went to Addis Ababa in March 2015 and addressed the Ethiopian parliament for the first time by an Egyptian president, reiterating that Egypt was in no way against Ethiopia’s endeavours to utilise the Nile waters as long as this did not inflict any harm on Egypt’s historical rights to the river. But Ethiopia does not recognise that “historical right,” and the country at the top level denies that Egypt has a right to claim 55.5 billion m3 of the Nile’s water annually, as stated in the 1959 Agreement, which Ethiopia since its last emperor Haile Selassie I has not officially recognised. This situation has resulted in an impasse, especially because although based on Egypt’s proposals Cairo wants the release of 40 billion m3 of the Nile’s water per annum, which is lower than its due of 55.5 billion m3, in truth it loses roughly 10 billion m3 of this because of evaporation behind the Aswan High Dam. This means that Egypt would only receive 30 billion m3 of water, which would not meet the growing needs of its population, whether for potable water or for different agricultural plans. As a result of such huge projected losses, Egypt is braced for major impacts and has been taking harsh measures including the banning of the cultivation of rice, a daily staple for many Egyptians. Ethiopia, on the other hand, has not been willing, given the procrastination of the talks, to reach a win-win agreement. Rather, it seems determined to move ahead with its plans. It is hard to see how there can be any workable compromise between “Egypt’s inalienable rights to the Nile water” and “Ethiopia’s sovereignty” as a result. According to the international Water Poverty Index, 1,000 m3 of water is needed annually for each person on earth. Egypt’s share of the River Nile has not changed over time, however. Since the 1959 Agreement, Egypt has been allocated 55.5 billion m3 of water per annum, when its population at the time was roughly 20 million. In other words, under the original terms of the agreement, each Egyptian would receive some 2,000 m3 of water. But as Egypt’s population has expanded to reach over 100 million by 2019, and given the growing needs of water for agriculture that is vital to sustain the lives of all Egyptians, the amount of water per capita has dropped to an alarming level of just some 55.5 m3 per person annually at 2018 estimates.

The two leaders stressed the importance of overcoming obstacles to the ongoing negotiations Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed agreed in a phone call on Friday to overcome any obstacles facing negotiations on the operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, according to the Egyptian presidency. Tensions have been building up between the two countries in recent weeks after talks on the technical details governing the operation of the mega-dam Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile failed to make progress. Ahmed called El-Sisi on Friday to thank him for his congratulations after the Ethiopian leader was announced as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the Egyptian presidency said in a statement. During the call, the two leaders stressed "the importance of overcoming any obstacles to the negotiations of the Renaissance Dam in order to reach an agreement that fulfils the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the three countries, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia," the statement said. That agreement will be within the framework of the Declaration of Principles signed by the three nations in 2015 as a basis for negotiations, it added. Earlier this week, Egyptian officials said talks over the matter had reached a deadlock and called for international mediation. Ethiopia has dismissed the calls for mediation, saying it has faith in the trilateral negotiations. Egypt fears the dam will diminish its water supply, which is dependent on the Nile. Ethiopia maintains the hydroelectric dam will not restrict the river’s flow and hopes the mega-project will turn it into a regional power hub. Search Keywords: Short link:

Amid a long-running diplomatic standoff over building and operating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that has heightened tensions, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said Sunday he would meet Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Russia. He did not say, however, when they would meet, but Russia will host the first Russian-African summit in the Black sea resort of Sochi on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24. While Egypt wants to guarantee a steady supply of water for its 100 million citizens, Ethiopia is determined to power the homes of over 100 million citizens. Being a downstream country on the Blue Nile, Sudan shares Egypt's water supply concerns, while, at the same time, it needs the power that will be generated by Ethiopia’s dam. Trilateral talks between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia have been deadlocked for more than a year. In May last year, the three countries reached an agreement to set up a scientific study group to consult on the filling of the dam. But no progress has been reported since. The dam is now more than 60% finished, and Ethiopia hopes to become a key energy hub in Africa upon its completion. The dam will generate about 6,400 megawatts (MW), more than doubling Ethiopia's current production of 4,000 MW. The dam project, launched by Ethiopia in 2012, is designed to feed a hydroelectric project to produce 6,000 MW of power, equal to six nuclear-powered plants. The construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam or the GERD, the largest hydroelectric dam project in Africa, has poisoned relations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. The dispute centers on the right to control a section of the Nile that stretches 6,695 kilometers from Lake Victoria to the Mediterranean and is the economic lifeblood of all three countries.

Cairo will this week push Addis Ababa to agree to an outside mediator to help resolve a deepening dispute over a giant hydropower dam being built on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, officials said on Sunday. ‮‮ ‬‬ Egypt fears the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam will threaten scarce water supplies and power generation at its own dam in Aswan. It says it has exhausted efforts to reach an agreement on the conditions for operating the dam and filling the reservoir behind it, after years of talks with Ethiopia and Sudan. Ethiopia has denied that the talks are stalled, accusing Egypt of trying to sidestep the process. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi is expected to raise the demand for a mediator when he meets Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed during a summit in Russia this week. “We’re hoping this meeting might produce an agreement on the participation of a fourth party,” an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said. “We’re hopeful to reach a formula in the next few weeks.” Egyptian officials said they had suggested the World Bank as a fourth party mediator, but were open to a country with technical experience on water-sharing, such as the US. The EU was another option. Proposals by Egypt for a flexible filling of the reservoir and a guaranteed annual flow of 40 billion cubic metres were rejected by Ethiopia. The latest rounds of talks in Cairo and Khartoum over the past two months ended in acrimony. “The gap is getting wider,” the Egyptian official said. Egypt draws almost all of its fresh water from the Nile, and is faced with worsening scarcity for its population of nearly 100 million. It says it is trying to reduce the amount of water used in agriculture. Hydrologists consider a country to be facing water scarcity if supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres a person each year. Egypt has about 570 cubic metres a person a year, which is expected to drop to 500 by 2025, without taking into account any reduction in supply caused by the dam, officials said. Ethiopia is expected to start filling the reservoir next year.

News article:
The late Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former Egyptian foreign minister and the first African to become the United Nations secretary general, once said a military confrontation over water was “nearly inevitable”. While we have yet to reach that critical point, water scarcity and the value of a much-needed resource have led to battle lines being drawn between nations. Increasingly, such disputes are becoming flashpoints that could tip into dangerous and volatile situations. Quote The Nile is a shared resource, one belonging to the world, not simply the 11 countries it traverses. It is imperative both sides are willing to reach a compromise The long-running row between Egypt and Ethiopia over who can lay claim to the 6,650-kilometre river Nile is a complex issue that stretches back years. The White Nile and the Blue Nile are the river's two main tributaries, converging in Khartoum before the river flows through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. The dispute centres on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which Ethiopia began constructing on the Blue Nile in 2012, close to the border with Sudan. Ethiopia says the $4 billion hydroelectric dam will begin generating power by the end of 2020 and will be fully operational by 2022. Once completed, it is set to be the largest dam in Africa, generating about 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and export. It is a project Ethiopia sees as essential to its transformation into a power hub and to ensure its food security. Egypt, meanwhile, says it is reliant on the Nile for 90 per cent of its irrigation and drinking water supplies and fears it will be catastrophically affected by the dam project. For years, the two countries have been wrangling for a resolution, with repeated talks – including with Sudan – failing to reach a solution. With construction of the dam continuing apace, negotiations have reached stalemate. In the most recent round of talks in Khartoum held earlier this month, ahead of both sides meeting in Sochi this week, the parties failed to break the deadlock. Since the dispute first erupted, there has been a change in leadership, with Abiy Ahmed becoming Ethiopia’s prime minister last year and winning the Nobel Peace Prize this year. Yet despite settling his differences with his neighbour Eritrea, a peace pact with Egypt still eludes him. For Egypt, the implications of the dam pose problems of water and food scarcity that already plague the country’s population of more than 100 million. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi has cited “historic rights” to the river, guaranteed by decades-old treaties. He does, however, acknowledge the importance of the dam for Ethiopia but rightly, he wants assurances that Egypt’s millions are not going to face water or power shortages. In the face of rising food prices in the country, Egypt’s concerns about its agricultural yield being adversely affected by reduced irrigation supplies are valid. So too is Ethiopia’s need to protect against drought. But the Nile is a shared resource, one belonging to the world, not simply the 11 countries it traverses. It is imperative both sides are willing to reach a compromise that fulfils the most critical needs of their populations. When Mr Sisi meets Mr Abiy in Sochi this week at the first Russian-African summit, there will be the opportunity for international partners and allies to play the role of mediator as the two sides search for a satisfactory solution. Mr Sisi is expected to push for an external negotiator such as the US or EU, which could bring their experiences on water-sharing agreements and arbitrating tricky deals to the table. The White House has responded offering support and urged all sides "to put forth good-faith efforts to reach an agreement". To secure the future of the Nile Basin and prevent food and water scarcity reaching a critical point, Ethiopia and Egypt must prioritise sustainability and a fair deal for both in their allocation of a shared resource. Accidents of geography cannot be used for political gain. With the peace and stability of the region at stake, the outcome of an escalation in the dispute could be potentially catastrophic.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat The latest breakdown in talks with Ethiopia over its construction of a massive upstream Nile dam has left Egypt with dwindling options as it seeks to protect the main source of freshwater for its large and growing population. Talks collapsed earlier this month over the construction of the $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is 60 percent complete and promises to provide much-needed electricity to Ethiopia's 100 million people. But Egypt, with a population of around the same size, fears that the process of filling the reservoir behind the dam could slice into its share of the river, with catastrophic consequences. Pro-government media have cast it as a national security threat that could warrant military action. Speaking at the UN last month, Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi said he would "never" allow Ethiopia to impose a "de facto situation" by filling the dam without an agreement. "While we acknowledge Ethiopia's right to development, the water of the Nile is a question of life, a matter of existence to Egypt," he said. Egypt has been holding talks for years with Ethiopia and Sudan, upstream countries that have long complained about Cairo's overwhelming share of the river, which is enshrined in treaties dating back to the British colonial era. Those talks came to an acrimonious halt earlier this month, the third time they have broken down since 2014. "We are fed up with Ethiopian procrastination. We will not spend our lifetime in useless talks," an Egyptian official told The Associated Press. "All options are on the table, but we prefer dialogue and political means." Egypt has reached out to the United States, Russia, China and Europe, apparently hoping to reach a better deal through international mediation. The White House said earlier this month it supports talks to reach a sustainable agreement while "respecting each other's Nile water equities." Mohamed el-Molla, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official, said Cairo would take the dispute to the UN Security Council if the Ethiopians refuse international mediation. That has angered Ethiopia, which wants to resolve the dispute through the tripartite talks. An Ethiopian official said the packages offered by Cairo so far "were deliberately prepared to be unacceptable for Ethiopia." "Now they are saying Ethiopia has rejected the offer, and calling for a third-party intervention," the official added. Both the Ethiopian and the Egyptian official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks with the media. The main dispute is centered on the filling of the dam's 74-billion-cubic-meter reservoir. Ethiopia wants to fill it as soon as possible so it can generate over 6,400 Megawatts, a massive boost to the current production of 4,000 Megawatts. Ethiopia said earlier this year that the dam would start generating power by the end of 2020 and would operate at full capacity by 2022. That has the potential to sharply reduce the flow of the Blue Nile, the main tributary to the river, which is fed by annual monsoon rains in the Ethiopian highlands. If the filling takes place during one of the region's periodic droughts, its downstream impact could be even more severe. Egypt has proposed no less than seven years for filling the reservoir, and for Ethiopia to adjust the pace according to rainfall, said an Egyptian Irrigation Ministry official who is a member of its negotiation team. The official also was not authorized to discuss the talks publicly and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The Nile supplies more than 90 percent of Egypt's freshwater. Egyptians already have one of the lowest per capita shares of water in the world, at around 570 cubic meters per year, compared to a global average of 1,000. Ethiopians however have an average of 125 cubic meters per year. Egypt wants to guarantee a minimum annual release of 40 billion cubic meters of water from the Blue Nile. The irrigation official said anything less could affect Egypt's own massive Aswan High Dam, with dire economic consequences. "It could put millions of farmers out of work. We might lose more than one million jobs and $1.8 billion annually, as well as $300 million worth of electricity," he said. The official said Ethiopia has agreed to guarantee just 31 billion cubic meters. Sis is set to meet with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, on Wednesday in the Russian city of Sochi, on the sidelines of a Russia-Africa summit. They may be able to revive talks, but the stakes get higher as the dam nears completion. The International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, warned earlier this year that the "risk of future clashes could be severe if the parties do not also reach agreement on a longer-term basin-wide river management framework." In recent weeks there have been calls by some commentators in Egypt's pro-government media to resort to force. Abdallah el-Senawy, a prominent columnist for the daily newspaper el-Shorouk, said the only alternatives were internationalizing the dispute or taking military action. "Egypt is not a small county," he wrote in a Sunday column. "If all diplomatic and legal options fail, a military intervention might be obligatory."

News article:
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia will face problems if it delays its general election beyond the scheduled date of May next year, the prime minister said on Tuesday, recalling past political violence. Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed speaks during a session with the Members of the Parliament in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, October 22, 2019. REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri “Democracy needs exercise. If we say we cannot hold elections now, it will bring a lot of problems. We should work wholeheartedly by building public trust,” Abiy Ahmed, this year’s Nobel peace prize winner, told parliament. The electoral board has the financing and capacity to conduct the polls in the country of 105 million. The vote would be the first under Abiy, who took office in April 2018 and began introducing political and economic reforms. These reforms have opened up what was once one of Africa’s most repressive nations but also stoked violence as emboldened regional strongmen build ethnic powerbases and compete over political influence and resources. Ethiopia has regularly held elections since 1995, but with the exception of the 2005 election, no election has been competitive. In the 2005 poll, riots erupted after the opposition cried foul, security forces killed nearly 200 protesters, and the government jailed many opposition politicians. “The people of Ethiopia have taken lessons from the conflict that happened following the 2005 general elections. Ethiopians do not want conflicts arising in connection with elections,” Abiy said. Questioned by MPs about the future of the fractious ruling coalition - some form of which has been in power since 1991 - Abiy said he intends to merge the coalition into a single party. One of the coalition’s four ethnic-based parties, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), rejected the idea last week. The TPLF was the most powerful force in the coalition until Abiy came to power. Rapidly transforming the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front “may create more instability and that would exacerbate an already difficult environment for conducting a free and fair election”, said William Davison, an Ethiopia analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank. Asked about a dispute with Egypt over the giant hydropower dam being built on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, Abiy said: “No force will stop Ethiopia from building the dam.” Abiy, who won the Nobel this month for his peacemaking efforts with longtime enemy Eritrea, raised the prospect of war over the dam: “If we are going to war ... we can deploy many millions. But war is not a solution.” Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to raise the demand for a mediator over the dam when he meets Abiy during a Russia-Africa summit this week.

Egypt President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi is set to meet Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed are set to meet on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi in an attempt to revive stalled talks regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Egypt is concerned will reduce the flow of Nile water to downstream countries. Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Soukry told Russian Sputnik news agency on Monday that Russia could help solve the Ethiopian Dam problem. "Russia is a big and permanent member of the Security Council. It is a state that always supports and emphasises the principles of international legitimacy and the need to respect international law," Shoukry told Sputnik in an interview in Cairo on the occasion of the Africa-Russia summit, which will be held in the Russian resort city of Sochi on 23-24 October. "The countries of the world can contribute to resolving this issue which affects 105 million Egyptians, 40 million Sudanese and 100 million Ethiopians," Shoukry said. President El-Sisi said on Monday that Egypt has exerted strenuous and balanced efforts to break the stalemate in the GERD talks. The president expressed hope that an agreement would be reached to guarantee the water supply for Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, saying that the rivers flowing through the continent should be a source of brotherhood and prosperity, not a source of conflicts, presidential spokesman Bassam Rady said. On the other hand, Ethiopia’s prime minister warned on Tuesday that his country is ready mobilise "millions" if it comes to war over the construction of the GERD, though he stressed that settling the dispute through negotiations is in everyone's best interest. "The meeting is the last chance to revive the negotiations," Egypt's former minister of water resources and irrigation Mohamed Nasr El-Din Allam told Ahram Online. Allam said that Ethiopia must understand Egypt's demands and seize this opportunity instead of stalling. He also suggested that Ethiopia is rejecting the involvement of any third party in the negotiations because any external study would reveal that the dam would have a negative impact on downstream countries. Ethiopia has rejected a proposal by Egypt that the dam be filled over a period of seven years and release 40 billion cubic meters of water every year. Earlier this month, Egyptian officials said that talks over the matter had reached a deadlock and called for international mediation. Ethiopia has dismissed the calls for mediation, saying it has faith in the trilateral negotiations. "In my opinion, it is difficult to reach a solution without an international mediator; however, Ethiopia is expected to refuse any mediation," Allam said. Allam added that the setting of the upcoming meeting between El-Sisi and Ahmed presents an opportunity for Russia's involvement as a mediator, and that any mediation would reveal the fairness of Egypt's demands. The upcoming meeting is significant for both its timing and for the fact that it involves the leaders of Egypt and Ethiopia, according to Ayman Abdel-Wahab, deputy head of the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies and an expert in African affairs. "This meeting represents an opportunity for talks removed from the technical discussions that Ethiopia has been stalling since 2017," Abdel-Wahab said. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has said that Egypt is forced to resort to Article 10 of the Declaration of Principles signed in Khartoum in 2015, which allows for an outside party to mediate in the negotiations. Earlier this week, Madbouly said that the dam is being built without regard to any environmental, economic or social studies. Madbouly added that although Egypt fully understands the need of Nile Basin countries for development, this should not come at the cost of harming other nations. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Egypt said Tuesday it was shocked and "follows up with great concern" the reported statement by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed that hinted at military option in resolving the dispute over a Nile dam, reports Trend referring to Xinhuanet.com. In a statement, Egyptian Foreign Ministry said "it was not appropriate" for Ahmed to involve the military option among other choices to solve the dispute with Egypt on Ethiopia's building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Nile river. The Ethiopian leader was quoted by press reports as saying on Tuesday that "Some say things about use of force (by Egypt). It should be underlined that no force could stop Ethiopia from building a dam." "If there is a need to go to war, we could get millions readied. If some could fire a missile, others could use bombs. But that's not in the best interest of all of us," he added. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said that Egypt has always advocated negotiations as a way to settle disputes related to the GERD among the three countries, namely Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. The statement revealed that Egypt had received an invitation from the U.S. for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the three countries in Washington to discuss the dam dispute. The last round of talks on the GERD held by Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Oct. 5 failed to reach a solution, with Egypt blaming Ethiopia for "rejecting all proposals that would help Egypt avoid serious harms caused by the construction of the dam." Egypt, a downstream Nile Basin country that relies on the Nile for its fresh water, is concerned that the construction of the GERD might affect its 55.5-billion-cubic-meter annual share of the river water. Ethiopia started building the dam in 2011, which is expected to produce more than 6,000 megawatts of electricity and become the largest hydropower dam in Africa upon completion. On Oct. 13, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said he will meet Ahmed in Russia to discuss the issue. Sisi and Ahmed highlighted during a phone conversation on Oct. 11 the importance of overcoming all obstacles facing the tripartite negotiations over the GERD. The two leaders also agreed that an agreement should be reached that fulfills the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia within the framework of the Declaration of Principles signed by the three countries in 2015.

News article:
Ethiopia is planning to build a massive dam to supply their population with hydro-electric energy. The only problem is that the dam will block a key water source to the Nile River. And the Nile is Egypt’s main source of fresh water. This has caused pro-government journalists to call for war against Ethiopia similar to that of the 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel – a war that Egypt lost. Talks between Cairo and Addis Ababa broke down earlier this month over Ethiopia’s nearly finished massive upstream dam. The project entitled the ‘Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam’ is about 70% finished reports TOI and is expected to supply it’s 100 million citizens with electricity. But Egypt, who has almost as big of a population is concerned that the process of filling the resevoir that sits behind the dam will come at the expense of the country’s main source of fresh water – the Nile. That’s because the project could drastically reduce the flow of the Blue Nile, the main tributary to the Nile. The tributary is fed by annual rainfall in Ethiopia’s highlands. “While we acknowledge Ethiopia’s right to development, the water of the Nile is a question of life, a matter of existence to Egypt,” Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sissi said. On the other hand, Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewude, said that her country believes “the use of the river should be (decided) according to international law and fair and equitable use of natural resources.” Ethiopia has been making efforts to resolve the issue of the Nile with countries like Ethiopia and Sudan who complain that Cairo enjoys more than their fair share of the world’s longest river. Egypt, to their credit, has south international mediation in an effort to resolve the matter and has reached out to countries such as the United States, Russia, and China. An Ethiopian official said the packages offered by Cairo so far “were deliberately prepared to be unacceptable for Ethiopia.” Meanwhile, Egyptian journalists are going as far as to call for a war against Ethiopia. Anwar el-Hawary, who used to be the editor of the Al-Masry Al-Youm new outlet, compared the dispute to the 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel, in which Egypt waged a surprise attack into the Sinai Peninsula. “If we fought to liberate Sinai, it is logical to fight to liberate the water,” he posted on his Facebook account. “The danger is the same in the two cases.”

News article:
Egypt said on Tuesday it accepted a US invitation to a meeting of foreign ministers about a giant hydropower dam on Ethiopia's Blue Nile that is causing an increasing dispute between the two countries. The meeting of the foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan, the three nations directly affected by the project, will be held in Washington, Egypt's Foreign Ministry said. It is not clear whether the other two nations have accepted the invitation. Egypt is worried that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is being built near Ethiopia's border with Sudan, will restrict supplies of scarce Nile water on which it is almost entirely dependent. After years of three-way talks with Ethiopia and Sudan, Cairo says it has exhausted efforts to reach an agreement on conditions for operating the dam and filling the reservoir behind it. Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development and has denied that talks between the three are stalled, accusing Egypt of trying to sidestep the process. Addis Ababa will not be stopped from building the dam, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Tuesday. Mr Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize this month for his reconciliation efforts with long-standing enemy Eritrea, raised the prospect of conflict over the dam. "If we are going to war we can deploy many millions," he said. "But war is not a solution." Egypt criticised the comments as "unacceptable". "Egypt expressed its shock, great concern and deep regret over comments conveyed by media and attributed to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed," the Foreign Ministry said. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi is expected to meet Mr Abiy during a Russia-Africa summit this week. Egypt has suggested bringing in an outside party, possibly the World Bank or the US, to mediate the dispute. Ethiopia previously rejected a mediator.

The leaders of Ethiopia and Egypt met on the sidelines of Russia’s Africa summit on Thursday to discuss a disputed Nile dam that has seen tensions flare, a diplomatic source told AFP. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi “delivered a message” to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed about Addis Ababa’s soon-to-be-finished dam on the Blue Nile, the Egyptian diplomatic source said. Advertisement The meeting lasted around 45 minutes and took place “in a positive atmosphere,” the source added, without providing details. Egypt fears that the building of the dam, a $4 billion project begun in 2012, will reduce the flow of the Nile, on which it depends for 90 percent of its water supply. Discussions between the two countries and with Sudan, through which the river also passes, have been blocked for nine years. Russia, which is hosting a two-day Africa Summit in its Black Sea resort of Sochi in an attempt to revive its Soviet-era influence on the continent, has said it is ready to play a role in resolving the conflict. “The dam ... was discussed during [Russian President Vladimir Putin’s] meeting with the President of Egypt, and during a meeting with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Putin told the two leaders they should take advantage of their presence in Sochi to “directly discuss (their) concerns” and that he also offered “his assistance”, Peskov said. In early October, negotiations in Khartoum resulted in a “stalemate”, according to Cairo, which has since sought international mediation. Ethiopia has rejected the claim, calling it “an unwarranted denial of the progress” made during the negotiations. Analysts fear the three Nile basin countries could be drawn into a conflict if the dispute is not resolved before the dam goes into operation late next year.

News article:
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — The latest breakdown in talks with Ethiopia over its construction of a massive upstream Nile dam has left Egypt with dwindling options as it seeks to protect the main source of freshwater for its large and growing population. Talks collapsed earlier this month over the construction of the $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is around 70% complete and promises to provide much-needed electricity to Ethiopia’s 100 million people. But Egypt, with a population of around the same size, fears that the process of filling the reservoir behind the dam could slice into its share of the river, with catastrophic consequences. Pro-government media have cast it as a national security threat that could warrant military action. Speaking at the UN last month, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said he would “never” allow Ethiopia to impose a “de facto situation” by filling the dam without an agreement. “While we acknowledge Ethiopia’s right to development, the water of the Nile is a question of life, a matter of existence to Egypt,” he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewude, also speaking at the UN General Assembly, said her country believes “the use of the river should be (decided) according to international law and fair and equitable use of natural resources.” Egypt has been holding talks for years with Ethiopia and Sudan, upstream countries that have long complained about Cairo’s overwhelming share of the river, which is enshrined in treaties dating back to the British colonial era. Those talks came to an acrimonious halt earlier this month, the third time they have broken down since 2014. “We are fed up with Ethiopian procrastination. We will not spend our lifetime in useless talks,” an Egyptian official told The Associated Press. “All options are on the table, but we prefer dialogue and political means.” Advertisement Egypt has reached out to the United States, Russia, China and Europe, apparently hoping to reach a better deal through international mediation. The White House said earlier this month it supports talks to reach a sustainable agreement while “respecting each other’s Nile water equities.” Mohamed el-Molla, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official, said Cairo would take the dispute to the UN Security Council if the Ethiopians refuse international mediation. That has angered Ethiopia, which wants to resolve the dispute through the tripartite talks. An Ethiopian official said the packages offered by Cairo so far “were deliberately prepared to be unacceptable for Ethiopia.” “Now they are saying Ethiopia has rejected the offer, and calling for a third-party intervention,” the official added. Both the Ethiopian and the Egyptian official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks with the media. The main dispute is centered on the filling of the dam’s 74-billion-cubic-meter reservoir. Ethiopia wants to fill it as soon as possible so it can generate over 6,400 Megawatts, a massive boost to the current production of 4,000 Megawatts. Advertisement That has the potential to sharply reduce the flow of the Blue Nile, the main tributary to the river, which is fed by annual rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands. If the filling takes place during one of the region’s periodic droughts, its downstream impact could be even more severe. Egypt has proposed no less than seven years for filling the reservoir, and for Ethiopia to adjust the pace according to rainfall, said an Egyptian Irrigation Ministry official who is a member of its negotiation team. The official also was not authorized to discuss the talks publicly and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The Nile supplies more than 90 percent of Egypt’s freshwater. Egyptians already have one of the lowest per capita shares of water in the world, at around 570 cubic meters per year, compared to a global average of 1,000. Ethiopians however have an average of 125 cubic meters per year. Egypt wants to guarantee a minimum annual release of 40 billion cubic meters of water from the Blue Nile. The irrigation official said anything less could affect Egypt’s own massive Aswan High Dam, with dire economic consequences. “It could put millions of farmers out of work. We might lose more than one million jobs and $1.8 billion annually, as well as $300 million worth of electricity,” he said. The official said Ethiopia has agreed to guarantee just 31 billion cubic meters. Sissi is set to meet with Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, on Wednesday in the Russian city of Sochi, on the sidelines of a Russia-Africa summit. They may be able to revive talks, but the stakes get higher as the dam nears completion. Ahmed told Ethiopian lawmakers on Tuesday that negotiations are the best chance for resolving the Nile deadlock and that going to war is “not in the best interest of all of us.” Advertisement Ethiopia hopes to finish the much-delayed project by 2023. The dam’s manager, Kifle Horro, said the project is now 68.5% complete and preparations are underway to finalize power generation from two turbines by next year. The International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, warned earlier this year that the “risk of future clashes could be severe if the parties do not also reach agreement on a longer-term basin-wide river management framework.” In recent weeks there have been calls by some commentators in Egypt’s pro-government media to resort to force. Abdallah el-Senawy, a prominent columnist for the daily newspaper el-Shorouk, said the only alternatives were internationalizing the dispute or taking military action. “Egypt is not a small county,” he wrote in a Sunday column. “If all diplomatic and legal options fail, a military intervention might be obligatory.” Anwar el-Hawary, the former editor of the Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper, compared the dispute to the 1973 Yom Kippur War with Israel, in which Egypt launched a surprise attack into the Sinai Peninsula. “If we fought to liberate Sinai, it is logical to fight to liberate the water,” he wrote on Facebook. “The danger is the same in the two cases. War is the last response.”

Ethiopia wants to fill it as soon as possible so it can generate over 6,400 Megawatts, a massive boost to the current production of 4,000 Megawatts. Advertisement That has the potential to sharply reduce the flow of the Blue Nile, the main tributary to the river, which is fed by annual rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands. If the filling takes place during one of the region’s periodic droughts, its downstream impact could be even more severe. Egypt has proposed no less than seven years for filling the reservoir, and for Ethiopia to adjust the pace according to rainfall, said an Egyptian Irrigation Ministry official who is a member of its negotiation team. The official also was not authorized to discuss the talks publicly and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The Nile supplies more than 90 percent of Egypt’s freshwater. Egyptians already have one of the lowest per capita shares of water in the world, at around 570 cubic meters per year, compared to a global average of 1,000. Ethiopians however have an average of 125 cubic meters per year. Egypt wants to guarantee a minimum annual release of 40 billion cubic meters of water from the Blue Nile. The irrigation official said anything less could affect Egypt’s own massive Aswan High Dam, with dire economic consequences. “It could put millions of farmers out of work. We might lose more than one million jobs and $1.8 billion annually, as well as $300 million worth of electricity,” he said. The official said Ethiopia has agreed to guarantee just 31 billion cubic meters. Sissi is set to meet with Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, on Wednesday in the Russian city of Sochi, on the sidelines of a Russia-Africa summit. They may be able to revive talks, but the stakes get higher as the dam nears completion. Ahmed told Ethiopian lawmakers on Tuesday that negotiations are the best chance for resolving the Nile deadlock and that going to war is “not in the best interest of all of us.” Advertisement Ethiopia hopes to finish the much-delayed project by 2023. The dam’s manager, Kifle Horro, said the project is now 68.5% complete and preparations are underway to finalize power generation from two turbines by next year. The International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, warned earlier this year that the “risk of future clashes could be severe if the parties do not also reach agreement on a longer-term basin-wide river management framework.” In recent weeks there have been calls by some commentators in Egypt’s pro-government media to resort to force. Abdallah el-Senawy, a prominent columnist for the daily newspaper el-Shorouk, said the only alternatives were internationalizing the dispute or taking military action. “Egypt is not a small county,” he wrote in a Sunday column. “If all diplomatic and legal options fail, a military intervention might be obligatory.” Anwar el-Hawary, the former editor of the Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper, compared the dispute to the 1973 Yom Kippur War with Israel, in which Egypt launched a surprise attack into the Sinai Peninsula. “If we fought to liberate Sinai, it is logical to fight to liberate the water,” he wrote on Facebook. “The danger is the same in the two cases. War is the last response.”

Egypt and Ethiopia's leaders agreed on Thursday to the immediate resumption of the work by a technical committee trying to agree on the operating terms of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), an Egyptian presidency spokesman said, Reuters reports. The work of the committee had failed to produce agreement over years of meetings, causing a diplomatic dispute between the two nations. The hydropower dam is currently under construction on Ethiopia's Blue Nile, and Ethiopia is expected to start filling the reservoir behind it next year. Egypt fears the dam could restrict already scarce supplies of water from the Nile, on which it is almost entirely dependent. Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development. In recent weeks, Egypt said three-way talks with Ethiopia and Sudan had been exhausted, issuing calls for an external mediator. Ethiopia PM: If there's a war with Egypt over the dam, millions would join Ethiopia denied that talks between the three countries were stalled, accusing Egypt of trying to sidestep the process. There was no mention of a mediator in the statement issued by a spokesman for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi after he met Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of a African-Russian summit in Sochi. It said work of the technical committee would resume "in a more open and positive manner, in order to reach a final vision on the rules for filling and operating the dam".

Source: Xinhua| 2019-10-29 06:23:29|Editor: Mu Xuequan Video Player Close CAIRO, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed on Monday the latest developments pertaining to the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). The GERD, which is built by Ethiopia on the Nile River, is causing spat between Cairo and Addis Ababa. In a statement, the Egyptian foreign ministry said the two top diplomats tackled the meeting the U.S. administration has called for in Washington, where the foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan, the three countries affected by the dam, are supposed to discuss the resumption of the technical negotiations on the filling and operation of the dam. "Pompeo expressed the U.S. administration's understanding of the importance of this issue and the need to reach a fair agreement that would achieve the interests of all three countries," the statement said. The last round of talks on the GERD held by Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Oct. 5 failed to reach a solution, with Egypt blaming Ethiopia for "rejecting all proposals that would help Egypt avoid serious harms caused by the construction of the dam." Egypt, a downstream Nile Basin country that relies on the Nile for its fresh water, is concerned that the construction of the GERD might affect its 55.5-billion-cubic-meter annual share of the river water. Ethiopia started building the dam in 2011, which is expected to produce more than 6,000 megawatts of electricity and become the largest hydropower dam in Africa upon completion. On Thursday, Egyptian presidency announced that Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have agreed to immediately resume the work of the technical committee of the GERD. Both leaders met on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit held in the Russian Black Sea resort city of Sochi last week. Meanwhile, the Egyptian foreign ministry said that Shoukry and Pompeo also addressed overall regional topics, including Syria and efforts to confront all forms of terrorism.

News article:
Egypt hopes external mediation and a resumption in the negotiations will help to resolve the stand-off over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, writes Doaa El-Bey All eyes were on Sochi in Russia late last week, where on the sidelines of a Russia-Africa Summit meeting President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi and Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed were set to meet to find a way out from the deadlock in the negotiations over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). President Al-Sisi’s meeting with Ahmed on the sidelines of the Sochi Summit was described as positive, with both leaders agreeing to resume the work of the tripartite technical negotiations on the dam. Speaking to reporters after that meeting, Ahmed said “there is no problem if we do the political discussion with anyone. The technical discussion has already been initiated, and they have gone on for five rounds and will continue,” he said. The Kremlin announced last week that Russian President Vladimir Putin had offered to mediate between Egypt and Ethiopia in the dam talks. According to Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Putin told the two leaders they should take advantage of their presence in Sochi to “directly discuss [their] concerns” on the dam and he also offered “his assistance”, Peskov said. The Ethiopian position was against external mediation. During a question-and-answer session in parliament in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa a couple of days earlier, Ahmed had said that only negotiations could resolve the deadlock with Cairo. But he also warned that “if we are going to war… we can deploy many millions. But war is not a solution.” Egypt regarded his comments as “negative” and “unacceptable”. In a statement issued the same day, the Foreign Ministry “expressed its shock, great concern, and deep regret over comments conveyed by the media and attributed to Prime Minister Ahmed” of Ethiopia. “Egypt was surprised that the comments came days after Ahmed received the Nobel Peace Prize, an event that should have prompted the Ethiopian side to show the political will, flexibility, and goodwill to reach a legally-binding and comprehensive agreement that serves the interests of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia,” the statement said. The foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan may also meet in Washington on 6 November to discuss the GERD. US Treasury Decretary Steven Mnuchin sent an invitation to the ministers last week after Egypt declared a deadlock in the negotiations with Ethiopia over the conditions for operating the dam and filling its reservoir. Egypt has accepted the invitation “in line with its firm commitment to the articles of the Declaration of Principles [on the GERD] and with confidence in the efforts exerted by the US,” according to a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry last week. “The US mediation is a positive step that may lead to a breakthrough,” commented one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. But, he added, time was an important factor. “We cannot spend another four years in four-party negotiations. Unless there is a clearly-drawn timetable for negotiations. The dam, which has been nearly 70 per cent built, will be fully built and there will be nothing to negotiate,” he said. Earlier this month, Washington said that it supported the ongoing negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on reaching a “cooperative, sustainable, and mutually beneficial agreement on filling and operating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.” Addis Ababa had rejected any possibility of external mediation in the negotiations in the past. In December 2017, Egypt suggested that the World Bank should be brought in to resolve tensions with Ethiopia over the dam, but Ethiopia rejected the suggestion. In September and October this year, two rounds of talks were held in Cairo and Khartoum, but they resulted in a “stalemate” and prompted Cairo to seek international mediation. President Al-Sisi asked US President Donald Trump during the UN General Assembly meetings in New York in September to mediate in the negotiations on the GERD. He also called on the international community to play a “constructive role” in urging all the parties to be flexible in the negotiations, in order to reach an agreement that reflected their common interests. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri has repeatedly expressed Egypt’s dissatisfaction with the delay in reaching an agreement on the GERD. He also raised the issue in bilateral meetings with European, African and Arab counterparts on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meetings, expressing his concern that the extended negotiations had so far failed to issue in an agreement. In 2015, Cairo and Ethiopia signed a Declaration of Principles on the GERD, which state that the two countries and Sudan should cooperate to reach an agreement on guidelines for different scenarios for the filling of the dam reservoir in parallel with its construction and on the operational policies of the dam. However, after four years of negotiations, two problems remain in the rate at which Ethiopia will draw water out of the Nile to fill the dam’s reservoir and the operating procedures of the dam. Cairo wants Ethiopia to release about 40 billion cubic metres of water, while Ethiopia has been saying that the figure should be 35 billion cubic metres. It has been proposing to fill the dam reservoir over a period of three or four years, with Egypt wanting the filling to take seven years. According to Addis Ababa’s present plans, the initial operation of the dam is scheduled for next year and its full operation by 2023. *A version of this article appears in print in the 31 October, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

News article:
Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have been invited to a meeting in the US to discuss the stalled talks on the operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Cairo has said it has received an invitation, along with Ethiopia and Sudan, from the US for a meeting on 6 November to break the stalemate on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). At a press conference with his German counterpart Heiko Maas, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry gave the date for the US meeting, nearly a week after the country announced the Trump administration has delivered an invitation to the three countries on the deadlock. Shoukry described the idea of a mediator as a proof of good intentions, stressing that Egypt tries to cooperate and resolve all issues through its diplomatic and peaceful channels. It’s unclear if Ethiopia or Sudan will attend the US-sponsored meeting, as Addis Ababa has not been positive about the possibility of a mediation attempt. Shoukry has said that the idea of the mediator comes under the 2015 Declaration of Principles, signed by the three countries. Per the declaration, if the parties involved do not succeed in solving the dispute through talks or negotiations, they can ask for mediation. Cairo suggested in 2017 that the World Bank could be a mediator in the ongoing dispute; however, the proposal was rejected by Addis Ababa. Shoukry said he hopes that all parties, including private companies involved in the dam, function under one standard, and not “double standards.” "Unfortunately, we are monitoring some of the companies refrain from cooperation related to dam-building due to the lack of environmental, economic, and safety studies; while they overlook all of this when it comes to another dam, like the GERD, which hasn't provided such studies," Shoukry said. The minister referred to the matter as a “substantive” issue for Egypt, stressing that "it's not about development, it's a matter of life.” “The GERD issue is a scientific one that shouldn't be politicised. It should not be exploited to achieve political aims,” Shoukry said. His statements come a few days after Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed agreed during a meeting in Russia’s Sochi that the GERD’s independent technical committee should immediately resume its work in a more open and positive way. The $4.8 billion dam, which is being built on the Blue Nile near the border with Sudan, will be the largest hydropower project in Africa when completed in 2022, generating more than 6,000 megawatts of electricity. Tensions have been building up between Egypt and Ethiopia in recent weeks after talks on the technical details governing the operation of the dam failed to make progress. Egypt fears that the Ethiopian dam will diminish its water supply, which is dependent on the Nile, and is pushing for the dam's reservoir to be filled over seven years, while Addis Ababa insists on a three-year filling time. Ethiopia maintains that the dam, which is nearly 70 percent complete, will not harm the downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan. Search Keywords: Short link:

Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have been invited to a meeting in the US to discuss the stalled talks on the operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Cairo has said it has received an invitation, along with Ethiopia and Sudan, from the US for a meeting on 6 November to break the stalemate on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). At a press conference with his German counterpart Heiko Maas, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry gave the date for the US meeting, nearly a week after the country announced the Trump administration has delivered an invitation to the three countries on the deadlock. Shoukry described the idea of a mediator as a proof of good intentions, stressing that Egypt tries to cooperate and resolve all issues through its diplomatic and peaceful channels. It’s unclear if Ethiopia or Sudan will attend the US-sponsored meeting, as Addis Ababa has not been positive about the possibility of a mediation attempt. Shoukry has said that the idea of the mediator comes under the 2015 Declaration of Principles, signed by the three countries. Per the declaration, if the parties involved do not succeed in solving the dispute through talks or negotiations, they can ask for mediation. Cairo suggested in 2017 that the World Bank could be a mediator in the ongoing dispute; however, the proposal was rejected by Addis Ababa. Shoukry said he hopes that all parties, including private companies involved in the dam, function under one standard, and not “double standards.” "Unfortunately, we are monitoring some of the companies refrain from cooperation related to dam-building due to the lack of environmental, economic, and safety studies; while they overlook all of this when it comes to another dam, like the GERD, which hasn't provided such studies," Shoukry said. The minister referred to the matter as a “substantive” issue for Egypt, stressing that "it's not about development, it's a matter of life.” “The GERD issue is a scientific one that shouldn't be politicised. It should not be exploited to achieve political aims,” Shoukry said. His statements come a few days after Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed agreed during a meeting in Russia’s Sochi that the GERD’s independent technical committee should immediately resume its work in a more open and positive way. The $4.8 billion dam, which is being built on the Blue Nile near the border with Sudan, will be the largest hydropower project in Africa when completed in 2022, generating more than 6,000 megawatts of electricity. Tensions have been building up between Egypt and Ethiopia in recent weeks after talks on the technical details governing the operation of the dam failed to make progress. Egypt fears that the Ethiopian dam will diminish its water supply, which is dependent on the Nile, and is pushing for the dam's reservoir to be filled over seven years, while Addis Ababa insists on a three-year filling time. Ethiopia maintains that the dam, which is nearly 70 percent complete, will not harm the downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan. Search Keywords: Short link:

Source: Xinhua| 2019-10-31 20:35:12|Editor: xuxin Video Player Close CAIRO, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Parliament Thursday urged Ethiopia not to harm Egypt's share of the Nile River, official news agency MENA reported. Citing the historical ties between Egypt and Ethiopia, the Arab parliament urged Ethiopia to reach a deal on the issue of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). It expressed its solidarity with Egypt in protecting its water security and in maintaining its legal rights and fixed share of the Nile River. A draft on the GERD is under discussion at the Arab Parliament, the report said. Earlier, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told the Arab Parliament that Egypt is looking forward to signing a tripartite legal deal with Ethiopia and Sudan over the GERD issue in a meeting scheduled in Washington on Nov. 6. Shoukry demanded coordination of "the Arab and African efforts to promote the Ethiopian side to reach an agreement that guarantees the rights of all parties." The GERD is a dam on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia, which has been under construction since 2011. Egypt, a downstream Nile Basin country that relies on the river for its fresh water, is concerned that the construction of the GERD might affect its 55.5-billion-cubic-meter annual share of the river water. GERD is expected to produce more than 6,000 megawatts of electricity and become the largest hydropower dam in Africa upon completion.

News article:
Earlier this month, the Trump administration invited the FMs of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to a meeting in Washington on 6 November to discuss the contentious GERD project Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry says that Cairo has immediately welcomed an invitation by the United States to host a tripartite meeting next week between the foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. Shoukry said that Egypt hopes this meeting will lead to the signing of a binding legal tripartite agreement that preserves the water rights of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. Shoukry made the remarks on Thursday before the Arab Parliament's general session on Arab water security, which was attended by the parliament's president Mashaal bin Fahm and members of the parliament. "Despite Egypt's sincere wish to reach an agreement on the rules of filling and operating the dam, these efforts have not resulted in this hopeful agreement," the minister said. Shoukry pointed out that Egypt has been engaged in intensive negotiations with Ethiopia and Sudan since the unilateral announcement by Ethiopia that it had started construction on the dam in early 2011, “even though this unilateral declaration violates the rules of international law, which stipulate prior notification and the necessity of conducting environmental and impact assessment studies on downstream countries prior to the commencement of the project.” World Bank to attend meeting Earlier this month, the Trump administration invited the foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to a meeting in Washington to discuss the giant GERD project on Ethiopia's Blue Nile, the focus of an escalating feud between Addis Ababa and Cairo over water resources. The invitation was also extended by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on 21 October to David Malpass, president of the World Bank Group. A World Bank spokesperson said in a statement that Malpass "plans to participate, assuming that all three countries are fully involved and also participate." On Thursday, the Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesperson Nebiat Getachew told Bloomberg that his country will take part in the 6 November meeting. Sudan has also announced its intention to attend the meeting. International mediation During the UN General Assembly meeting in New York in September, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi asked US President Donald Trump to mediate the conflict caused by the GERD. In a first, the US Treasury Department was the one to invite all the parties to the meeting, as opposed to the State Department, which had repeatedly urged tripartite negotiations to resolve the crisis. "It is premature to say that the United States of America is the fourth international mediator, because Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan should accept Washington as a mediator in the technical negotiations," Hussain Haridy, former assistant to the Egyptian foreign minister, said to Al-Helal weekly magazine. In July 2018, then-Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn rejected a call by Egypt for World Bank arbitration in the dispute, saying that “seeking professional support is one thing, transferring (arbitration) to an institution is another thing. So we told them that this is not acceptable on our side.” "All parties are waiting for the outcome of the forthcoming talks, in light of Egypt's keenness to follow the path of negotiation to break the deadlock," Haridy added. The US is not the only party approached by Egypt for external mediation. The Russian Kremlin has announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered to mediate between Egypt and Ethiopia on the GERD issue. The Russian offer came two days after Egypt's foreign ministry said it had accepted an invitation from the US administration to host a meeting of the foreign ministers of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia in Washington to discuss the GERD. Earlier this month, President El-Sisi met with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit held in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on 24 October. The two leaders agreed that the GERD's independent technical committee should immediately resume its work in a more open and positive way. The Ethiopian PM affirmed his country's commitment to the course of negotiations until a final agreement is reached.

The US is not the only party approached by Egypt for external mediation. The Russian Kremlin has announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered to mediate between Egypt and Ethiopia on the GERD issue. The Russian offer came two days after Egypt's foreign ministry said it had accepted an invitation from the US administration to host a meeting of the foreign ministers of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia in Washington to discuss the GERD. Earlier this month, President El-Sisi met with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit held in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on 24 October. The two leaders agreed that the GERD's independent technical committee should immediately resume its work in a more open and positive way. The Ethiopian PM affirmed his country's commitment to the course of negotiations until a final agreement is reached. The $4.8 billion GERD, which is being built near the border with Sudan, will be the largest hydropower project in Africa when completed in 2022, generating more than 6,000 megawatts of electricity. Tensions have been building up between Egypt and Ethiopia in recent weeks after talks on the technical details governing the operation of the dam failed to make progress. Egypt fears that the Ethiopian dam will diminish its water supply, which is dependent on the Nile, and is pushing for the dam's reservoir to be filled over seven years, while Addis Ababa insists on a three-year filling time. Ethiopia maintains that the dam, which is nearly 70 percent complete, will not restrict the river’s flow. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) has been a bone of contention between Cairo and Addis Ababa since 2011 when construction began without consultations or environmental and impact studies. Egypt’s fears that the $4.8 billion (Dh17.6 billion) hydropower dam on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, scheduled to be completed within two years, will negatively impact its country’s share of its lifeblood, upon which 90 per cent of its population rely in terms of drinking water and irrigation, are real and cannot be understated. Yet during eight years of negotiations involving Sudan, the Ethiopian government has shown utter disregard for Egypt’s concerns that GERD will potentially deprive the most populous Arab country of 60 billion cubic meters portended by technical studies. Such a dramatic shortfall coming at a time when Egypt’s per capita water resources have diminished by as much as 60 per cent since over the past 50 years is unacceptable. The current sticking point between the two nations is Ethiopia’s insistence of filling the reservoir within three years whereas Egypt stipulates a minimum of seven years. It is hard to understand why the Ethiopian government has adopted such an adversarial stand. What’s four short years between friends! Ironically just weeks after the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month when talks with Egypt had broken down, he boasted to parliamentarians that his country could mobilise many millions in the event of war over the dam - Linda S. Heard Ironically just weeks after the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month when talks with Egypt had broken down, he boasted to parliamentarians that his country could mobilise many millions in the event of war over the dam. “If some could fire missiles, others could use bombs,” he warned before adding that conflict was in nobody’s best interest. Egypt issued a statement expressing “deep shock and concern” over the PM’s remarks. Ahmed’s rhetoric was not only belligerent but also reckless when Egypt’s Nile water is an existential necessity and its military prowess has been beefed-up since 2013 now ranking 12th out of 137 countries as opposed to Ethiopia ranking 47th on Global Firepower’s index. Tensions flared to their highest ever until President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and Prime Minister Ahmed met on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Forum in Sochi for talks characterised as “positive”. Unconfirmed reports suggest Ahmed apologised for his unwarranted sabre-rattling. Need for third party mediation To end this increasingly fractious stalemate, the Egyptian government has long requested its Ethiopian counterpart to accept third party mediation, which until recently Abiy vehemently refused to contemplate insisting that negotiations should remain tripartite, a matter to be solved by his country together with Egypt and Sudan. But the Trump administration’s willingness to step forward for the role has met with his albeit reluctant approval. The first step towards mediation kicks off with a meeting at the office of US Treasury Secretary on November 6 to be attended by the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan with the participation of the World Bank Group’s president David Malpass. However, critics say the meeting should have been hosted by the US State Department rather than the Treasury. Egypt hopes that the process will result in a legally-binding agreement notwithstanding that according to Tareq Radwan who heads Egypt’s parliamentary Committee of African Affairs Ethiopia has little respect for international law citing its violation of the 2015 Declaration of Principles Agreement as well as international legislation covering dam construction. In keeping with a wave of public discontent sweeping the planet, Ethiopians have turned to the streets in protest calling for their prime minister to go during which at least 78 demonstrators have lost their lives; many killed by security forces and pro-government thugs drawn from the Prime Minister’s ethnic group — the Oromos making-up 35 per cent of the population. Unless the authorities succeed in quelling ethno-religious fury, the PM’s reelection hopes for May 2020 are dim and no heroic theatricals against Egypt will preserve his vaulted chair. He bills himself as a reformer. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decorated him as a peacemaker. Never has the time been more propitious for Abiy Ahmed to live up to his stated ideals and those conferred upon him. In the meantime, Egypt prepares for all contingencies with the construction of 35 costly desalination plants around the country including the world’s largest in the town of Ain Sokhna on the shore of the Red Sea’s Gulf of Suez. But make no mistake, no amount of processed seawater can replace the fertile gift of silt delivered by the Nile that has nourished agricultural lands for millennia turning rain-starved deserts green.

News article:
Egypt and Ethiopia will begin mediation talks in the US on Wednesday over the impact a Nile dam will have on Cairo’s share of Nile waters. The foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan are due to meet in Washington DC at the invitation of US President Donald Trump. The talks follow a deadlock in drawn-out negotiations, with Ethiopia rejecting Egyptian proposals to resolve the dispute and Sudan, which stands to benefit from the hydropower dam, quietly siding with Addis Ababa. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi spoke on the phone with President Trump late on Monday before he tweeted lavish praise of the US leader, describing him as a “a unique man who possesses the strength to face and deal with crises". He thanked Mr Trump for “efforts to sponsor the tripartite negotiations” and said he would like to emphasise his “full confidence in this generous sponsorship, which will find an agreement that safeguards the rights of all parties in the framework of international law and human justice”. White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the objective of the Washington talks was to reach a “collaborative agreement” on the dam dispute. The dam, formally known as the Grand Renaissance Dam, has been built on the Blue Nile, which accounts for about 85 per cent of the Nile waters. The Blue Nile and the White Nile, which originates in central Africa, merge near Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, to become the Nile that flows downstream through the deserts of northern Sudan and into Egypt all the way to the Mediterranean coast. The most populous Arab state with 100 million people, Egypt is alarmed that the dam could significantly reduce its share of the Nile waters when a massive reservoir behind it is filled. The country is mostly desert and depends on the river for about 90 per cent of its water needs, yet it has publicly acknowledged the dam’s importance to the development of Ethiopia. Egypt, however, argues that bilateral co-operation could reduce the expected damage to levels that are easier to manage. Otherwise, it claims, millions of farmers will be out of work and the country’s food supply will be threatened. On the other hand, Ethiopia has a population matching Egypt’s and it views the hydropower dam as essential. The dam has become a symbol of national pride after millions of Ethiopians bought bonds to finance its construction. Historically, Ethiopia has resented Egypt’s domination over the Nile. Ethiopia’s proposal is to fill the reservoir over four to seven years, but Cairo insists that it must annually release 40 billion cubic meters of water, a proposal rejected by Addis Ababa on the grounds that it could not spare so much during drought spells. In an exhaustive report on the dispute released in March, the International Crisis Group quoted experts as saying the reservoir’s capacity, which is about 74 billion cubic meters, is bigger than what is needed for a dam intended to generate hydropower rather than store water for irrigation. Egypt’s high expectations for a successful mediation has given some analysts both hope and concern. Attiya Issawi, who has written on African affairs for Cairo's state Al Ahram daily for decades, said the good relations between the United States and both Egypt and Ethiopia were likely to facilitate the talks. "It will be difficult for Egypt or Ethiopia to reject any reasonable proposals made by the Americans," he told The National. "This round of talks will be better than previous ones and is very likely to produce a breakthrough." However, Abbas Sharaky, a geology and water resources professor who lectures at Cairo University’s college of High African Studies, believes the US invitation may have come too late, but pointed that the “important question now is what is the price for America’s mediation to resolve the issue?”

The three African nations have said they will continue trying to resolve a conflict over plans for a massive Ethiopian-run dam along the Nile river. The project has raised concerns about shortages of drinking water. Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan made a commitment to resolving a dispute over a large Ethiopian-led dam project after US-led talks on Wednesday. The three nations issued a statement saying they would continue negotiations in talks to be held in Washington on December 9 and January 13 with the aim of finding a resolution by January 15 of next year. Read more: Water shortages pose growing risk to global stability "The ministers reaffirmed their joint commitment to reach a comprehensive, cooperative, adaptive, sustainable, and mutually beneficial agreement on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and to establish a clear process for fulfilling that commitment in accordance with the 2015 Declaration of Principles," the statement read. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and World Bank President David Malpass also signed it. Big gains, big losses The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, in the works since 2011, is a massive Ethiopian hydroelectric dam project along the Nile river. Ethiopia plans to start filling and operating the reservoir in 2020, with the aim of eventually completing one of the world's biggest dams and becoming Africa's biggest power exporter. Once complete, the dam will generate about 6,450 megawatts of electricity, double Ethiopia's current output. The Nile provides both water and electricity to the 10 countries it passes through. Sudan and Egypt fear that the project could threaten their water supply. Egypt, which has suffered from a water crisis in recent years, relies on the river for 90% of its drinking water. After talks between the countries broke down earlier this year, Egypt asked the US to step in as a mediator. Peer mediation Water ministers from all three countries will attend the upcoming talks, as will the US Treasury and the World Bank. In the event a resolution is not reached by the January 15 deadline, the ministers agreed to then involve an international mediator. kp,se (AFP, Reuters) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

News article:
Cairo - Mohammed Nabil Helmi, Marwa Sabri Ethiopian Ambassador to Egypt, Dina Mufti told Asharq Al-Awsat on Saturday that any misunderstanding between Egypt and Ethiopia should be solved peacefully. “War is not a choice… We cannot afford its costs, we don’t need it because it is an unfruitful means, particularly that we possess enough tension is this part of the world,” the Ambassador said. Mufti spoke to Asharq Al-Awsat for almost an hour from his office at the embassy in Cairo, which lies around 500 meters away from the Nile River Cornish. The Ambassador looked both optimistic and cautious. However, he was enthusiastic and attached to what he described as “the right to the development” of his country. Last month, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed allegedly gave provocative statements regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, in which he warned that his country could ready millions of people in case a war broke out over the dam, driving shock in Cairo. “The statements were misunderstood by the media,” Mufti said. Ethiopia admits that the cost of the Renaissance Dam construction is about $4 million, hoping it becomes the largest African source of electricity primarily designed to generate power with an expected capacity of 6,000MW. Mufti said Ethiopia hopes that this dam would help support Addis Ababa’s plan to face “the undermined development,” including population growth, not only in his country, but also in several developing states where the youth generation is largely increasing amid a lack of employment opportunities. While Ethiopia considers the Renaissance Dam a priority, Egypt states it is attached to the fact that all Nile Valley countries have a right to economic development. However, Cairo insists that this policy should not affect “its interests and rights in the Nile,” particularly that Egypt relies on the River to cover more than 90 percent of its needs. Mufti said the Renaissance Dam would protect the water from evaporating and it would help decrease the accumulation of slit, which engenders Ethiopia considerable costs. “The Dam would generate electricity. As Egypt always assert that it does not object the development of Ethiopia, we will not object Cairo’s interests,” the Ambassador said. Mufti expressed no objections to the US role in the technical negotiations between Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia on the massive dam being constructed on the Nile River. However, he made sure during the interview to minimize the importance of mediation, asserting that he personally had preferred that this issue be solved between the three concerned parties.

Mufti said Ethiopia hopes that this dam would help support Addis Ababa’s plan to face “the undermined development,” including population growth, not only in his country, but also in several developing states where the youth generation is largely increasing amid a lack of employment opportunities. While Ethiopia considers the Renaissance Dam a priority, Egypt states it is attached to the fact that all Nile Valley countries have a right to economic development. However, Cairo insists that this policy should not affect “its interests and rights in the Nile,” particularly that Egypt relies on the River to cover more than 90 percent of its needs. Mufti said the Renaissance Dam would protect the water from evaporating and it would help decrease the accumulation of slit, which engenders Ethiopia considerable costs. “The Dam would generate electricity. As Egypt always assert that it does not object the development of Ethiopia, we will not object Cairo’s interests,” the Ambassador said. Mufti expressed no objections to the US role in the technical negotiations between Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia on the massive dam being constructed on the Nile River. However, he made sure during the interview to minimize the importance of mediation, asserting that he personally had preferred that this issue be solved between the three concerned parties.

News article:
Cairo - Mohammed Nabil Helmi, Marwa Sabri Ethiopian Ambassador to Egypt, Dina Mufti told Asharq Al-Awsat on Saturday that any misunderstanding between Egypt and Ethiopia should be solved peacefully. “War is not a choice… We cannot afford its costs, we don’t need it because it is an unfruitful means, particularly that we possess enough tension is this part of the world,” the Ambassador said. Mufti spoke to Asharq Al-Awsat for almost an hour from his office at the embassy in Cairo, which lies around 500 meters away from the Nile River Cornish. The Ambassador looked both optimistic and cautious. However, he was enthusiastic and attached to what he described as “the right to the development” of his country.

News article:
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg is expected to rule on November 12 on whether to mark exports of goods, produced in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights, to European Union countries. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter This decision will be made following a petition filed by Psagot Winery to the Administrative Court of France against the 2015 EU directive to mark products manufactured in the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem with a special label. Sign in French grocery store saying products are from Israeli settlements The Israeli foreign ministry fears that an ECJ precedent, which would require labeling products from the settlements, would be forced upon all 28 EU countries and embolden the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) and other de-legitimization organizations against Israel to fight Israeli exports. In addition, Israel is worried that the BDS movement will take advantage of the precedent and will call on countries outside Europe to mark the produce of the settlements. This decision is a follow-up to the European Union's guidelines approved in November 2015 for labeling products from the settlements, a move that has been criticized by Israel as "discriminatory" and damaging to peace efforts with the Palestinians. Thanks to efforts made by the Foreign Ministry and Israeli representatives around Europe, the implementation of the new guidelines was successfully blocked in most European countries. France became one of the first countries to adopt these guidelines, and in 2016 the French Ministry of Economy even issued its own guidelines requiring the marking of products from the settlements. Psagot Winery in the West Bank (Photo: Ofer Meir) The Administrative Court of France later annulled the decision until further notice after Psagot Winery, among others, filed a petition against marking its products, claiming that the directive contravenes the French constitution. Since it is a European regulation, the French court then forwarded the issue to the European Court of Justice in Luxemburg - a supreme court whose decisions cannot be appealed. The ruling might effectively provide practical tools to attack Israel and Israeli exports to Europe. Its public impact will be great, as stated, not only because of the implications for export but also in the delegitimization efforts against the State of Israel. The ruling will allow BDS activists to appeal to their local courts across the EU, which will be obliged to implement it without holding hearings on the matter. The Israeli Foreign Ministry is preparing for the decision. In the event of an unfavorable ruling for Israel, most of the activities of the Israeli embassies will be directed at the local ministries of economy and agriculture in order to to convince them not to apply the ruling or interpret it in a lightly.

France condemns Israel for green-lighting construction plans for 2,342 housing units in West Bank settlements, saying approvals were distancing chances for a two-state solution to the conflict. In a statement, the French government also criticizes the decision to approve the expansion of a road that connects settlements to Jerusalem while bypassing Bethlehem. “These decisions were made in the alarming context of accelerating settlement growth in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which undermines the conditions needed for a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians based on the two-state solution,” the statement says.

A general view picture shows houses in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, in the occupied West Bank February 15, 2017. (Reuters) Ramallah – Asharq Al-Awsat The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates criticized on Tuesday the weak stances of the European Union (EU) towards increased Israeli settlement expansion and the confiscation of Palestinian territories. In a statement, the ministry said that although it appreciates Monday's statement made by the EU on the past confiscations, “yet what about the confiscations of today and tomorrow?” It added that the EU clearly considers that by this, it “exempts itself from the responsibility and accountability according to the international law.” “The issue requires a reaction from the world countries given its danger,” it said, according to the German news agency (dpa) The EU restated that the settlement activity in the occupied territories is illegal by virtue of the international law, and it curbs the possibility of a two-state solution. It called on Israel to end all settlement activities in tandem with its obligations as an occupation power. The Palestinian ministry saw that the current Israeli approach is represented in eradicating the possibility of establishing the Palestinian state through laying hands over thousands dunam of lands in delicate regions in the West Bank. It continued that the expedited Israeli procedures in this regard reflect a fascist, racist and colonial plot, with the involvement of the US.

News article:
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) will likely decide next week whether European law requires the discriminatory labeling of Jewish goods from disputed Israeli territories. Meanwhile, a series of articles have been spreading misinformation or “fake news” about the case quoting anonymous Israeli officials, and therefore the record has to be corrected. The case originated when the European Commission issued a non-binding notice claiming that European Union guidance requires labels on food products from eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank and Golan Heights that originate in Jewish “settlements” to include the derogatory indication “Israeli colony” or equivalent terms. Psagot Winery, supported by The Lawfare Project and represented by esteemed French Supreme Court Lawyer François-Henri Briard, sued the French government for its discriminatory application of the notice. France’s highest court, the Conseil d’État, referred the matter to the ECJ, asking the European court to assess whether E.U. law requires such labeling, and if not, whether E.U. states were free to implement such requirements. In June, the Advocate General (AG) of the European court declared in a non-binding opinion that he believes E.U. law requires such labeling. He further stated that while Israeli products from the “disputed territories” may not be labeled as “Products of Israel,” but rather must be labeled as products of “Israeli colonies,” Palestinian products from the exact same region may be designated as originating in “Palestine” rather than, for example, “Palestinian colonies.” This undeniably discriminatory approach seems to ignore the Oslo Accords, which expressly did not create a Palestinian state, but provided for both Israelis and Palestinians the same legal rights to live in the disputed territories until the Israeli government and Palestinian Liberation Organization reached a final agreement through negotiations. According to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of anti-Semitism, a contemporary example of anti-Semitism is “[a]pplying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.” In the product-labeling context, Israel is being held to a different standard than other nations deemed to be acting in violation of international law.

On Nov. 12, the ECJ is expected to announce a decision on the limited questions before it only, and then the case will be remanded back to the French court to rule on according to French anti-discrimination law. There is no reason to believe the French court will agree with the AG’s reasoning, which in effect declares that Palestinian businesses should receive preferential treatment not afforded to Israeli businesses. Nor has there yet been a decision by a French court on this matter. Anonymous Israeli officials have been claiming that many E.U. countries have simply not been implemented the labeling guidelines, so it would have been better policy to just ignore them and pretend they didn’t exist. This is a misleading and dangerous position. Countries like Germany, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and others have indeed been ramping up their enforcement of the European Commission guidelines on labeling and sending letters to E.U. importers. What these anonymous Israeli officials seem to be asking is for private companies to simply ignore the fact that their goods are being targeted for discriminatory treatment designed to cripple the Israeli export market. Despite the fake news disseminated by certain media outlets, this case has not and will not make things worse for Israeli exporters. If Psagot Winery had not brought suit, the door would have been left open for anyone to bring European importers to court in an attempt to force them to abide by the labeling regulations. Psagot’s legal case does not change this—it challenges those regulations themselves with the aim of preventing any future legal cases against Israeli products. Even in the event of an unfavorable decision from the ECJ, Psagot’s case will be remanded back to France, where it will be challenged on anti-discrimination grounds. Discriminatory labeling requirements that single out Israeli goods will likely be challenged in every European jurisdiction that attempts to implement them, on the basis of local anti-discrimination laws. Moreover, if there is an adverse ruling by the ECJ this month, the E.U. Parliament and Council could amend the food regulation at issue and annul its application with respect to West Bank and Golan Heights products, as was done in the Western Sahara Polisario case. The case before the ECJ was brought by an Israeli company exercising its legitimate rights to avail itself of the judicial process to protect its commercial interests, and by extension, the commercial interests of all Israeli companies that do business in Europe. Any concerns that this case could harm Israeli exporters further are completely unfounded, as even an unfavorable decision would not change the status quo. Before the case was brought, E.U. countries were enforcing the notice and the European Commission was touting the regulations as binding. It is deeply troubling that Israeli government officials would signal to the ECJ prior to its ruling that the Israeli government not only expects a negative decision, but is prepared to blame its own citizens for the outcome. Israel’s Foreign Ministry would be well-served to instruct its bureaucrats to spend more time defending Israeli interests abroad and less time demonizing Israeli companies behind the shameful cloak of anonymity.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) will likely decide next week whether European law requires the discriminatory labeling of Jewish goods from disputed Israeli territories. Meanwhile, a series of articles have been spreading misinformation or “fake news” about the case quoting anonymous Israeli officials, and therefore the record has to be corrected. The case originated when the European Commission issued a non-binding notice claiming that European Union guidance requires labels on food products from eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank and Golan Heights that originate in Jewish “settlements” to include the derogatory indication “Israeli colony” or equivalent terms.

News article:
The European Court of Justice on Tuesday morning ruled that products made in Israeli settlements must be labeled as such, and may not be marketed as products of Israel. The dramatic decision will likely cause already-tense relations between Jerusalem and Brussels to further deteriorate, as Israeli politicians from across the political spectrum have long rejected the European Union’s policy of distinguishing between goods made in Israel proper and those manufactured in areas that the EU does not recognize as sovereign Israeli territory. “Foodstuffs originating in the territories occupied by the State of Israel must bear the indication of their territory of origin, accompanied, where those foodstuffs come from an Israeli settlement within that territory, by the indication of that provenance,” the court — the EU’s highest legal instance — said in a press release. The full text of the verdict, handed down by 15 judges in the court’s Grand Chamber, can be found here. In a statement, a spokesperson of the EU embassy in Ramat Gan said that “clear and non-misleading indication of origin is an essential part of the EU’s consumer policy.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The court’s decision confirms the European Commission’s “interpretative notice” of 2015, which first introduced the need to label settlement goods as such, the spokesperson added. “The EU’s position regarding this issue did not change,” she said. “The EU has a longstanding and well-known position that it will not recognize any changes to pre-1967 Israeli borders other than those agreed by the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” she said. “The EU considers settlements in occupied territories illegal under international law.” At the same time, the EU rejects “any form of boycott or sanctions against Israel” including the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, she emphasized. Advertisement The court took on the case after Psagot Winery — which is located in a settlement by the same name just north of Jerusalem — challenged a 2016 ruling by a French court that said goods produced in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights must be labeled as originating in an “Israeli settlement.” “We will study the decision and respond after we have studied it,” Psagot CEO Yaakov Berg told The Times of Israel in an initial statement minutes after the court in Luxembourg announced its verdict. A short while later, The Lawfare Project, a New York-based pro-Israel advocacy group, released a statement in Berg’s name: “The Winery is proud of its contribution to combating this decision and intends to continue the struggle,” it said. The statement also noted that several US Congressmen are supporting the winery’s battle against the EU’s labeling policy. “As Israeli citizens, living in a community that has been approved by the Israeli government, we only wish to produce and export high standard wine that has earned its reputation worldwide,” Berg was quoted saying. Brooke Goldstein, who heads the Lawfare Project and has provided legal counsel to Psagot, said the court’s decision would “codify religious discrimination into law” and embarrasses Europe. Advertisement “There is no reason for products produced by Muslims and Jews in the same geographic place to be labelled differently. In fact, treating people differently because of their religion is the definition of bigotry and we know what happens when Europe goes down that track,” she said. Just last week, Goldstein told The Times of Israel that she was “confident” that the EU court would rule in Psagot’s favor. Transportation Minister Bezalel Smotrich denounced the court’s ruling, suggesting that the judges in Luxembourg are supporting the Gaza terrorists who have been shooting hundreds of rockets at Israel since early Tuesday. “On the same day that Israel’s enemies remind of us their aspiration to destroy us, and of the results of escaping from terrorism and relinquishing control over territory, the European court is positioning itself by their side,” he said in a statement. The Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office did not have an immediate response to the court’s ruling. However, the Israeli government expected the court’s verdict and tried to convince the winery to withdraw its appeal, several unnamed Israeli officials had said in recent days. They feared that the court would declare legally binding a policy that heretofore, while considered mandatory, was not enforced by many EU member states. Tuesday’s ruling was likely to boost the BDS movement, they had argued before it was handed down. Indeed, the court’s verdict is likely to actually harm the business interests of all Israelis exporters, not only those from the settlements, Israeli officials had warned. “The European countries’ maneuvering space will decrease after the ruling,” an Israeli officials told The Times of Israel recently. “Those seeking to delegitimize Israel could use the ruling against us, both on the legal level as well as in terms of public perception.” Advertisement According to a Channel 13 report Monday, the Foreign Ministry instructed diplomats stationed in European capitals to warn their interlocutors that implementing the controversial policy could negatively impact relations with Israel. The pro-settler Yesha Council denounced the court ruling, saying it mainly hurts the Arab residents of the West Bank who make a living working for Israeli companies. “This is hypocritical decision, which stems from the lowest kind of anti-Semitism and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,” the group said in a statement. It also called on the Israeli government to “act strongly” in order to annul the court ruling. The Palestinians welcomed the court’s ruling, and called on European countries to implement “what is a legal and political obligation,” senior Palestine Liberation Organization official Saeb Erekat said in a statement. “Our demand is not only for the correct labeling reflecting the certificate of origin of products coming from illegal colonial-settlements, but for the banning of those products from international markets,” he added. In their decision Tuesday, the 15 judges wrote that it was necessary to label Israeli settlement goods as such “to prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity.” The court further stated that Israeli settlements “are characterized by the fact that they give concrete expression to a policy of population transfer conducted by that state outside its territory, in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law.” Advertisement A label that merely stated “Made in the West Bank” was insufficient, the court said, because customers would not have a way of knowing that the product they are considering purchasing originated in a locality established “in breach of the rules of international humanitarian law.” Products from Israel proper, the spokesperson for the EU embassy in Israel said, continue to have a “privileged trading relationship with the EU.” She noted that such goods benefit from preferential tariff treatment upon their entry into the EU. “This situation will remain unchanged,” she promised. Pro-Israel activists quickly condemned the court’s ruling. “The European Court is approving putting a new kind of ‘Yellow Star’ on Jewish-made products,” said Eugene Kontorovich, a professor of international law and the director of International Law at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum. “This is not about consumer protection, it is about adopting a unique legal standard for the Jewish state. The EU labels for these Jewish products are also unique among all product labelling in that they are not geographic — they are not about ‘where’ something was made but by ‘whom,'” he said. Gerald Steinberg, a political science professor and the head of NGO Monitor, a Jerusalem-based watchdog group critical of pro-Palestinian nonprofits, said the EU’s product labelling is meant as a “gateway drug” towards BDS and other forms of demonization for anti-Israel groups.

In a statement, a spokesperson of the EU embassy in Ramat Gan said that “clear and non-misleading indication of origin is an essential part of the EU’s consumer policy.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The court’s decision confirms the European Commission’s “interpretative notice” of 2015, which first introduced the need to label settlement goods as such, the spokesperson added. “The EU’s position regarding this issue did not change,” she said. “The EU has a longstanding and well-known position that it will not recognize any changes to pre-1967 Israeli borders other than those agreed by the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” she said. “The EU considers settlements in occupied territories illegal under international law.” At the same time, the EU rejects “any form of boycott or sanctions against Israel” including the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, she emphasized. Advertisement The court took on the case after Psagot Winery — which is located in a settlement by the same name just north of Jerusalem — challenged a 2016 ruling by a French court that said goods produced in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights must be labeled as originating in an “Israeli settlement.” “We will study the decision and respond after we have studied it,” Psagot CEO Yaakov Berg told The Times of Israel in an initial statement minutes after the court in Luxembourg announced its verdict. A short while later, The Lawfare Project, a New York-based pro-Israel advocacy group, released a statement in Berg’s name: “The Winery is proud of its contribution to combating this decision and intends to continue the struggle,” it said. The statement also noted that several US Congressmen are supporting the winery’s battle against the EU’s labeling policy. “As Israeli citizens, living in a community that has been approved by the Israeli government, we only wish to produce and export high standard wine that has earned its reputation worldwide,” Berg was quoted saying. Brooke Goldstein, who heads the Lawfare Project and has provided legal counsel to Psagot, said the court’s decision would “codify religious discrimination into law” and embarrasses Europe. Advertisement “There is no reason for products produced by Muslims and Jews in the same geographic place to be labelled differently. In fact, treating people differently because of their religion is the definition of bigotry and we know what happens when Europe goes down that track,” she said. Just last week, Goldstein told The Times of Israel that she was “confident” that the EU court would rule in Psagot’s favor. Transportation Minister Bezalel Smotrich denounced the court’s ruling, suggesting that the judges in Luxembourg are supporting the Gaza terrorists who have been shooting hundreds of rockets at Israel since early Tuesday. “On the same day that Israel’s enemies remind of us their aspiration to destroy us, and of the results of escaping from terrorism and relinquishing control over territory, the European court is positioning itself by their side,” he said in a statement. The Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office did not have an immediate response to the court’s ruling. However, the Israeli government expected the court’s verdict and tried to convince the winery to withdraw its appeal, several unnamed Israeli officials had said in recent days. They feared that the court would declare legally binding a policy that heretofore, while considered mandatory, was not enforced by many EU member states. Tuesday’s ruling was likely to boost the BDS movement, they had argued before it was handed down. Indeed, the court’s verdict is likely to actually harm the business interests of all Israelis exporters, not only those from the settlements, Israeli officials had warned. “The European countries’ maneuvering space will decrease after the ruling,” an Israeli officials told The Times of Israel recently. “Those seeking to delegitimize Israel could use the ruling against us, both on the legal level as well as in terms of public perception.” Advertisement According to a Channel 13 report Monday, the Foreign Ministry instructed diplomats stationed in European capitals to warn their interlocutors that implementing the controversial policy could negatively impact relations with Israel. The pro-settler Yesha Council denounced the court ruling, saying it mainly hurts the Arab residents of the West Bank who make a living working for Israeli companies. “This is hypocritical decision, which stems from the lowest kind of anti-Semitism and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,” the group said in a statement. It also called on the Israeli government to “act strongly” in order to annul the court ruling. The Palestinians welcomed the court’s ruling, and called on European countries to implement “what is a legal and political obligation,” senior Palestine Liberation Organization official Saeb Erekat said in a statement. “Our demand is not only for the correct labeling reflecting the certificate of origin of products coming from illegal colonial-settlements, but for the banning of those products from international markets,” he added. In their decision Tuesday, the 15 judges wrote that it was necessary to label Israeli settlement goods as such “to prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity.” The court further stated that Israeli settlements “are characterized by the fact that they give concrete expression to a policy of population transfer conducted by that state outside its territory, in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law.” Advertisement A label that merely stated “Made in the West Bank” was insufficient, the court said, because customers would not have a way of knowing that the product they are considering purchasing originated in a locality established “in breach of the rules of international humanitarian law.” Products from Israel proper, the spokesperson for the EU embassy in Israel said, continue to have a “privileged trading relationship with the EU.” She noted that such goods benefit from preferential tariff treatment upon their entry into the EU. “This situation will remain unchanged,” she promised. Pro-Israel activists quickly condemned the court’s ruling. “The European Court is approving putting a new kind of ‘Yellow Star’ on Jewish-made products,” said Eugene Kontorovich, a professor of international law and the director of International Law at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum. “This is not about consumer protection, it is about adopting a unique legal standard for the Jewish state. The EU labels for these Jewish products are also unique among all product labelling in that they are not geographic — they are not about ‘where’ something was made but by ‘whom,'” he said. Gerald Steinberg, a political science professor and the head of NGO Monitor, a Jerusalem-based watchdog group critical of pro-Palestinian nonprofits, said the EU’s product labelling is meant as a “gateway drug” towards BDS and other forms of demonization for anti-Israel groups.

EU’s top court rules that consumers have a right to know if goods they buy come from Israeli settlements built on occupied Palestinian land in violation of international law. (Ronan Shenhav) The European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday that goods from Israeli colonies on occupied Palestinian land must be labeled as originating from settlements. The judgment is a severe blow to Israel’s efforts to legitimize its colonies in the occupied West Bank and Syria’s Golan Heights – the construction of which is a war crime. The court, the highest judicial authority for interpreting EU law, stated that labeling settlement goods is mandatory “in order to prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity.” The ruling also acknowledges that Israel’s settlements are part of a “policy of population transfer” by Israel “in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law.” Legal boost for BDS According to the EU court, accurate labeling is necessary so that consumers can make “informed choices, with regard not only to health, economic, environmental and social considerations, but also to ethical considerations and considerations relating to the observance of international law.” In other words, the EU’s top court is affirming that citizens have the right to engage in economic boycotts of goods in order to promote respect for human rights and international law. This part of the ruling will be particularly welcome to advocates of BDS – boycott, divestment and sanctions – who emphasize the role of civil society action in bringing accountability for Israel’s violations of Palestinian rights. Earlier this year, an advisory opinion from a senior official of the EU court likened Israeli settlement wines to goods from apartheid South Africa. “Just as many European consumers objected to the purchase of South African goods in the pre-1994 apartheid era, present-day consumers may object on similar grounds to the purchase of goods from a particular country” because it pursues “policies which that consumer happens to find objectionable or even repugnant,” Gerard Hogan, advocate general of the European Court of Justice, wrote. His reasoning appears to have persuaded the judges. Losing case A 2011 EU directive requires accurate labeling of goods in order to protect a consumer’s right to information, including the origin of a product. In 2015, the EU issued an “interpretive notice” requiring goods made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Golan Heights to be labeled as originating from such settlements. The French government then issued a regulation in 2016 requiring such labeling on settlement goods. The case before the EU court stemmed from an effort to overturn that French rule. It was brought by the Psagot winery, a settlement company that operates on occupied, stolen Palestinian land, and by the Organisation Juive Européenne, an Israel lobby group. Israeli officials appear to have anticipated that the court ruling would go against them. In recent days anonymous officials criticized Psagot for proceeding with what they expected would be a losing case. “In what could be described as a preemptive blame game, these officials are warning that the European Court of Justice is likely to rule in favor of the controversial labeling policy, and that the suit brought about by Psagot, while just, will ultimately backfire,” The Times of Israel reported. “The European countries’ maneuvering space will decrease after the ruling,” an Israeli official said. The judgment by the EU court follows a similar decision by the Federal Court of Canada in July. The Canadian court ruled that wines produced in settlements on occupied Palestinian land in violation of international law cannot be labeled “Made in Israel.” The court in Ottawa found that people who wish to express their political views through their purchasing decisions “have to be provided with accurate information as to the source of the products in question.” Lax enforcement In 2017, EU officials privately admitted that it is “impossible” to reliably distinguish which Israeli-produced goods come from settlements. This raises questions about how effectively the court ruling will be enforced by an EU bureaucracy and member states that spare no effort to aid Israel and shield it from accountability.

News article:
Leading U.S. lawmakers warned the European Union that if they issue a mandate requiring Jewish products made in contested areas of Israel to carry consumer warning labels, this could trigger American anti-boycott laws and effectively jeopardize our trade with Europe, where anti-Semitism is becoming increasingly prevalent. The European Court of Justice (CJEU) is expected to issue an opinion this week on a long-running case brought forth by an Israeli winery challenging a requirement that Israeli-made products be labeled as coming from “settlements” and “Israeli colonies.” The decision, according to the Washington Free Beacon, is expected to be issued early Tuesday and follows a recent opinion by the EU court’s advocate general stating that European law requires these Jewish-made products to be labeled. Critics compared the law to Nazi-era boycotts of Jewish products and view such requirements as a win for the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, [aka BDS.] Question: If the EU wants to boycott Israeli products, why aren’t they also boycotting Turkish, Venezuelan, Iranian and Jordanian products, just for starters? Answer: Because the BDS movement is an anti-Semitic, Palestinian-led movement co-founded by Omar Baghouti, a man who calls for a one state solution and the dismantling of Israel, the only Jewish state on the planet. Barghouti attended Tel Aviv University but was overtly anti-Semitic. The school wanted him expelled but it never came to pass and he remained at the school where he received a masters degree in philosophy. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) petitioned EU ambassador to the United States Stavros Lambrinidis to raise concerns about a possible ruling in favor of the warning labels, stating that it could create policy tension with the United States and involve us in a boycott war with the EU. Sens. Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) and Rob Portman (R-OH) sent a similar letter to U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer expressing concerns that the ruling holds Israel to a standard no other country is subjected to, as mentioned above. Rep. Juan Vargas (D-CA) also sent a letter to U.S. ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland. It warned that the ruling would lead to discrimination against Israel, but of course, that’s exactly the intention. Advertisement The lawmakers stated that such a ruling could trigger multiple U.S. anti-boycott laws and damage the nearly $1.3 trillion in trade between America and the EU. “The regulation in question is problematic for a number of reasons, including because it targets specific businesses based on the ethnicity and national origin of their owners,” Menendez wrote in the Lambrinidis letter. “I am deeply concerned that if the CJEU decision empowers the EU to require or allow its Member States to label Israeli and Palestinian products in the manner proposed, it will allow and encourage the politicization of EU rules of origin labeling with potential adverse unintended consequences, including by opening the door to near-unlimited use of ‘ethical considerations’ in food labeling which would enable Member State protectionism and nationalism, and be unhelpful for the EU single market,” Menendez wrote. “Additionally, it could facilitate Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) tactics and de facto boycotts and discrimination against Israel, and its products, and potentially lead to discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, religion and nationality, contrary to existing EU policies and laws against BDS campaigns, Israel boycotts and discrimination,” the letter states. Advertisement A decision mandating the labeling of Jewish goods also would be seen as an effort by the EU to interfere in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, giving Hamas justification to continue their attacks on Israel. “The U.S. Federal Government and many U.S. states have enacted strong anti-boycott provisions that impose severe penalties and restrictions on companies that participate in boycotts or other economic pressure campaigns against Israel,” Menendez wrote. “If the CJEU decision empowers the EU to mandate or allow Member States to implement such labels which target Israeli businesses and exports there will be serious and far-reaching implications and unintended consequences.” So we will find out soon enough about the decision the EU is expected to make, but with the endemic problem of hatred for the Jews, don’t bet on a good outcome.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund has banned investment in G4S because of the risk of human rights violations being committed by the company in Qatar and the UAE, the Guardian reported today. "Norway's Council of Ethics, which monitors investments in the country's £860bn Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), said there was an 'unacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations'," the paper added. "The company's practice – in the worse cases – could place workers under constraint," the council said. In March 2017, a Yemeni court ordered G4S to pay millions in back pay and compensation to security guards who accused the firm of abandoning them after the war broke out in the country. The company denied the charges. READ: Rights group condemns Israel's campaign against BDS The security firm has long been the target of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign as a result of its involvement in Israeli aggression Palestinian prisoners and Al-Aqsa Mosque. A G4S subsidiary runs a national police training centre inside Israeli prisons where thousands of Palestinians are detained and holds a contract with Israel to build the Israeli Police Academy in the illegal settlement of Beit Shemesh. This academy offers all forms of training for Israel, which practices torture against the Palestinian people, mainly in occupied Jerusalem.

The United States declared itself "deeply concerned" by a European court ruling this week obliging European states to clearly label produce originating from Israeli settlements in occupied territory. In a statement published yesterday, the US State Department slammed the decision, echoing the criticism already levelled by the Israeli government. "The United States is deeply concerned by the EU requirement identified in the decision issued yesterday by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Psagot Case," the statement read. "The circumstances surrounding the labelling requirement in the specific facts presented to the Court are suggestive of anti-Israel bias," the State Department continued. In a case brought by Psagot, a settlement-based winery, the court ruled that produce made in settlements in the occupied West Bank should be identified as such, as opposed to "Made in Israel". READ: New research shows Israel settlements benefit from bilateral relations with EU In response, Israel said it "strongly rejects" the decision, which it claimed "serves as a tool in the political campaign against Israel", adding that "the ruling's entire objective is to single out and apply a double standard against Israel". The Trump administration's response echoed these talking points, claiming that labelling settlement produce "serves only to encourage, facilitate, and promote boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel". "The United States unequivocally opposes any effort to engage in BDS, or to otherwise economically pressure, isolate, or otherwise delegitimise Israel," the State Department added. "The path toward resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict is through direct negotiations. America stands with Israel against efforts to economically pressure, isolate, or delegitimise it."

News article:
As Israel came under attack this week with hundreds of rockets raining down from Gaza, and as it steeled itself for even worse, the Israel-bashers were up to their old tricks. On Tuesday, the European Court of Justice issued its ruling in the Psagot winery case. It said that the origin of any foodstuffs, such as Psagot wine, made in an Israeli settlement in the “occupied territories” must be described as such. This was to enable consumers to make “ethical considerations and considerations relating to the observance of international law,” which could “influence consumers’ purchasing decisions.” What’s unethical here is not the behavior of Israel but the ECJ. Singling out Israel like this creates a discriminatory double standard. No other country with a territorial dispute or whose behavior is subject to criticism has its products labeled in this way. As Eugene Kontorovich, a scholar of international law, tweeted: “Products around the world are made in many situations that raise ‘ethical’ and legal questions, from Chinese prison labor factories to Moroccan drilling Sahrawi oil. Only such concern that requires labeling in E.U. is Jews living in neighborhoods where they are not ‘supposed’ to be.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Moreover, the court has discriminated against Jews by singling out Israeli businesses from Arab ones. Its ruling is deeply politicized and disreputable, owing everything to boilerplate European prejudice against Israel, and nothing to law and justice. Indeed, it repeatedly got the law wrong. For example, it stated that “the West Bank is a territory whose people, namely the Palestinian people, enjoy the right to self-determination.” No such right has ever been granted in law. As The Hague Initiative for International Co-operation has written: “On the contrary, international law requires that the right to self-determination cannot infringe the territorial integrity or security of neighboring states.” Which is precisely what the Palestinians’ demand entails. Where the boundaries of any Palestinian state would ultimately be drawn has always been a matter for negotiation. Under the Oslo accords, the Palestine Liberation Organization itself agreed that “the status of these territories is under negotiation, and at least some of these territories could in fact be part of the territory of the State of Israel.” In fact, the only legal right to any of what is now Israel, the “West Bank” and Gaza was given by the international community in the 1920s to the Jews alone, in recognition of their unique historical claim to the land as the only people for whom it had ever been their national kingdom. The ruling states that the settlements give “concrete expression to a policy of population transfer conducted by [Israel] outside its territory, in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law.” This is the standard misreading of the Geneva Convention, which is also regularly trotted out by the British foreign office and others to claim that the settlements are illegal. But it is false. The Israeli residents of these disputed territories weren’t transferred there by the state. They moved there voluntarily. Meanwhile, as half of Israel was shut down and its citizens took to the bomb shelters, it didn’t take long for Amnesty International to slander Israel yet again for defending itself against attack. It accused Israel of bombing the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights building in Gaza. “Strikes targeting civilian buildings is a violation of international law,” it (ungrammatically) declared. This was untrue. The building was actually hit by a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket, as testified by a Fox News foreign correspondent in Gaza, Trey Yingst, who said he witnessed this from across the street. Confronted by the truth, Amnesty merely tweeted a disingenuous statement that “conflicting information” was circulating about what exactly hit the building, and called for an “impartial investigation” into this and other incidents. The only impartial investigation should be into the moral bankruptcy of Amnesty International. Its initial falsehood was accompanied by another tweet that “Israel has a history of carrying out serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza, including war crimes, with impunity and displaying a shocking disregard for Palestinian lives.” This is a lie. Israel goes to lengths unequaled by any other nation’s armed forces in trying to minimize civilian casualties, with a ratio of civilians to terrorists killed that is three to four times better than any Western nation has achieved. It is those firing the rockets from Gaza who are in violation of international and human-rights law by committing the double war crime of deliberately targeting Israeli civilians and using their own people as human shields. Amnesty has a long record of anti-Israel behavior. As the watchdog NGO Monitor says, Amnesty “disproportionately singles out Israel for condemnation, focusing solely on the conflict with the Palestinians, misrepresenting the complexity of the conflict, and ignoring more severe human rights violations in the region.” Both the ECJ ruling and Amnesty’s behavior are but the latest examples of the way in which international law and human-rights doctrine have been used—or abused—to weaponize malevolence against Israel. As detailed in James Loeffler’s book, Rooted Cosmopolitans: Jews and Human Rights in the Twentieth Century, this is a tragic history. Reacting to the anti-Jewish pogroms in Eastern Europe around the turn of the last century, Jewish lawyers, jurists and other activists sought to fashion international law into a defense mechanism to protect powerless minorities through asserting the human rights of every individual. The Lithuanian-born lawyer, Jacob Robinson, fruitlessly warned that for the Jewish people, this was a trap. He understood that, by superseding national sovereignty, universal human-rights doctrine was innately hostile to Jewish particularism as expressed through the Zionist dream of recovering the Jewish national homeland. He was correct. Human-rights doctrine and law itself have been turned into weapons against Israel. Amnesty has played a special role in this travesty. As Loeffler has said, its Jewish founder, Peter Benenson, developed from a Socialist Zionist into a Catholic humanitarian. “In the process, he set his organization—and by extension, the larger human-rights movement—on a course to view Jewish nationalism as an affront to the universalist sensibilities of the liberal, Christian West. “The human-rights community, in other words, came to define itself as a universal Church of humanity through renouncing its Jewish origins. The State of Israel became an irresistible target, worthy of extra scrutiny and moral critique by virtue of its ties to Judaism and the Holocaust. “This was not anti-Semitism in the classical sense. But it was an ideological obsession with Zionism, and it saw Israel as cartoonish rogue state and icon of clannish tribalism. Thus, what we might call the ‘deep culture’ of the human-rights movement grew out of an almost missionary-like, Christian-inflected worldview, in which Israel became a symbol of the redemptive promise of human-rights universalism and the failure of Jewish nationhood.” To its credit, the U.S. government has responded furiously to the ECJ ruling. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the Trump administration is gearing up to take action to fight The European Union labeling decision as a “top priority.” “I think we’ve been clear that we think this is consistent with the BDS movement, and we think the BDS movement is anti-Semitic,” said an official. Good for them. That is the only morally principled response for a government to make. And for everyone else, the best response is to make a point of buying Psagot’s excellent wine.

The information extracted from the image:


 Theme/Focus: Growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank from 1947 to 2021.
Key Information/Sub-event: The image shows the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank from 1947 to 2021. In 1947, there were 27 Israeli settlements in the West Bank. By 1967, this number had increased to 331. In 1993, there were 911 Israeli settlements in the West Bank. By 2021, this number had increased to 1,186.
News Event Perspective: The image provides a visual representation of the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank over time. This information is relevant to the news article because it helps to illustrate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The image shows that the number of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has increased significantly over time. This has led to increased tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, as the Palestinians see the settlements as a violation of their right to self-determination. The image also shows that the growth of Israeli settlements has accelerated in recent years, which is likely to further increase tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.

This information is relevant to the news article because it helps to illustrate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The image shows that the number of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has increased significantly over time. This has led to increased tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, as the Palestinians see the settlements as a violation of their right to self-determination. The image also shows that the growth of Israeli settlements has accelerated in recent years, which is likely to further increase tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.']

This year, Norway increased its annual support to Palestinian education authorities from NOK 40 ($4.3 million) to 55 million ($6 million) annually and has plans to up its help by another NOK 220 million ($24 million) over the next few years. Anniken Huitfeldt of the Labour Party requested an explanation from the Conservative Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide about the government's actions over the dangerous content of the books. She stressed that Norwegian funds must be used to “promote peace and reconciliation”, not “build up contradictions”. Conservative MP Michael Tetzschner also voiced concerns over the development of Palestinian self-government. “I believe we need to have a bigger debate about whether Norwegian taxpayers should contribute to a regime that is developing so poorly. Sooner or later we have to put our foot down”, Tetzschner told Aftenposten. Hans Fredrik Grøvan of the Christian Democrat Party has advocated to freeze support until the syllabus has been changed sufficiently, while the Progress Party proposes to cut Norway's support by 10 percent. By contrast, Petter Eide of the Socialist Left Party and the head of the parliamentary Friends of Palestine group, suggested more dialogue. “No, there is a lot we can do without cutting the support. Instead of criticising them, we should demand a dialogue that can help improve the educational content”, Petter Eide said. “Don't forget that we're in fact living under an occupation. Our children grow up in a besieged country. Every single day is suffering for our children”, Palestinian Vice Education Minister Dr Basri Saleh told Aftenposten, addressing the criticism. According to him, some of the examples listed by IMPACT-SE were either later removed or taken out of context. State Secretary Audun Halvorsen of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that Norways support mainly goes to infrastructure, such as building and renovating schools, and does not cover salaries, operating expenses, curricula, or learning material. Norway was one of the first countries to recognise Israel in 1949 and has played a major part in peace efforts. The attitude toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, however, is one of the indicators of the left-right divide in Norwegian politics. While the Friends of Israel caucus mostly features right-of-centre MPs from the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats and the Progress Party, the Friends of Palestine relies heavily on the left-of-centre parties, above all Labour and the Socialist Left.

News article:
The European Court of Justice’s ruling earlier this week determining that the labeling of settlement goods is legally binding could seriously hurt ties between Israel and the European Union, Knesset speaker Yuli Edelstein warned on Thursday. In a letter to the president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, Edelstein conveyed a “good measure of dismay and disappointment” over the EU court’s verdict. “I am gravely concerned that the court’s decision could undermine the political and economic ties between Israel and the European Union and have far-reaching, negative ramifications for the prospects of peace between Israel and its neighbors in the Middle East,” the Knesset speaker wrote to his counterpart. The verdict, handed down Tuesday by the EU’s top court in Luxembourg, “applies a double standard to Israel and the disputed territories under its control,” Edelstein went on. “Indeed, out of dozens of such areas around the world, I believe only Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights are subject to such labeling regulations.” The judges also “chose to overlook the deep, historic connection between the Jewish people and the entire land of Israel,” he wrote. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Using the Biblical terms for the West Bank, Edelstein argued that Judea and Samaria should not be considered “occupied” by Israel “as they were never part of another country.” Israel’s control of these territories was legitimated by the Balfour Declaration, the 1920 San Remo Resolution and Article 80 Section 12 of the UN Charter, wrote Edelstein, a vociferous opponent of Palestinian statehood and strong supporter of Israel’s settlement project. Furthermore, the EU court ignored the “implausibility” of returning the Golan Heights to Syria, he added. Advertisement “At the same time, the court prescribed differential treatment for Arabs and Jews based on ethnicity by mandating that food labels not indicate merely ‘West Bank’ or ‘Golan Heights’ but specifically that the foods come from a Jewish settlement — lest consumers mistake these goods for Arab ones,” the Knesset speaker lamented in his letter. “By imposing this requirement, the court prejudges the outcome of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, in contradiction to the longstanding position of the European Union — and the international community as a whole — that bilateral steps and talks are the only way to resolve this conflict.” Edelstein added that the court’s verdict accused only Israel of violating international law but disregarded “the conduct of its enemies,” noting that this week Palestinian terrorists in Gaza fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli civilians. The “selective information” on which the court based its ruling “will inevitably result in a boycott of goods” from the settlements but also from Israel proper, he posited. “In doing so, the court has knowingly adopted the arguments long propounded by the BDS movement, whose extremist agenda aims to destroy the economy of Israel as a whole in order to force it to capitulate to the Palestinians.” If implemented, the court’s “disgraceful” verdict would undermine the EU’s ability to play a fair and objective role in the Middle East peace process, according to Edelstein. Advertisement Furthermore, it is “likely to result directly in many problems for Israel’s economic cooperation” with EU member states. Edelstein concluded his letter by urging Sassoli to get the European Parliament and member states’ parliaments to announce “their unqualified opposition to this unfortunate ruling.” A yet-unpublished study by a pro-Palestinian nonprofit in Brussels found that only 10 percent of settlement wines in European stores are labelled in accordance to EU’s labeling policy. The EU, meanwhile, took great pains this week to stress that it was not banning settlement goods and opposes boycotts and sanctions against Israel. “Products originating from the settlements outside the internationally recognized borders, i.e., before 1967, have not been blocked and will not be blocked from entry into the EU,” a spokesperson for the union’s Ramat Gan embassy told The Times of Israel on Wednesday. The Knesset speaker’s criticism of the EU court’s ruling joins that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Israel Katz, as well as of the US State Department and various US congressmen. “Europe the other day decided to act against Israel, and to put labels on products that are made here,” Netanyahu said Wednesday. “They don’t join the sanctions against Iran, they join sanctions against Israel. Unbelievable!” Palestinian officials welcomed the court’s ruling, and urged European countries to implement “what is a legal and political obligation,” senior Palestine Liberation Organization official Saeb Erekat said in a statement. Advertisement “Our demand is not only for the correct labeling reflecting the certificate of origin of products coming from illegal colonial-settlements, but for the banning of those products from international markets,” he added. The court took on the case after Psagot Winery — which is located in a settlement by the same name just north of Jerusalem — challenged a 2016 ruling by a French court that said goods produced in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights must be labeled as originating in an “Israeli settlement.” In their decision Tuesday, the 15 judges wrote that it was necessary to label Israeli settlement goods as such “to prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity.” The court further stated that Israeli settlements “are characterized by the fact that they give concrete expression to a policy of population transfer conducted by that state outside its territory, in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law.” A label that merely stated “Made in the West Bank” was insufficient, the court said, because customers would not have a way of knowing that the product they are considering purchasing originated in a locality established “in breach of the rules of international humanitarian law.”

News article:
Thirteen Israeli notables on Friday issued an open letter saying they welcomed the European Court of Justice’s ruling earlier this week that settlement products need to be labeled as such, but said the move is insufficient and the European Union must ban the import of settlement goods altogether. “Israeli settlements are the leading cause of human rights violations against Palestinians, and settlement expansion is destroying the possibility of a two-state solution. By banning goods that originate in Israeli settlements, Europe would help support the differentiation between Israel per se and settlements in the occupied territories,” reads the letter published in the Guardian. “We believe that the occupation is morally corrosive, strategically shortsighted, and thoroughly detrimental to peace. The international community has taken insufficient action in addressing this reality. Europe continues to support the occupation financially by allowing trade with Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.” The letter was signed by former speaker of Knesset and head of the Jewish Agency Avraham Burg; former lawmaker Mossi Raz; former ambassador to France Prof. Eli Barnavi; former Israeli ambassador to South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe Ilan Baruch; former attorney general Prof. Michael Ben-Yair; former ambassador to South Africa and Turkey Alon Liel; former Israeli ambassador to the Czech Republic Erella Hadar; Israel Prize winners Prof David Harel, Prof Yehoshua Kolodny, Alex Levac, Prof David Shulman and Prof Zeev Sternhell; EMET Prize Laureate Miki Kratsman.

The Israeli government lambasted the ruling. “Europe the other day decided to act against Israel, and to put labels on products that are made here,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “They don’t join exactly the sanctions against Iran, they join sanctions against Israel. Unbelievable!” The US State Department on Wednesday condemned the ruling in a statement later welcomed by Netanyahu, who said it demonstrated “moral clarity.” A spokesperson for the EU embassy in Ramat Gan told The Times of Israel on Wednesday that the union’s labeling requirement “is not discriminatory and it is not against Israel.” The union has a privileged trading relationship with Israel, and products originating in Israel proper benefit from preferential tariff treatment, she said. “The EU is the first trading partner for Israel with total trade in 2018 amounting to 34.4 billion euros,” she said. Products originating from the settlements outside Israel’s internationally recognized borders “have not been blocked and will not be blocked from entry into the EU,” she stressed.

News article:
Federica Mogherini has constantly indulged Benjamin Netanyahu during her time as EU foreign policy chief. (European Union) Federica Mogherini is closing her term as the European Union’s foreign policy chief in much the same way that she kicked it off: by pandering to Israel. Shortly after taking up her post in 2014, Mogherini paid a visit to Benjamin Netanyahu. She assured the Israeli prime minister that he could “count on the European Union” to build a “new start.” Mogherini was vague about what the “new start” would entail. Nonetheless, she has brought some degree of innovation – though not in a positive sense – to international relations. Under her leadership, the EU uses far weaker language than previously when alluding to grave breaches of human rights. Back in February 2001, the official EU line was that it “deplores” how Israel was carrying out extrajudicial executions. But when Israel resorted to an extrajudicial execution in November 2019, Mogherini’s team merely referred to an “operation” without expressing any criticism. In Feb. 2001, an extrajudicial execution by Israel in Gaza sparked strong condemnation by the EU. Tuesday's extrajudicial execution of Bahaa Abu al-Atta was noted as an "operation", zero criticism. @4noura's 'Justice for Some' essential reading to understand this trajectory. pic.twitter.com/d0WeIQkyEv — Ben White (@benabyad) November 14, 2019 Snuggling up Mogherini has been in regular contact with Israel’s top politicians over the past five years. When Netanyahu’s Likud became the biggest party in a 2015 election, Mogherini was quick to congratulate him. Her message was that she regarded Israel’s relationship with the European Union as “mutually beneficial.” Such snuggling up to the apartheid state displays a contempt for demands by Palestinians that they be granted justice and equality. Perhaps the most concise articulation of those demands is the 2005 Palestinian call for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel. Following a 2016 confab with Netanyahu, Mogherini stressed her “firm rejection” of the BDS call. To be fair, Mogherini has occasionally spoken some truth. In 2017, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, approved a bill to “regularize” the theft of Palestinian land by formally approving settlements in the occupied West Bank that had hitherto been deemed illegal even by Israel. Mogherini issued an uncharacteristically frank reprimand. If the legislation came into effect, it “would further entrench a one-state reality of unequal rights,” she complained. For once, she accurately identified the problem which must be solved. Moral compass? At grassroots level, many Palestinians are seeking to swap the “one-state reality of unequal rights” for a one-state solution that guarantees equality. Mogherini might have acknowledged the problem – however fleetingly – yet she has been dismissive of those seeking to end it. Rather than advocating for genuine equality, she favors a two-state solution that would, in all probability, give Palestinians sovereignty over a mere sliver of their historic homeland. Mogherini has insisted “there is no alternative” to a two-state solution. Reflecting on her term recently, Mogherini said “I am proud that we, Europeans, have never lost our compass” and have “always kept working to preserve and enable a negotiated two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.” Thankfully she did not refer to the figurative navigational aid as a “moral compass.” For the EU’s stance on some key issues is amoral. Since 30 March 2018, Israel has repeatedly attacked Gaza residents taking part in the Great March of Return. When protesters have been killed, Mogherini’s team has suggested that they were responsible for their own deaths. Statements published by that team have claimed that some demonstrators acted violently, implying that is why they were shot. Vital context has been omitted. The stones thrown by some protesters are no match for the exploding bullets or tear gas canisters fired at high velocity by Israeli snipers. Besides, when did throwing a stone at a heavily-armed soldier become an offense punishable by death? Hunt for euphemisms A population under military occupation has a UN-mandated right to resist. Apparently, it would be too much for Mogherini to accept that. Her “new start” has involved a hunt for euphemisms. It is no longer fashionable, she would have us believe, to label the situation in Gaza as a siege or a blockade. She prefers to call it a “closure.” Mogherini and her team have been unfailingly courteous toward Israel. In their statements, the team asks Israel to “reconsider” planned demolitions of Palestinian homes. Last year, Mogherini’s team even stated that it “expects” Israel to “reverse” decisions that would uproot Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. As usual, there was no threat of any penalty if Israel disregarded the EU’s ever-so-timid appeal. Mogherini’s successor as EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, may be more of a straight talker. As Spain’s foreign minister, Borrell was not prepared to dance with joy when Israel marked the 70th anniversary of its foundation during May 2018. The celebrations were “covered in blood” because Israel had carried out a massacre in Gaza a few days earlier, he wrote in an opinion piece. Will Borrell behave any differently to Mogherini when he takes up his new post? His past willingness to excoriate Israel does not make him a valiant defender of human rights. On the contrary, he has been part of a government which has sought to crush Catalonia’s independence movement in quite a brutal manner. Borrell himself has made spurious allegations against prominent figures in that movement. He has gone so far as publishing a classified document in an attempt to besmirch one such figure. Being the foreign minister for Spain is not the same as representing the entire EU, which now includes 28 countries. Collectively, their governments have indulged Israel in all kinds of ways. Borrell might usher in a few small changes but more than likely the indulgence will continue. It is vital, then, that ordinary Europeans do what political leaders won’t: boycott and isolate Israel.

News article:
Federica Mogherini has constantly indulged Benjamin Netanyahu during her time as EU foreign policy chief. (European Union) Federica Mogherini is closing her term as the European Union’s foreign policy chief in much the same way that she kicked it off: by pandering to Israel. Shortly after taking up her post in 2014, Mogherini paid a visit to Benjamin Netanyahu. She assured the Israeli prime minister that he could “count on the European Union” to build a “new start.” Mogherini was vague about what the “new start” would entail. Nonetheless, she has brought some degree of innovation – though not in a positive sense – to international relations. Under her leadership, the EU uses far weaker language than previously when alluding to grave breaches of human rights. Back in February 2001, the official EU line was that it “deplores” how Israel was carrying out extrajudicial executions. But when Israel resorted to an extrajudicial execution in November 2019, Mogherini’s team merely referred to an “operation” without expressing any criticism. In Feb. 2001, an extrajudicial execution by Israel in Gaza sparked strong condemnation by the EU. Tuesday's extrajudicial execution of Bahaa Abu al-Atta was noted as an "operation", zero criticism. @4noura's 'Justice for Some' essential reading to understand this trajectory. pic.twitter.com/d0WeIQkyEv — Ben White (@benabyad) November 14, 2019 Snuggling up Mogherini has been in regular contact with Israel’s top politicians over the past five years. When Netanyahu’s Likud became the biggest party in a 2015 election, Mogherini was quick to congratulate him. Her message was that she regarded Israel’s relationship with the European Union as “mutually beneficial.” Such snuggling up to the apartheid state displays a contempt for demands by Palestinians that they be granted justice and equality. Perhaps the most concise articulation of those demands is the 2005 Palestinian call for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel. Following a 2016 confab with Netanyahu, Mogherini stressed her “firm rejection” of the BDS call. To be fair, Mogherini has occasionally spoken some truth. In 2017, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, approved a bill to “regularize” the theft of Palestinian land by formally approving settlements in the occupied West Bank that had hitherto been deemed illegal even by Israel. Mogherini issued an uncharacteristically frank reprimand. If the legislation came into effect, it “would further entrench a one-state reality of unequal rights,” she complained. For once, she accurately identified the problem which must be solved. Moral compass? At grassroots level, many Palestinians are seeking to swap the “one-state reality of unequal rights” for a one-state solution that guarantees equality. Mogherini might have acknowledged the problem – however fleetingly – yet she has been dismissive of those seeking to end it. Rather than advocating for genuine equality, she favors a two-state solution that would, in all probability, give Palestinians sovereignty over a mere sliver of their historic homeland. Mogherini has insisted “there is no alternative” to a two-state solution. Reflecting on her term recently, Mogherini said “I am proud that we, Europeans, have never lost our compass” and have “always kept working to preserve and enable a negotiated two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.” Thankfully she did not refer to the figurative navigational aid as a “moral compass.” For the EU’s stance on some key issues is amoral. Since 30 March 2018, Israel has repeatedly attacked Gaza residents taking part in the Great March of Return. When protesters have been killed, Mogherini’s team has suggested that they were responsible for their own deaths. Statements published by that team have claimed that some demonstrators acted violently, implying that is why they were shot. Vital context has been omitted. The stones thrown by some protesters are no match for the exploding bullets or tear gas canisters fired at high velocity by Israeli snipers. Besides, when did throwing a stone at a heavily-armed soldier become an offense punishable by death? Hunt for euphemisms A population under military occupation has a UN-mandated right to resist. Apparently, it would be too much for Mogherini to accept that. Her “new start” has involved a hunt for euphemisms.

News article:
Last week, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) released an anti-Semitic bombshell. It decreed that all European Union member states must affix special labels to Jewish-made Israeli “foodstuffs” produced beyond the Green Line and exported to E.U. member states. The ruling was made in response to a lawsuit brought before a French court by Psagot winery, located north of Jerusalem. Psagot manager Yaakov Berg was represented by a consortium of attorneys led by Brooke Goldstein, the founder and executive director of the Lawfare Project in New York. The focus of the Lawfare Project’s work is defending Israel and Jews against discrimination. Israeli political leaders and American Jewish leaders roundly and rightly condemned the court ruling as anti-Israel, biased and anti-Semitic. Psagot brought suit before a French administrative court to appeal a 2016 French regulation requiring the special labeling of Jewish-made Israeli foods produced beyond the Green Line. Psagot and its attorneys argued before the French court that the French regulation contradicted European law by imposing illegal trade barriers. The French court referred the issue to the ECJ in the form of two questions: Does E.U. law require the bloc’s member-states to impose discriminatory labeling requirements on Jewish-made products from the disputed territories, and, if it doesn’t, does E.U. law still permit member states to adopt such labeling requirements on their own. In the background of the case was a 2015 “interpretive notice” issued by the European Commission that had instructed all E.U. member states to apply the special discriminatory labels to all Jewish-made Israeli goods produced beyond the Green Line. Senior jurists in and out of government explain that the interpretive notice was a blow to Israel, but it did not legally require E.U. states to do anything. The notice could only have become legally binding if it had been unanimously adopted by E.U. states in the European Council. Israeli lawyers noted at the time that the European demand for discriminatory labels violated international trade law, but this made no impression on European decision makers. The French court’s referral to the ECJ was a big deal. It created a means for anti-Israel forces in the E.U. to render the interpretive notice from 2015 legally binding on all E.U. states without obtaining unanimous consent. ECJ judgments bind all E.U. states. Once the matter was moved to the ECJ for a determination, senior international jurists and Israeli government officials began requesting that Psagot and the Lawfare Project pull their lawsuit. Former Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked (Yamina), who dealt with the issue during her tenure, revealed on Tuesday that she and a senior Justice Ministry official had repeatedly “begged” Psagot and its attorneys to withdraw their lawsuit. Speaking to the media Tuesday, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Foreign Ministry officials submitted similar requests that Psagot withdraws its lawsuit. In late June of this year, the urgency of the entreaties grew. According to ECJ procedure, before the judges render their verdict, the court’s advocate general publishes his recommended verdict. It is rare for the court to rule in a manner that contradicts its advocate general’s recommendation. In late June, the advocate general recommended answering that it is obligatory for E.U. member states to affix discriminatory labels to Israeli Jewish imports from Israeli territory beyond the Green Line. Once his recommendation was published, any residual hope the ECJ would act in accordance with international trade law and reject the proposed discriminatory labeling policy was extinguished. But then, with or without the advocate general’s recommendation, Israel and Psagot never stood a chance of getting justice at the ECJ. Before it is a judicial body, the ECJ is a political arm of the E.U. whose job it is to uphold E.U. policies and strengthen E.U. institutions. The E.U.’s policy towards Israel has been clear for a very long time. For decades, the E.U. has been waging a hostile campaign against Israel. The goals of the campaign are to call Israel’s right to exist into question, weaken Israel economically and politically and strengthen Israel’s enemies at Israel’s expense. The E.U. wages its campaign through political, diplomatic and economic warfare. Non-governmental organizations registered in Israel and financed and directed by the E.U. and its member states are strategic weapons in this campaign. These European-financed and directed, Israeli-registered and staffed NGOs routinely submit petitions to Israel’s High Court of Justice whose purpose is to stymie the government’s ability to implement duly promulgated policies and undermine the Israeli military’s ability to defend the country. At the United Nations, E.U. member states vote against Israel and for its enemies as a general practice. They support U.N. bodies including the U.N. Human Rights Committee, UNRWA and UNESCO that routinely and maliciously target Israel. The E.U. leverages its trade and scientific cooperation with Israel to normalize boycotts of Israeli companies, institutions and Jewish citizens who operate beyond the Green Line. As for Europe’s support for Israel’s enemies, led by Germany, the E.U. refuses to walk away from the nuclear deal with Iran, or reinstate economic sanctions against Iran in light of its open material breaches of the limitations the nuclear deal placed on its nuclear activities. So too, led by Germany, the E.U. refuses to designate all arms of Hezbollah as a terror group. This pro-Hezbollah policy has the deadly result of enabling the Iranian-controlled terrorist group to operate and raise money openly in Europe. Both of these policies, which pave Iran’s way to a nuclear arsenal and empower its foreign legion, are hostile acts towards Israel. Then there is the E.U.’s adulation of the Palestinians. E.U. institutions do not merely legitimize Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas and the PFLP, they enthusiastically embrace them. For instance, the European Parliament has repeatedly hosted senior Palestinian terrorists. It has given standing ovations to senior Palestinian officials, including Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, as they revived medieval anti-Semitic blood libels. Abbas, for instance, accused Israeli Jews of deliberately poisoning wells. In the face of the E.U.’s implacable, long-standing and steadily expanding efforts to harm Israel, the notion Israel can reasonably expect to ever receive a fair hearing from any E.U. body is ridiculous. Stunningly, even after their defeat at the ECJ the Psagot winery and its legal team refuse to accept this truth. In an interview on Tuesday with JNS, Goldstein said that Europe itself is the verdict’s biggest loser. In her words, “The ruling opens the floodgates where consumers in any E.U. country will be able to insist that any consideration important to them before they purchase a product—whether social, political, environmental or other—will have to be included on the labeling of any product being imported. Not just from Israel.” This is untrue. The verdict—like the E.U.’s legally unsupported claim that Israeli “settlements” built beyond the Green Line are illegal—is not general. It is very specific. It applies only to Israel. The ECJ’s ruling will not be applied on behalf of vegans and Tibetans. Everyone knows it was directed against Israel and its Jewish citizens alone. The verdict was political, not legal. For all that, Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry officials are wrong to attack the Psagot winery and its attorneys for their willful blindness. They themselves are afflicted by the same impairment. In their contacts with the E.U., its agencies and aligned organizations, government officials act on the basis of the mistaken belief that it is possible to convince the Europeans to abandon their hostile positions against Israel through reasoning and evidence. Perhaps the best example of this misguided Israeli practice is the respect Israel accords the prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (ICC). ICC investigators are currently preparing charges against Israelis for so-called war crimes on the basis of false accusations submitted by the Palestinians. The Palestinian complaints relate both to Israel’s military activities and to settlement activities carried out by the Israeli government and Israeli citizens. According to government officials, the reason Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preventing the evacuation of the illegal Palestinian outpost Khan al-Ahmar despite the fact that the High Court of Justice ordered its dismantlement over a year ago is fear that implementing the court decision will subject Israel to war crimes charges at the ICC. In September 2018, the Trump administration announced that it was ending all cooperation with the ICC due to its political nature and its institutional hostility towards the United States and Israel. Following this announcement, the United States denied a visa to an ICC prosecutor scheduled to visit the country to investigate complaints submitted to the ICC against U.S. soldiers for actions they allegedly perpetrated in Afghanistan. Shortly after the policy was presented, the State Department announced it was ordering the closure of the PLO representative office in Washington, D.C., due to the PLO’s refusal to withdraw the complaints it submitted to the ICC against Israel. Unlike the Americans, Israel continues its dialogue with the ICC prosecutor and permits the prosecutor’s representatives to enter Israel in the hopes of convincing the ICC of Israel’s innocence. But the fact that the ICC is even giving a hearing to, let alone proceeding with its investigations of false accusations against Israel is proof that it is a hostile body. It will never give a fair hearing to Israel. Just as permitting the inherently hostile ECJ to adjudicate issues related to Israeli Jewish exports from Israeli-controlled territory was a mistake that harmed Israel, so Israel’s legitimization of the ICC will come back to haunt it. Berg, Goldstein and their associates insist that they were compelled to act because the Israeli government refused to lift a finger against the E.U. Their allegation of government inaction is valid. The government has an obligation to aggressively respond to Europe’s hostile behavior. To this end, the time has come to end the tax-exempt status of hostile European-funded and directed NGOs. It is also time for Israel to act in the legal arena in jurisdictions that are not inherently hostile to the Jewish state. For instance, Israel should seek justice against the E.U.’s hostile and unfair trade practices at the World Trade Organization’s arbitration bodies and in U.S. courts. But before Israel can do any of these things, government officials have to abandon their delusion that Europe is Israel’s enlightened ally with whom Israel can reason. Europe is not enlightened and it is not Israel’s ally. It is not susceptible to reason and evidence. It is a hostile post-national governing structure that is conducting political, diplomatic and economic warfare against Israel to harm the Jewish state and assist its enemies. So long as our leaders and our officials refuse to accept this basic truth, we will continue to experience defeat and discrimination as individuals and collectively at the hands of our European “friends.” Reprinted with author’s permission from Jewish News Syndicate

News article:
Last week, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) released an anti-Semitic bombshell. It decreed that all European Union member states must affix special labels to Jewish-made Israeli “foodstuffs” produced beyond the Green Line and exported to E.U. member states. The ruling was made in response to a lawsuit brought before a French court by Psagot winery, located north of Jerusalem. Psagot manager Yaakov Berg was represented by a consortium of attorneys led by Brooke Goldstein, the founder and executive director of the Lawfare Project in New York. The focus of the Lawfare Project’s work is defending Israel and Jews against discrimination. Israeli political leaders and American Jewish leaders roundly and rightly condemned the court ruling as anti-Israel, biased and anti-Semitic. Psagot brought suit before a French administrative court to appeal a 2016 French regulation requiring the special labeling of Jewish-made Israeli foods produced beyond the Green Line. Psagot and its attorneys argued before the French court that the French regulation contradicted European law by imposing illegal trade barriers. The French court referred the issue to the ECJ in the form of two questions: Does E.U. law require the bloc’s member-states to impose discriminatory labeling requirements on Jewish-made products from the disputed territories, and, if it doesn’t, does E.U. law still permit member states to adopt such labeling requirements on their own. In the background of the case was a 2015 “interpretive notice” issued by the European Commission that had instructed all E.U. member states to apply the special discriminatory labels to all Jewish-made Israeli goods produced beyond the Green Line. Senior jurists in and out of government explain that the interpretive notice was a blow to Israel, but it did not legally require E.U. states to do anything. The notice could only have become legally binding if it had been unanimously adopted by E.U. states in the European Council. Israeli lawyers noted at the time that the European demand for discriminatory labels violated international trade law, but this made no impression on European decision makers. The French court’s referral to the ECJ was a big deal. It created a means for anti-Israel forces in the E.U. to render the interpretive notice from 2015 legally binding on all E.U. states without obtaining unanimous consent. ECJ judgments bind all E.U. states. Once the matter was moved to the ECJ for a determination, senior international jurists and Israeli government officials began requesting that Psagot and the Lawfare Project pull their lawsuit. Former Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked (Yamina), who dealt with the issue during her tenure, revealed on Tuesday that she and a senior Justice Ministry official had repeatedly “begged” Psagot and its attorneys to withdraw their lawsuit. Speaking to the media Tuesday, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Foreign Ministry officials submitted similar requests that Psagot withdraws its lawsuit. In late June of this year, the urgency of the entreaties grew. According to ECJ procedure, before the judges render their verdict, the court’s advocate general publishes his recommended verdict. It is rare for the court to rule in a manner that contradicts its advocate general’s recommendation. In late June, the advocate general recommended answering that it is obligatory for E.U. member states to affix discriminatory labels to Israeli Jewish imports from Israeli territory beyond the Green Line. Once his recommendation was published, any residual hope the ECJ would act in accordance with international trade law and reject the proposed discriminatory labeling policy was extinguished. But then, with or without the advocate general’s recommendation, Israel and Psagot never stood a chance of getting justice at the ECJ. Before it is a judicial body, the ECJ is a political arm of the E.U. whose job it is to uphold E.U. policies and strengthen E.U. institutions. The E.U.’s policy towards Israel has been clear for a very long time. For decades, the E.U. has been waging a hostile campaign against Israel. The goals of the campaign are to call Israel’s right to exist into question, weaken Israel economically and politically and strengthen Israel’s enemies at Israel’s expense. The E.U. wages its campaign through political, diplomatic and economic warfare. Non-governmental organizations registered in Israel and financed and directed by the E.U. and its member states are strategic weapons in this campaign. These European-financed and directed, Israeli-registered and staffed NGOs routinely submit petitions to Israel’s High Court of Justice whose purpose is to stymie the government’s ability to implement duly promulgated policies and undermine the Israeli military’s ability to defend the country. At the United Nations, E.U. member states vote against Israel and for its enemies as a general practice. They support U.N. bodies including the U.N. Human Rights Committee, UNRWA and UNESCO that routinely and maliciously target Israel. The E.U. leverages its trade and scientific cooperation with Israel to normalize boycotts of Israeli companies, institutions and Jewish citizens who operate beyond the Green Line. As for Europe’s support for Israel’s enemies, led by Germany, the E.U. refuses to walk away from the nuclear deal with Iran, or reinstate economic sanctions against Iran in light of its open material breaches of the limitations the nuclear deal placed on its nuclear activities. So too, led by Germany, the E.U. refuses to designate all arms of Hezbollah as a terror group. This pro-Hezbollah policy has the deadly result of enabling the Iranian-controlled terrorist group to operate and raise money openly in Europe. Both of these policies, which pave Iran’s way to a nuclear arsenal and empower its foreign legion, are hostile acts towards Israel. Then there is the E.U.’s adulation of the Palestinians. E.U. institutions do not merely legitimize Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas and the PFLP, they enthusiastically embrace them. For instance, the European Parliament has repeatedly hosted senior Palestinian terrorists. It has given standing ovations to senior Palestinian officials, including Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, as they revived medieval anti-Semitic blood libels. Abbas, for instance, accused Israeli Jews of deliberately poisoning wells. In the face of the E.U.’s implacable, long-standing and steadily expanding efforts to harm Israel, the notion Israel can reasonably expect to ever receive a fair hearing from any E.U. body is ridiculous. Stunningly, even after their defeat at the ECJ the Psagot winery and its legal team refuse to accept this truth. In an interview on Tuesday with JNS, Goldstein said that Europe itself is the verdict’s biggest loser. In her words, “The ruling opens the floodgates where consumers in any E.U. country will be able to insist that any consideration important to them before they purchase a product—whether social, political, environmental or other—will have to be included on the labeling of any product being imported. Not just from Israel.” This is untrue. The verdict—like the E.U.’s legally unsupported claim that Israeli “settlements” built beyond the Green Line are illegal—is not general. It is very specific. It applies only to Israel. The ECJ’s ruling will not be applied on behalf of vegans and Tibetans. Everyone knows it was directed against Israel and its Jewish citizens alone. The verdict was political, not legal. For all that, Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry officials are wrong to attack the Psagot winery and its attorneys for their willful blindness. They themselves are afflicted by the same impairment. In their contacts with the E.U., its agencies and aligned organizations, government officials act on the basis of the mistaken belief that it is possible to convince the Europeans to abandon their hostile positions against Israel through reasoning and evidence. Perhaps the best example of this misguided Israeli practice is the respect Israel accords the prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (ICC). ICC investigators are currently preparing charges against Israelis for so-called war crimes on the basis of false accusations submitted by the Palestinians. The Palestinian complaints relate both to Israel’s military activities and to settlement activities carried out by the Israeli government and Israeli citizens. According to government officials, the reason Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preventing the evacuation of the illegal Palestinian outpost Khan al-Ahmar despite the fact that the High Court of Justice ordered its dismantlement over a year ago is fear that implementing the court decision will subject Israel to war crimes charges at the ICC. In September 2018, the Trump administration announced that it was ending all cooperation with the ICC due to its political nature and its institutional hostility towards the United States and Israel. Following this announcement, the United States denied a visa to an ICC prosecutor scheduled to visit the country to investigate complaints submitted to the ICC against U.S. soldiers for actions they allegedly perpetrated in Afghanistan. Shortly after the policy was presented, the State Department announced it was ordering the closure of the PLO representative office in Washington, D.C., due to the PLO’s refusal to withdraw the complaints it submitted to the ICC against Israel. Unlike the Americans, Israel continues its dialogue with the ICC prosecutor and permits the prosecutor’s representatives to enter Israel in the hopes of convincing the ICC of Israel’s innocence. But the fact that the ICC is even giving a hearing to, let alone proceeding with its investigations of false accusations against Israel is proof that it is a hostile body. It will never give a fair hearing to Israel. Just as permitting the inherently hostile ECJ to adjudicate issues related to Israeli Jewish exports from Israeli-controlled territory was a mistake that harmed Israel, so Israel’s legitimization of the ICC will come back to haunt it. Berg, Goldstein and their associates insist that they were compelled to act because the Israeli government refused to lift a finger against the E.U. Their allegation of government inaction is valid. The government has an obligation to aggressively respond to Europe’s hostile behavior. To this end, the time has come to end the tax-exempt status of hostile European-funded and directed NGOs. It is also time for Israel to act in the legal arena in jurisdictions that are not inherently hostile to the Jewish state. For instance, Israel should seek justice against the E.U.’s hostile and unfair trade practices at the World Trade Organization’s arbitration bodies and in U.S. courts. But before Israel can do any of these things, government officials have to abandon their delusion that Europe is Israel’s enlightened ally with whom Israel can reason. Europe is not enlightened and it is not Israel’s ally. It is not susceptible to reason and evidence. It is a hostile post-national governing structure that is conducting political, diplomatic and economic warfare against Israel to harm the Jewish state and assist its enemies. So long as our leaders and our officials refuse to accept this basic truth, we will continue to experience defeat and discrimination as individuals and collectively at the hands of our European “friends.” Reprinted with author’s permission from Jewish News Syndicate

News article:
Two generations removed from the Holocaust, a rising specter of anti-Semitism is once again haunting Europe. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) just issued a ruling discriminating against Jewish businesses in Israel. The case was brought by Psâgot Winery, a historic vineyard, and maker of Israeli wine. The decision, however, has implications far beyond the vine. The court declared that EU law requires that derogatory labels be placed on products made by Jews in disputed Israeli territories. In fact, per the CJEU, any consumer's “ethical considerations” — whether political, social, economic, or environmental — also necessitate labeling. Europe has opened up a Pandora’s Box of politicized product labeling and unleashed unintended consequences that could wreak havoc on international trade. Back in 2015, a small group of European Foreign Ministers proposed that imported products made by Israelis in the West Bank, Golan Heights, or East Jerusalem require distinct labels to indicate they were produced in Israeli “colonies” or “settlements.” Under the guise of consumer protection, they proposed that Psâgot, which is located on a site where Jews have been growing grapes and making wine for thousands of years, stamp a humiliating and historically inaccurate disclaimer onto every bottle. The Lawfare Project, a legal think tank, helped Psâgot challenge this discriminatory policy. Now that the court has decided that EU law does indeed require such labeling, they have effectively mandated discrimination. The law now treats Jewish-owned and Muslim-owned businesses differently, even if they operate in the same geographic location. While such religious discrimination may be easy to enforce in the West Bank, where Muslims and Jews are relatively segregated, it will present quite the challenge in Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, where there are no defined “settlements.” Compliance with the court’s decision would require some sort of ethnic or religious census of business owners in order to determine how products should be labeled. Intentional or not, the court just established a precedent and legal framework for new labeling requirements on products from all over the world. The decision allows any consumer to object to the labeling of any country's exports based on any "ethical consideration" whatsoever. Anyone can now demand that oil produced in Iran be labeled to indicate that the Islamic Republic executes homosexuals. Goods produced in China could be made to note that the People’s Republic violently suppresses pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. Imports from the United States might have to disclaim whether the manufacturer supports President Trump. At least one lawsuit has already been filed by a consumer protection association in France, demanding that the court enforce labeling of Iranian, Chinese, U.S., and even some French products, pursuant to the astonishingly expansive "ethical considerations" mandate. Unless the EU amends the underlying trade regulations, European countries that have the unenviable task of enforcing this decision will now be faced with two choices: equal treatment under the law, or overt antisemitism. With the former, the door will be opened to unpredictable and chaotic politicized labeling. The second option, wherein only Israeli products area affected, satisfies the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism, according to which a contemporary example is "[a]pplying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation." Psâgot's legal action will now be remanded to France, where we will argue, on the basis of French anti-discrimination law, against applying the requirements exclusively to Israel. We are committed to challenging enforcement in every country and every locality that attempts to discriminate on the basis of ethnicity or religion. It gives rise to painful historic parallels when Europeans force Jews to identify themselves and their products with distinct markings. The CJEU’s decision essentially states that European law requires Israelis to pin yellow stars to make it easier to identify themselves and their products. The symbolism is not lost on anyone. Eighty-one years ago this week, Europe embarked on one of the darkest chapters in its history with Kristallnacht, the "Night of Broken Glass." Now, European ministers of trade, finance, and justice have to decide whether they want to begin on yet another dark path. We’ll soon learn just how much economic uncertainty they are willing to stomach in order to bring back yellow stars for the Jews. Brooke Goldstein is Executive Director of The Lawfare Project, and Yaakov Berg is CEO of Psâgot Winery.

Hungary is blocking a diplomatic effort by the European Union to issue a joint statement condemning the U.S. announcement on Monday that it does not consider Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria to be illegal, The Times of Israel reported on Wednesday. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó has made it plain that Hungary will veto any E.U. statement on the settlement’s legality, a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the matter told the Times on condition of anonymity. As a result, no text has yet been circulated among E.U. member states, according to the source. Budapest recently blocked a joint European Union statement condemning the U.S. move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Hungary opened a trade office in Jerusalem earlier this year as a branch of its embassy in Tel Aviv. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has close relations with Israel and the United States. His government recently recognized the country’s Orthodox Jewish community for the first time since World War II. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Monday that the United States is softening its stance on Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria.

News article:
This week, headlines worldwide reported upon a new European Union requirement that goods produced in Israeli settlements must not carry the generic “Made in Israel” tag and must be specially labeled. In reaction to this decision, across America, Israel and civilized people worldwide, there was outrage. For example, The United States State Department said that the ruling encourages the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. The State Department said the U.S. “unequivocally opposes” any efforts to “economically pressure, isolate, or otherwise delegitimize Israel.” Israel’s Foreign Ministry said this decision sets a “double standard” that unfairly singles out Israel when there are dozens of territorial disputes around the world. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the decision was “another example of Europe continuing its surrender to Israel’s enemies. The EU’s discrimination against the Zionist enterprise will provide legal cover for anti-Semitism.”NGO Monitor said product labelling is “a stepping stone for full-fledged BDS against Israel, particularly in Europe.” In Israel across the political spectrum this labeling has been attacked. There is no difference between products produced across the Green Line and those produced in Israel proper, Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid said and noted that this ruling was “effectively a call for the de facto boycott of Israel,” an “irresponsible move”, “a direct continuation of the boycott movement against Israel, which is anti-Semitic and misguided,” and a “stain on the EU. Avigdor Lieberman sarcastically suggested stamping settlement goods with yellow stars (a reference to the Holocaust). The head of the Jewish Agency, and former Labor Party leader, Isaac Herzog, conjured a parallel between the E.U.’s decision and the U.N.’s 1974 “Zionism is Racism” resolution, which his father, Chaim Herzog, Israel’s U.N. ambassador at the time, famously denounced. Herzog continued to note that to mark products made in factories over the Green Line is “a prize for terror.” Former justice minister head Ayelet Shaked said the ruling had a “stench of antisemitism,” explaining that there is no similar mandate with regard to any other territorial conflict, such as Tibet, Cyprus and Western Sahara. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an American Jewish leader bought ads this week in the New York Times, featuring a large bottle of wine labeled with a Jewish star reminiscent of the stars worn in Nazi Germany. “For centuries, and most famously in the 1930s, Jews and their businesses were labeled by Europeans,” the ad reads. “Now, just decades after the Holocaust, they’re at it again.”“True to form and history, Europe’s actions are only against Israel and Jews,” the ad reads. “The EU does not label olive oil from Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus, nor fish from Moroccan-occupied Western-Sahara, nor Goji berries and, most significantly, gold and other resources being plundered from Chinese-occupied Tibet. “Singling out Jewish businesses means Europe’s latest measures has nothing to do with justice,” it continues. “It’s a centuries-old, uniquely European prejudice: naming and shaming Jews.” Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at George Mason University’s school of law said, “Now Jewish products are the only ones to have to bear special labels based on their origin. This is a new kind of yellow star put exclusively on Jewish goods,” referring to the badge Jews throughout Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear as a means of identification. Yet, you know who celebrated? The radical extremist American Jewish non-profit, The New Israel Fund, who continue to openly advocate and financially support a boycott of Israel. This policy of the European Union is perfectly in line with the policies of The New Israel Fund. As their website states, the NIF will “not deny funding to organizations that call for a boycott of settlement products…” In plain English, $30 Million Dollars a year is raised from American Jews to boycott post-1967 Israel – including the Western Wall, Ma’aleh Adumim, Shiloh and other Israeli cities. The NIF supports a boycott of Israel. Donors to the New Israel Fund include Oz Benamram, the Bertha Foundation, Moriah Fund, Sparkplug Foundation, Firedoll Foundation and Telos Group. Shame on them and all donors to NIF.

News article:
As has been widely reported, on November 12, 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Article 9(1)(i) of Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 must be interpreted to mean that “foodstuffs originating in a territory occupied by the State of Israel must bear not only the indication of that territory but also, where those foodstuffs come from a locality or a group of localities constituting an Israeli settlement within that territory, the indication of that provenance.” The lawsuit that ended up before the ECJ was brought by the Psagot winery, which is located in territories occupied by Israel since June 1967 and whose products are distributed in France. Psagot challenged a notice published by France’s Ministry of the Economy requiring that goods originating from Israeli-occupied territories be labeled in accordance with Regulation 1169/2011 as interpreted by the European Commission (which distinguished between those goods that were produced in an Israeli settlement and those that were not). France’s Supreme Court for Administrative Justice (Conseil d’État) sought preliminary guidance from the ECJ. Regulation No. 1169/2011 is essentially a consumer protection rule regarding foodstuffs. In pertinent part, the Regulation requires that food information not be “misleading”, including as to a food’s “country of origin or place of provenance”. The ECJ determined that foodstuffs produced in an Israeli settlement within territory occupied by the State of Israel in 1967 must so state – otherwise, European consumers might be misled as to the “place of provenance” of the product. Alternatively stated, if a product produced in an Israeli settlement only identified the State of Israel as the “country of origin”, such labeling “would be liable to deceive consumers.” As a result of the ECJ ruling, much hand-wringing, rending of garments and wearing of sackcloth and ashes has ensued. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the decision “unbelievable.” The Israeli foreign ministry said the ruling would serve as a “tool in the political campaign against Israel” and accused the ECJ of singling out and discriminating against Israel. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the EU policy “gravely flawed.” Another Israeli diplomat indicated that if European countries implemented the ruling, it would be “damaging” to the EU-Israel relationship. The US State Department issued a statement expressing “deep concern” over the decision and asserted that the “circumstances surrounding the labeling requirement” are “suggestive of anti-Israel bias.” The statement further asserted that the ruling would serve to “encourage, facilitate, and promote boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.” Similarly, the World Jewish Congress found the ECJ ruling “worrying” because it: (a) “sets the ground” for delegitimization of Israel; (b) could “set a precedent” for implementation, or stricter implementation, of Regulation 1169/2011’s labeling requirements; and (c) encourages BDS against Israel. Neither Israel nor the producers of foodstuffs located in Israeli-occupied territories should fear the ECJ’s decision. Instead, they should welcome the ruling as a “teachable moment.” All the ECJ decision mandates is that foodstuffs indicate that they are the product of an Israeli settlement within territory occupied by the State of Israel in 1967. This is a baseline requirement, and not a limitation. In other words, nothing in the ruling stops producers from expounding on how it came to be that their products are being produced in territory occupied by the State of Israel in 1967. Advertisement For example, a truthful, non-deceptive and non-misleading label could legitimately state: From approximately 1300 B.C.E. until approximately 70 C.E., the Jewish people consistently maintained an independent nation-state in territory known as Judea, which is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea (to the West), Mount Hermon (to the North), the Jordan River (to the East) and the Negev desert (to the South). The spiritual and political center of Judea was always the city of Jerusalem. After Roman imperialists conquered Judea, the native, indigenous Jewish inhabitants were subjected to mass murder and forced expulsion. The Roman Empire attempted to quash any Jewish connection to the land by renaming it “Palastina” and by colonizing and renaming its capital “Aelia Capitolina”. Subsequent colonial conquerors followed the Romans, including Sassanids, Byzantine Christians, Umayyad (Arab) Muslims, Crusaders, Mamluks and Ottoman Turks. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the British were awarded a “mandate” over “Palestine”, which included the obligation to establish a national home for the Jewish people. In 1922, Britain broke off from Mandate Palestine a vast territory located east of the Jordan River, excluded Jews from settling in that territory and, thereafter, administered the only western part of the Mandate as “Palestine”, while calling the eastern part “Transjordan”. The Arab inhabitants of the western part of Mandatory Palestine, who remained there after centuries of imperialist colonization, objected to any independent Jewish state. Advertisement In 1947, the British government announced its intention to terminate the Mandate. In November of 1947, the United Nations General Assembly voted to partition Palestine into separate independent Arab and Jewish states. The Arabs rejected the Partition Plan. The Jews accepted it and, in May of 1948, declared an independent State of Israel. The Arab inhabitants of the former Mandate, joined by the combined armed forces of several nearby Arab countries, immediately attacked the nascent State of Israel. Israel not only fended off the attackers, but also acquired territory in excess of that granted to it under the Partition Plan. The pre-existing Jewish communities – some of which were centuries old – in those portions of Palestine illegally occupied by Arab states (Syria, Jordan and Egypt) as a result of their belligerent war of aggression were destroyed, and their inhabitants expelled, including from the eastern portion of Jerusalem. Like the Romans, Jordan renamed the territory it occupied, historically known as Judea and Samaria, as the “West Bank”. Syria occupied the Golan Heights. Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. The Arabs did not give up their quest to eliminate the State of Israel. In June of 1967, Arab armies again prepared to attack Israel and were again rebuffed. In that defensive war, Israel came to occupy those territories previously illegally occupied by Syria (Golan Heights), Egypt (Gaza Strip) and Jordan (“West Bank”). Because there was no prior legitimate sovereign state in control of those territories, the Fourth Geneva Convention – including its prohibition against the forcible transfer of civilians to territory of an occupied state – did not, and does not, apply in these territories. In November of 1967, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 242, which, in pertinent part, affirmed that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East should include: (a) withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the Six Day War; and (b) termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force. Resolution 242 makes no mention of civilian habitations in territories occupied by Israel in 1967. Israel’s peace negotiations with all neighboring Arab states – and with the Arab inhabitants of those territories occupied by Israel in 1967 (through the PLO and the Palestinian Authority) – have always been premised on Resolution 242. Pending a peace agreement pursuant to which the Arab inhabitants of those territories occupied by Israel in 1967 agree to terminate their claims and acknowledge Israel’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, Israel has exercised its legal right to use non-private land and property in territories it occupies, including for civilian habitation. Voluntary Jewish settlement on land acquired in a defensive war, which did not belong to a previous lawful sovereign and which was designated as part of the Jewish State under the British Mandate, is not illegal. The European Union denominates these civilian Jewish habitations as “Israeli settlements”. Accordingly, this wine is a PRODUCT OF AN ISRAELI SETTLEMENT WITHIN TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE STATE OF ISRAEL IN 1967 While lengthy, such a label would undoubtedly comply with the EU Regulation No. 1169/2011 and any national implementation of it. The above is, of course, only an example. Producers subject to Regulation No. 1169/2011 could come up with their own (truthful, non-deceptive and non-misleading) descriptions, so long as they contain the ECJ’s “magic formula” regarding country of origin or place of provenance. Historical truth simply cannot be deemed “misleading” or “deceptive.” Europe’s Christians certainly understand that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). It’s now time for Jews in “Israeli settlements” to set themselves free as well.

News article:
As has been widely reported, on November 12, 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Article 9(1)(i) of Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 must be interpreted to mean that “foodstuffs originating in a territory occupied by the State of Israel must bear not only the indication of that territory but also, where those foodstuffs come from a locality or a group of localities constituting an Israeli settlement within that territory, the indication of that provenance.” The lawsuit that ended up before the ECJ was brought by the Psagot winery, which is located in territories occupied by Israel since June 1967 and whose products are distributed in France. Psagot challenged a notice published by France’s Ministry of the Economy requiring that goods originating from Israeli-occupied territories be labeled in accordance with Regulation 1169/2011 as interpreted by the European Commission (which distinguished between those goods that were produced in an Israeli settlement and those that were not). France’s Supreme Court for Administrative Justice (Conseil d’État) sought preliminary guidance from the ECJ. Regulation No. 1169/2011 is essentially a consumer protection rule regarding foodstuffs. In pertinent part, the Regulation requires that food information not be “misleading”, including as to a food’s “country of origin or place of provenance”. The ECJ determined that foodstuffs produced in an Israeli settlement within territory occupied by the State of Israel in 1967 must so state – otherwise, European consumers might be misled as to the “place of provenance” of the product. Alternatively stated, if a product produced in an Israeli settlement only identified the State of Israel as the “country of origin”, such labeling “would be liable to deceive consumers.” As a result of the ECJ ruling, much hand-wringing, rending of garments and wearing of sackcloth and ashes has ensued. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the decision “unbelievable.” The Israeli foreign ministry said the ruling would serve as a “tool in the political campaign against Israel” and accused the ECJ of singling out and discriminating against Israel. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the EU policy “gravely flawed.” Another Israeli diplomat indicated that if European countries implemented the ruling, it would be “damaging” to the EU-Israel relationship. The US State Department issued a statement expressing “deep concern” over the decision and asserted that the “circumstances surrounding the labeling requirement” are “suggestive of anti-Israel bias.” The statement further asserted that the ruling would serve to “encourage, facilitate, and promote boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.” Similarly, the World Jewish Congress found the ECJ ruling “worrying” because it: (a) “sets the ground” for delegitimization of Israel; (b) could “set a precedent” for implementation, or stricter implementation, of Regulation 1169/2011’s labeling requirements; and (c) encourages BDS against Israel. Neither Israel nor the producers of foodstuffs located in Israeli-occupied territories should fear the ECJ’s decision. Instead, they should welcome the ruling as a “teachable moment.” All the ECJ decision mandates is that foodstuffs indicate that they are the product of an Israeli settlement within territory occupied by the State of Israel in 1967. This is a baseline requirement, and not a limitation. In other words, nothing in the ruling stops producers from expounding on how it came to be that their products are being produced in territory occupied by the State of Israel in 1967. Advertisement For example, a truthful, non-deceptive and non-misleading label could legitimately state: From approximately 1300 B.C.E. until approximately 70 C.E., the Jewish people consistently maintained an independent nation-state in territory known as Judea, which is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea (to the West), Mount Hermon (to the North), the Jordan River (to the East) and the Negev desert (to the South). The spiritual and political center of Judea was always the city of Jerusalem. After Roman imperialists conquered Judea, the native, indigenous Jewish inhabitants were subjected to mass murder and forced expulsion. The Roman Empire attempted to quash any Jewish connection to the land by renaming it “Palastina” and by colonizing and renaming its capital “Aelia Capitolina”. Subsequent colonial conquerors followed the Romans, including Sassanids, Byzantine Christians, Umayyad (Arab) Muslims, Crusaders, Mamluks and Ottoman Turks. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the British were awarded a “mandate” over “Palestine”, which included the obligation to establish a national home for the Jewish people. In 1922, Britain broke off from Mandate Palestine a vast territory located east of the Jordan River, excluded Jews from settling in that territory and, thereafter, administered the only western part of the Mandate as “Palestine”, while calling the eastern part “Transjordan”. The Arab inhabitants of the western part of Mandatory Palestine, who remained there after centuries of imperialist colonization, objected to any independent Jewish state. Advertisement In 1947, the British government announced its intention to terminate the Mandate. In November of 1947, the United Nations General Assembly voted to partition Palestine into separate independent Arab and Jewish states. The Arabs rejected the Partition Plan. The Jews accepted it and, in May of 1948, declared an independent State of Israel. The Arab inhabitants of the former Mandate, joined by the combined armed forces of several nearby Arab countries, immediately attacked the nascent State of Israel. Israel not only fended off the attackers, but also acquired territory in excess of that granted to it under the Partition Plan. The pre-existing Jewish communities – some of which were centuries old – in those portions of Palestine illegally occupied by Arab states (Syria, Jordan and Egypt) as a result of their belligerent war of aggression were destroyed, and their inhabitants expelled, including from the eastern portion of Jerusalem. Like the Romans, Jordan renamed the territory it occupied, historically known as Judea and Samaria, as the “West Bank”. Syria occupied the Golan Heights. Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. The Arabs did not give up their quest to eliminate the State of Israel. In June of 1967, Arab armies again prepared to attack Israel and were again rebuffed. In that defensive war, Israel came to occupy those territories previously illegally occupied by Syria (Golan Heights), Egypt (Gaza Strip) and Jordan (“West Bank”). Because there was no prior legitimate sovereign state in control of those territories, the Fourth Geneva Convention – including its prohibition against the forcible transfer of civilians to territory of an occupied state – did not, and does not, apply in these territories. In November of 1967, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 242, which, in pertinent part, affirmed that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East should include: (a) withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the Six Day War; and (b) termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force. Resolution 242 makes no mention of civilian habitations in territories occupied by Israel in 1967. Israel’s peace negotiations with all neighboring Arab states – and with the Arab inhabitants of those territories occupied by Israel in 1967 (through the PLO and the Palestinian Authority) – have always been premised on Resolution 242. Pending a peace agreement pursuant to which the Arab inhabitants of those territories occupied by Israel in 1967 agree to terminate their claims and acknowledge Israel’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, Israel has exercised its legal right to use non-private land and property in territories it occupies, including for civilian habitation. Voluntary Jewish settlement on land acquired in a defensive war, which did not belong to a previous lawful sovereign and which was designated as part of the Jewish State under the British Mandate, is not illegal. The European Union denominates these civilian Jewish habitations as “Israeli settlements”. Accordingly, this wine is a PRODUCT OF AN ISRAELI SETTLEMENT WITHIN TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE STATE OF ISRAEL IN 1967 While lengthy, such a label would undoubtedly comply with the EU Regulation No. 1169/2011 and any national implementation of it. The above is, of course, only an example. Producers subject to Regulation No. 1169/2011 could come up with their own (truthful, non-deceptive and non-misleading) descriptions, so long as they contain the ECJ’s “magic formula” regarding country of origin or place of provenance. Historical truth simply cannot be deemed “misleading” or “deceptive.” Europe’s Christians certainly understand that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). It’s now time for Jews in “Israeli settlements” to set themselves free as well.

News article:
The European Court of Justice has ruled that Jewish products from Israeli-controlled territories must be singled out for punitive labeling if they are to be sold in European Union countries. This attack on Israel’s economy is a blow to America’s most important ally in the Middle East. What largely has been absent from the debate about the EU decision — which penalizes Israel alone among over 100 countries involved in territorial conflicts across the world — is the apparent Nazi and neo-Nazi origins of the measure. The EU’s top court seeks to punish the Jewish state because of its presence in the disputed territories of the West Bank, Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Instead of encouraging direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel over these contested territories as part of an eventual peace deal, the EU appears to have chosen to wage economic warfare against Israel. The ideological basis for the anti-Israel labeling penalty is clear: In 2012, Germany’s National Democratic Party (NPD) submitted a bill in the parliament of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to single out Israeli products. The NPD initiative called for “Palestinian and Israeli products” to be labeled and for a “clear designation of origin” to be implemented. The following year, Germany’s powerful Green Party introduced an initiative in the Bundestag that mirrored this legislation. Henryk M. Broder, a well-known German-Jewish journalist who has testified about modern anti-Semitism in the German parliament, wrote a column in a Swiss weekly, titled “Two Souls, One Thought,” that the NPD and Green parliamentary initiatives to demarcate Israeli products are “at their core identical.” The EU measure targeting Israel, Broder continued, is grounded in pre-World War II Nazi ideology. The NPD and Green initiatives follow the model of the Third Reich’s boycott of Jewish businesses that began on April 1, 1933, and invoked the slogan: “Germans, defend yourselves. Do not buy from Jews!” Economic warfare designed to destroy German Jews’ ability to support their families in the 1930s was part and parcel of the buildup to the Holocaust during WWII. The difference today, of course, is that European Jews can emigrate to Israel to escape the resurgent tide of anti-Semitism endemic in many EU member nations. Unfortunately, there appears to be support among some German diplomats and political parties for punishing Israeli producers. To the credit of the Trump administration, the U.S. vehemently opposes the mandatory labeling of Jewish products. A U.S. official told The Washington Free Beacon: “I think we’ve been clear that we think this is consistent with the BDS movement and we think the BDS movement is antisemitic.” Clearly, the EU labeling system could provide a huge shot to the extreme anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. In May, the Bundestag voted to classify BDS as an anti-Semitic movement. However, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government apparently has not stopped funding NGOs that support BDS activities in the Federal Republic and across the Middle East. Germany, the most influential country within the EU, could help put an end to the draconian labeling measure. Merkel, whom the World Zionist Organization honored last month with the prestigious Theodor Herzl Award for “exceptional efforts on behalf of Israel and the Zionist cause,” can prove she deserves such accolades by telling those who oppose Israel that Germany will reject any resurrection of anti-Jewish measures that echo the genocidal Nazis, old or new.

News article:
Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stated, on Thursday, that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank threaten to make a two-state solution impossible, the Palestine News Network reported. “Settlement activity in East Jerusalem seriously jeopardizes the possibility of Jerusalem serving as the future capital of both states,” she said during a speech at the European Parliament general debate on the situation in Israel and Palestine. “Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory are illegal under international law; they constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible,” Mogherini remarked. She continued, “There will not be peace without a strong political commitment by both sides and by the international community. On the European Union side, we have always been and we will continue to be ready to support, to encourage, to accompany all efforts to build peace and security and a negotiated two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.” “Yet we should all know that the two-state solution remains, I am profoundly convinced of this, the best and the only realistic chance for peace and also for security in the Holy Places.” More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank. The UN Security Council has condemned Israel’s settlement activities in the occupied territories in several resolutions. Less than a month before Trump took office, the United Nations Security Council in December 2016 adopted Resolution 2334, calling on Israel to “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem”. Palestinians want the West Bank as part of a future independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem (al-Quds) as its capital. The last round of Israeli-Palestinian talks collapsed in 2014. Among the major sticking points in those negotiations was Israel’s continued settlement expansion on Palestinian territories.

Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stated, on Thursday, that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank threaten to make a two-state solution impossible, the Palestine News Network reported. “Settlement activity in East Jerusalem seriously jeopardizes the possibility of Jerusalem serving as the future capital of both states,” she said during a speech at the European Parliament general debate on the situation in Israel and Palestine. “Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory are illegal under international law; they constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible,” Mogherini remarked. She continued, “There will not be peace without a strong political commitment by both sides and by the international community. On the European Union side, we have always been and we will continue to be ready to support, to encourage, to accompany all efforts to build peace and security and a negotiated two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.” “Yet we should all know that the two-state solution remains, I am profoundly convinced of this, the best and the only realistic chance for peace and also for security in the Holy Places.” More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank.

News article:
The BDS Movement began as an international civil insurrection against Israel following a series of military failures by combined Arab armies. It was designed to inflict severe, even crippling, economic damage on Israel. International agencies were cajoled to join the global campaign to bring down the Jewish State and to isolate it diplomatically. Despite all their hyper-active efforts this to has effectively been a failure. If the raison d-etre behind their efforts was to improve the lot of the Palestinian Arabs, the results of this has been contrary to what they, perhaps, intended. The prime example was the BDS high profile efforts to close down the Mishor Adumim factory of SodaStream, the Israeli-based company manufacturing the popular home soda machines. The brand carried the label “Made in Israel. This product is produced by Arabs and Jews working side-by-side in peace and harmony.” This message infuriated the BDS Movement who set about a heavily-funded propaganda campaign to close SodaStream down. It happened at a time when the Israeli company was looking to expand its production facility due to increasing demand for its popular product. Faced with its business needs and the rise of adverse publicity, SodaStream CEO, Daniel Birnbaum, decided to move its production to the Negev industrial area just north of Beer Sheba. The result was the prime victims of the BDS anti-normalization efforts were over 600 Palestinians forced into unemployment after earning Israeli-scale wages and social welfare benefits. The brand new factory today employs more people. The Palestinians have been replaced by the local Bedouin. SodaStream goes from strength to strength. It was taken over by globally-known Pepsi Cola. In November 2019, it was announced that a $92 Million expansion will enable the enlarged factory to employ a further one thousand workers. Had SodaStream stayed at Mishor Adumim, it would have benefitted the local Palestinians. Instead, BDS wrought significant financial damage on them. Advertisement Such is the bankruptcy of BDS efforts to inflict economic harm on Israel. As a substitute, they have persuaded the European Union to introduce a labelling policy on Jewish produced products and services from Judea & Samaria in Israel, frequently called “the West Bank,” and used to called in diplomatic circles as “disputed territories.” In a unique policy, the EU are insisting that Israeli products emanating from Jewish towns, villages, and industrial areas can no longer be labelled “Made in Israel” but must designate some other description. When the EU calls upon “international law” to back up its demands, its history, apparently, begins in 1967. Based on that false premise, it is a convenient leap of commitment to decide that Israel occupied “Palestine” in a corrupted retelling on history upon which they base their diplomacy, policies, their resolutions, and their false laws. They ignore the fact that there is no Palestine yet. Palestinians seem to be doing their best to establish a state only when Israel has been annihilated and Jews banished. Advertisement The Europeans take no account of the fact that, prior to 1948, the so-called West Bank was Israel in territory that included Judea & Samaria, the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea down to Eilat. They take no account that this was prescribed by the League of Nations (the forerunners of the United Nations) in 1922 in which they affirmed the 1920 decision of the Supreme Court of the League of Nations that “recognized the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country.” We need to question the European drift from the requirement to “secure the cooperation of all Jews who are willing to assist in the establishment of the Jewish national home” to a policy that id blatantly anti-Semitic. As for the premise that Jewish products must be tagged as not being quite kosher, i.e., not made in Israel, but produced by Jewish labor and ingenuity in what are called “Jewish settlements,” the European framers of this discriminatory labelling policy would do well to consider Article 6 of the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine which says the Administration of Palestine… “shall facilitate Jewish immigration” and shall encourage “close settlement by Jews on the land.” How the Europeans go from there to an attempted blocking and limitation on Jews choosing to live where they are entitled, historically and legitimately, to live, and call that an obstacle to peace, is, again, blatantly anti-Semitic. As for “Illegal occupation,” it is not illegal for a nation to defend itself. Nor is it illegal for such a nation to hold onto territory seized in a defensive war against a congenital aggressor as Israel was against Jordan, both in 1948 and in 1967, when it twice invaded Israel in order to annihilate the Jewish state and to banish its Jewish population. Evidence of this is seen in Jordan’s brutal occupation of Jerusalem in which they destroyed all the ancient synagogues and physically expelled all the remaining Jews, those they hadn’t killed, from the Old City of Jerusalem. That was when Jordan occupied Judea & Samaria and the Jordan Valley, which became known as The West Bank (of Jordan) between 1948 and 1967. Nobody cried about “illegally occupying Palestinian land” during that period. The Europeans had nothing to say about calling on the Jordanians to withdraw from occupied Israeli land. They were silent when Jordan joined with other Arab armies to “drive the Jews into the sea,” from their vantage positions on the high ground overlooking the narrow coastal plain of what was left of Israel since their initial conquest of Israeli territory. The Europeans silently expected the annihilation of the Jewish State. They did nothing. They watched and waited. Many were disappointed by the miraculous victory of a determined people’s army against the British trained and equipped Jordanian army who were driven back across the Jordan River as Israeli soldiers liberated Jerusalem and drove the Syrians off the Golan Heights. The Europeans have been supporting the proxy Arab cause, known as the Palestinians, ever since. They have silently acquiesced with Palestinian terrorism. They have pressured and punished Israel while buying into the victim card played by a corrupt, violent, anti-Semitic Palestinian leadership in Ramallah who, according to all polls, do not represent Palestinian Arabs. That honor belongs to Hamas, the Palestinian chapter of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. They pump European taxpayer’s money into Palestinian Authority coffers that fund a multi-million dollars “Pay to Slay” policy. They continue to fund UNRWA, the iniquitous UN organization that perpetuates a growing Palestinian refugee population into their 4th and 5th generation, living in the exclusive civil and security control of the Palestinian Authority! Am I the first to ask how it is possible to be a Palestinian refugee when you have been born and live as the 5th generation under the control of the PA? But the EU decision to target some 700,000 Jews while referring to “population transfers,” yet failing to impose the same strictures on Turkey who transferred its population into the northern part of Cyprus it occupied in a war of aggression, Russians in the Crimea, China’s grip on Tibet and Hong Kong, not to mention European fishing in the waters of Western Sahara occupied by Morocco, is not just hypocritical. It is a blatant form of discriminatory anti-Semitism.

News article:
EU support for Israel’s police and prison system elicits no criticism from corporate-funded think tanks. Shadi Hatem APA images I had a simple reason for deciding to write and speak out about the European Union’s relationship with Israel more than a decade ago: Nobody else was doing it. Soon it transpired that I was just partly right. Some “experts” on this subject can be found in think tanks and academia. Occasionally, they are invited to appear on the mainstream media. But mostly the target audience for their work seems to be other experts. Like a clique, the experts have their own language – a language with which the rest of us are unfamiliar. One of their favorite words is “normative.” I found myself listening to a couple of these experts during a recent conference in London (thankfully, the event also featured some genuine human rights campaigners). The conference introduced me to the work of Hugh Lovatt from the European Council on Foreign Relations. He has carved out a niche for himself as the leading authority on “differentiation.” As far as I can see, “differentiation” means that the EU should draw a distinction between Israel and the territories it has occupied since 1967 – the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), Gaza and the Golan Heights. Flawed Lovatt’s analysis rests on a fact that should be obvious but which needs to be constantly repeated: Israel’s settlement activities are illegal and governments around the world are obligated not to assist Israel’s illegal conduct. The concept of “differentiation” is nonetheless inherently flawed. For a start, it implies there are two Israels: one a vibrant democracy that may be caressed and cuddled; the other a perpetrator of war crimes that Western liberals should shun. In reality, there is only one Israel. The 2005 Palestinian call for boycott, divestment and sanctions recognizes that reality. It demands that action be taken against Israel in its entirety. That is proper. The Israel which began colonizing the West Bank in 1967 is the same Israel which forbids Palestinian refugees from returning to homes from which they were expelled in 1948. Furthermore, the same Israel treats Palestinians living within it as inferior to Jews – a situation now enshrined in constitutional legislation. Hugh Lovatt has distanced himself from the BDS movement. The principles behind differentiation were spelled out in a 2015 paper that he wrote, along with his colleague Mattia Toalda. According to that paper, “the genesis, goals and policies that flow from differentiation contrast sharply with those of BDS. One is premised on the deeper integration of Israel with Europe, the other on its isolation.” Lovatt’s stance is pretty much identical to that of the European Union. By rejecting the boycott of Israel, he is toeing the establishment line. He is refusing to accept an appeal by an oppressed people. Even worse, he is implying that he knows better than them. On paper, the differentiation policy is meant to hold Israel accountable for settlements. But it actually does the reverse. While the EU takes no meaningful action to halt Israel’s colonization of the West Bank, the bloc continues to deepen its ties with the state that is building the settlements. Israel is essentially being rewarded for the very crimes the EU claims to oppose. Independent? It is tempting to ignore Lovatt and “experts” like him completely. But I believe it is necessary to question what they are doing. The European Council on Foreign Relations is not supposed to be a governmental agency, although its name gives the impression that it is. Officially, it claims to carry out “independent research.” The think tank nonetheless receives funding from the European Union, NATO and from Thales and Airbus, two weapons makers that have undertaken joint projects with Israel’s war industry. I contacted Lovatt by email, asking if he could point me to a case where he had been trenchant in his criticism of the EU or the arms trade. He did not reply. Far from being trenchant, Lovatt has actually whitewashed the EU’s complicity in Israel’s crimes. He has given his seal of approval to Horizon 2020, an EU scientific research program involving Israel. For Lovatt, the scheme is acceptable because it is conditional on no grants being given to activities undertaken within Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Lovatt has evidently not taken account of how Israeli government bodies are exempt from those conditions. The result is that Israel’s science ministry is a significant beneficiary of Horizon 2020, despite how it is headquartered in East Jerusalem. By having such a narrow focus, Lovatt has also overlooked how other bodies taking part in the occupation of the West Bank soak up EU science grants. They include Israel’s public security ministry – responsible for a police and prison system which subjects Palestinians to torture and abuse – and its defense ministry. Farcical If Lovatt was really committed to “independent research,” he would not seek to flatter diplomats and governments the way that he does. In a recent tweet, he praised Emanuele Giaufret, the EU’s ambassador in Tel Aviv, for signing an “excellent” opinion piece in The Jerusalem Post. Great to see this excellent op-ed by the EU's ambassador to Israel @EGiaufretEU setting the record straight on the labelling guidelines and #EUDifferentiation between Israel and the settlements.

Lovatt was, therefore, lauding an attempt to smooth any Israeli feathers that were ruffled by the court’s verdict. A truly independent observer would expose the double standards of the powerful. Lovatt instead has a tendency to take what the powerful state at face value. In another recent tweet, he commended the Dutch government for issuing a letter in support of the EU court ruling on labeling settlement goods.

Contrary to the impression given by Lovatt, the idea that the Netherlands is being tough with Israel is simply farcical. Who do Lovatt and his colleagues serve? In its entry to the EU’s “transparency register,” the European Council on Foreign Relations states it “does not engage in the direct representation of interests.” The use of the word “direct” is instructive. It suggests that the European Council on Foreign Relations is lobbying on behalf of its funders in a subtle and stealthy way. That would be in keeping with what think tanks financed by big business and major institutions generally do.

EU support for Israel’s police and prison system elicits no criticism from corporate-funded think tanks. Shadi Hatem APA images I had a simple reason for deciding to write and speak out about the European Union’s relationship with Israel more than a decade ago: Nobody else was doing it. Soon it transpired that I was just partly right. Some “experts” on this subject can be found in think tanks and academia. Occasionally, they are invited to appear on the mainstream media. But mostly the target audience for their work seems to be other experts. Like a clique, the experts have their own language – a language with which the rest of us are unfamiliar. One of their favorite words is “normative.” I found myself listening to a couple of these experts during a recent conference in London (thankfully, the event also featured some genuine human rights campaigners). The conference introduced me to the work of Hugh Lovatt from the European Council on Foreign Relations. He has carved out a niche for himself as the leading authority on “differentiation.” As far as I can see, “differentiation” means that the EU should draw a distinction between Israel and the territories it has occupied since 1967 – the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), Gaza and the Golan Heights. Flawed Lovatt’s analysis rests on a fact that should be obvious but which needs to be constantly repeated: Israel’s settlement activities are illegal and governments around the world are obligated not to assist Israel’s illegal conduct. The concept of “differentiation” is nonetheless inherently flawed. For a start, it implies there are two Israels: one a vibrant democracy that may be caressed and cuddled; the other a perpetrator of war crimes that Western liberals should shun.

News article:
Last month's decision by the European Court of Justice which insisted on the labelling of Israeli goods produced on the illegal settlements in occupied Palestine, has been denounced as an attack on the Jewish people, by a member of the Israeli government. The astonishing rebuke, which implied that the legal decision was anti-Semitic, was directed at the European Union's top court, by former Israeli minister and senior Likud figure, Gideon Sa'ar, during the Israel Allies Foundation conference in Jerusalem this morning. In the meeting attended by several legislators from various parts of the world, Sa'ar denounced the court for not "acting legally" and accused them of conveying a "lack of moral clarity." His accusations, however, are at odds with international law, as the EU's top court affirmed through last month's judgement. Under international law, settlements are illegal, as is the transfer of civilian population to an illegally occupied territory. Israel contests this international consensus, however. Amongst its justification for denying Palestinians the rights and provisions granted to Jews in the occupied territory, is its claim that the land it calls Judea and Samaria, was given to the Jewish people by God, almost three millenniums ago. READ: Israel settlers led by Yehuda Glick storm Al-Aqsa compound Sa'ar announced to the participants, consisting mainly of religious figures, that the court's decision "is an attempt to delegitimise the right of the Jewish people to live and build our future in the land of our forefathers." Insisting that the Jewish people cannot be "occupiers" in their own land, " Sa'ar concluded by calling on the EU, and on governments around the world, not to be "blind to the truth" and to "show moral clarity, when it comes to the conflict, and all the issues in the Middle East." Sa'ar's remarks follow a series of controversial moves that critics deem are intended to normalise Israel's colonisation. The latest in this sequence of provocative steps saw the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, upending international norms, by recognising Israel's annexation of Palestinian territory. "Arguments about who is right and who is wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace" Pompeo proclaimed while disposing of the legal framework for determining right from wrong, in such matters. The remarks were widely denounced for relegating Palestine to an extra-legal matter, as though it were a lawless frontier beyond the purview of universally accepted norms of behaviour. This trend has raised concerns that it will accelerate the retreat of a multi-national system, founded on the ideals of a rules-based international order, with respect for human rights and minorities.

This is the reason why Weisler and many other Israeli farmers, started looking for different solutions, developing ties with other markets, including Russia. "90 per cent of our peppers go to Russia, which is not part of the EU. With other products, we are still largely dependent on the European market, and as such, the decision will most probably decrease our ability to market our produce," he explained. In 2018, Israel's exports to Russia stood at more than $675 million with 24 per cent of those, edible products. In comparison, in the first half of 2018, Israeli exports to the EU accounted for $8.1 billion, or 33 per cent of total exports. While it is not clear the degree to which the EU engages with trade with Jewish settlements, estimates are that they only make up one per cent of the total turnover. A Losing Game Israeli farmers are not the sole losers in this situation. Palestinian workers will suffer, as well. "What BDS groups - that claim to fight for the rights of the Palestinians - fail to understand is that instead of hurting Israel, they end up hurting the Palestinians they represent, simply because we employ Palestinian workers," explained Weisler. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Labour, 60 per cent of the Jordan Valley workforce is employed in agriculture in Israeli settlements. "In high season, we are talking about 15 thousand employees that support entire families. If we lose our jobs, they will too, and this will inevitably push them into a severe poverty cycle," he added. We Won't Stop But hardships don't stop Weisler. "We fight [such discriminatory decisions] and the BDS through public diplomacy, and by explaining that the financial peace that we created here is beneficial for all. But, most importantly, we will continue to work the land and produce the best quality products, making them irresistible to consumers," he concluded. The EU has never recognized the West Bank and the Golan Heights, captured from Jordan and Syria respectively during the 1967 war, as part of Israel. Today, the population of the West Bank stands at 3.2 million people - the majority of which are Palestinians. The situation in the Golan Heights is similar. Out of 40 thousand people living there, less than half are Jewish.

The UK Labour Party's leader Jeremy Corbyn has demanded an urgent meeting of the Privy Council over the US killing of Iran's Major General Qasem Soleimani and following the Pentagon's announcement that it will send 3,000 more troops to the Middle East. Mr Corbyn wrote a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, outlining a series of questions that he thinks should be discussed, including measures the UK should take to ensure the safety of its nationals. "Given the serious nature of the issues now faced by our country and indeed the world as a consequence of the US attack, I would welcome a prompt response to this request and stand ready to attend any briefing meeting as soon as arranged," Corbyn wrote. The Labour leader described the attack as an "assassination", calling on the UK government to resist the "belligerent actions" from the US.

News article:
Dominic Raab has insisted Boris Johnson is 'in charge' of the UK's response to rising tensions in the Middle East amid growing criticism over the Prime Minister's decision not to cut short his Caribbean holiday. Mr Johnson arrived back in the UK today after a trip to the private island of Mustique to celebrate the New Year with partner Carrie Symonds. His opponents have attacked him for so far remaining silent over the US's fatal strike on Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, on Friday which has plunged the region into fresh instability. But Mr Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said this morning that he had been 'in constant contact' with the PM in recent days as he called for 'deescalation' in the stand off between the US and Iran. Mr Raab also revealed he spoke to the Iraqi prime minister this morning as well as to the Iraqi president last night and that he intended to reach out to the foreign minister of Iran to call for calm. Responding to suggestions that the PM had 'put his feet up' after winning a majority at the general election last month, Mr Raab said: 'No, that is not right. The Prime Minister is in charge. In fact I have been in constant contact with him over the Christmas break on a whole range of foreign policy issues. 'We were in touch on Friday in relation to the situation in Iraq and the whole government is working very closely together. 'I spoke to the Defence Secretary last night, I talked to the National Security Adviser on Friday and we are very clear on the strategy and we are implementing it. 'He will be back in play tomorrow, in the UK.' Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News why the PM had not come back to the UK early, Mr Raab said: 'He is in charge, as I said, and we have been in regular contact over the Christmas break. 'What really matters here is that the government has got a very clear strategy and message which is that we want to see deescalation, we are going to do everything we can to protect UK diplomatic and military missions and we are going about that business.' Dominic Raab, pictured this morning in central London, has called for 'deescalation' in the stand off between the US and Iran Boris Johnson, pictured in Downing Street on December 19, is yet to comment on the US killing of Iran's top general Qassem Soleimani but Mr Raab said today the PM is 'in charge' of the UK's response People carry the casket of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani upon arrival at Ahvaz International Airport on Sunday. The casket was greeted by chants of 'Death to America' as Iran issued new threats of retaliation Military personnel carry the casket of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in Iran. A tide of mourners packed the streets of the Iranian city of Ahvaz on Sunday to pay respects to top general Soleimani, days after he was killed in a US strike There are fears of all-out war after Iran threatened revenge over the Donald Trump-approved attack in Baghdad, Iraq, on Friday and as the US sent 3,000 extra troops to Kuwait. The Foreign Office has issued strengthened travel advice to Britons across the Middle East including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, while the Navy will begin accompanying UK-flagged ships through the key oil route of the Strait of Hormuz. Meanwhile, military chiefs are understood to have ordered 400 soldiers training local forces in Iraq to scrap their duties to switch to 'force protection' to defend themselves and British diplomats from potential revenge strikes. The Foreign Secretary this morning declined to give his full backing to the US strike that killed Soleimani as he labelled the general a 'regional menace'. But he defended the US's right to act as he said 'we understand the position that the Americans found themselves in'. 'They have a right to exercise self-defence, they have explained the basis on which that is done and we are sympathetic to the situation they found themselves in,' he said. 'But there is a risk with the heightening of tensions and we now seek deescalation and the stabilisation of the situation and a war in fact is in no-one's interest. 'The only people that would gain would be Daesh and the terrorists that would exploit the vacuum.' Mr Trump used Twitter on Saturday night to threaten to hit dozens of targets in Iran 'very fast and very hard' if it retaliates for the killing of Soleimani. Jeremy Corbyn responded to Mr Raab's comments by tweeting: 'Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s declaration of "sympathy" for Trump’s reckless and lawless killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani is craven and dangerous. 'Boris Johnson’s government must oppose this escalation towards another devastating war in the Middle East.' Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who is running to replace Mr Corbyn as Labour leader, attacked Mr Johnson for failing to cut short his holiday. She told Sky's Sophy Ridge: 'We should take responsibility, we are international players, of course, we have other preoccupations, and clearly the Prime Minister has a lot of preoccupations - he's sunning himself drinking vodka martinis somewhere else and not paying attention to this. 'We've had three Cobra meetings where Mark Sedwill, the chief civil servant, has had to chair it because the Prime Minister hasn't been available.' Mr Raab is expected to meet his French and German counterparts early this week before travelling to Washington DC on Thursday for face-to-face talks with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. The meeting, understood to have been arranged ahead of the strike, comes after Mr Pompeo criticised the UK's response. 'Frankly, the Europeans haven't been as helpful as I wish that they could be,' he told Fox News. 'The Brits, the French, the Germans all need to understand that what we did, what the Americans did, saved lives in Europe as well.' Later, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace gave the strongest backing to the US despite urging 'all parties' to de-escalate as he announced the Royal Navy's bolstered plan to protect UK ships and citizens in the region. Trump threatened to hit 52 critical targets in Iran in retaliation if Tehran strikes any American interests in the region, upping the stakes after Iran said it had identified 35 targets for potential strikes Iran is considering its options against America in retaliation for the killing of Quds commander Qassem Soleimeni in Baghdad. The conflict could quickly spiral out of control, dragging in other world powers including Russia, Turkey and China After speaking to his US counterpart Mark Esper on Friday, Mr Wallace said American forces have been 'repeatedly attacked by Iranian-backed militia' in Iraq during 'the last few months'. 'General Soleimani has been at the heart of the use of proxies to undermine neighbouring sovereign nations and target Iran's enemies,' Mr Wallace continued. 'Under international law the United States is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens.' Acting leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey added to criticism of the PM. 'Johnson's silence on Trump's dangerous assassination in Iraq is deafening,' Sir Ed said. 'The Prime Minister must speak out now and make clear Britain will not support the US in repeating the mistake of the Iraq war.' Labour's John McDonnell vowed during an anti-war protest at Downing Street to press Mr Johnson over the attack, which will 'set the Middle East and the globe alight yet again'. 'And it's not good enough for the UK Government just to appeal for a de-escalation, what we expect the UK Government to do is to come out in total and outright condemnation of this act of violence,' the shadow chancellor said.

News article:
Dominic Raab has insisted Boris Johnson is 'in charge' of the UK's response to rising tensions in the Middle East amid growing criticism over the Prime Minister's decision not to cut short his Caribbean holiday. Mr Johnson arrived back in the UK today after a trip to the private island of Mustique to celebrate the New Year with partner Carrie Symonds. His opponents have attacked him for so far remaining silent over the US's fatal strike on Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, on Friday which has plunged the region into fresh instability. But Mr Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said this morning that he had been 'in constant contact' with the PM in recent days as he called for 'deescalation' in the stand off between the US and Iran. Mr Raab also revealed he spoke to the Iraqi prime minister this morning as well as to the Iraqi president last night and that he intended to reach out to the foreign minister of Iran to call for calm. Responding to suggestions that the PM had 'put his feet up' after winning a majority at the general election last month, Mr Raab said: 'No, that is not right. The Prime Minister is in charge. In fact I have been in constant contact with him over the Christmas break on a whole range of foreign policy issues. 'We were in touch on Friday in relation to the situation in Iraq and the whole government is working very closely together. 'I spoke to the Defence Secretary last night, I talked to the National Security Adviser on Friday and we are very clear on the strategy and we are implementing it. 'He will be back in play tomorrow, in the UK.' Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News why the PM had not come back to the UK early, Mr Raab said: 'He is in charge, as I said, and we have been in regular contact over the Christmas break.

News article:
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to return from his luxury holiday in the Caribbean to address the situation in Iran following pressure from the opposition. Top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was assassinated on Friday overnight at Baghdad Airport by a US airstrike, after which Johnson has remained silent, instead deploying foreign minister Dominic Raab to deal with the situation. Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Boris Johnson demanding an emergency meeting on the assassination. He said in a tweet: "I've written to Boris Johnson requesting an urgent Privy Council briefing and answers to questions following the US assassination of Qassem Suleimani." The letter posed a series of questions, including whether or not the UK was informed of the assassination before it went ahead, and if so, what sort of advice did the UK government give to the Trump administration? Corbyn said: "The US assassination of Qasem Soleimani is an extremely serious and dangerous escalation of conflict with global significance. The UK government should urge restraint on the part of both Iran and the US, and stand up to the belligerent actions and rhetoric coming from the US." Read: British navy to escort UK-flagged ships through Strait of Hormuz Boris Johnson was spending parliamentary recess on the luxury private Caribbean island of Mustique, just off the coast of St Vincent and the Grenadines with girlfriend Carrie Symonds. Foreign Minister Dominic Raab told Sky News that the UK were "on the same page" as the US following the attack, and expressed sympathy, saying the US had the right to defend itself. This comes as Iraqi parliament voted to expel all foreign troops from their country, hours after US President Donald Trump sent 3000 additional US soldiers to the region. The Iraqi foreign minister has also lodged a complaint to the United Nations (UN) regarding the assassination of General Soleimani. Trump has threatened to hit Iran "hard and fast" if they retaliate to the US, claiming to be targeting 52 Iranian sites of cultural significance, a tactic deployed by the terror group Daesh, and is considered a war crime by the UN.

News article:
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hit out at opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn over payments the Labour politician received from the Iranian state-funded television station Press TV. Mr Johnson made the comments during a heated back and forth with his Labour counterpart over Britain’s response to escalating tensions between the United States and Iran in the Middle East. Deflecting an accusation from Mr Corbyn that he was unable to stand up to US President Donald Trump in the wake of a Washington-ordered drone strike against Iranian General Qassem Suleimani, the prime minister attacked the Labour leader’s appearance on the Iranian channel. "This is absolute fiction. But what I will say is that the UK will continue to work for de-escalation in the region," Mr Johnson said. "But he should be in absolutely no doubt, and this is of course a leader of the Opposition who famously received £10,000 from the Iranian Press TV” said. "I'm very surprised, at the end of these exchanges, that he is yet to condemn the activities of Qassem Suleimani.” the prime minister added. The Labour leader’s registered interests as an MP show he received £20,000 for appearances he made on Press TV between 2009 and 2012. The Iran-backed channel had its license revoked by the UK regulator in 2012 after it aired the forced confession of Iranian Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari. Mr Corbyn became the leader of the Labour Party in September 2015. Speaking in British parliament following Iran’s retaliation for the killing of Suleimani with ballistic missile strikes against two coalition bases in Iraq, Mr Johnson confirmed that the UK is continuing its work to de-escalate in the stand-off between the US and Iran in Iraq. "As far as we can tell there were no casualties last night sustained by the US and no British personnel were injured in the attacks," the prime minister said. "We are doing everything we can to protect UK interests in the region, with HMS Defender and HMS Montrose operating in an enhanced state of readiness to protect shipping in the Gulf," he added.

"As far as we can tell there were no casualties last night sustained by the US and no British personnel were injured in the attacks," the prime minister said. "We are doing everything we can to protect UK interests in the region, with HMS Defender and HMS Montrose operating in an enhanced state of readiness to protect shipping in the Gulf," he added.

News article:
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hit out at opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn over payments the Labour politician received from the Iranian state-funded television station Press TV. Mr Johnson made the comments during a heated back and forth with his Labour counterpart over Britain’s response to escalating tensions between the United States and Iran in the Middle East. Deflecting an accusation from Mr Corbyn that he was unable to stand up to US President Donald Trump in the wake of a Washington-ordered drone strike against Iranian General Qassem Suleimani, the prime minister attacked the Labour leader’s appearance on the Iranian channel. "This is absolute fiction. But what I will say is that the UK will continue to work for de-escalation in the region," Mr Johnson said. "But he should be in absolutely no doubt, and this is of course a leader of the Opposition who famously received £10,000 from the Iranian Press TV” said. "I'm very surprised, at the end of these exchanges, that he is yet to condemn the activities of Qassem Suleimani.” the prime minister added. The Labour leader’s registered interests as an MP show he received £20,000 for appearances he made on Press TV between 2009 and 2012. The Iran-backed channel had its license revoked by the UK regulator in 2012 after it aired the forced confession of Iranian Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari. Mr Corbyn became the leader of the Labour Party in September 2015. Speaking in British parliament following Iran’s retaliation for the killing of Suleimani with ballistic missile strikes against two coalition bases in Iraq, Mr Johnson confirmed that the UK is continuing its work to de-escalate in the stand-off between the US and Iran in Iraq. "As far as we can tell there were no casualties last night sustained by the US and no British personnel were injured in the attacks," the prime minister said. "We are doing everything we can to protect UK interests in the region, with HMS Defender and HMS Montrose operating in an enhanced state of readiness to protect shipping in the Gulf," he added.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday to end the confrontation with the United States and underlined Britain's commitments to Tehran's nuclear agreement, Downing Street said. Johnson "called for an end to hostilities" and said Britain viewed the 2015 nuclear deal as "the best arrangement currently available to deliver on our goal of stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon", his spokesman said. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said "the time has come" for Britain, Germany, France, Russia and China to follow Washington's lead and abandon the 2015 nuclear agreement, which sets limits on Iran's enrichment levels. Iran began breaking the deal's rules once Trump pulled the US out in 2018, resulting in a new wave of tension. The US launched a drone attack in Iraq last week killing Iran's top military commander. In a 20-minute call, Downing Street said Johnson wanted to "deliver the clear message" to Iran that "there is an urgent need for de-escalation".

LONDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson talked to US President Donald Trump about Iranian missile attacks on Iraqi bases housing coalition forces, his spokesman said on Wednesday. “The PM underlined the importance of de-escalation to avoid further conflict” and “the need for a diplomatic solution” to the crisis, the spokesman told reporters. “Both leaders agreed to stay in touch,” he added. News of the conversation came as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab headed to the United States for talks with his US counterpart Mike Pompeo, and members of Congress. Earlier, Johnson called on Iran not to repeat missile attacks, after last week’s US strike killed one of Tehran’s top commanders, Qasem Soleimani last Friday. Tehran has warned it will hit back harder if Washington responds. But Johnson told parliament: “Iran should not repeat these reckless and dangerous attacks but should instead pursue urgent de-escalation.” At his weekly question and answer session, he defended the US strike, and promised to support the security of people in Iraq. He said that General Soleimani had armed Huthi rebels in Yemen and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and supported Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. Soleimani also supplied improvised explosive devices “to terrorists to kill and maim” UK forces, Johnson told MPs. “That man had the blood of British troops on his hands,” he said. But he rejected suggestions from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn that Soleimani’s killing was illegal under international law. “The issue of legality is not for the UK to determine as it was not our operation,” he said. “But most reasonable people would accept that the United States has a right to protect its bases and personnel.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom Donald Trump has previously called a "friend," disregarded the president's call to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, telling Iran's President Hassan Rouhani that his country remains committed to the international agreement. Johnson spoke to Rouhani on Thursday morning, after a speech by Trump on Wednesday, urging European allies to join the U.S. in its hardline approach to Iran. After Trump's May 2018 decision to withdraw form the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), known commonly as the Iran nuclear deal, the treaty's other signatories – the U.K., the European Union, Germany, France, Russia and China – all criticized the president's action and have remained supportive of the pact. "The Prime Minister underlined the U.K.'s continued commitment to the JCPOA and to ongoing dialogue to avoid nuclear proliferation and reduce tensions," Johnson's office said in an official statement after his call with Rouhani. The statement also noted that the British and Iranian leaders "discussed the situation in the region following the death of Qassem Soleimani and the Prime Minister called for an end to hostilities." Tensions flared between Washington and Tehran over the past week following Trump's controversial decision to carry out a military strike last week to take out Soleimani, a prominent Iranian commander, as he arrived in Iraq for meetings. Iranian leaders quickly vowed "revenge" and on Tuesday carried out missile strikes targeting military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq, which did not result in any casualties. Although analysts and Washington lawmakers have expressed fear of further escalation, Trump and Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif both suggested on Wednesday that their respective countries did not plan to take further action for the time being. During his call with Johnson on Thursday, Rouhani argued that the U.K. and Europe were made safer due to Soleimani's military actions against the militant extremist group Islamic State (or ISIS). "London would not have been safe without [the] devotion of Lieutenant General Qas[s]em Soleimani," the Iranian president told Johnson, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Under the JCPOA, which was signed under the administration of former President Barack Obama, Iran was offered sanctions relief and international investment in exchange for reining in its nuclear program. The United Nations nuclear watchdog monitored Iran's actions, consistently reporting that the Persian Gulf nation remained in compliance with the treaty. But Trump had long criticized Obama and the deal, deciding to withdraw from the accord and reimplement sanctions against the country in May 2018. That decision was condemned by the European signatories as well as Russia and China, as they noted that the agreement had been working to curb Iran's undesired behavior. Iran continued to remain in compliance with its obligations until May 2019, a year after Trump withdrew. It then began taking steps back from its commitments over the past few months. Following the killing of Soleimani last Friday, Iran announced on Sunday that it would no longer abide by the international agreement. However, Iran said that it would remain open to returning to its obligations if all the other signatories–including the U.S–also abided by the deal.

Britain’s House of Commons has given final approval to the bill authorizing the country’s departure from the European Union, paving the way for Brexit at the end of the month. Lawmakers vote 330-231 to pass the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill. It will become law once it is approved by Parliament’s upper chamber, the House of Lords, which does not have the power to overturn decisions of the elected Commons. The bill’s Commons passage is a victory for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has vowed that Britain will leave the EU on the scheduled date of January 31. The comfortable majority won in last month’s election by Johnson’s Conservatives ended years of political deadlock over Brexit and allowed the bill to be approved despite opposition from smaller parties. — AP

News article:
LONDON: Boris Johnson has called for an end to hostilities in the Gulf in a phone conversation with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. The Prime Minister also said he remained committed to the nuclear deal with Tehran, despite US President Donald Trump’s call for the UK to break away from the arrangement. During the 20-minute call, Johnson also urged an end to the “detention and mistreatment” of jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals held by Tehran, and demanded their immediate release. Downing Street said the Prime Minister “underlined the UK’s continued commitment” to the troubled nuclear deal in the conversation. On Wednesday, Trump said the “time has come” for Britain, Germany, France, Russia and China to “break away” from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — the US president has already pulled out of the agreement which was aimed at easing sanctions in exchange for Iran not pursuing a nuclear weapon. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The JCPOA is the best arrangement currently available to deliver upon our goal of stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon.” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who held talks in Washington with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acknowledged that Iran’s breaches of the JCPOA were becoming “acute”. “We want to see Iran come back to full compliance and we will be looking at all measures including potentially triggering the DRM (the deal’s dispute resolution mechanism),” he said. Johnson’s call with Rouhani came as tensions appeared to have eased following Tehran’s retaliation against the US over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani. The Downing Street spokesman said: “They discussed the situation in the region following the death of Qassem Soleimani and the Prime Minister called for an end to hostilities.” In the Commons on Wednesday, Johnson said Gen Soleimani, who was killed by a US drone strike on January 3, “had the blood of British troops on his hands” because he had “supplied improvised explosive devices to terrorists”. Following a missile barrage aimed at military bases in Iraq hosting US forces and troops from allies including the UK, Trump suggested Tehran was “standing down” — signalling that the two sides were stepping back from the brink of war.

News article:
The special relationship between the US and UK has taken a battering lately. Following the UK defence secretary's comments that Britain would not automatically back the US in future wars, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on President Donald Trump to "dial down" his conflict with Iran in a reprimanding tone. Speaking to the BBC this morning in a live interview inside his Downing Street residence, Johnson said "Let me be very clear. I don't want a military conflict between us, the United States and Iran." His comment "let's dial this down" coming as Trump assumed a boastful and aggressive stance towards Iran, has been seen as an attempt to mock the US president. This wouldn't be the first time though that Johnson has been seen to be mocking Trump. He was filmed with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's President Emmanuel Macron mockingly discussing Trump's behaviour at the NATO summit in December. READ: UK's Johnson urges Trump to de-escalate Iran situation While Mayor of London he ridiculed Trump's comments about the Muslim ban saying: "I think Donald Trump is clearly out of his mind if he thinks that's a sensible way to proceed, to ban people going to the United States in that way, or to any country." Johnson also dismissed Trump's suggestion that there were "no go areas" in London in a mocking tone. "I think he's betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of President of the United States," he said. After appearing to mock Trump during the BBC interview, Johnson said: "President Trump is a great deal maker," before adding "by his own account, and many others." The latest escalation in violence was summed up by the prime minister as the result of American concerns over the Iran nuclear deal. "Let's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead," said Johnson after pointing out that the current deal was made by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. Some British commentators have been surprised by the tone of the Number 10 at a time when the UK is about to leave the EU and needs the US more than ever. The White House is unlikely to have appreciated Johnson's rebuke of Trump after the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Reacting to Trump's threat to strike Iranian cultural sites Johnson said that it would be against "international conventions". READ: Minister says UK must reduce military dependence on US

News article:
LONDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday he would favor replacing the Iranian nuclear deal with an accord that Washington could support. Johnson's proposal for a "Trump deal" that would tackle Tehran's aggressive foreign policy in the Middle East came just hours before Britain, France and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism against Iran for violating the 2015 accord. "If we are going to get rid of it (the nuclear deal), let's replace it and let's replace it with the Trump deal," the prime minister told BBC television in an interview. "I think that would be a great way forward," he said, without giving further details on this would entail. It is vital #Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon. Today, the UK, France and Germany have initiated the dispute resolution mechanism in response to Iran breaking its commitments in the JCPOA nuclear deal. We want to bring Iran back into full compliance and preserve the deal. https://t.co/ptaqGXVerH — Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) January 14, 2020 Foreign minister Dominic Raab told parliament that while Johnson's remarks did not represent a policy shift Britain was willing to work with the US and European partners to build a broader initiative which would address not just Iran's nuclear ambitions but its destabilising activity in the region. "We believe, as of now, that the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) is the best available deal for restraining Iran's nuclear ambitions and we want Iran to come back into full compliance," Raab told parliament. "Equally .... the prime minister, the United States and our European partners are fully open to a broader initiative which would address not just the nuclear concerns but the broader concerns around the destabilising activity that we've seen recently." The US said on Tuesday that it supported the Europeans lodging of the complaint. European powers have been trying to salvage the JCPOA following the 2018 decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out. But Tehran has wound down its compliance since then, prompting the three European parties to the deal to trigger a provision intended to hold Iran to account. Britain, France and Germany said in a letter to the European Union's foreign policy chief Tuesday they had no choice but to trigger the deal's “dispute mechanism,” given Iran's ongoing transgressions. The three said they rejected Tehran's argument that Iran was justified in violating the deal because the United States broke the agreement by pulling out unilaterally in 2018. "We have therefore been left with no choice, given Iran’s actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments,'' the countries said in a joint statement. The JCPOA has a provision that allows a party to claim significant non-compliance by another party before a joint commission. If the issue is not resolved by the commission, it then goes to an advisory board and eventually to the UN Security Council, which could reimpose sanctions. Iran's foreign ministry warned of a "serious and strong response" to the European move. "If the Europeans... seek to abuse (this process), they must also be prepared to accept the consequences," it said. Raab said Britain, the US and European powers had discussed at the G7 summit in Biarritz last year the possibility of a "broader deal" that had Washington's support. "It's not just President Trump but also President Macron (of France) who have argued for a broader deal with Iran," he said. Trump last week called on signatories to the JCPOA to withdraw from the agreement, and Johnson said he understood Washington's concerns. "From the American perspective it's a flawed agreement, it expires, plus it was negotiated by (former) President Obama," the premier said. "President Trump is a great deal-maker - by his own account and many others. Let's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead." Johnson's comments come after the a further diplomatic fallout between Iran and the UK over the arrest of the British ambassador Rob Macaire in Tehran on Saturday. Britain summoned the Iranian ambassador to London on Monday in protest and sought assurances that it would not happen again and that embassy staff would be safe. “The arrest of our Ambassador to Iran was a flagrant violation of international law and it is important that Iran understands how seriously we take this matter," Middle East minister Andrew Murrison said. Iran claimed Macaire had been attending an illegal protest, but the ambassador said he had merely gone along to a vigil for victims of a Ukrainian plane shot down by the Iranian military. The incident killed 176 people. “We reiterate the importance of a full and transparent investigation into Ukraine International Airlines flight 752," Murrison said. "The loss of life in the crash was a tragedy and we express our condolences to the people of Iran as they grieve those who died.” *With AFP and Reuters

We want to bring Iran back into full compliance and preserve the deal. https://t.co/ptaqGXVerH — Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) January 14, 2020 Foreign minister Dominic Raab told parliament that while Johnson's remarks did not represent a policy shift Britain was willing to work with the US and European partners to build a broader initiative which would address not just Iran's nuclear ambitions but its destabilising activity in the region. "We believe, as of now, that the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) is the best available deal for restraining Iran's nuclear ambitions and we want Iran to come back into full compliance," Raab told parliament. "Equally .... the prime minister, the United States and our European partners are fully open to a broader initiative which would address not just the nuclear concerns but the broader concerns around the destabilising activity that we've seen recently." The US said on Tuesday that it supported the Europeans lodging of the complaint. European powers have been trying to salvage the JCPOA following the 2018 decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out. But Tehran has wound down its compliance since then, prompting the three European parties to the deal to trigger a provision intended to hold Iran to account. Britain, France and Germany said in a letter to the European Union's foreign policy chief Tuesday they had no choice but to trigger the deal's “dispute mechanism,” given Iran's ongoing transgressions. The three said they rejected Tehran's argument that Iran was justified in violating the deal because the United States broke the agreement by pulling out unilaterally in 2018. "We have therefore been left with no choice, given Iran’s actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments,'' the countries said in a joint statement. The JCPOA has a provision that allows a party to claim significant non-compliance by another party before a joint commission. If the issue is not resolved by the commission, it then goes to an advisory board and eventually to the UN Security Council, which could reimpose sanctions. Iran's foreign ministry warned of a "serious and strong response" to the European move. "If the Europeans... seek to abuse (this process), they must also be prepared to accept the consequences," it said. Raab said Britain, the US and European powers had discussed at the G7 summit in Biarritz last year the possibility of a "broader deal" that had Washington's support. "It's not just President Trump but also President Macron (of France) who have argued for a broader deal with Iran," he said. Trump last week called on signatories to the JCPOA to withdraw from the agreement, and Johnson said he understood Washington's concerns. "From the American perspective it's a flawed agreement, it expires, plus it was negotiated by (former) President Obama," the premier said. "President Trump is a great deal-maker - by his own account and many others. Let's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead." Johnson's comments come after the a further diplomatic fallout between Iran and the UK over the arrest of the British ambassador Rob Macaire in Tehran on Saturday. Britain summoned the Iranian ambassador to London on Monday in protest and sought assurances that it would not happen again and that embassy staff would be safe. “The arrest of our Ambassador to Iran was a flagrant violation of international law and it is important that Iran understands how seriously we take this matter," Middle East minister Andrew Murrison said. Iran claimed Macaire had been attending an illegal protest, but the ambassador said he had merely gone along to a vigil for victims of a Ukrainian plane shot down by the Iranian military. The incident killed 176 people. “We reiterate the importance of a full and transparent investigation into Ukraine International Airlines flight 752," Murrison said. "The loss of life in the crash was a tragedy and we express our condolences to the people of Iran as they grieve those who died.” *With AFP and Reuters

News article:
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under mounting pressure to side with President Trump as the United Kingdom’s diplomatic dispute with Iran escalates after the detention of London’s ambassador to Tehran. Backbench members of Parliament called for a tougher British response to Tehran after the Foreign Office responded to the detention by summoning Iran’s ambassador for an official dressing down. Johnson said he remains committed to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal despite growing demands from the United States that it be abandoned. The moves in London came two days after Rob Macaire, the British ambassador to Tehran, was held for several hours while protests erupted across Iran on Saturday at the shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner. He said he attended a vigil for victims of flight 752, including British nationals, but left after five minutes when it erupted into an anti-government protest. He was arrested 30 minutes later, according to his tweet. Thanks for the many goodwill messages. Can confirm I wasn’t taking part in any demonstrations! Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy. Normal to want to pay respects- some of victims were British. I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting. — Rob Macaire (@HMATehran) January 12, 2020 Speaking as British ministers updated MPs on the latest developments, Bob Blackman, a Conservative backbencher, called for tougher action. He said: “Is it not time that we sent a very strong signal by proscribing the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps], freezing their assets and saying we'll unfreeze them, we'll give you an opportunity once you restore proper, normal, diplomatic actions and behaviors across the world?” His words came amid increasing demands from the U.S. that the U.K. abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in order to increase pressure on Tehran. Last week, Trump blamed the agreement for allowing Iran to finance terror operations around the world, calling on signatories to recognize the damage it had done. It puts Johnson at a European crossroads as he attempts to negotiate a trade deal with Trump and plot a post-Brexit course just as Trump signals a more muscular stance with a drone strike that killed Iran’s most feared military leader. But, during the weekend, Johnson joined with Angela Merkel of Germany and Emmanuel Macron of France to reiterate their commitment to the deal. “Today, our message is clear: We remain committed to the JCPOA and to preserving it; we urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the agreement and return to full compliance; we call on Iran to refrain from further violent action or proliferation; and we remain ready to engage with Iran on this agenda in order to preserve the stability of the region,” they said. Fred Fleitz, a former National Security Council chief of staff under Trump, said persuading Johnson was crucial to getting other allies in line. “There have been signs for some time that the British realize that the time is up for the nuclear deal because of a series of provocations by the Iranians during the past year, how they’ve been breaking their commitments,” he said. “The only thing that keeps them in this is that they don’t like the president, that they are liberal elitists, and they don’t want to side with President Trump.” A senior European diplomat in the Middle East said the preferred method remained using the JCPOA’s dispute resolution mechanism to drag Iran back in line. “Those in favor of a harder line were not helped by Trump’s comments, which implied any measures taken under the deal would be construed as walking away when actually they would be intended to save the deal and pressure Iran to return to compliance within its mechanisms,” he said.

* Johnson says Trump can replace nuclear deal * Johnson: Trump is a great deal maker * Johnson: let's work together to replace the nuclear deal (Adds quotes, background) By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday called on U.S. President Donald Trump to replace the Iranian nuclear deal with his own new agreement to ensure that the Islamic Republic did not get an atomic weapon. "If we're going to get rid of it, let's replace it and let's replace it with the Trump deal," Johnson said of the 2015 nuclear arms control deal with Tehran. "That would be a great way forward." "President Trump is a great deal maker, by his own account. Let's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead," Johnson told the BBC. Under the deal brokered in 2015, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to restrict its nuclear program. But in 2018, Trump pulled out of the deal. European powers have repeatedly said they still support the deal though Tehran announced earlier this month it would abandon limitations on enriching uranium, a further blow to the deal. "If you get rid of this nuclear deal, the JCPOA, it's what Trump wants. My point to our American friends is, look, somehow or other you've got to stop the Iranians acquiring a nuclear weapon," Johnson said. "From the American perspective, it's a flawed agreement, it expires, plus it was negotiated by President (Barack) Obama. From their point of view it has many, many faults." Trump is confident he could still renegotiate a new nuclear deal with Tehran, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said earlier this month after Iran announced it would retreat further from the 2015 nuclear pact. "I don't want a military conflict between us, the United States and Iran, let's dial this thing down," Johnson said.

News article:
President Trump on Tuesday night said he agreed with the suggestion to replace the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal with a new pact negotiated by his own administration. “Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, @BorisJohnson, stated, ‘We should replace the Iran deal with the Trump deal.’ I agree!” the president tweeted. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, @BorisJohnson, stated, “We should replace the Iran deal with the Trump deal.” I agree! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2020 Prime Minister Boris Johnson in an interview with the BBC on Tuesday made the suggestion after emphasizing the need to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. He noted that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal, was enacted to do just that. Trump announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the deal in May 2018. “Well, if we’re going to get rid of it, let’s replace it,” Johnson said in the interview. “Let’s replace it with the ‘Trump deal.’ “ It’s not clear what a “Trump deal” would entail, or if Trump even views the idea as serious. But it comes amid international concerns over the spiraling tensions between Washington and Tehran, which reached a fever pitch earlier in January after Trump approved a drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, leader of the elite Quds Force. Soleimani’s killing was met with retaliation from Iran, which shortly afterward launched missile strikes at a military base in Iraq housing U.S. troops. No fatalities were reported in the immediate aftermath, but it was later revealed that Tehran inadvertently shot down a commercial airline flight during the attack, killing all passengers on board. The downing of the plane, and the government’s stalled admission that it was to blame, has sparked anti-government protests in Iran over the past several days. Trump himself has defended the killing of Soleimani, whom he referred to as a “son of a bitch” during a rally in Wisconsin earlier on Tuesday night, even as he has drawn condemnation from other countries. Trump used much of his time at the rally to tout his foreign policy in the Middle East, during which he also praised the Iranian protesters and slammed former President Obama’s decision to sign on to the Iran deal. The president has said in the past that he would meet with his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, though a planned meeting between the two leaders at the United Nations last fall unraveled at the last minute.

No fatalities were reported in the immediate aftermath, but it was later revealed that Tehran inadvertently shot down a commercial airline flight during the attack, killing all passengers on board. The downing of the plane, and the government’s stalled admission that it was to blame, has sparked anti-government protests in Iran over the past several days. Trump himself has defended the killing of Soleimani, whom he referred to as a “son of a bitch” during a rally in Wisconsin earlier on Tuesday night, even as he has drawn condemnation from other countries. Trump used much of his time at the rally to tout his foreign policy in the Middle East, during which he also praised the Iranian protesters and slammed former President Obama’s decision to sign on to the Iran deal. The president has said in the past that he would meet with his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, though a planned meeting between the two leaders at the United Nations last fall unraveled at the last minute.

News article:
President Trump on Tuesday night said he agreed with the suggestion to replace the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal with a new pact negotiated by his own administration. “Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, @BorisJohnson, stated, ‘We should replace the Iran deal with the Trump deal.’ I agree!” the president tweeted. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, @BorisJohnson, stated, “We should replace the Iran deal with the Trump deal.” I agree! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2020 Prime Minister Boris Johnson in an interview with the BBC on Tuesday made the suggestion after emphasizing the need to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. He noted that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal, was enacted to do just that. Trump announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the deal in May 2018. “Well, if we’re going to get rid of it, let’s replace it,” Johnson said in the interview. “Let’s replace it with the ‘Trump deal.’ “ It’s not clear what a “Trump deal” would entail, or if Trump even views the idea as serious. But it comes amid international concerns over the spiraling tensions between Washington and Tehran, which reached a fever pitch earlier in January after Trump approved a drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, leader of the elite Quds Force. Soleimani’s killing was met with retaliation from Iran, which shortly afterward launched missile strikes at a military base in Iraq housing U.S. troops. No fatalities were reported in the immediate aftermath, but it was later revealed that Tehran inadvertently shot down a commercial airline flight during the attack, killing all passengers on board.

News article:
President Trump late Tuesday tweeted his support for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's idea to scrap the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and replaced it with a new proposal designed and negotiated by the Trump administration. BORIS JOHNSON SAYS TRUMP SHOULD DESIGN HIS OWN NUKE DEAL Trump was likely referring to an interview that the United Kingdom leader had with the BBC on Monday where he called his U.S. counterpart "a great deal maker, by his own account and others," and expressed a willingness to let Trump take the lead on the matter. "If we're going to get rid of it, let's replace it and let's replace it with the Trump deal," Johnson said. Trump tweeted late Tuesday the quote from the interview and the line, “I agree!” The U.S. pulled out from the Obama-era agreement in 2018. Trump devoted much of his time while running for office mocking the international agreement for being too soft on the Iranian regime. Trump took a major gamble earlier this month when he approved the drone killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iran’s immediate response to fire missiles at bases holding U.S. troops in the region was considered by many to be contained. There were no reports of casualties. But some Middle East experts warn that Tehran and some of its proxies may still be planning a more meaningful retaliation. The Trump administration has said it is not focused on regime change in the country, but—at least for the time—appears to be in a powerful negotiating position with Tehran. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was at Stanford University on Monday and said the administration’s goal is to one day see Iran “behave like a normal nation. Just be like Norway,” he said, according to the New York Times. Fox News' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report

News article:
A former aide to US President Donald Trump, Richard Goldberg, has warned British PM Boris Johnson that if the UK wants a free trade agreement with the US, then he’ll need to follow Washington and not Brussels on foreign policy. In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, Iran hawk Richard Goldberg – who recently stepped down from his role on the National Security Council following his part in ramping up US tensions with Tehran – ostensibly issued Johnson a veiled threat. Goldberg suggested that Johnson think long and hard about the UK’s position on the Iran nuclear deal and foreign policy more generally. He insisted that in post-Brexit Britain, it’s “less important what Brussels thinks and far more important what Washington thinks.” It’s absolutely in his interest and the people of Britain’s interest to join with President Trump and the United States, to realign your foreign policy away from Brussels, and to join the maximum pressure campaign to keep us all safe. Goldberg’s comments have been widely panned on social media, with many interpreting his words as an ultimatum, rather than a “choice” being presented to PM Johnson. Green MP Caroline Lucas claimed that it was “clear” that if the UK is to secure a trade deal with the US then “we’d have to follow Trump’s dangerous foreign policies.” We've not even left the EU yet and it's already clear that if we want a US trade deal, the US administration will try to force us to accept their food standards & drug prices, and we'd have to follow Trump's dangerous foreign policies https://t.co/iv5vg6AHkG — Caroline Lucas (@CarolineLucas) January 15, 2020 Others online insisted Trump’s former aide was in reality proposing that the UK becomes “a US vassal state & to fall in line on Iran, Israel” and the Middle East. While another angrily tweeted: “So much for Take Back Control.” #r4today Richard Goldberg goes from White House's Iran director to Freedom Foundation & draws a clear link between Johnson's falling in behind Trump policy, and a UK-US trade deal after Brexit. UK clearly expected to be a US vassal state & to fall in line on Iran, Israel, M East. — susannah tarbush (@starbie99) January 15, 2020 Rich Goldberg (who he?) tells us Brexit Britain MUST now align itself with the US both economically AND politically, ie adopt US 'foreign policy' #r4today#Iran So much for Take Back Control. Thanks, Rich. Thanks BBC. — Clapton Blues (@garyfoskett) January 15, 2020 On Tuesday, Johnson signaled that he was falling in line behind the US president and would seek to tear up the current Iran deal and replace it with a ‘Trump deal’. “Let’s work together to replace the JCPOA and get the ‘Trump deal’ instead,” Johnson told BBC Breakfast.

News article:
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has revealed that Donald Trump threatened punitive auto tariffs if Europe kept backing the Iran nuclear deal. She also said a post-Brexit UK would align closer to Washington than Brussels. German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was in London on Thursday for talks with her British counterpart, Ben Wallace. Issues such as Brexit, collective military missions and Iran were high on the agenda. Iran nuclear deal The ministers discussed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), the agreement negotiated by Germany, Great Britain and France (E3), along with the United States, China and Russia, which was designed to stymie the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. The deal, though, is hanging by a thread, and has been growing ever weaker since US President Donald Trump announced the decision to withdraw from the landmark agreement in May 2018. Iran is pushing the E3 to break from the US if the nations are serious about maintaining the JCPOA. Kramp-Karrenbauer said she hoped that the UK would continue to work with Germany and France in the context of NATO and the E3 group. Trump threat France and Germany are currently wrestling with President Trump to deal with the Iran crisis. Germany will not support Trump's "course of maximum pressure" against Iran, said Kramp-Karrenbauer. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had called for the nuclear deal negotiated by the E3 to be replaced by a new US-led treaty. Kramp-Karrenbauer said Trump had threatened to impose punitive tariffs on car imports if Germany, France and Great Britain continued to support the Iran nuclear deal. Germany's defense minister backed up a report in The Washington Post that the US would impose a 25% levy as she told reporters: "This expression or threat, as you will, does exist." Explainer: The European narrative To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Brexit The question of how the EU and Great Britain want to work together in terms of security policy after Brexit was also discussed by Kramp-Karrenbauer and Wallace. With the UK set to leave the bloc on January 31, the German defense minister expects the UK to form closer ties with the US, particularly in terms of security. She suggested Britain wanted to take "a very independent position" that "relies on traditionally good and close relations with the United States." On Thursday evening, Kramp-Karrenbauer will give a speech on Brexit and Europe at the London School of Economics. jsi/rt (AFP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

News article:
Brexit Talks with Brussels May Fall Through, But Who's There to Catch the UK? Mr Johnson's comments highlight a resurgence in the US-UK 'special relationship', which peaked in 1946 under former PM Winston Churchill during World War II and continued with Bush-Blair military adventurism in Iraq and Afghanistan. Boris Johnson's support for a Trump deal continues this tradition via a common objective - a major trade deal with the US, which remains a key component of London's post-Brexit economic strategy. President Trump had congratulated Johnson on his December general election success, stating that the US would be "free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT", directly competing with UK-EU trade talks across the Channel. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 13, 2019 European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen hinted in early January that a deal before the Brexit deadline of December 2020 deadline would be 'impossible', echoed by Johnson's comments in a BBC interview that such a deal would be "epically likely" not to happen. Such economic constraints could see the UK leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms, meaning that tariffs and massive bureaucracy could plague the UK economy at the start of January 2021. This may entice UK officials to deepen ties to the US as a backup plan amid failed talks with the EU, for short-term gain, but will turn the UK into a dependency of the US. The UK-US Special Relationship, in Dollars and Pence A June 2019 report from multinational professional services firm Ernst and Young (EY) found that such a trade deal would be a "key determinant of the UK’s success post-Brexit". According to figures from the report, the US was the UK's largest single nation export market, with 13 percent of goods and 24 percent of services, or £84bn, going to Washington. The US was the "single largest investor" in the UK totalling £351bn in 2017, or 26 percent of foreign direct investment (FDI), EY added. London's reciprocal investment in the US totalled 13 percent of total FDI in the US - America's largest investor. — Ambassador Johnson (@USAmbUK) January 13, 2020 EY added: [Our] UK Attractiveness Survey found that businesses see a trade deal with the US as the top priority, with 73% of respondents identifying the US as one of the countries that the UK should prioritise in trade negotiations. EY’s 2019 UK Attractiveness Survey demonstrated a greater resilience of US investors, compared to investors from other regions, to the current political and economic uncertainties in the UK. But while choosing an independent post-Brexit path to diversify investment would seem to be a more sustainable long-term strategy, London appears to have fallen back on the familiar path of allowing the US to dictate its economic, political and foreign policy for short-term benefit, with regional allies facilitating this. British Oil Pipe(line) Dreams And the Iran Deal Framework A UK government report also explained that the UK has been losing natural gas production capacity while increasing its demand and imports of liquid natural gas (LNG), further complicating issues for energy suppliers. Boris Johnson's pivot to Washington could potentially satisfy two preconditions for a major trade deal with the US: allowing the United States to sell its expensive LNG to the UK and deterring Iranian oil firms from selling its own reserves, potentially the largest in the world via the South Pars 11 fields. But the US is still the biggest winner in this by racketeering the UK's energy security and controlling who London can trade with, namely those already in the US geopolitical orbit along the North Sea, in addition to the UK being pressured from receiving future reserves shared amongst the EU27 set to earn new inflows from the nearly complete Nord Stream II pipeline.

News article:
UK Finance Minister Sajid Javid has said Downing Street will impose a 2 percent sales duty on tech giants like Facebook and Google in April, even as the country hopes to hammer out a new free trade deal with the United States following Brexit and despite a threat of tit-for-tat retaliation made at the Davos summit on Wednesday, 22 January by Washington. “It’s important — as we said at the time when we first introduced it to parliament and legislated for it — it is a proportionate tax,” said Javid. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the government’s “strong preference” was for an internationally agreed-upon tax, but it was taking “too long to address”. On the issue of a similar tax, France recently backed down, agreeing to postpone its introduction pending negotiations between President Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump, after being threatened with retaliatory tariffs on wine and cheese. When questioned at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Washington’s response in the event that Britain moves ahead with its tax, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US would consider imposing tariffs on UK car exports. Mnuchin argued that the UK-proposed tax was discriminatory because it would mainly hit US companies. “If people just want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we’ll consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies,” CNN quoted Mnuchin as saying. The official added, in a more conciliatory tone: “We’re going to have some private conversations. I’m sure this will be worked out, if not at our level then between the prime minister and the president who have an excellent relationship.” Mnuchin dangles auto tariffs as a weapon to deal w/ digital taxes "We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature... if people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies" — Saleha Mohsin (@SalehaMohsin) January 22, 2020 ​Higher tariffs on cars made in the United Kingdom would be a blow to an industry that has been hard hit by Brexit uncertainty, with auto production declining for 17 of the past 18 months, according to the UK Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. According to the SMMT, nearly 20 percent of UK car exports are to the United States. On the issue of trade, Sajid Javid had also emphasised that the government’s “first priority” was reaching a trade deal with the EU rather than the US, with a government source cited by The Times as clarifying that the Chancellor was referring to there being a “hard” deadline of securing a trade deal with the EU by 31 December. Steven Mnuchin responded: “We are very much looking forward to a new trade agreement this year with the UK — it’s a big priority for us… We thought we’d go first. The [EU] might be a little harder to deal with than we are.” Donald Trump said in Davos that Boris Johnson would “come out great” from trade negotiations with Brussels, adding that the prime minister has “a lot of guts”. Huawei Access Britain’s decision on Huawei, which has long been a key provider to the British telecom sector, is expected to be taken at a meeting of the National Security Council next week, and risks rendering UK-US relations more fraught. Washington has said that giving the green light to China’s Huawei for building “non-core” parts of Britain’s 5G network would be “madness”, as it threatened to limit intelligence-sharing with Britain.

"They will do their damnedest to sabotage it. They've moved from ‘remain’ to ‘rejoin’. So they want to be called re-joiners. You'd think after the December election they'd be begging for forgiveness. But instead, they want to re-join the EU", Freddy Vachha, a UKIP national campaign manager, said. The bill overcame resistance from pro-EU elements in both chambers of the British parliament to gain the royal assent last week. This was made possible by the ruling Conservative party's landslide victory in December's election. The UK is set to formally exit the EU on Friday, triggering an 11-month transition period in which the two will try to negotiate an amicable trade deal. EU officials have cast doubt on whether such a pact is possible within months, despite otherwise optimistic sounds from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But Vachha argued that no transitional period would suffice if enough people in the civil service, including many in both chambers of parliament, were determined to "make Brexit fail".

News article:
In a recent UN Security Council vote on extending cross-border aid to Syria, Britain aligned with the United States and abstained in a rare split with its European partners that could herald others to come after Brexit. Some diplomats played down the January 10 vote by pointing out that while there can be coordination in such negotiations, the vote ultimately remains above all a national political decision. But others drew clear conclusions on the unusual position adopted by London during the vote on Syria, which was co-authored by Germany and Belgium and backed by France and Estonia. "The United Kingdom is gaining independence," a UN official speaking on condition of anonymity told AFP. "In negotiations, this may not change too much. But when it comes to votes, whether or not to use a veto, it will weigh," said the source. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, London wields veto power equal to Paris, Washington, Moscow and Beijing. With Britain's exit from the EU on January 31, "the United Kingdom will no longer be bound by European positions," the official said. "With the United States, the United Kingdom risks playing the same role as China, which often acts in support of Russia." The rapprochement between President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will also come into play, several diplomats at the UN headquarters predicted. What is certain is that Brexit will see Britain leave all European coordination meetings which are held regularly in New York. Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union provides that its members in the UN Security Council "shall consult together" and "defend" the interests of the bloc. Instructions are still awaited from Brussels on the procedures to be followed from February 1. European members of the council, however, expect London to continue "genuine cooperation" with them during the transition period, and they would reciprocate. For common positions, this will likely be on a "case by case" basis, according to several diplomats who said they hope Britain retains a "willingness to continue to work together" with the EU on various concerns such as Iran or North Korea. So far, Paris, Berlin and London have maintained a united front against the US decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iranian nuclear agreement. In recent months, the three have also been in lockstep on North Korea, calling for UN Security Council meetings after each ballistic missile test by Pyongyang and jointly demanding the maintenance of international sanctions. At the Security Council, France has more at risk than others with Britain's departure from the European Union. Faced with an often unpredictable US administration, London and Paris could present a united European front in three-way negotiations. But in future, France could find itself in a minority vis-a-vis its two partners. Through the rotation of council's non-permanent members, France could also find itself as the only EU member among the 15 participants in 2022 if Albania succeeds Estonia and Ireland is not elected next June. No comments were forthcoming from the British diplomatic mission to the UN on the future positioning of London in the Security Council or in the UN General Assembly. Will London move closer to the CANZ group (Canada, Australian and New Zealand), all members of the Commonwealth? Or go it alone like Russia, China and Japan do? In this case, Britain "risks being pulled into the American orbit," the UN official believes. And among the practical and immediate consequences of Brexit, London will have to strengthen its diplomatic mission in New York since it will no longer be represented in multiple UN meetings by the European mission. prh/mtp/jm/dw

LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom leaves the European Union at 2300 GMT on Friday but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has a bulging to do list for what he has cast as a “new dawn” for the country. Below are the biggest issues he has to deal with. TRADE As soon as the United Kingdom formally leaves the EU on Jan. 31 it can start negotiating trade deals with other countries. The European Union - which accounts for about half of the United Kingdom’s trade - along with the United States are the government’s top priority for securing new trade deals. A sticking point in U.S. talks will be a British proposal for a unilateral digital services tax, despite a U.S. threat to levy retaliatory tariffs on British-made autos. ‘DIS-UNITED KINGDOM’ Brexit strained the bonds which tie the United Kingdom together: England and Wales voted to leave the EU but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.

China has also cautioned the United Kingdom for what it says is meddling in Hong Kong - its former colony. ‘ECONOMY, STUPID’ Ahead of the December election, Johnson said he would spend more on the National Health Service, infrastructure and ensure prosperity across the United Kingdom. In translation, that means more borrowing: more UK government bonds sold.

News article:
The European Union lost one of its stars on Friday night as Britain left the bloc to strike out as a sovereign, independent state. This spurred the British anti-Brexit campaign group Led by Donkeys to laser-display one of the 12 gold stars of the EU flag on the cliffs of the southern coastal town of Dover with a message to keep the symbol safe until Britain one day returns to the continental grouping. On the prospect of this happening, no one can predict the future; the economist John Kenneth Galbraith once quipped that the only point of forecasting was to make astrology look reliable. Meanwhile, the government in London is looking to shape the country’s destiny from a much different perspective. From its viewpoint, the new autonomy enjoyed by the UK will mean securing trade deals that are better suited to the structure of the country's economy. It will mean faster, more clear-cut policymaking. It will grant more scope for independent, effective diplomacy. Importantly, the UK will no longer operate under the shadow of encroachment on its national strategic interests. This means the behemoth that is the financial centre in the City of London will offer its traditional advantages unfettered by excessive regulation. It is tempting to see, as the critics of Brexit do, this decision as a leap into a dark place where the forces of nationalism are stirring. But that would be to disregard the assurances coming from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government that a modernisation project is in the works to make the country work better for all its citizens. So what are the prospects of remoulding Britain as a best-in-class international player? The UK has left the European Union but there can still be alignment on some issues and policies. AFP A key test will be a forthcoming overhaul of the country’s sanctions policy. While the transition period of leaving the EU is in place until the end of 2020, this will be a gradualist endeavour. According to a notice issued by the UK treasury, British companies and other entities will continue to comply with the EU’s sanctions policies throughout the year. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab used a speech to foreign correspondents in London last week to touch on this point. Lawyers specialising in this area expect human rights-related sanctions to be unilaterally imposed under what is called the "Magnitsky amendment" to Britain’s most recent sanctions act as soon as March. Compliance with the British sanctions regime will be distinct from that of the EU, which could affect licences to operate in one place but not in another. But sanctions policy is an important issue because it will measure how closely aligned Britain is with its European neighbours. Brussels, Paris and Berlin can hug Britain tight and ensure London has little incentive to drift further away. A more nimble national decision-making process should be faster at imposing sanctions and tweaking its policies for strategic effect. And Europe could end up following the British lead in many instances. Last week, Mr Raab was at pains to showcase how the country had remained close to France and Germany with regard to its Iran policy. While the British Foreign Office maintains that keeping the 2015 deal restricting Iran’s nuclear programme is a must, there has already been some political divergence. Britain has not joined the policy of maximum pressure on Iran. However, Mr Johnson has thrown his weight behind a “Trump deal” with Iran that addresses the gamut of international concerns over Tehran’s policies. Key questions are now crowding in on the British government machine. Mr Raab was also on stage during the week with the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. As I watched the two men in close proximity, it was clear that the US and UK still have the relationship where they can finish each others sentences. However, the content changes between the first speaker and the second. The US has the superpower sway and is capable of maintaining its principles-based lines on Iran’s role as the “biggest state-sponsor of global terror”. So far London chooses to take a more managerial approach. The 2015 deal is the only game in town, according to Mr Raab. As long as the hardliners hold sway in Tehran, Mr Raab judges that the Trump deal is only a one-sided offer. Officials have in the meantime announced a raft of negotiations with the UK’s biggest trade partners. But the same vivid dilemma will confront the country: does it have the heft to impose its negotiating lines? The UK must be pragmatic in its dealings with the world. Finance, for example, is an area where it can be more cavalier, elsewhere not so much. Aligning with Europe in matters of sanctions and security will be a no-brainer. The US meanwhile could be boosted by importing British fin-tech expertise. As for services, they are so ill-defined within the framework of world trade that both a good and a bad deal could be on the table. Manufacturing exports should be tariff-free. Much else is essentially bald men fighting over a comb. There is much uncertainty to come in the weeks and months after Brexit. Trade talks are likely to hog the headlines and the country’s diplomatic positions are up for grabs. In all this, what is now visible is the US charm offensive. The UK should take advantage of it.

The European Union lost one of its stars on Friday night as Britain left the bloc to strike out as a sovereign, independent state. This spurred the British anti-Brexit campaign group Led by Donkeys to laser-display one of the 12 gold stars of the EU flag on the cliffs of the southern coastal town of Dover with a message to keep the symbol safe until Britain one day returns to the continental grouping. On the prospect of this happening, no one can predict the future; the economist John Kenneth Galbraith once quipped that the only point of forecasting was to make astrology look reliable. Meanwhile, the government in London is looking to shape the country’s destiny from a much different perspective. From its viewpoint, the new autonomy enjoyed by the UK will mean securing trade deals that are better suited to the structure of the country's economy. It will mean faster, more clear-cut policymaking. It will grant more scope for independent, effective diplomacy. Importantly, the UK will no longer operate under the shadow of encroachment on its national strategic interests. This means the behemoth that is the financial centre in the City of London will offer its traditional advantages unfettered by excessive regulation. It is tempting to see, as the critics of Brexit do, this decision as a leap into a dark place where the forces of nationalism are stirring. But that would be to disregard the assurances coming from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government that a modernisation project is in the works to make the country work better for all its citizens. So what are the prospects of remoulding Britain as a best-in-class international player? The UK has left the European Union but there can still be alignment on some issues and policies. AFP A key test will be a forthcoming overhaul of the country’s sanctions policy. While the transition period of leaving the EU is in place until the end of 2020, this will be a gradualist endeavour. According to a notice issued by the UK treasury, British companies and other entities will continue to comply with the EU’s sanctions policies throughout the year. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab used a speech to foreign correspondents in London last week to touch on this point. Lawyers specialising in this area expect human rights-related sanctions to be unilaterally imposed under what is called the "Magnitsky amendment" to Britain’s most recent sanctions act as soon as March. Compliance with the British sanctions regime will be distinct from that of the EU, which could affect licences to operate in one place but not in another. But sanctions policy is an important issue because it will measure how closely aligned Britain is with its European neighbours. Brussels, Paris and Berlin can hug Britain tight and ensure London has little incentive to drift further away. A more nimble national decision-making process should be faster at imposing sanctions and tweaking its policies for strategic effect. And Europe could end up following the British lead in many instances. Last week, Mr Raab was at pains to showcase how the country had remained close to France and Germany with regard to its Iran policy. While the British Foreign Office maintains that keeping the 2015 deal restricting Iran’s nuclear programme is a must, there has already been some political divergence. Britain has not joined the policy of maximum pressure on Iran. However, Mr Johnson has thrown his weight behind a “Trump deal” with Iran that addresses the gamut of international concerns over Tehran’s policies. Key questions are now crowding in on the British government machine. Mr Raab was also on stage during the week with the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. As I watched the two men in close proximity, it was clear that the US and UK still have the relationship where they can finish each others sentences. However, the content changes between the first speaker and the second. The US has the superpower sway and is capable of maintaining its principles-based lines on Iran’s role as the “biggest state-sponsor of global terror”. So far London chooses to take a more managerial approach. The 2015 deal is the only game in town, according to Mr Raab. As long as the hardliners hold sway in Tehran, Mr Raab judges that the Trump deal is only a one-sided offer. Officials have in the meantime announced a raft of negotiations with the UK’s biggest trade partners. But the same vivid dilemma will confront the country: does it have the heft to impose its negotiating lines? The UK must be pragmatic in its dealings with the world. Finance, for example, is an area where it can be more cavalier, elsewhere not so much. Aligning with Europe in matters of sanctions and security will be a no-brainer. The US meanwhile could be boosted by importing British fin-tech expertise. As for services, they are so ill-defined within the framework of world trade that both a good and a bad deal could be on the table. Manufacturing exports should be tariff-free. Much else is essentially bald men fighting over a comb. There is much uncertainty to come in the weeks and months after Brexit. Trade talks are likely to hog the headlines and the country’s diplomatic positions are up for grabs. In all this, what is now visible is the US charm offensive. The UK should take advantage of it.

News article:
This week sees the biggest shift in British foreign policy in almost 50 years, as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. As an EU member, the UK shaped Europe’s foreign policy, from EU sanctions on Russia to the Iran nuclear deal. The UK wants to stay an influential European foreign policy power. But how can it outside the EU? When European foreign ministers discussed Iran this month the Brits were there; in future they won’t be. The UK can still play a leading role in shaping Europe’s foreign policy after Brexit — but it will need to engage with Europe differently. Up to 2016, British foreign policy was based on three pillars. First, Atlanticism. London routinely aligned with Washington on international issues and acted as a transatlantic bridge, explaining European views to the United States and vice versa. Second is leadership in the EU — specifically, the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Third, multilateralism. As a medium-sized power with global interests, an effective rules-based international order was central to advancing British interests. Each of these pillars is now challenged. First, Brexit takes the UK out of the CFSP. Second, the rules-based international order is being undermined by Russia, China and, to an extent, the U.S. Third, Washington’s transatlantic outlook under the Trump administration has become more nationalistic, transactional and mercantile, with skepticism — sometimes even hostility — toward the EU and NATO. The English Channel and the Atlantic have both widened since 2016. The UK’s traditional diplomatic handling of foreign policy crises — align with Washington and shape the EU response — no longer applies. So how can the UK lead European foreign policy after Brexit? Through four new steps. First, by doing more bilaterally with European counties — especially France and Germany. New summits, dialogues and agreements could be launched. Second, by using meetings of other international groupings to coordinate European foreign policy positions and actions. The so-called “E3” (Germany, France and the UK) works well on Iran — Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson issued a joint statement on Soleimani — and could be expanded to other issues. The Group of Seven (G7) could play a bigger foreign policy role too. Third, as part of this year’s negotiations on the UK’s future trade and security relationship with the EU, London and Brussels could agree to close co-operation on foreign policy. Various new mechanisms are possible. French President Macron has suggested creating a European Security Council including the UK. Alternatively, the UK could occasionally be invited to attend meetings of EU foreign ministers, as John Kerry did as U.S. secretary of State. Joint UK-EU statements could even be considered if the UK and EU wanted to show a united stance – including to Moscow and Beijing – such as after a use of chemical weapons. Fourth, by working closely with the EU in other international organizations, particularly the United Nations. This would also help bolster multilateralism, and show the UK remains globally orientated. Europe should support these steps. In or out of the EU, the UK is a major European political and military power, and one of only two European nuclear states and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. European views will pack more punch globally if the Brits are also on board. Growing transatlantic tensions also mean Brussels, Paris and Berlin should keep London within the European foreign policy orbit instead of seeing it adopt a more Trumpian outlook. Against a geo-political backdrop of transatlantic divisions, Britain’s ability to lead European foreign policy after Brexit will ultimately depend on the strategic posture it chooses to adopt between Europe and the US. In short, will the UK align more with Washington on foreign policy after Brexit? Does the UK see its interests and values remaining European? Or will it adopt a policy of strategic equidistance? Despite Brexit, since the 2016 referendum the UK has supported the EU, not the US, on major transatlantic disagreements — including Iran, trade, climate change and China. Brussels and Washington will look closely at whether this continues or changes. The UK wants trade deals with both.

News article:
As Britain contemplates one of the most important shifts in its foreign policy, it should maintain its security links with Europe, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said. In a report on the importance of the UK’s national interest in policy, the British think tank also said the country should increase its capability for action without the US. “The first priority should be to respond to security threats to the UK homeland, both from competitor states and from non-state actors,” wrote the report’s author, the institute deputy director general Prof Malcolm Chalmers. “Maintaining strong security partnerships with European allies is vital to tackling threats to the UK and its immediate neighbourhood.” Speaking at RUSI's Britain in the World event on Monday, Professor Lawrence Freedman said Britain needed to begin reappraising its place in the world using realism as its starting point. "The government still insists we are outward looking and internationalists in spirit. Rather than what might have been Britain First we have Global Britain," he said, explaining if Britain was to retain its position of international prestige it needed to make a case for its continued importance. British MP Tom Tugendhat, Chair of the House of Common's Foreign Affairs Committee, said changes in EU member states, such as the electoral gains made by Sinn Fein in Ireland, would continue to have profound effects on the UK, despite Brexit. "This change in Europe is going to be a really defining moment for us," he said. The RUSI report goes on to say the UK was unlikely to move into a closer or more subservient position to the US after its exit from Europe. Instead, it said Britain should expect more autonomy from both traditional partners. “A more likely scenario is that the UK is moving towards a situation of regulatory autonomy in relation to both its major partners, rather than a wholesale shift from one to the other,” the report said. It said that, where possible, Britain should “increase its capability for action without the US”. In the run-up to its exit from the EU on January 31, Britain stuck closely to its European partners in its response to the Iran nuclear crisis. Britain, France and Germany have urged Tehran to resume compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal despite Washington’s abandonment of the agreement. But British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has welcomed US President Donald Trump’s plan for peace in the Middle East more emphatically than have other European leaders. At the same time, Britain and the US have clashed bitterly over the UK’s decision to allow Chinese company Huawei limited access to run its new 5G network, against Mr Trump’s wishes.

FILE PHOTO: French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian leaves the Elysee Palace following the weekly cabinet meeting in Paris, France, October 21, 2019. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo PARIS (Reuters) - France will be watching carefully for any sign of unfair competition from Britain if it goes ahead with plans to set up freeports after Brexit, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Tuesday. Britain formally left the EU on Jan. 31 but remains subject to EU laws and regulations during a transition period due to last until the end of this year. The British government said on Sunday it planned to announce the location of up to 10 post-Brexit freeports, or free trade zones, by the end of this year with the hope that they can begin operating in 2021. “We will be extremely vigilant to prevent any form of unfair competition (from the freeports), whatever the matter, and if we need time to negotiate, we will take it”, Le Drian told the French parliament in response to a lawmaker’s question. Freeports are areas where imported goods can be held or processed free of customs duties before being exported again. They can also be used to import raw materials and make finished goods for export. Le Drian said France would work closely with the European Commission on the matter. Britain wants to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period but the negotiations are expected to be tough and complex.

News article:
Boris Johnson has called off plans for a spring visit to the United States to see Donald Trump amid ongoing transatlantic tensions that threatens to overshadow trade talks, it was reported today. The Prime Minister is said to have originally planned to visit Washington last month following his election victory, before moving the trip to February. But now the plans for a visit are said to have been shelved and the two men will not meet face-to-face until a G7 summit at Camp David in Maryland in June. Washington and London are at loggerheads over issues including Mr Johnson's decision to allow Chinese tech giant Huawei to have a role in the UK's 5G phone network. They have also clashed over Washington's refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the alleged CIA agent accused of killing British teenager Harry Dunn in a Northamptonshire road accident. Although the cancellation was not intended as a snub to the US president, it may be seen that way in Washington ahead of trade deal talks both sides want to complete as soon as possibly. The Prime Minister (today in Downing Street) is said to have originally planned to visit Washington last month following his election victory, before moving the trip to February But now the plans for a visit are said to have been shelved and the two men will not meet face-to-face until a G7 summit at Camp David in Maryland in June No 10 insists that Mr Johnson cancelled the trip to concentrate on domestic politics and his new team of ministers. A source referenced the all-seeing villain in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, telling the Sun: 'When the Eye of Sauron is off the Whitehall machine, things stop working. 'That is why he has stripped down all his foreign travel this year to get his agenda done.' Downing Street said this afternoon that Mr Johnson is 'currently focused on the UK domestic agenda and... levelling up for the British people'. Last week it was claimed Mr Johnson endured a phone call with an 'apoplectic' Donald Trump following the decision to approve a deal with Huawei. The Prime Minister spoke to the US President last week soon after he announced that the Chinese manufacturer would be allowed to work on the UK's next-generation 5G mobile phone network – despite strong opposition from the US. A source briefed on the phone call told the Financial Times that Mr Trump was 'apoplectic' with Mr Johnson. A second official confirmed the call between the pair was 'very difficult'. Last night US prosecutors accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and helping Iran track protesters in its latest indictment against the Chinese company, escalating Washington's battle with the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker. In the indictment, Huawei Technologies Co was charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from six US technology companies and to violate a racketeering law typically used to combat organized crime. It also contains new allegations about the company's involvement in countries subject to sanctions. Among other accusations, it says Huawei installed surveillance equipment in Iran that was used to monitor, identify, and detain protesters during the 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Tehran. The United States has been waging a campaign against Huawei, which it has warned could spy on customers for Beijing. Washington placed the company on a trade blacklist last year, citing national security concerns. Harry Dunn, 19, was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car outside a US military base in the UK in August last year Boris Johnson again stood up to Washington on Wednesday by claiming the UK's extradition arrangements with the US are 'imbalanced' and suggesting they need to be reviewed. But the Prime Minister insisted his treaty concerns had nothing to do with a growing Transatlantic clash over UK demands for the extradition of Harry Dunn's alleged killer, Anne Sacoolas. It came as the slain Briton's family accused the Foreign Office (FCO) of being 'engaged in a cover-up' over the teenage motorcyclist's death. The FCO has said it has 'no plans' to launch a public inquiry despite reports that Ms Sacoolas had worked as a spy for the CIA. Nineteen-year-old Mr Dunn was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car outside a US military base in Northamptonshire on August 27 last year. Ms Sacoolas, 42, the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, was granted diplomatic immunity following the crash and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international controversy. She was charged with causing Mr Dunn's death by dangerous driving in December. But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected an extradition request from the UK for her last month.

News article:
TEHRAN: Iran’s constitutional watchdog has barred thousands of people from running in next month’s parliamentary elections, including 90 current lawmakers, most of whom are accused of corruption. The Guardian Council, a body of senior clerics and legal experts, vets candidates for office as well as legislation, and rules out individuals if it believes their views or behavior are incompatible with the theocratic system. Half its members are appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A spokesman for the Guardian Council was quoted by the hard-line Kayhan paper as saying most of the lawmakers were rejected for “financial problems,” a reference to fraud and embezzlement. The spokesman, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, said more than 14,000 people registered to run in December. Of those, just 5,000 qualified, he said. Of the 290 current members of Parliament, 247 registered to run for re-election. Those rejected can appeal the decision in the coming days. The reformist newspaper Etemad said on Tuesday that most of those rejected were reformist and moderate candidates. It said that as a result the elections will essentially be an “internal vote” among hard-liners. Hard-liners were also disqualified, but it’s not clear how many. The elections will test the popularity of the pro-reform bloc led by President Hassan Rouhani. They have championed improved ties with the West and expanded social freedoms, but have suffered major setbacks since President Donald Trump assumed office. Iran regularly holds presidential and parliamentary elections, but they are closely supervised by the clerical establishment, and the supreme leader has the final say on all major policies.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks during a session of parliament in Tehran, Iran, December 8, 2019. Official President website/Handout via REUTERS Tehran - Asharq Al-Awsat Leaders of Iran's reformist parties criticized the country’s hardliner Guardian Council for disqualifying many well-known reformist candidates from the upcoming February 21 parliamentary elections. Guardian Council Spokesperson Abbas Ali Kadkhodai insisted that some 90 out of the 290 MPs cannot run in upcoming elections. This is a dramatic change compared with the previous round of polls in 2016 when all of the 30 MPs from Tehran were on the reformists’ lists and reform minded candidates also won in other major cities such as Mashad and Isfahan. The Guardian Council has rejected appeals by President Hassan Rouhani and Majles Speaker Ali Larijani to reconsider the vetting. The Council has accused both leaders of "not being well-informed" about the affairs of the state. Last week, Rouhani criticized it for disqualifying reformist and moderate candidates saying that "all of those whose qualifications are endorsed by the Guardian Council come from the same faction: the hardliners." Rouhani’s pressuring of the Council came after Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stressed in the last Friday sermon the necessity of high turnout in the elections, at a time Iran is subject to unprecedented economic and political pressure from the United States. Likewise, at the open session of the Majles on Monday Larijani questioned the validity of vetting by the Guardian Council saying that he was surprised to see current and former MPs being disqualified on charges of financial and ethical corruption. Some candidates said the Council has disqualified all the lawmakers who had supported the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The claim about supporting the Rouhani administration or the JCPOA leading to candidates' disqualifications was made by Rouhani's Chief of Staff Mahmoud Vaezi on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

News article:
TEHRAN: Iran’s president warned on Monday of threats to the Islamic republic’s “democracy and national sovereignty”, after a body dominated by his ultra-conservative rivals disqualified thousands of candidates, weeks before elections. President Hassan Rouhani’s moderate conservatives and their reformist allies are locked in a public quarrel with the Guardian Council over the disqualification of thousands of candidates — including 92 sitting MPs. The council, which oversees Iran’s elections, says it has barred some 9,500 potential candidates from standing, almost two thirds of the 14,500 hopefuls. Rouhani, whose alliance fears losing its majority in the February 21 polls, said the disqualifications risked appointments being made “elsewhere” than the ballot box. “The greatest danger for democracy and national sovereignty is the day when elections become a formality,” the government’s website quoted Rouhani as saying in a meeting with provincial governors. “May God never bring this day,” he added. “Let us reassure the people and tell them our system is not a single-party system.” In an apparent reference to ultra-conservatives, he said “they should at least let there be competition and participation”. He called on Iranians of all stripes to vote, “even if... there are shortcomings in elections”. “Sometime I may not want to vote for some reason, but some other time I may not have enough trust to go to the ballot box; this is very dangerous,” he said. Candidates who are disqualified are allowed to appeal before the elections. The polls come after a traumatic month for Iran, in which it approached the brink of war with the United States and mistakenly shot down a passenger jet.

TEHRAN: Iran’s president warned on Monday of threats to the Islamic republic’s “democracy and national sovereignty”, after a body dominated by his ultra-conservative rivals disqualified thousands of candidates, weeks before elections. President Hassan Rouhani’s moderate conservatives and their reformist allies are locked in a public quarrel with the Guardian Council over the disqualification of thousands of candidates — including 92 sitting MPs. The council, which oversees Iran’s elections, says it has barred some 9,500 potential candidates from standing, almost two thirds of the 14,500 hopefuls.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print Maryam Rajavi: Boycotting mullahs’ illegitimate election is a patriotic duty and the nation’s pledge to martyrs of the uprising Written by Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) on 05 February 2020. MARYAM RAJAVI: REGIME’S INTENSIFYING FACTIONAL FEUDING, DEEPENS INTERNAL SCHISM BOYCOTT OF ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY The Iranian regime’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei, grappling with the nightmare of his overthrow subsequent to the recent November and January uprisings, and reeling from irreparable blow he suffered with the elimination of Qassem Soleimani, is poised to institute a unipolar regime. Khamenei wants to consolidate his authority with the formation of a one-faction Parliament to forestall his regime’s inevitable overthrow. After completing an unprecedented purge of parliamentary candidates, Khamenei warned those “who were elected through elections, but undercut elections,” and scolded his rival faction, “How is it that when an election is in your favor, it is correct and definitive, but when not in your favor, it is defective?” Addressing his president, Hassan Rouhani, who on January 27 had described the election as appointments because of the purge of his faction’s candidates, Khamenei said, “When you falsely claim this election has been engineered or is not an election, you discourage the people.” https://twitter.com/iran_policy/status/1222973474794242048 Khamenei added, “The Guardian Council has a standing in the Constitution and is a trustworthy institution. How can one so easily accuse this institution as being biased toward some people?” Khamenei revealed his dread of public apathy and rejection of the election farce and said, “Someone may not like me, but if that person likes Iran, he/she must cast a vote. Thus, anyone who likes Iran and the country’s security, wants to see the problems resolved and wants to see the correct turnover of the elite, should participate in the election.” According to state-run media, the Guardian Council has disqualified 90 of the sitting members of the parliament, some of whom have served three terms. Candidates in 170 districts are from Khamenei’s faction and the main candidates of the rival faction in other districts have been eliminated, such that ultimately 260 seats will go to the faction most aligned with Khamenei and 30 to the so-called moderate factions. The rival faction is warning about widespread boycott of the election and the regime’s “implosion,” describing the Guardian Council’s purges as “a looming danger to the foundation of the Islamic Republic.” It has appealed to Khamenei to allow it to compete in the election in order to increase voter participation. On January 15, Rouhani said, “Do not disturb the people, don’t tell the people that for every parliamentary seat there are 17, 170 or 1,700 candidates. From how many factions? One? This cannot be an election. One cannot run the country with one faction.” Rouhani’s spokesman, Ali Rabiei said on February 3rd, “An indication of resistance to conduct that will implode Iran (regime) is the presence of us all at the ballot box. All of us must be present, whether critics or those who are worried.” The regime is planning wholesale fraud and rigging. Mostafa Mirsalim, affiliated with Khamenei’s faction, has already foretold the participation of “at least 70 percent” of eligible voters. Contradicting the rival faction, on January 27, Rouhani referred to systematic rigging in the election. “In any case, we could not make the election electronic… What is this, someone writes on a ballot, then drops it in a box, someone reads it, another person marks a ledger, it is not known what is read and what is marked. Then after we have recorded all [the ballots], at the very end, when they want to compile all the votes, what kind of funny business will take place… Many elections run into problems during compilation of the ballots.” Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), described the aggravating crisis and schism at the top of the regime over the election charade a manifest reflection of another deadly impasse the regime is facing. She said, the complete purge of the rival faction’s candidates is a clear sign of the ruling religious fascism’s inevitable retrenchment in the face of the surging uprisings and the crisis of overthrow. Mrs. Rajavi emphasized that the Iranian people have cast their true vote in the November 2019 and January 2020 uprisings with chants of “death to the principle of the velayat-e faqih, and death to Khamenei.” They will boycott the mullahs’ illegitimate election more than before. Boycotting this farce is a patriotic duty and the Iranian nation’s pledge to the martyrs of the Iranian people, especially the 1,500 martyrs of the November uprising. It also reflects the demands of the January 2020 uprising of the people and students for the overthrow of the illegitimate ruling theocracy in its entirety. The people and students chanted “death to Khamenei, death to the dictator, death to the principle of the velayat-e faqih, death to the oppressor, be it the shah or the leader,” demonstrating that they want a future devoid of shah and the mullahs, and one based on democracy and people’s sovereignty. https://twitter.com/Maryam_Rajavi/status/1225160037502521346 Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran February 5, 2020

That’s why the Guardian Council, which answers only to Khamenei, has purged parliamentary candidates from the faction of President Hassan Rouhani. When Rouhani described this as an appointment rather than election, Khamenei lashed out, asking how Rouhani dare criticize the Guardian Council and accusing him of destroying people’s trust in the election. In this comment, Khamenei revealed that his greatest fear would be for people to treat this election like the sham it is because a significantly low turnout would be drastically different from the artificially high voter turnout the regime created in previous years. It would show a lack of trust in the regime. But still, even though Rouhani said “One cannot run the country with one faction” and foretold systematic vote-rigging, his underlings have come out to encourage voters. His spokesman Ali Rabiei said all Iranians should come out to the ballot box. While on Khamenei’s side, Mostafa Mirsalim said that they think 70% of voters will show up on election day, a number that would be considered high in an actual democracy. State-run media said that the Guardian Council has disqualified 90 sitting members of parliament, some who have served multiple terms, while candidates in 170 districts are solely from Khamenei’s faction. This could mean that 260 seats will essentially go to Khamenei and 30 to Rouhani.

It was clear that Khamenei meant the regime’s President Hassan Rouhani, who had recently called the appointments a threat to democracy and national sovereignty. Regardless of the threats by the Supreme Leader against the protests of the rival faction, what Khamenei uttered during the meeting clearly signaled his weakness in front of the angry and frustrated people, who are completely against the entire regime, with no difference between any of the factions. Begging for votes Among his remarks about the election, which is the main challenge of the day for the regime, was the invitation to the people to participate in the so-called election, which is highly anticipated: “Someone may not like me, but if he likes Iran, he should come to the ballot box.” The message that any listener receives from these words full of plea and supplication is a clear confession of people’s hatred and disgust against him and his regime. A vicious leader who, with deceit, tried to keep a straight face. A losing leader who begs and urges the people to warm up this repetitive and disgusting so-called election. This despicable request showed how much this regime needs such an act in this situation. A defanged criminal Khamenei, who is better informed than anyone about the slack of regime’s shows such as the “Friday prayers ceremonies”, “so-called elections” to various “marches”, complained that some called “the huge population of millions of people, several thousand people, and the mobility of several hundred people in the streets are named the people of Iran.” And he hypocritically promised that the people would “attend in a large crowd in the squares and streets “at the events of the anniversary of the Iranian revolution in 1979 and the 40th-day mourning ceremony of Qassem Suleimani (the eliminated IRGC Quds Force commander). Khamenei’s appeal to the overt lies of the “millions of people” while he repeated it over and over in the months following the November uprising is ironically indicative of his extremely weak and fragile position. A situation that became more clarified during the uprising of January, with people and students tearing up his photos and that of his warmonger and strategic arm Qassem Suleimani and chanting slogans such as “Suleimani is a murderer, and his Leader is a murderer too” and “Death to Khamenei” and “Death to the lying leader”. In addition to the repetition of the protests in Iran, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Lebanese people, whose countries the mullahs regard as the strategic depth of their regime, is another aspect of this weak and fragile situation, which has forced him to repeat the “million population” in his lectures. Begging for security The vicious leader of the regime like the last days of the traitorous Shah who had confessed that he had “heard the voice of the revolution,” said: “Well, there are plagues in the country, and they knew it too. These sanctions, in addition to the little failures that we do, have created problems for the people and the people have some complaints.” While speaking about the “honor of the regime”, “national power”, “national insight” and “national security,” he immediately demanded: “However, as the election is concerned, as the reputation of the regime is concerned, as the security of the state is on the desk, the people come to the scene, this represents the national determination, national power, and national insight.” Khamenei who did not just cry in fear of the uprising and the security of his regime, surprisingly he remembered the beloved Iran and begged for votes while saying, “Everyone who loves Iran, loves the security of his homeland and the honor of his homeland, and is seeking to solve problems, must attend the ballot box so that the Iranian national determination and power will re-emerge.” Yes, this is the real situation of a blood loving dictator who begs for the votes of the people and the security of his regime at the end of its sovereignty, while knowing well that the oppressed people of Iran have long boycotted any of the regime’s elections. And this time they will ridicule it more than ever. They have decided to permanently cleanse their homeland of the existence of the Velayat-e-Faqih (mullahs’ regime) and these ridiculous shows.

Iranians would choose the Islamic Republic as they did in 1979 if given a choice today, claimed President Hassan Rouhani in a speech on the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. February 11 marks the 41st anniversary of the 1979 revolution which led the current regime to power. Advertisement “If Iranians were to be given a choice today, they would choose the Islamic Republic again just like they did 41 years ago,” Rouhani said on Tuesday in Tehran. “The Islamic revolution was based on a choice, the people chose a religious and democratic regime over a US-dependent and corrupt one,” he said. “Iranians have a choice every year on the anniversary of the revolution to either stay at home or come to the street and pledge allegiance to the regime, and every year, they choose the latter,” Rouhani said. State TV reported that tens of thousands of Iranians had poured into the streets of Tehran and other cities on Tuesday morning to commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Islamic revolution, against a backdrop of escalating tensions with the United States. However, dissidents rejected the claims as overstated and posted videos of empty streets online. Feb 11 - Tehran, #Iran Jomhouri (Republic) Avenue While regime officials are claiming a "million man march" marking the 1979 revolution, video shows merely a few dozen people in the street.#41YearsOfFailure pic.twitter.com/NQlzwFgWEd — Heshmat Alavi (@HeshmatAlavi) February 11, 2020 Regional impact The Islamic Revolution has not only impacted Iran but the region and the whole world, he said, adding that the US and Israel have been Iran’s “biggest enemies” since the 1979 revolution. “America’s mistake is that it thinks it is up against a regime or some politicians, when in reality it is up against 83 million Iranians,” said the Iranian President. Iran almost got into a full-blown conflict with the United States last month after a US drone strike killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on January 3, prompting Iran to retaliate with a missile barrage against a US base in Iraq days later. Rouhani thanked the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for targeting US bases in Iraq last month, claiming that the attacks were demanded by the Iranian people. “I thank the IRGC, the armed forces, and the Basij for listening to the people’s demands and avenging martyr Soleimani by attacking the Ain al-Assad base,” he said. Rouhani described the slain military commander as “a senior and powerful diplomat as well as a military commander,” saying: “Both resistance and diplomacy are required.” “America lies when it says Soleimani was looking for war and instability,” he said, claiming that the former head of the Quds Force brought about stability in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and the whole region. Rouhani also urged Iranians not to boycott the parliamentary elections scheduled for February 21, calling elections the country’s “saviour.” Read also: Timeline: The Iranian revolution and the rise of the Islamic Republic Opinion: Technical setback used to herald 41st anniversary of Islamic Revolution in Iran Fate of jailed Iran protesters remains unknown, families fear death: Report Iran will continue to fund terror abroad despite laundering regulations: Experts

News article:
Rising anti-government fervor, a biting economic crisis, and the absence of free and fair elections are likely to dampen voter turnout in Iran’s upcoming parliamentary elections. Fearing a low turnout in the February 21 vote would harm the legitimacy of the country’s theocratic system, Iranian officials are pulling out all the stops to get the vote out. 'I Beg You' President Hassan Rohani called on voters to get out and vote in the elections despite "possible complaints and criticism.” “I beg you not to be passive,” Rohani, a relative moderate, exhorted the public on February 11. His remarks came after the Guardians Council, which vets all candidates, disqualified some 9,000 of the 14,000 who people who registered to run, including 90 current lawmakers. Iran’s reformists said that 90 percent of its candidates throughout the country have been barred from running. In the 2016 vote, a bloc of reformists and moderate conservatives won 41 percent of the 290 parliamentary seats. Hard-liners won 29 percent and independents took 28 percent. Experts predict hard-liners to dominate the legislature. Ali Rabiei, Rohani's spokesman, offered an even starker message to voters. "The upcoming elections are the most important elections in the history of the Islamic Republic," Rabiei said on February 3. "The only way to prevent the collapse of Iran is by going to the polls." 'Go To Hell' Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for a high turnout and said voting was an act of patriotism. “Any person who has an affinity for Iran and its security must take part in the elections,” Khamenei said in a speech on February 5. “Someone may not like me personally, but if they love Iran, they must go to the ballot box." “The enemies that threaten the country and the people are more frightened of the public’s support than our military capabilities,” Khamenei added. “Yes, they are scared of our missiles, but they are more frightened of the public’s support. Taking part in the elections is a stamp of support for the system from the people, and it will lead to security.” Public anger has mounted amid a crunching economic crisis that has been fueled by biting U.S. sanctions that were reinstated after President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the landmark international agreement that curbed Iran’s controversial nuclear program. When officials announced gasoline rationing and price hikes in November 2019, anti-government protests erupted in more than 100 Iranian cities and turned violent before security forces violently put them down amid an Internet blackout. Amnesty International said more than 300 people were killed and thousands detained in the crackdown. In January, Iran shot down a Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight after it took off from a Tehran airport, killing all 176 people aboard. Iranian authorities initially denied any responsibility for the accident. But three days after the tragedy the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) admitted the plane had been shot down "unintentionally," leading to days of protests in Iranian cities, with demonstrators chanting slogans against Iran’s clerical leadership. Referring to Khamenei, mourners shouted "death to the dictator." Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group (ICG), said Khamenei’s call for people to come out and vote in elections that were even less free than previous votes shows the “disconnect between the state and the society in Iran.” Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, a hard-line ally of Khamenei, went further by suggesting that those who stay away from the polls will receive divine punishment. "Those who do not take part in the elections will go to hell," said Alamolhoda. Public Apathy Gauging public opinion is difficult in Iran, where people can be jailed for their opinions. But there are signs of public apathy towards the vote. A poll conducted by the state-run News Network on the Telegram app on February 5 showed over 78 percent of viewers said they would not take part in the elections. Although the posts were deleted, the poll was repeated with similar results. Days later, the posts were deleted again, and a News Network presenter announced that the channel was fake. Analysts said Iranians who would have voted for pro-reform and moderate candidates could decide not to vote, given the mass purge of reformist candidates by officials. With the election results effectively preordained, analysts said it was unclear even if the conservatives and hard-liners could mobilize their supporters. “What this means is that turnout is more important than who takes the majority of seats in parliament,” said Scott Lucas, an Iran expert at Birmingham University in Britain. “Khamenei tipped off that priority last week when he appealed for a high turnout as a message to Iran's enemies,” he added. “The question is to what extent the regime will massage the turnout figures to get the magic number that it wants to declare victory over those enemies -- both at home and abroad.”

News article:
Iran's week-long parliamentary election campaign started on Thursday, state TV reported, a vote seen as a popularity test for the clerical establishment at a time when relations with Washington are at their worst since the 1979 Islamic revolution.The Guardian Council, which must approve candidates, has rejected around 6,850 moderate or conservative hopefuls in favour of hardliners from among the 14,000 applicants seeking to contest the February 21 vote. About a third of lawmakers have also been barred from standing again."The 7,150 candidates who are running for parliamentary elections have started campaigning on Thursday," state TV reported. Pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani has criticised the disqualifications, but like supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei he has called for a high turnout as the country faces challenges over its disputed nuclear programme.Khamenei, the final authority in Iran's complex system of clerical rule and limited democracy, backed the Guardian Council, saying the next parliament was no place for those scared of speaking out against foreign enemies.Tensions with the United States have spiked since 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed crippling sanctions.The crisis worsened when Iran's most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone in Baghdad in January 3, which led to Iran retaliating against US targets in Iraq on January 8. The vote will have no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran's nuclear policy, which is determined by Khamenei.With the disqualification of moderate and leading conservative figures, hardline loyalists of Khamenei are likely to dominate the parliament.Pro-reform politicians said in January that they had no candidates to stand for 230 of the 290 seats in parliament, saying Iranians' demands for a "free and fair" election were not met because of the large numbers disqualified. The Council has cited various grounds for the rejections, such as "corruption and being unfaithful to Islam".Some 58 million Iranians out of 83 million are eligible to vote. While supporters of the establishment will vote for hardline candidates, moderates are struggling to mobilise their supporters, who are disappointed with Rouhani's failure to ease social and political restrictions.Leading pro-reform parties have been either dismantled or banned since a presidential vote in 2009, in which hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected. His rivals alleged the vote was rigged.In Tehran, which accounts for 30 seats in the assembly, hardline candidates are headed by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former mayor of the capital who once commanded the elite Revolutionary Guards.

News article:
TEHRAN: Iranians vote next week in a crucial parliamentary election that is widely expected to herald the return of conservatives and heap pressure on beleaguered President Hassan Rouhani. Friday´s vote comes after months of steeply escalating tensions between Iran and its decades-old arch enemy the United States. The Guardian Council, the body that rigorously vets candidates, disqualified more than half of the 14,444 who sought to stand — including dozens of mostly moderate and reformist incumbents. A week of campaigning for seats in the Majles kicked off Thursday with little fanfare. Faced with the stark choice of voting for the conservatives and whether or not to vote at all, those who backed Rouhani in the past see this election as a lost cause and are expected to stay away in droves. “The majority of the current parliament is composed of reformists, and people believe that they haven´t done anything serious” since being elected in 2016, said independent journalist Farshad Ghorbanpour. “The Iranian people have come to the conclusion that their choice has no impact,” he told AFP. The purge of candidates was “unprecedented”, said Ghorbanpour. “Even some conservatives who were likely to speak independently and rationally in parliament have been disqualified.” Iranians are feeling the strain after months of turmoil. In November, nationwide demonstrations over petrol price hikes turned violent before being crushed in a deadly crackdown. Bread and butter issues have put Rouhani´s alliance at risk of losing in a landslide. A salesman in Tehran´s Grand Bazaar summed up the mood, saying he would abstain as voting seemed “useless”. Asked what might convince him to change his mind, Mostafa Hamidi, 37, said it would be if those in power lived up to “at least one of their promises. Just one, not 1,000.” Another voter expressed despair over the country´s mismanagement. “The truth is that whenever we have voted, things never improved but got worse,” said Morteza Jaberi, who works in a motorbike repair shop in Tehran´s run-down Molavi neighbourhood. “Our country is very powerful in all fields, but there are people in charge who cannot use this power properly,” the 38-year-old told AFP. Rouhani, a moderate conservative, came to power promising greater social freedoms and the benefits of engagement with the West. But his signature achievement — a 2015 nuclear deal that was meant to give Iran relief from sanctions — is now in tatters. In 2018 US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement that froze Iran´s nuclear programme and began reimposing crippling sanctions. Tehran and Washington have been sworn enemies since 1979. But they have never come as close to a direct confrontation as in the past seven months, when it has happened twice, most recently after the US killed prominent Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on January 3. The “martyrdom” of the hugely popular general provoked an outpouring of grief in Iran. Millions from all walks of life turned out to mourn his death. But that unity suffered a blow after Iran admitted it “accidentally” shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing all 176 people aboard. The disaster, which claimed the lives of many students studying abroad, sparked more protests that turned political. At stake in the February 21 election are 290 seats. The disqualifications can only benefit Rouhani´s conservative rivals whose solid support base always shows up at elections and has been spurred by the tense standoff with the United States. Rouhani has repeatedly railed against the disqualifications, saying they threaten Iran´s democracy. “The greatest danger for democracy and national sovereignty is the day when elections become a formality,” he said last month. In the absence of real opponents, a grand coalition of “principalists” — or conservatives — looks set to win in a landslide. The Majles drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties and approves the budget. But while it has been “increasingly sidelined in the decision-making process”, a swing to hardliners may make Rouhani´s life difficult, said Ellie Geranmayeh, analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations. The vote is also seen as an opportunity to gauge the electorate. “The outcome should give a decent sense of popular opinion — important in a country where quality public opinion polling is rare,” said Henry Rome, Iran analyst at Eurasia Group. “The election will also provide an early indicator of the outlook for the presidential election in mid-2021.” But Rouhani´s coalition was unlikely to survive, he said. “A right-wing parliament will torment Rouhani during his final year in office... complicating the government´s ability to respond to sanctions pressures,” said Rome. “In contrast, if a right-wing president wins in 2021, the parliament can enable that leader to move quickly on new initiatives.”

Many Iranians, battered by economic sanctions, political turmoil and the lingering threat of military conflict, say they are in no mood to vote in general elections this week. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Speaking of heavy hearts and a sense of bitterness, Tehranis complain they are tired of politicians who have failed to keep their word or to raise living standards. 3 View gallery A street in Tehran ( Photo: AFP ) "No way! There's no way we are going to vote!" 62-year-old Pari said under the gaze of her daughter who also intends to boycott the parliamentary polls Friday because she no longer trusts politicians. "It's difficult for everyone in Iran nowadays. We're fed up. We want to send a message that we're not satisfied with the situation," the mother added. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, re-elected in 2017, promised more social and individual freedoms and gave assurances that Iranians would be able to benefit from the fruits of engagement with the West. But many people feel their lives have been crippled by the economic slump and exacerbated by harsh U.S. sanctions since American President Donald Trump in 2018 pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal with Iran. 3 View gallery Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ( Photo: AFP ) Added to this has been the threat of military conflict as Trump has ramped up a campaign of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic republic. Pari and her daughter Kiana were strolling through Tajrish, one of the capital's most exclusive neighborhoods where displays of wealth contrast sharply with extreme poverty. Elegant women in dark glasses steered their SUVs through streets lined with roadside vendors who displayed their wares on the grimy pavement. A shoeshine boy sitting on the curb of the icy sidewalk was narrowly missed by a motorcycle online food delivery rider speeding the wrong way up a traffic-choked street. "There's no work, no future," said Kiana, her jet-black hair falling out from under her headscarf. Above all, she aid, she no longer "trusts the authorities" and is dismayed by their "lack of honesty". The credibility of Iran's leaders took a hit among many when authorities denied last month that Iranian armed forces had mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian airliner, before they came clean days later. Crippled lives At Tehran's Grand Bazaar, beyond the stunning turquoise-blue mosaic entrance, hundreds of people scrambled into the historic market, a labyrinth of alleys and shops underneath stone vaulted ceilings. Browsing for brass dishware, linen bedding, refined carpets and clothes, shoppers elbowed their way through the crowd. Standing at the entrance was Amir Mohtasham, a 38-year-old who has been jobless for two years and who said he worries about the lack of vision of those candidates allowed to stand for elections. "It seems none of the candidates has a plan for anything," he said. 3 View gallery Tehran's Grand Bazaar ( Photo: AFP ) "Neither the conservatives nor the reformists are trustworthy. They only care about votes... Our elections are useless." A short distance away, a 30-year-old carpet merchant, though much better off, voiced similar views. "We voted for Rouhani with a dream, but we didn't achieve anything," Mohammad said, accusing the authorities of spreading "lies". "People no longer have peace of mind," he said. "When the people aren't the ones who decide, why should we vote? If voting is legitimizing, then we won't vote." Other people from conservative or religious backgrounds, however, said they were determined to take part in the election. "I will certainly vote, but I need to think about for whom," said Hassan Ghole, 55, a bazaar salesman. "Our parliamentarians are all trying to do their best but how much they can actually succeed, nobody knows," he said, expressing hope that future lawmakers would work "to solve the problems of youths". 'Voice our protest' In Tehran's poorer southern district of Nazi Abad, a housewife wearing a chador also said she would dutifully cast her ballot. "From the point of view of our religion, it's important to go and vote, especially as our country is surrounded by enemies," she said. "The most important thing for us is to have faith in life and then the economy will be good." ( Video: Reuters ) But in the same neighborhood, youths spoke of their thirst for more freedom in the Islamic republic, which marked its 41st anniversary this month. "Elections have just become symbolic... I don't support this system and won't vote," 20-year-old Kamran Baluchzadeh said, in a rare show of dissent. "I feel hopeless and weak, and I'm even not 25 years old," he said, shivering in below-freezing temperatures. "I feel desperate," he added, citing expenses he can't pay, worries about being unable to find a wife and taking care of his parents. Bags of clothing and a telephone in hand, Pari Aghazadeh is a fashion designer who does not go unnoticed with her slender figure, redone nose, false nails and a thick coat of lipstick. "I honestly don't want to vote, because it won't fix our problems," she said, accusing the government of mismanagement. "This government, this system doesn't care at all about women. We don't have any personal freedoms," she said. At least by boycotting the vote, she said, "we can voice our protest".

"There's no work, no future," said Kiana, her jet-black hair falling out from under her headscarf. Above all, she aid, she no longer "trusts the authorities" and is dismayed by their "lack of honesty". The credibility of Iran's leaders took a hit among many when authorities denied last month that Iranian armed forces had mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian airliner, before they came clean days later. Crippled lives At Tehran's Grand Bazaar, beyond the stunning turquoise-blue mosaic entrance, hundreds of people scrambled into the historic market, a labyrinth of alleys and shops underneath stone vaulted ceilings. Browsing for brass dishware, linen bedding, refined carpets and clothes, shoppers elbowed their way through the crowd. Standing at the entrance was Amir Mohtasham, a 38-year-old who has been jobless for two years and who said he worries about the lack of vision of those candidates allowed to stand for elections. "It seems none of the candidates has a plan for anything," he said. 3 View gallery Tehran's Grand Bazaar ( Photo: AFP ) "Neither the conservatives nor the reformists are trustworthy. They only care about votes... Our elections are useless." A short distance away, a 30-year-old carpet merchant, though much better off, voiced similar views. "We voted for Rouhani with a dream, but we didn't achieve anything," Mohammad said, accusing the authorities of spreading "lies". "People no longer have peace of mind," he said. "When the people aren't the ones who decide, why should we vote? If voting is legitimizing, then we won't vote." Other people from conservative or religious backgrounds, however, said they were determined to take part in the election. "I will certainly vote, but I need to think about for whom," said Hassan Ghole, 55, a bazaar salesman. "Our parliamentarians are all trying to do their best but how much they can actually succeed, nobody knows," he said, expressing hope that future lawmakers would work "to solve the problems of youths". 'Voice our protest' In Tehran's poorer southern district of Nazi Abad, a housewife wearing a chador also said she would dutifully cast her ballot. "From the point of view of our religion, it's important to go and vote, especially as our country is surrounded by enemies," she said. "The most important thing for us is to have faith in life and then the economy will be good." ( Video: Reuters ) But in the same neighborhood, youths spoke of their thirst for more freedom in the Islamic republic, which marked its 41st anniversary this month. "Elections have just become symbolic... I don't support this system and won't vote," 20-year-old Kamran Baluchzadeh said, in a rare show of dissent. "I feel hopeless and weak, and I'm even not 25 years old," he said, shivering in below-freezing temperatures. "I feel desperate," he added, citing expenses he can't pay, worries about being unable to find a wife and taking care of his parents. Bags of clothing and a telephone in hand, Pari Aghazadeh is a fashion designer who does not go unnoticed with her slender figure, redone nose, false nails and a thick coat of lipstick. "I honestly don't want to vote, because it won't fix our problems," she said, accusing the government of mismanagement. "This government, this system doesn't care at all about women. We don't have any personal freedoms," she said. At least by boycotting the vote, she said, "we can voice our protest".

News article:
DUBAI (Reuters) - Hardliners are set to tighten control of Iran this week in a parliamentary election stacked in their favor, as the leadership closes ranks in a deepening confrontation with Washington. Big gains by security hawks would confirm the political demise of the country’s pragmatist politicians, weakened by Washington’s decision to quit a 2015 nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions in a move that stifled rapprochement with the West. More hardliner seats in the Feb. 21 vote may also hand them another prize -- more leeway to campaign for the 2021 contest for president, a job with wide day-to-day control of government. Such wide command of the power apparatus would open an era in which the elite Revolutionary Guards, already omnipresent in the life of the nation, hold ever greater sway in political, social and economic affairs. Allies of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have ensured hardliners dominate the field, removing moderates and leading conservatives and permitting voters a choice mostly between hardline and low-key conservative candidates loyal to him. “Literally, it is not a race anymore. Hardliners want the presidency. This is the end of moderation for at least a decade if not more,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Like hardliners, conservatives back the ruling theocracy, but unlike them support more engagement with the outside world. Faced with little choice, many voters are likely to be focused on bread-and-butter issues, in an economy hurt by U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy toward Iran. With Iran facing growing isolation and threats of conflict over its nuclear standoff with the United States, and growing discontent at home, the turnout is seen as a referendum on the establishment -- a potential risk for the authorities. REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS POWER Many Iranians are furious over the handling of November protests against fuel price hikes which swiftly turned political with demonstrators calling for “regime change”, leading to the bloodiest unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic. A crackdown overseen by the Revolutionary Guards killed hundreds and led to the arrest of thousands, according to human rights organizations. The public is also livid over the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January that killed all 176 people on board, mainly Iranians. After days of denials, Tehran admitted that the Guards were to blame. But Khamenei’s loyalist candidates are backed by core supporters of the establishment who identify in all aspects of life with the Islamic Republic, insiders said. “Their supporters believe in the establishment and they will vote because they see it as a religious duty. Hardliners will benefit from a low turnout,” said the government official. Speaking to Reuters, some authorities predicted a turnout of about 60% for the 290-seat assembly, compared to 62% and 66% respectively in the 2016 and 2012 votes. Some 58 million Iranians out of 83 million are eligible to vote. “Iran is not only Tehran or other major cities where voters are politically motivated. In small cities, towns and generally in rural areas people will vote,” a hardline official said. Slideshow ( 4 images ) With no independent, reliable opinion polls in Iran it is hard to gauge which way the ballot will go, let alone the extent to which Khamenei and the Guards will exert their influence over the vote to cement their grip on power. But pro-reform voters are dismayed by disarray in their camp and the failure of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to abide by an election pledge to ease social and political restrictions. “Many Iranians (who voted for Rouhani) have lost their hope for reforms,” said a reformist former official. “They don’t trust the reform movement anymore. They want change and only change.” A hardline dominated parliament could mount pressure on Rouhani, architect of the nuclear pact, who has been criticized by Khamenei’s influential allies for his performance in power. Slideshow ( 4 images ) “I beg you not to be passive ... I am asking you ... not to turn your back on ballot boxes,” Rouhani said in a speech on Feb. 11. The slate of hardline candidates is dominated by the Guards, who answer directly to Khamenei, and their affiliated Basij militia, insiders and analysts say. Aside from its vast economic holdings, the Guards have grown more politically assertive in recent decades, with increasing numbers of veterans in legislative and executive powers. Former Guards commander Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable from 2008 has benefited from strong support from Khamenei’s son Mojtaba, tops the parliamentary lists of main hardline groups in Tehran. BALANCE OF POWER “We will serve wherever the revolution and our Imam (Khamenei) need us,” said a former Guardsman, who served in the government of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. His re-election in 2009 sparked protests for months against alleged vote-rigging. Parliamentary elections have scant impact on Iran’s foreign or nuclear policies, which are set by Khamenei, and major pro-reform parties have been either banned or dismantled since 2009. But the vote shows shifts in the factional balance of power in Iran’s unique dual system of clerical and republican rule. Mass disqualifications of candidates in 2004 parliamentary polls sidelined reformists for years. It ushered in hardline Ahmadinejad in 2005. In 2016 voters handed gains to centrists and moderates, suggesting many sought more open democracy and wider freedoms. This time, the Guardian Council, a hardline vetting body, has disqualified 6,850 hopefuls out of 14,000, ranging from moderates to conservatives, from contesting parliament polls. About a third of sitting lawmakers have also been barred. “We did what we were supposed to do, now it is your (voters) turn,” said head of the Council Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati. Several politicians including Rouhani strongly criticized the Council’s rejection of over 50% of hopefuls. The watchdog denied any bias. Khamenei, who has the final say in Iran’s complex ruling system, has backed the watchdog, saying parliament has no place for “those scared of speaking out against foreign enemies”.

News article:
TEHRAN: Iran’s supreme leader said Tuesday it is a “religious duty” for people to vote in this week’s general election and strengthen the Islamic republic against the “propaganda” of its enemies. “Participating in elections and voting... is a religious duty, not just a national or revolutionary duty,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech, parts of which were aired on state television. “Elections nullify many of the vicious plots the Americans have in their minds and Zionists have in their hearts against the country,” he said, referring to US ally Israel. Iranians are set to elect a new parliament on Friday, with conservatives expected to make a resurgence. Observers expect a low turnout as many reformist and moderate candidates have been barred from running by the Guardian Council. The council, made up of six clerics appointed by the supreme leader and six lawyers selected by the judiciary, disqualified more than half of the 14,444 hopefuls. The move threatens the thin majority of President Hassan Rouhani’s alliance in parliament. Friday’s election comes after months of domestic turmoil and steeply escalating tensions between Iran and its arch enemy the United States. In November, nationwide demonstrations over petrol price hikes turned violent before being crushed in a deadly crackdown. Tensions with Washington have risen since 2018 when US President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark nuclear agreement and reimposed crippling sanctions. But they have never come as close to a direct confrontation as in the past seven months, when it has happened twice, most recently after the US killed prominent Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on January 3. Iran hit back on January 8 by firing a barrage of missiles at US troops in Iraq.

TEHRAN: Iran’s supreme leader said Tuesday it is a “religious duty” for people to vote in this week’s general election and strengthen the Islamic republic against the “propaganda” of its enemies. “Participating in elections and voting... is a religious duty, not just a national or revolutionary duty,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech, parts of which were aired on state television. “Elections nullify many of the vicious plots the Americans have in their minds and Zionists have in their hearts against the country,” he said, referring to US ally Israel. Iranians are set to elect a new parliament on Friday, with conservatives expected to make a resurgence. Observers expect a low turnout as many reformist and moderate candidates have been barred from running by the Guardian Council. The council, made up of six clerics appointed by the supreme leader and six lawyers selected by the judiciary, disqualified more than half of the 14,444 hopefuls. The move threatens the thin majority of President Hassan Rouhani’s alliance in parliament. Friday’s election comes after months of domestic turmoil and steeply escalating tensions between Iran and its arch enemy the United States. In November, nationwide demonstrations over petrol price hikes turned violent before being crushed in a deadly crackdown. Tensions with Washington have risen since 2018 when US President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark nuclear agreement and reimposed crippling sanctions. But they have never come as close to a direct confrontation as in the past seven months, when it has happened twice, most recently after the US killed prominent Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on January 3. Iran hit back on January 8 by firing a barrage of missiles at US troops in Iraq.

News article:
PARIS: Opponents of Iran’s theocratic leadership are urging an outright boycott of its parliamentary elections, arguing that it is anything but democratic and that casting a ballot serves only to bolster the country’s Islamic rulers. The country’s supreme leader has urged Iranians to “disappoint the enemy” by participating en masse in the vote on Friday, which coincides with one of the most testing periods for the country since the ousting of the pro-US shah in 1979. “Participating in elections and voting ... is a religious duty” that will strengthen the Islamic republic against the “propaganda” of its enemies, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday. Analysts say Iran’s leaders want to see a high turnout to bolster their legitimacy as they battle an economic crisis spurred by crippling American sanctions imposed after Washington abandoned the 2015 deal curtailing Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. The crisis prompted some of the most potent protests since the Revolution and the ferocious crackdown that followed. The elections have been overshadowed by mass disqualifications of over 7,000 mainly moderate and reformist candidates by the Guardian Council oversight body. The council threw out more candidates than it allowed in, including most incumbent MPs. But its spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee said the body was “neutral” in its dealings with all political camps. “The Guardian Council follows the laws and regulations parliament has passed at different times,” Kadkhodaee told a televised news conference. “This time, just like at previous (elections), we have tried to properly follow the law,” he said. “The Council has never had a political view... It approaches political factions with closed eyes. “What it does judge is the evidence in the cases of the candidates and then it only acts in accordance with the law passed by parliament.” In a message from her jail cell, posted on her husband’s Facebook page, Iranian rights activist Narges Mohammadi said a boycott of the elections was the only peaceful means of protest left now that demonstrations are no longer being authorized. “We need to rise up in the most civilized way and launch a strong boycott campaign to respond to the repressive policies of the government,” wrote Mohammadi, who is serving a 10-year sentence for “forming and managing an illegal group.” Opponents outside Iran argue that the government’s pressure on citizens to vote means that anyone who casts their ballot is effectively legitimising the system. Opinion This section contains relevant reference points, placed in (Opinion field) Masih Alinejad, a former journalist who has left the country and leads a campaign against the enforced Islamic headscarf for women, has issued a viral video on social media warning that voting overlooks the memory of those killed in the protests. While officials tell everyone to vote for the sake of the country, “the day after the election, it’s back to normal — the establishment claims the votes gave the Islamic regime legitimacy, and all promises of greater freedoms are forgotten,” she told AFP from New York. “The candidates are pre-selected, no opposition views are tolerated and even the turnout is stage-managed,” she said, adding that instead of voting, people should demand a UN investigation into the November protests. Amnesty International has confirmed the deaths of 300 people in the crackdown that followed those protests, and some estimates are far higher. Iran rejects the reports but has yet to give its own figures. Tehran’s admission that it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner in January, killing all 176 on board, sparked more protests, at the very moment when the authorities were seeking to consolidate national sentiment following the US killing of top commander Qasem Soleimani. Underlining the importance of mass participation, Khamenei said in a speech on February 5 that “the enemies who threaten the country and the nation are more afraid of popular support than our armaments.” Turnout has varied widely in Iranian parliamentary elections over the past decades, but has generally been recorded at more than 50 percent and sometimes topping 60 percent — a figure the authorities will want to see repeated on Friday. While the leadership should be able to count on a reasonable turnout from supporters of conservatives and in more rural areas, it is not certain how many will vote in bigger cities such as Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz and even the holy city of Mashhad, said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The question mark is over the bigger urban cities,” she told AFP. In any case, conservatives — or “principalists,” who are themselves split between different factions — will likely dominate the next parliament after the disqualification of reformists, which risks putting off many voters. “The scale of disqualifications and what many see as a lack of competitive choice for the Iranian electorate may result in much lower voter participation in the urban areas relative to the last election,” Geranmayeh said. On the other hand, “supporters of the principalists are expected to turn out and vote. We should not underestimate their numbers. They have also been galvanized by recent events including the killing of Soleimani,” she said.

News article:
Leader calls for massive election turnout to frustrate US Iran Press TV Tuesday, 18 February 2020 9:48 AM Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says the upcoming parliamentary elections in Iran are taking place at a critical time of US pressure and attempts to drive a wedge between the Iranian nation and government, calling for a large turnout in the polls to foil Washington's "evil intentions." Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with thousands of people from Iran's East Azarbaijan Province in Tehran on Tuesday, marking the anniversary of the Tabriz uprising of February 18, 1978. The Leader called elections a contributor to the strength of the country and said the US formed think tanks of dozens or hundreds of people to plan to alienate the Iranian people and the youth in particular from the government. He referred to the massive turnout of the people on the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution last Tuesday and in processions to honor Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani earlier, and said, "The same thing should happen in the elections, meaning that the enemies should see for themselves that, in spite of their persistence in attempting to drive a wedge between the people and the establishment, people receive the elections well, which is reason for pride for the Islamic establishment." "Elections neutralize many of the evil intentions that the Americans and the Zionists (Israelis) have in mind against Iran," Ayatollah Khamenei said. "These elections are the response to the chicanery and deception of Iran's enemies." Ayatollah Khamenei said friends and foes alike were watching the elections. "Enemies want to know what all of their attempts, the economic difficulties that exist in the country, the perfidy of the Westerners and the Europeans (in the Iran deal matter) toward Iran, and all the pressures – the maximum pressure, as they call it themselves – have finally done to the Iranian people," the Leader said. "Our friends all over the world, too, are watching with concern to see what happens." Iran's 11th parliamentary elections will be held on February 21, 2020. The date will also feature interim elections for Iran's Assembly of Experts, which elects and oversees the activities of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution. Last week, millions of Iranians from all walks of life filled the streets across the country to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. The nation-wide rallies came one month after Iranians held million-strong funeral processions in many cities for General Soleimani, who was assassinated by the US in Iraq on January 3. 'First-class idiots going all out speaking gibberish again' Ayatollah Khamenei said the "first-class idiots in the US are once again lining up to say some nonsense about" Iran. "Partially, what they say is to affect the [turnout in the] elections... to make people despair of the ballot box," the Leader said. "The nonsense they speak is also partially to make up for their ineffectiveness," he added, referring to how the regional tide had turned against America after the assassination of General Soleimani. "The Americans wanted our dear martyr (General Soleimani), who had a very deep impact on the region, to be taken out so that they could prevail. Things turned out the opposite way." Brian Hook, who has been the US's so-called special representative for Iran, claimed on January 17 that the Iranians would "have little to say" in the elections, which he called a "sham." Last week, American news and opinion website The Daily Beast reported that Hook held meetings with an associate of the anti-Iran terrorist Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) in September 2019 and January this year, before and after General Soleimani's assassination. 'Iran a thousand times stronger' Ayatollah Khamenei said the US did all in its power – in military, political, security, economic, cultural, and media terms – over the past 40 years to topple the Iranian establishment. Not only did America fail in those attempts, the Leader said, but it also saw the Iranian establishment grow "a thousand times" stronger. The Leader said the US was the most indebted country in the world – with 22 trillion dollars in national debt – and was merely making itself up to look good. 'America will sink' Ayatollah Khamenei pointed to the story of the British giant passenger ship RMS Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912, and said, "Just as the splendor of the famous ship Titanic did not stop it from sinking, attempts to make up America's appearance do not stop it from sinking, either, and America will sink." The Leader said Iran was opposed to no nation or race but only to arrogance and tyranny. "America has dozens of [military] bases in the countries around ours, but if something happens one day, these bases will be of use neither to America nor to those who give their money to it... because American arrogance is collapsing."

News article:
TEHRAN, Iran (AFP) — Iran’s electoral watchdog on Wednesday defended its decision to disqualify thousands of candidates for a crucial parliamentary election in two days, as a lackluster campaign neared its end. Conservatives are expected to make an overwhelming resurgence in Friday’s vote, which comes after months of steeply escalating tensions between Iran and its decades-old arch foe the United States. Their gains would be made at the expense of those who back President Hassan Rouhani, a relatively moderate conservative who was re-elected in 2017 promising people more freedoms and the benefits of engagement with the West. But many people in Iran feel their lives have been crippled by an economic slump exacerbated by harsh US sanctions since President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a landmark nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic in 2018. A week of campaigning, which has seen posters go up but only a few low-key gatherings, comes to an end on Wednesday, before a day of silence on the eve of polling day. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Interior Ministry said around half of the 16,033 hopefuls would contest the election after the Guardian Council barred thousands, most of them relative moderates and reformists. But the Council said it was “neutral” in its dealings with all political camps and acted in accordance with the law when it blocked their candidacy. “The Guardian Council follows the laws and regulations parliament has passed at different times,” said its spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee. Advertisement Disillusionment “This time, just like at previous (elections), we have tried to properly follow the law,” he told a news conference. “The Council has never had a political view… It approaches political factions with closed eyes. “What it does judge is the evidence in the cases of the candidates and then it only acts in accordance with the law passed by parliament.” Commentators expect disillusionment among the 57 million-strong electorate in the sanctions-hit country to result in a low turnout. Many people on the streets of Tehran have expressed dissatisfaction with politicians ahead of the election, saying they failed to keep their word or to raise living standards. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday urged Iranians to vote, saying it was a “religious duty.” Advertisement Rouhani issued a similar call on Wednesday, saying that taking part would give Iran the “strength and unity” needed in its stand against the United States. “We are going to the polls to choose the best people for parliament, which is a very important institution,” he said in televised remarks after a meeting of his cabinet. “We are under severe sanctions and pressure by the global arrogance, and we have to break these sanctions and improve people’s lives,” he added, referring to the United States. “Sanctions are a terrorist and tyrannical act against Iran. “One cannot say sanctions have no effect and the government should be doing more… It’s lies, it’s supporting America.” Turnout at Iran’s past 10 elections averaged 60.5 percent, said the interior ministry. ‘Tyrannical’ sanctions The Guardian Council said it expected at least 50 percent of registered voters to cast ballots in the election. “Our forecast is that we will have a good turnout in the upcoming election, and the average turnout has usually not been under 50 percent, and we will witness a turnout of 50 percent turnout in this election too,” its spokesman Kadkhodaee said. Advertisement Iranians have been feeling the strain after months of turmoil. The economy has been battered since Trump abandoned the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign. In November, demonstrations over petrol price hikes spread across Iran and turned violent before being crushed in a deadly crackdown. Tehran and Washington have nearly gone to war twice in the past seven months, most recently after the US killed prominent Iranian general Qassem Soleimani on January 3. The “martyrdom” of the hugely popular general provoked an outpouring of grief in Iran. Millions of people turned out to mourn his death, but that unity suffered a blow after Iran admitted it “accidentally” shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing 176 people. Voting for Iran’s 290-seat parliament, or Majles, opens at 8:00 am (0430 GMT) on Friday and lasts 10 hours, but can be extended. The first results are expected on Sunday. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

News article:
Iranians are heading to the polls on Friday in a parliamentary election seen as a referendum on the establishment as the country faces growing isolation and threats of conflict over its nuclear standoff with the U.S. amid rising discontent at home. While establishment supporters will vote for hardline candidates, many pro-reform Iranians are furious over the handling of November protests against fuel price hikes that soon turned political, with demonstrators demanding "regime change." Many people on the streets of Tehran have expressed dissatisfaction with politicians ahead of the election, saying they failed to keep their word or to raise living standards. The public is also livid over the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January that killed all 176 people aboard, mainly Iranians. After days of denials, Tehran admitted the Guards were to blame. After the Iranian government raised the fuel prices by 50%, thousands of protesters took to the streets to protest the government. Blocking roads and attempting to prevent the security forces from entering certain neighborhoods, the protesters clashed with the police. Reportedly, the police did not refrain from using live bullets, killing more than 100 people. U.S. sanctions have already deteriorated the economic situation. But Iran's trans-border activities also increase the burden on the country's economy. The vote to pick 290 lawmakers is Iran's first since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers in 2018, to reimpose sanctions that have hit the economy hard. Turnout was 62% in the 2016 parliamentary vote and 66% of people voted in 2012. About 58 million Iranians are eligible to vote. Conservatives are expected to make an overwhelming resurgence in Friday's vote. Their gains would be made at the expense of those who back President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate conservative who was re-elected in 2017 promising people more freedoms and the benefits of engagement with the West. The Guardian Council, which must approve candidates, has rejected about 6,850 moderate or leading conservative hopefuls in favor of hardliners from among 14,000 applicants seeking to contest Friday's vote. The election will have no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran's nuclear policy, which is determined by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose hardline loyalists are likely to dominate the parliament. On Tuesday, Khamenei said voting was "a religious duty" but some prominent pro-reform politicians in Iran and activists abroad have called for a boycott of the elections. Iranian activists and opposition groups are distributing the Twitter hashtags #BoycottIranShamElections and #VOTENoVote widely on social media.

News article:
Iranians are supposed to go to the polls on Friday to elect a new Islamic Consultative Assembly, an ersatz parliament designed to give an autocratic regime a pseudo-democratic varnish. At the same time, voters are invited to participate in by-elections to fill vacancies in the Assembly of Experts, a grouping of mullahs supposed to supervise the performance of the “Supreme Guide”. We said “supposed to go the polls” because it is not at all clear how many of the 60 million eligible to vote would bother to take part in an exercise that many regard as insulting and futile. A number of polls, including some conducted by the government, predict a turnout-no higher than 50 percent. A Ministry of the Interior poll puts the number of those who intend to vote in Tehran at 24 percent. Some Middle East experts often ask me why a regime like the one in control of Iran needs any election specially when candidates are pre-selected by the authorities and those elected won’t be declared winners without the final approval by the office of the “Supreme Guide”. The reason is that, in its initial phase, the Islamic Revolution was, in fact, a classical bourgeois revolution reflecting typical middle class dreams of democracy, nationalism, socialism or even communism. With rare, and at times important, exceptions, the mass of Iranian workers and peasants took no part in anti-Shah demonstrations. The difficulty was that the leadership of the revolution had no intention of creating a Western-style society in which economically and socially Westernized Iranian middle classes would feel at home. One way to deceive them was to continue with a tradition of elections dating back to 1907. For decades later, a new middle class has emerged, President Hassan Rouhani refers to it as “the well-off 30 percent”, people who are prepared to live a double life in which economic comfort, not to say prosperity, is combined with lack of political freedoms and restrictive social norms. In this double life, the new middle class passes part of the year abroad, mostly in Western Europe and North America, where it can wear what it likes, eat what it likes and live like its Western counterparts. I was astonished to learn from an Islamic Majlis study that over 3,000 high-ranking officials have permanent resident permits for the United States and Canada. For example, six out of the 31 provincial governors in the Islamic Republic commute between Canada and Iran on a regular basis. Thousands of the children of this new middle class attend Western universities, mostly in the US and Canada. The new middle class, including some senior mullahs and their families, also uses several specialized hospitals in Germany, Switzerland and Britain. In many cases, as soon as a passenger aircraft leaves the Iranian airspace, the ladies cast off their hijab and the men queue up to shave or at least trim their beards. They look like a troupe of actors capable of playing different roles in accordance with the script at hand and the venue of the show. The new middle class has also built egg-nests outside Iran, for a rainy day when one might be forced to flee. Iranians have bought an astonishing 70,000 properties in Turkey alone. Georgia recently stopped the sale of property to Iranians and Oman has just imposed restrictions on Iranians buying real estate in the sultanate. In Western Europe and North America tens of thousands of former Islamic officials and their associates own property and substantial investment portfolios. The new middle class also has a network of propagandists abroad, peddling the yarn that the Islamic Republic, in the words of Noam Chomsky, is a “people-based” regime, a little lamb defying the American big bad wolf. Interestingly, the new Islamic middle class often cites Western “Infidel” authorities to support its world vision. Last Tuesday, “Supreme Guide” Ali Khamenei, addressing an election rally in Tehran, quoted former US President Jimmy Carter and Senator Bernie Sanders to back the claim that the US is about to implode because of widening class divisions, mass poverty and spiraling national debt. Hardly a day passes without the daily Kayhan, echoing Khamenei’s views, quoting unknown or little known “American scholars” and think-tanks praising the Islamic Republic and demanding that US cease opposing Tehran’s regional ambitions. That a new regime creates a new middle class isn’t something limited to Iran. Serbian writer Milovan Djilas has a whole book on the new middle class created by the Communist regime in Yugoslavia. In Communist China the new middle class began to take shape in the 1970s. Han Suyn depicted that new stratum of the Chinese society, consisting of people who could wear Western clothes and munch chop-suey, an American invention, when abroad but could also march, waving Mao Zedong’s Red Book in Beijing. Today, you would be astonished by the number of Chinese Communist officials who have attended American universities and have their offspring treading the same path. You may be even more astonished to learn the volume of Chinese investments in Europe and North America. There is, however, a big difference between the Islamic Republic’s new middle class and its counterparts in Titoist Yugoslavia or Communist China. In Yugoslavia and China no section of the new middle class pretended to have democratic aspirations. The “moderates-vs-hardliners” show that has plagued Iranian politics for decades did not exist in Yugoslavia or China. The least bad outcome of today’s polling would be the end of the “moderate-hardliner” duet. Since there was no campaigning worthy of the name and no major political issues were discussed by the candidates it is impossible to know exactly who is who. But some observers predict a low turnout and claim that the overwhelming majority of candidates likely to be declared as winners belong to the faction led by Khamenei and backed by the security-military apparatus. In other words, next Majlis will have fewer “half-pregnant” members, those who want to appear like Jeffersonian democrats but acting more savagely than Attila. I am not sure that such predictions would become reality. But I sure hope they will. A Majlis reflecting the reality of a corrupt, incompetent and brutal regime in full is less harmful than one designed to hide the nature of the Islamic Republic and promote forlorn hopes of moderation and reform.

News article:
Iranians went to the polls on Friday to vote for a new parliament. For many of them, it is a chance to hold their lawmakers accountable. The parliament has proven to be powerless in the past few years. Many Iranians chose to abstain from voting in the parliamentary election on Friday. Ahead of the polls, there was a lot of chatter on social media and other platforms about boycotting the election. A survey by the Institute for Social Studies at Tehran University in early February said that not even one out of four Iranians in the capital Tehran would cast their ballot. This is in sharp contrast to the 2016 vote, which recorded a 62% turnout countrywide, and around 50% in Tehran. Mohammad Sadeq Javadi Hesar, who is a member of the reformist Etemad Melli (National Trust Party), anticipated a low turnout this year. "The driving force behind elections in Iran has always been the youth, as well as academics. But now they are disappointed by the government's hollow promises. They are frustrated, especially because they haven't seen a reasonable response to the crises in the past two years," Hesar told DW. Women activists in Iran are also disgruntled. "Whoever goes to the polls will endorse the regime's crimes," 12 women political prisoners at a prison in Tehran wrote in an open letter. These activists called for an election boycott to protest against the regime's brutal handling of demonstrators.

Last year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the international nuclear deal with Iran. New US sanctions and Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran followed, which resulted in an economic crisis in the Middle Eastern country. However, the measures failed to force Tehran to agree to a new, comprehensive nuclear agreement.

Experts say that Iran's strategy to counter American pressure requires total obedience and support from Iranians, but it does not give them any economic respite. The economic crisis has snowballed into a national crisis. When people started protesting against the crisis, Iranian security forces unleashed a brutal crackdown on them. Protesters were targeted by paramilitary forces – under Khamenei's supervision – as the authorities shut down the internet. The aim was to stop news and photos of the government's brutal clampdown from spreading. The internet shutdown was administered by a young minister of communications. The parliamentarians remained silent spectators during this painful time. This made clear to many Iranians that when it comes to suppressing critical voices, there is hardly any difference between hardliners, moderates and reformers.

Two Iranian missiles accidentally hit an Ukrainian passenger plane near Tehran, killing all 176 people onboard, including 146 Iranians. To date, Iranian lawmakers have not dared to question the Revolutionary Guards, whose units were in charge of the missile attack. "The Iranian people feel that the elected institutions have no power," Sadegh Zibakalam, a Tehran-based political scientist, told DW. "All important decisions are made somewhere else." The conflict with the US has strengthened Khamenei, who is not answerable to any institution and has the final say in the country. "Many voters are now wondering why they should vote at all. These disappointed voters are the ones who were once mobilized by reformist parties," underlined Zibakalam. "But there are people in Iran who are loyal to the political system and always go to the polls. They vote for the conservative candidates," he added.

Analysts say a high turnout is crucial for Khamenei as the regime wants to interpret it as a sign of trust in the political system. Nonetheless, Iran's parliamentary elections are far from democratic. The Guardian Council - which comprises the regime's loyalists, religious and legal scholars - already barred almost 9,000 candidates from participating in the polls. Among these are 92 incumbent members of parliament, most of them well-known reformist politicians. Over 7,000 candidates were allowed to take part in the elections by the regime. Many of these are young and inexperienced candidates with one trait in common: their absolute loyalty to Khamenei.

The vote followed the barring of 9,000 mostly reformist and moderate candidates. Authorities said there was large fall in turnout compared to 2016. Hardliners loyal to Iran's supreme leader looked set to sweep to a parliamentary election victory on Friday, likely cementing their grip on power. Iranians voted in parliamentary elections that were seen as unlikely to change approaches to domestic or foreign policy. Thousands of mostly moderate and reformist candidates were barred from the contest. The disqualification of those potential candidates, along with weariness over social restrictions and economic woes, were cited as a reasons for the low voter turnout.

News article:
Iranians lined up at polling stations across the country on Friday to cast their ballot in parliamentary elections. Much hinges on voter turnout, which will be a key gauge of support for Iran’s leadership in a climate of rising tension as the country buckles under a deepening economic crisis and escalating tensions with the United States. Hardliners are expected to tighten their grip in an election following the disqualification of thousands candidates in favour of those loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Prior to the vote, his allies in The Guardian Council, a hardline vetting body, weeded out moderates and leading conservatives, leaving a pool of candidates loyal to the supreme leader. In response, the Trump administration sanctioned five Iranian officials who it accused of preventing free and fair elections on Thursday evening. “Literally, it is not a race anymore. Hardliners want the presidency. This is the end of moderation for at least a decade if not more,” an official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. While the Iranian Parliament does not wield major power, significant gains by regime supporters could weaken the country’s pragmatist politicians, who back wider engagement with the outside world. The outcome is likely to weaken the position of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who has disappointed supporters by failing to follow through on promises to ease social and political restrictions. The reformist president, who won the last two elections on promises to open Iran up to the outside world, has already lost credibility over the outcome of the nuclear deal, which he orchestrated with the US. Conservatives, who support the ruling theocracy, will likely dominate, but a win could be undermined by mass abstention if voters boycott the polls. In the days leading up to the vote, Iran's leaders pumped out messages of encouragement at rallies and on social media, urging supporters to cast their ballot. "Voting is a religious duty ... which will also guarantee the national interests of Iran," Mr Khamenei said after he voted on state television. "I am urging Iranians to vote early." ss Some 58 million Iranians out of 83 million are eligible to vote in Iran, where leaders have drawn legitimacy from high voter turnouts in the past. For Mr Khameini, a big turnout would send a strong signal to Washington that that Iran can survive US sanctions. Tensions between the US and Iran have been rising since President Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018 and peaked in recent weeks after a US drone strike killed the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani on January 3. Critics of the regime said a low turnout would express the public's anger over economic hardship and the violent repression of human rights. Crowds surged onto the streets last November after a steep increase in fuel prices prompted mass protests that quickly morphed into demonstrations calling for regime change. During a week-long internet blackout, a brutal government crackdown killed hundreds and led to thousands of arrests. Many Iranians are also furious over the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January that killed all 176 on board. Protests in the wake of the incident, which Tehran spent several days denying before admitting responsibility, reiterated demands for an end to the regime. Anti-establishment Iranians have tweeted support for a boycott of the elections on social media with posts showing fingerprints dipped in red ink to represent those killed in the fuel protests under the hashtags #RedInkBoycott and #ElectionBoycott2020. Previous elections in 2012 and 2016 saw 66-per cent and 62-per cent turnouts respectively with some commentators predicting that disillusionment over the state of the economy and the failure of President Rouhani to follow through on promises to improve civil liberties will lead to a lower turnout in this election. But with no independent, reliable opinion polls in Iran, it’s difficult to predict which way the ballot will go.

TEHRAN: Hardliners are set to dominate in the Iran parliamentary elections as voters hit the polling booth as public anger against moderate conservative President Hassan Rouhani deepens over a ravaged economy, corruption and multiple crises. State television showed the Islamic republic's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei casting the first ballot in Tehran. Experts predict a low turnout with rising voter apathy that they say will serve the conservatives at the expense of Rouhani, who was re-elected in 2017 promising more freedoms and the benefits of engagement with the West. Nearly 58 million people are eligible to vote. Around half of the 16,033 hopefuls will contest the 290 seats up for grabs across 31 provinces after the Guardian Council barred thousands of would-be candidates, mostly moderates and reformists.

News article:
TEHRAN: Conservatives took an early lead on Saturday as the first results of Iran’s parliamentary election came in, boosted by a predicted low turnout following the disqualification of nearly half the candidates. Friday’s election followed months of steeply escalating tensions between Iran and the US. Voters had been widely expected to shun the polls, disillusioned by unfulfilled promises and struggling to cope in a country whose economy has buckled under harsh US sanctions. About half of the 16,000-odd candidates were disqualified. Among them were many reformist and moderate candidates — including dozens of sitting MPs — leaving conservatives with virtually no competition. By midday on Saturday, votes had been counted in 71 constituencies out of 208, according to National Elections Committee figures reported by semi-official news agency ISNA. Tehran is the biggest catch in the election with 30 seats. The conservative and ultra-conservative alliance appeared to have a comfortable edge in the capital in early results, the committee’s spokesman Esmail Mousavi said on state television. Most votes went to the first three names on the alliance’s list, he said. Opinion This section contains relevant reference points, placed in (Opinion field) Leading the race was Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, a three-time presidential candidate, former police chief and member of the Revolutionary Guards who was Tehran mayor from 2005 to 2017. Reformists and moderates hardly figured in the 37 other names of “leading Tehran candidates,” Mousavi said. Final results for both the capital and other provinces would be announced by early Sunday at the latest, he added. If the results are confirmed, it will mean President Hassan Rouhani’s slender majority of reformists and moderates elected with fanfare four years ago is nearly purged. “A lot of people voted in the previous parliamentary election, but the enthusiasm faded away every day after that,” Ali, a Tehran taxi driver, told AFP. “And now there’s nothing to be hopeful about to go and vote,” added the 53-year-old, who abstained. HIGH LIGHTS • About half of the 16,000-odd candidates were disqualified. • Tehran is the biggest catch in the election with 30 seats. • Final results for both the capital and other provinces will be announced by early Sunday. • The 11th parliamentary election since the 1979 revolution comes after a surge in tensions between Tehran and Washington. • Leading the race was Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, a three-time presidential candidate, former police chief and member of the Revolutionary Guards who was Tehran mayor from 2005 to 2017. With official figures still coming in, news agencies close to conservatives and ultra-conservatives have predicted a landslide win for their candidates across Iran. An unofficial tally published by Fars news agency said 183 of Parliament’s 290 seats had already been decided, with conservative candidates winning 135 of them. Reformists were a distant second at 20, it said, adding independents had won 28 seats. Fars tweeted that turnout in Tehran was 1.9 million out of more than 9 million eligible voters. Many in the capital seem to have sat out the election, including Arghavan Aram, who manages an NGO for transsexuals. “An election with only one faction is not an election, it’s a selection,” she said. But Aram appeared optimistic for a future where “Trump leaves, Democrats come to power alongside a moderate supreme leader” in Iran and things would change. The state television website said that among 56 winners announced on Saturday, most were fresh faces and only 10 were former MPs. The 11th parliamentary election since the 1979 revolution comes after a surge in tensions between Tehran and Washington, and Iran’s accidental downing of a Ukrainian airliner that sparked anti-government protests. Turnout was estimated at around 40 percent nationwide and 30 percent in Tehran at the scheduled close of polls on Friday, according to Fars. But authorities extended polling for another six hours to allow as many people as possible to vote. Fars said the official turnout figure would be released on Saturday, while official results are not expected to be announced until Sunday. Schools were closed in dozens of urban centers on Saturday while the count went ahead. Iran fell into a deep recession after US President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions following Washington’s unilateral withdrawal from a landmark nuclear deal in 2018.

News article:
Hardliners in Iran have secured all 30 parliamentary seats in Tehran, the country's capital, state TV reported on Sunday. These were the initial results of its first round of parliamentary elections, which were held on Friday and were expected to produce victory for the country's conservatives. Early indications from Tehran and other provinces show the principlist and conservative factions were set for a landslide win in the 290-seat Parliament. The result would be a blow to moderate conservative President Hassan Rouhani. Conservatives won 191 of the Parliament's 290 seats, Fars news agency reported. Reformists were a distant second at 16, it said, adding independents had won 34 seats. Iran's Interior Minister, Abdolreza Fazli, said on Sunday that turnout in the parliamentary election was about 42 per cent, state TV reported. That was the lowest since Iran's 1979 revolution. Mr Fazli said more than 24 million of 58 million eligible voters took part in the election on Friday. He said the lowest turnout from the vote was the capital, Tehran, with just 25.4 per cent. Mr Fazli said the country voted under less than ideal circumstances but: "We believe that the number of votes and the turnout is absolutely acceptable." The turnout is widely regarded as a measure of how Iranians view the country's government and signals possible widespread dissatisfaction with Iran's rulers and the system over which they preside. Turnout was nearly 62 per cent in the 2016 elections and has consistently been above 50 per cent since the revolution. The strong victory for principlists and conservatives may be due to the Guardian Council, a vetting body of six clerics appointed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and six jurists, which disqualified more than half of the 14,000 people who applied to be candidates. Most of those rejected by the council came were reformists and the moderates. This led the factions to boycott the elections in Tehran. Mr Rouhani criticised the Guardian Council, saying "this is not an election” in a televised speech on January 15. He still urged Iranians to vote. In the 2016 election, the reformists bloc and their centrist and moderate allies won 41 per cent of parliamentary seats. The principlists won 29 per cent and independents took 28 per cent of seats. The result was a setback for the conservative bloc. This parliamentary election was also supposed to enable a review of Iran's Constitution to pave the way for a smooth succession for Mr Khamenei, while he is still in good health to supervise the transition. The elections took place under the threat of the coronavirus, which has killed eight people in Iran and infected 43 people across five cities, including Tehran. Iran reported its first case of the virus two days before the national polls. Mr Khamenei on Sunday accused enemy "propaganda" of trying to dissuade people from voting by exaggerating the threat of the coronavirus. "Their media did not ignore the tiniest opportunity for discouraging people and resorting to the pretext of diseases and the virus," he said. A range of crises has beset Iran in the past year, including widespread anti-government protests in November sparked by a rise in prices. They hurt the establishment's legitimacy after they were met with a violent crackdown that deepened resentment over economic hardship and corruption. There were also protests after the accidental downing of a passenger jet by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps amid heightened tensions with the US in January. Authorities initially tried to cover up the cause of the crash. The withdrawal by the US in 2018 from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, and its reimposition of sanctions, have hit Iran's economy hard. On the eve of the vote in Iran, the Trump administration sanctioned five election officials and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticised the election as a "sham".

The strong victory for principlists and conservatives may be due to the Guardian Council, a vetting body of six clerics appointed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and six jurists, which disqualified more than half of the 14,000 people who applied to be candidates. Most of those rejected by the council came were reformists and the moderates. This led the factions to boycott the elections in Tehran. Mr Rouhani criticised the Guardian Council, saying "this is not an election” in a televised speech on January 15. He still urged Iranians to vote. In the 2016 election, the reformists bloc and their centrist and moderate allies won 41 per cent of parliamentary seats. The principlists won 29 per cent and independents took 28 per cent of seats. The result was a setback for the conservative bloc. This parliamentary election was also supposed to enable a review of Iran's Constitution to pave the way for a smooth succession for Mr Khamenei, while he is still in good health to supervise the transition. The elections took place under the threat of the coronavirus, which has killed eight people in Iran and infected 43 people across five cities, including Tehran. Iran reported its first case of the virus two days before the national polls. Mr Khamenei on Sunday accused enemy "propaganda" of trying to dissuade people from voting by exaggerating the threat of the coronavirus. "Their media did not ignore the tiniest opportunity for discouraging people and resorting to the pretext of diseases and the virus," he said. A range of crises has beset Iran in the past year, including widespread anti-government protests in November sparked by a rise in prices. They hurt the establishment's legitimacy after they were met with a violent crackdown that deepened resentment over economic hardship and corruption. There were also protests after the accidental downing of a passenger jet by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps amid heightened tensions with the US in January. Authorities initially tried to cover up the cause of the crash. The withdrawal by the US in 2018 from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, and its reimposition of sanctions, have hit Iran's economy hard. On the eve of the vote in Iran, the Trump administration sanctioned five election officials and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticised the election as a "sham".

Iran's hardliners took victory today in a general election marred by the lowest turnout since the 1979 Islamic Revolution amid anger at the government. Tehran, which reported its first case of coronavirus two days before Friday's ballot, accused 'enemies' of fuelling fears of the deadly contagion to stifle voting. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: 'Their media did not ignore the tiniest opportunity for discouraging people and resorting to the pretext of diseases and the virus.' However, experts had anticipated low turnout amid growing anger at the government over biting economic conditions, made worse by conflict with the US, and the conservative authorities' barring more than half the 16,000 candidates. Iranians queue to vote in the parliamentary elections in a polling station on Friday in the capital Tehran Iranian President Hassan Rouhani casts his ballot for the 11th Parliamentary elections at a polling station in Tehran, Iran on polling day It signals a shift from four years ago when moderates and reformists won a slender majority in parliament and heaps further pressure on President Hassan Rouhani. The interior ministry announced results of 95 percent of the 208 constituencies in Friday's election, declaring the names of the winning candidates but without specifying their political affiliation. 'Victory for the anti-American candidates, a new slap for Trump,' crowed the ultra-conservative Kayhan newspaper. 'The people have disqualified the reformists,' it added, alluding to Rouhani's backers, who have been weakened by President Donald Trump pulling the US out of a landmark nuclear deal and by a slew of economic and political crises. Seventeen women were elected, the website of the government newspaper Iran said - the same number as in the outgoing 290-seat parliament. Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli announced the participation rate was 42.6 percent - the lowest in four decades. The election came two days after Iran announced its first cases of the deadly new coronavirus that emerged in China. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei speaks on the coronavirus cases and last week's elections in Tehran on Sunday. 'Their media did not ignore the tiniest opportunity for discouraging people and resorting to the pretext of diseases and the virus.' He said Poll workers empty full ballot boxes after the parliamentary election voting time ended in Tehran in the early hours of Saturday 'We held these elections when there were various incidents in the country: we had bad weather, there was this coronavirus disease, there was the plane crash,' Rahmani Fazli said, referring to the January 3 downing of a Ukrainian airliner which killed 176 people. He said that in such a scenario 'the turnout rate seems perfectly acceptable for us.' A low participation had been widely forecast, as a conservative-dominated electoral watchdog disqualified about half of the 16,000-odd candidates, mostly moderates and reformists. The Fars news agency said a second round would be held in at least 11 constituencies. One woman candidate has qualified for the second round, Iran newspaper added. Voter apathy marked the polls, but Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lauded the people's 'huge participation' despite what he termed 'negative propaganda' by foreign media. It 'began a few months ago and grew larger approaching the election and in the past two days, under the pretext of this illness,' he said. 'Their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting. (Our enemies) are even opposed to any election by the Iranian people,' the leader added. Iran on Sunday reported three new coronavirus deaths, taking its toll to eight - the highest in any country outside China. It said there were 43 COVID-19 virus infections nationwide. Iranians queue up during parliamentary elections at the Shah Abdul Azim shrine in the southern outskirts of Tehran An Iranian woman shows her voting document during parliamentary elections at the Shah Abdul Azim shrine on the southern outskirts of Tehran on Friday Authorities ordered the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 of Iran's 31 provinces from Sunday and said Tehran could be under quarantine, if necessary. Art events, concerts and film shows have been banned for a week across the country. In the past 24 hours, four new infections surfaced in Tehran, seven in the holy city of Qom - where the country's first infections emerged - two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. 'We are on the frontlines, we need help,' said the head of Qom's medical sciences university, Mohammadreza Ghadir. 'If I can say one thing, it is help Qom.' Iran's health minister, Saeed Namaki, said the treatment of COVID-19 cases would be free. 'In every city, one hospital will be dedicated to treating coronavirus cases,' he said, adding that this number would be greater in bigger cities like the capital. Tehran's city hall has ordered the closure of snack shops and water fountains in metro stations, officials said. Iranians queue up to vote during parliamentary elections at the Shah Abdul Azim shrine in southern Tehran Tehran municipality spokesman Gholamreza Mohammadi said buses and underground trains were being disinfected. Mohsen Hashemi, head of Tehran's municipal council, said, 'If the number of infections increases in Tehran, the whole city will be quarantined.' Posters were also put up across the sprawling city of eight million on Sunday, asking people not to shake hands as part of a coronavirus prevention campaign. Iran's cyberpolice meanwhile warned that anyone putting 'fake clips' online related to the virus would be punished. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the speed at which COVID-19 has spread in Iran, as well as it being exported from the Islamic republic to other countries, including Lebanon.

News article:
Tehran: Iranian hardliners won a majority in parliamentary elections, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency, sweeping Tehran and other cities in a repudiation of President Hassan Rouhani’s engagement with outside powers. Mehr didn’t give a final breakdown, saying that more than 220 out of 290 members of parliament will be hardliners and conservatives. The official turnout was 42.5 per cent, the lowest in the history of the Islamic Republic. The election had been widely predicted to hand control of the legislature to conservatives empowered by instability and economic damage triggered by US policies. Participation was held back by the powerful Guardian Council’s disqualification of hundreds of moderates and reformists. Hard-liners and conservatives won all 30 seats in Tehran, the largest and most influential constituency, Fars said Saturday after polls closed at midnight. They also dominated in Esfahan, Khuzestan, Mazandaran and several other provinces, Mehr reported. Participation was held back by the powerful Guardian Council’s disqualification of hundreds of moderates and reformists, Rouhani’s loss of political credibility as the US reimposed sanctions, and a reported surge in coronavirus cases in Iran this week. Turnout in the 2016 election, which was dominated by reformers and moderates who supported Rouhani and the nuclear deal with global powers, was almost 62 per cent. Several polling stations in both affluent and working-class neighbourhoods of Tehran, the capital, were largely empty on Friday. Given the vacuum among moderates candidates, conservative factions loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenie and generally opposed to engaging with the West were widely expected to prevail. Khamenie, on his official news portal, praised the “shining of the Iranian nation in the big test of the elections,” while accusing a “foreign propaganda apparatus” of invoking coronavirus “to dissuade people from taking part in the elections.” Soleimani’s killing Recent military exchanges, including the killing of General Qassem Soleimani by a US strike, and highly charged rhetoric that’s punctuated the confrontation with Washington, have also energised Khamenei’s base. For Mohammad, a 29-year-old voting in Tehran, a shift in the balance of power won’t make much difference. “They’re all cut from the same cloth,” he said of the country’s politicians, withholding his last name due to the sensitivities of talking to the foreign media in Iran. “I don’t really think there’s much to set them apart.” If arch-conservatives emerge victorious they’ll control most branches of the state for the first time since the end of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s presidency in 2013. Rouhani, who delivered on his promise to end Iran’s long-running nuclear standoff with global powers but was unable to build a new era of prosperity when faced with President Donald Trump’s economic offensive, will be largely sidelined. Black list In a timely reminder of how hard-liners can influence economic policy, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force announced on Friday that Iran’s banking system will be returned to its so-called black list of countries after failing to ratify legislation required to bring the sector in line with its counter-terrorism financing and anti-money-laundering standards. Hard-liners, currently a minority in Iran’s parliament, have for several years fiercely opposed and effectively stalled the pro-FATF legislation that Rouhani promoted and struggled to ratify, and which would have effectively seen Iran adopt the United Nations’ Palermo Convention against organized crime. Some 7,200 candidates vied for seats on Friday. About 75 current lawmakers were barred from running again by the powerful Guardian Council, tipping the field heavily in favor of conservatives wedded to the theocratic ideals of Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution. Friday’s election also had significant potential consequences for the Iranian economy and the wider Middle East region, including any hope Iran will renegotiate its landmark 2015 nuclear settlement from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2018. Looking ahead “The crux of this vote is whether it will indicate the outcome for the next presidential elections, which will be more significant,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “If the Rouhani opposition does take over parliament, they will see this as ammunition that galvanizes them, and they won’t want him to have any foreign policy success in his last year,” she said. Some prominent conservative politicians are using the election to stage a comeback and a potential springboard to compete in the 2021 presidential poll, when Rouhani will be ineligible to stand for a third term. They include the former mayor of Tehran, Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf, who’s also a former general with the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Firebrand cleric Hamid Rasaei, who campaigned against the nuclear deal as it was being negotiated, is also hoping to re-enter parliament. Threats to ministers Amid concerns of a low turnout, the commander of Iran’s IRGC on Thursday urged citizens to vote in a show of show defiance to the US. “Every vote by the people is a slap in the face of an enemy,” the semi-official Tasnim news reported the commander as saying. If the new chamber does decisively swing in favour of conservatives, Rouhani may struggle to ratify any key legislation during his final year in office, including efforts to bring Iran’s banks within international anti-terrorism financing standards. Ongoing attempts to impeach some key ministers, including Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, are also likely to escalate. Rouhani’s credibility was already battered by the failure of the nuclear deal to deliver the economic relief he’d promised after a decade of international sanctions. From the get-go, foreign businesses were afraid to sign deals, fearful of running afoul of remaining US sanctions. Any lingering hopes evaporated after the US quit the accord and began imposing fresh sanctions, which have since clobbered the economy. The International Monetary Fund estimates Iran’s economy shrank by 9.5 per cent last year. Conservatives want Iran to abandon Rouhani’s push to open up to Western investment and trade, and focus instead on increasing self-reliance. While oil exports, down 80 per cent, show no sign of recovering, construction, steel production and exports for cash to immediate neighbors are doing well.

Friday’s election also had significant potential consequences for the Iranian economy and the wider Middle East region, including any hope Iran will renegotiate its landmark 2015 nuclear settlement from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2018. Looking ahead “The crux of this vote is whether it will indicate the outcome for the next presidential elections, which will be more significant,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “If the Rouhani opposition does take over parliament, they will see this as ammunition that galvanizes them, and they won’t want him to have any foreign policy success in his last year,” she said. Some prominent conservative politicians are using the election to stage a comeback and a potential springboard to compete in the 2021 presidential poll, when Rouhani will be ineligible to stand for a third term. They include the former mayor of Tehran, Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf, who’s also a former general with the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Firebrand cleric Hamid Rasaei, who campaigned against the nuclear deal as it was being negotiated, is also hoping to re-enter parliament. Threats to ministers Amid concerns of a low turnout, the commander of Iran’s IRGC on Thursday urged citizens to vote in a show of show defiance to the US. “Every vote by the people is a slap in the face of an enemy,” the semi-official Tasnim news reported the commander as saying. If the new chamber does decisively swing in favour of conservatives, Rouhani may struggle to ratify any key legislation during his final year in office, including efforts to bring Iran’s banks within international anti-terrorism financing standards. Ongoing attempts to impeach some key ministers, including Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, are also likely to escalate. Rouhani’s credibility was already battered by the failure of the nuclear deal to deliver the economic relief he’d promised after a decade of international sanctions. From the get-go, foreign businesses were afraid to sign deals, fearful of running afoul of remaining US sanctions. Any lingering hopes evaporated after the US quit the accord and began imposing fresh sanctions, which have since clobbered the economy. The International Monetary Fund estimates Iran’s economy shrank by 9.5 per cent last year. Conservatives want Iran to abandon Rouhani’s push to open up to Western investment and trade, and focus instead on increasing self-reliance. While oil exports, down 80 per cent, show no sign of recovering, construction, steel production and exports for cash to immediate neighbors are doing well.

News article:
Iran last week held parliamentary elections amid growing anti-regime protests, U.S. threats and an increasing death toll from the coronavirus. Voter turnout slumped to its lowest since 1979, when the current regime, under the leadership of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, seized power after the ousting of the country's last Shah, Reza Pahlavi. Turnout dwindled to 42.5%, indicating that the brutally suppressed protests had manifested themselves into an unofficial boycott of the elections after various reformist figures had been banned from running in the elections. Iran’s conservatives declared victory on Sunday evening after winning all 30 of the government. Conservative newspapers hailed the results as a victory against the U.S., with which tensions are at an all-time high after the killing of Qassem Soleimani last month in Iraq. In fact, Iranian people are wary of the ongoing tensions with the U.S., Israel and the involvement of their country in the wars and conflicts in the Middle East, from Yemen to Syria. During the protests in the last few months, demonstrators chanted slogans against the regime’s foreign policy and called for change, only to be brutally suppressed. Although it is impossible to authenticate the numbers, it is estimated that thousands of people were killed by security forces. The brutal crackdown was followed by the barring of more than 7,000, mostly moderate and reformist potential candidates. At least 90 of the disqualified potential candidates were already lawmakers. The low turnout seems to mark a silent protest against the regime, although Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said: “We held these elections when there were various incidents in the country. We had bad weather, there was the coronavirus and there was the plane crash,” referring to the downing of the Ukrainian jet by an Iranian missile that killed 176 people. While Fazli found the turnout “acceptable under these circumstances,” the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused the foreign media of carrying out negative propaganda. He said it “began a few months ago and grew larger with the approaching election and in the past two days, under the pretext of this illness. Their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting. (Our enemies) are even opposed to an election by the Iranian people.” President Hassan Rouhani, who is under mounting pressure due to the conservatives outbreak, criticized the disqualification of potential candidates by the Guardian Council, which acts under the supreme leader’s command. “The disqualification was akin to customers being told they have options but being offered just one brand at a store.” In fact, in previous elections in 2016, turnout came to nearly 62% and led to reformists securing a considerable number of seats in Parliament. Amid increased tensions with the U.S., the victory of the conservatives is likely to lead Iran to adopt a harshened rhetoric, to be unwilling to compromise with the U.S. and to enact stricter measures against regime dissidents. The conservatives in Tehran were led by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, former head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ air force wing. He is expected to become speaker of the incoming Parliament. His victory will strengthen the Revolutionary Guards’ position in the country. The Iranian regime may also impose more rigid measures against its people, who refused to cast a ballot in light of repressive measures. The regime will likely harshen its tone against the U.S. and Israel which will only cause further destabilization in the Middle East.

News article:
After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to annex the Jordan Valley along with all of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he wins the upcoming elections, Defense Minister Naftali Bennett on Wednesday pushed for a cabinet vote to move ahead with the plan already next week. In a Twitter exchange the previous day between Netanyahu and his chief rival, Blue and White leader MK Benny Gantz, the two men appeared to dare each other to swiftly apply sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. The annexation talk is “welcome,” Bennett wrote on Twitter “but it is, for the time being, just talk. The only real test is action.” He called on Netanyahu to bring the annexation measure for approval by the cabinet at its coming weekly meeting on Sunday, followed by a vote in the Knesset on Tuesday. “Only actions will determine,” wrote Bennett, who leads the Yamina alliance of nationalist parties to the right of Likud. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Yisrael Beytenu leader MK Avigdor Liberman, a fierce rival of Netanyahu, criticized the prime minister’s announcement the night before, accusing him of simply trying to divert attention from his efforts to seek parliamentary immunity from an indictment in three corruption cases. “You don’t care one whit about the Jordan Valley,” Liberman wrote Wednesday on Facebook. “The only thing you care about is immunity.” Like Bennett, he called on Netanyahu to show his sincerity by immediately working to pass annexation legislation. Advertisement Shas leader Aryeh Deri on Wednesday said in a statement that his party would support such a bill and urged others to also support it, as “a historic opportunity has been created.” He said Shas was calling on “all the parties to join the process, in order to ensure broad national agreement that will send a message to the world that the Israeli people are united on this important matter.” Netanyahu’s annexation promise in a speech Tuesday launching his Likud party’s election campaign came hours after Gantz promised to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. In what appeared to be the top centrist lawmaker’s latest effort to cater to right-leaning voters, Gantz said the area making up roughly 20 percent of the West Bank would remain part of the Jewish state in any future peace agreement. Currently, the only way for Israel to annex to Jordan Valley with the agreement of the international community would be under a negotiated peace deal with the Palestinians, who claim the entire West Bank for a future state. Right-wing officials and settler leaders largely scoffed at Gantz’s pledge. Netanyahu called the Blue and White leader’s bluff by urging him not to wait until after the election, but rather to support the measure if it is brought before the Knesset for a vote in the coming weeks. Advertisement Gantz subsequently issued a similar challenge to Netanyahu, tweeting: “You can apply Israeli law in the Jordan Valley in a cabinet decision within two hours, without any Knesset discussion. Let’s see you.” Netanyahu continued the exchange of jabs, tweeting: “I expect full support by you and Blue and White for this historic move. Very soon I will put you to that test.” After that exchange, Transportation Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged Netanyahu to call a Knesset vote as early as next week to immediately annex the Jordan Valley, a call echoed by Bennett on Wednesday. Hebrew media widely reported Netanyahu’s possible move as a potential trap for Blue and White, since if it supports the measure the party will be seen as being steered by the premier on major policy issues, and if it opposes it that would put the lie to Gantz’s Tuesday annexation announcement. However, a decision to extend Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley during a transitional government is likely to be opposed by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who reportedly voiced reservations when the issue was raised ahead of the September elections. Elections in April and September failed to break a political deadlock and produce a permanent government, sending Israel to an unprecedented third vote on March 2. A key campaign issue is Netanyahu’s immunity bid, the process for which has been hampered by the political stalemate. Netanyahu — who faces an indictment on corruption charges, including bribery, in three cases — denies any wrongdoing. Opposition lawmakers are striving to see the immunity request debated before the coming election because there is currently a majority in parliament opposed to granting it. Jacob Magid and Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday to annex all settlements in the occupied West Bank as he officially launched his election campaign, reported The Times of Israel. The Likud leader made the remarks on the same day that his main rival Benny Gantz had promised to annex the Jordan Valley region of the occupied West Bank. Speaking to supporters in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said his government would "immediately" extend Israeli sovereignty over all West Bank settlements "without exception". Netanyahu also attacked the Blue and White leader, suggesting that the former military chief's commitment to annexing the Jordan Valley was an election campaign bluff. READ: 'I won't let settlements be uprooted in any diplomatic plan', says Netanyahu Urging Gantz to back a potential vote coming before the Knesset in the coming weeks, spearheaded by transportation minister Bezalel Smotrich, to approve the annexation of the Jordan Valley, Netanyahu declared: "Benny Gantz, I expect an answer by the end of the day". The party leaders than exchanged tweets, with Gantz telling Netanyahu: "Try for once not to lie and here's a tip — you can apply Israeli law in the Jordan Valley in a cabinet decision within two hours, without any Knesset discussion. Let's see you". Netanyahu replied: "Benny Gantz, I am happy you have finally decided to support my initiative to apply Israeli law in the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea. I expect full support from you and Blue and White for this historic move. Very soon I will put you to that test". OPINION: More war crimes are Israel's plan for the immediate future According to The Times of Israel, "Netanyahu is reportedly considering the move [to hold a vote] as a trap for Blue and White, since if it supports the measure the party will be seen as being dragged by the premier on major policy issues, and if it opposes it that would negate the effect of Tuesday's annexation announcement". The report also noted, however, that a decision to annex the region "during a transitional government is likely to be opposed by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who reportedly voiced reservations when the issue was raised ahead of the September elections".

Yisrael Beytenu chief Avigdor Liberman visits the Jordan Valley, an area of the West Bank that he and other leading Israeli politicians have called to annex. “For us the Jordan Valley is the most-agreed upon [thing] in Israeli society since the Alon Plan through [prime minister Yitzhak] Rabin and up to Gandhi [Rehavam Ze’evi],” Liberman writes on Facebook. Liberman says that he hopes by next week at the latest, the Knesset will vote on a bill backed by his party to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, “just as the prime minister promised.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week called for a vote to immediately extend sovereignty over the area, after his political rival Benny Gantz said he would work to do so after the March 2 elections with international backing. “If ultimately because of all types of excuses the vote doesn’t come up for a vote next week it means only one thing: The prime minister simply took residents of the [Jordan] Valley for a spin and in the end there won’t be Israeli sovereignty here or anywhere else,” he says. The comments come as Netanyahu takes off for Washington to meet with US President Donald Trump for talks on the White House’s peace plan.

Yisrael Beytenu chief Avigdor Liberman visits the Jordan Valley, an area of the West Bank that he and other leading Israeli politicians have called to annex. “For us the Jordan Valley is the most-agreed upon [thing] in Israeli society since the Alon Plan through [prime minister Yitzhak] Rabin and up to Gandhi [Rehavam Ze’evi],” Liberman writes on Facebook. Liberman says that he hopes by next week at the latest, the Knesset will vote on a bill backed by his party to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, “just as the prime minister promised.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week called for a vote to immediately extend sovereignty over the area, after his political rival Benny Gantz said he would work to do so after the March 2 elections with international backing. “If ultimately because of all types of excuses the vote doesn’t come up for a vote next week it means only one thing: The prime minister simply took residents of the [Jordan] Valley for a spin and in the end there won’t be Israeli sovereignty here or anywhere else,” he says. The comments come as Netanyahu takes off for Washington to meet with US President Donald Trump for talks on the White House’s peace plan.

Defense Minister Naftali Bennet said Sunday that Israel will in "under no condition allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state," ahead of the Trump administration's release of the long-awaited Middle East peace plan, slated to be unveiled on Tuesday. Speaking in the West Bank settlement of Ariel, Bennett said: "In no case, under no condition, will we allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state or recognition of such a state and we will not relinquish a single centimeter of the land of Israel to Arabs." Haaretz Weekly Ep. 58 Credit: Haaretz >> Read more: Annexation for dummies: Making sense of Netanyahu and Gantz's declarations "Before us, before the government, is a once in a lifetime chance, once in 50 years, to extend Israeli law over half a million citizens and over the Jordan Valley and Gush Etzion," Bennett said. Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival, Kahol Lavan leader Benny Gantz, set out to Washington on Sunday to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan. "This has been our dream for so many years. They're asking what position we will take," Bennett said. "Our answer: Annexation – we support the plan. No annexation – we won't support the plan." The defense minister called to extend Israeli law over all of the West Bank and added: "The right-wing government won't allow debate with the left over any option other than the full extension of Israeli sovereignty over half a million Israelis at this Sunday's security cabinet meeting. Open gallery view "In another week here, the city of Ariel will able to finally be an official part of the state, just like Tel Aviv. If that happens, the cabinet will fully support the 'deal of the century.'" According to Israeli sources, the American plan will assure full Israeli sovereignty in all the existing settlements and annexation of the Jordan Valley, which will become Israel's eastern border. Responsibility for security in all the territory in the West Bank and most of Jerusalem – including the Old City – is expected to remain in Israeli hands. In addition, Israel won't be able to expand the settlements and will be forced to clear illegal outposts. According to the sources, the Palestinian state will be established over most of the land in the West Bank and in outlying Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem. In addition, a future Palestinian state would retain access to and take part in the management of the holy sites, in coordination with Jordan. Earlier Sunday, Netanyahu departed for the U.S. and is expected to land in Washington in the early morning hours on Monday. Before departing, Netanyahu said: "Five years ago I appeared before Congress in Washington because I had to stand up to a plan developed by an American president," referencing the Iran nuclear deal signed between former President Barack Obama and Tehran. "I've believed that plan jeopardized Israel's mere existence. Today I'm headed to bring back a plan, which I believe will advance Israel's interests. On Tuesday we'll make History," the premier continued. Netanyahu was originally scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday. However, after it was announced that Gantz would hold a private meeting with the U.S. president on Monday, a senior Israeli official said the premier would also sit down with Trump on Monday in addition to their audience the day after. Meanwhile, Yossi Dagan, the head of the Samaria Regional Council in the West Bank, will also take off Sunday to take part in a series of meetings with evangelical Christians and Republicans in a bid to gain their support against giving away territory meant for a future Palestinian state. On Saturday night, the Samaria Regional Council launched a campaign featuring its stance on Trump's peace plan. According to the campaign, the council "rules out the establishment of a Palestinian state, will not agree to abandon isolated Jewish communities as enclaves in a territory controlled by a terrorist country, and rejects renouncing Area C and B and further concessions." The Oslo Accords divided the West Bank into three parts: Area A, which makes up 18 percent of the West Bank and includes all large Palestinian cities, is under full control of the Palestinian Authority; Area B, which makes up 22 percent, is under civilian control of the PA and Israeli security control; and Area C, which makes up 60 percent, is controlled by Israel and is home to Palestinian communities alongside Israeli settlements.

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — The Interior Ministry is working on solutions for issues that will arise in the event that Israel annexes areas of Yehudah and Shomron, Interior Minister Rabbi Aryeh Deri said Monday. On a tour of the Jordan Valley – the first time since 1994 that a member of Shas has officially toured the region, Channel 13 reported – Deri said that declaring sovereignty over areas like the Jordan Valley “is a mitzvah that has come to our hands, and we are not allowed to miss the opportunity to miss doing a mitzvah.” On the tour, Rabbi Deri met with local officials and visited farms and some of the small communities that dot the area, as well as conferring with IDF officials. “Our forefathers were here, this marks the spot where the Jews entered Eretz Yisrael, and this is where the great return by our people to their land began,” Rabbi Deri said. “This is our land and the land of our forefathers. We have already begun working on installing Israeli law here. The mayors here will be mayors not by order of the military government, but by the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. Israeli diplomats who have been involved in discussions regarding the plan say that Israel is not going to be required to make many more concessions than it has already made. Channel 12 said that the plan includes recognition of Yerushalayim as Israel’s capital, and gives the option for Israeli sovereignty on all the settlement blocs, at the very least. The plan does not call for the establishment of a Palestinian state at this time, but reserves the option for one to be established in the future – if the Palestinians accept the conditions of the plan, which almost undoubtedly will include recognizing Israel as a Jewish state, something the Palestinian Authority has refused to do until now. Details on President Donald Trump’s “deal of the century” peace plan are expected to be released Monday. Both Binyamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz will meet with Trump Monday afternoon Israel time, with the prime minister conferring with the president before the Blue and White head. Afterwards, details of the plan will be released. Netanyahu will again meet with Trump Tuesday at noon, Washington time.

Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennet sounded a defiant note yesterday ahead of the expected publication this week of the Trump administration's peace plan for the region, reported Haaretz. In no case, under no condition, will we allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state or recognition of such a state and we will not relinquish a single centimetre of the land of Israel to Arabs said Bennett, speaking in Ariel, a major settlement in the occupied West Bank. The minister additionally clarified that "under no condition" will Israel "allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state". Reports suggest that the White House will unveil the political contours of its plan tomorrow, with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz both in Washington to hold talks with President Donald Trump. "Before us, before the government, is a once in a lifetime chance, once in 50 years, to extend Israeli law over half a million citizens and over the Jordan Valley and Gush Etzion," declared Bennett. READ: No opposition from the international community as Israel alters the two-state paradigm "This has been our dream for so many years. They're asking what position we will take," he added. "Our answer: Annexation – we support the plan. No annexation – we won't support the plan." Bennett, a long-term proponent of unilateral annexation of portions of the occupied West Bank, called for the Israeli authorities to take action. "In another week here, the city of Ariel will able to finally be an official part of the state, just like Tel Aviv," he said.

News article:
Two Jews, three opinions — goes the beloved Jewish adage. However, in the Jewish state, for the past few years, there are only two opinions — yes Bibi, no Bibi. This is the prism through which any political or policy matter is judged. This “dilemma” has managed to obliterate the traditional borderlines between right and left, uniting political foes and has even cost us a third election. No issue was substantial enough to bridge the seemingly abyssal divide separating the two camps. Which is why this week’s Twitter spat between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Benny Gantz over the extension of Israeli law into the Jordan Valley was so refreshing. Both parties realized that the Valley will not fall victim to the divide. The vast majority of Israelis understand the security significance of the Jordan Valley for Israel, the strong biblical and historic ties, and the unique opportunity of having an American president who will not only not oppose the move, but may even support it. Bibi and Gantz recognize this, of course. They did not quarrel on whether Israel should annex the Valley, but rather who will set the move in motion sooner. A groundbreaking consensus, but for the usual naysayers, who put forth two main arguments — foreign policy and questions of legal authority. The foreign policy arguments begin, as is often the case, with the threat that all hell will break loose in the Middle East if the Jordan Valley is annexed. If this argument sounds familiar, it’s because we have heard it before: when President Trump signaled his intent to recognize Jerusalem, and Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Thankfully President Trump is not easily deterred. Both moves were accomplished and the world is still standing. Our neighbors in the region have long realized that they have much greater issues to deal with. They discovered that their attachment to the “Palestinian cause” is a source of internal volatility, while Israel is a stabilizing force in the region. Their choice is clear through their silence. Some European countries may not be happy with the move. But then again, when was the last time they were? It is of course prudent to maintain relationships. But let’s face it, Europe’s role hasn’t been helpful these past few years anyway. Instead of building trust, Europe has focused on judging Israel by different standards than other countries and pushing Israel into a corner. This was manifested only recently with the European Court of Justice ruling on labeling Israeli products made in Judea and Samaria. Passing up on an opportunity to secure Israeli borders with American approval will not be a show of diplomatic good will, but rather succumbing to foreign bullying. And then there is the threat of the International Criminal Court (ICC). This past month, the ICC prosecutor informed the court of its intention to open a war crimes probe into Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip as well as Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank. Annexing the Jordan Valley, so the argument goes, will feed into the ICC’s intent to prosecute Israelis and may even expedite the process. But thinking by this logic is to miss the point completely. The ICC is a rogue body. It has failed in its mission to prosecute real war criminals. The legal basis for the prosecution of Israelis it a hoax at best. Israel is not party to the Rome Statute. The Palestinian Authority, which is not even a state, cannot in good faith be party to it either. After a long history of failure to implement its mission the ICC is vested in showing that it can bring results in prosecuting Israel, facts notwithstanding. To give up a vital and timely Israeli interest for fear of the court, is to hand the ICC an undeserved, all-too-easy and wrong, win. Finally, opponents of the application of Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley annexation contend that given the political situation, the move would be illegal. Cloaking opposition in legal arguments is the Israeli left’s modus operandi to blocking unwanted moves that enjoy public support. The left’s argument is that election season is not the time to make such grave and substantial decisions, as the government no longer enjoys the trust of the Knesset. However, the Basic Law: The government (of constitutional status) clearly states that an outgoing government continues with all its duties until the next government is formed. In fact, even the Israeli Supreme Court, which at times has decided that outgoing governments’ decisions should be limited in scope, has ruled that if the decision at hand is timely and dependent on an opportunity that may no longer be available in the future (such as the support of an American president), the government is authorized to make the decision. Moreover, the legal vehicle for the government to extend Israeli law to the Jordan Valley was already put in place by the Knesset in 1967. Following the Six Days War, the Knesset amended the 1948 Act on the Order of Governance and Law, to include section 11B, empowering the Government of Israel to extend its law to any part of Eretz Yisrael (i.e., land that was under the British Mandate) via an order. The next day, the government acted on that authority and extended Israel’s law over Jerusalem. It was legal then. It is legal now. No doubt that a designated naysayer will be found to petition the court against the move. But judging by the wide range of support on both right and center, the court will be wise not to overstep its authority or breach the trust of the people.

The next day, the government acted on that authority and extended Israel’s law over Jerusalem. It was legal then. It is legal now. No doubt that a designated naysayer will be found to petition the court against the move. But judging by the wide range of support on both right and center, the court will be wise not to overstep its authority or breach the trust of the people.

News article:
Two Jews, three opinions — goes the beloved Jewish adage. However, in the Jewish state, for the past few years, there are only two opinions — yes Bibi, no Bibi. This is the prism through which any political or policy matter is judged. This “dilemma” has managed to obliterate the traditional borderlines between right and left, uniting political foes and has even cost us a third election. No issue was substantial enough to bridge the seemingly abyssal divide separating the two camps. Which is why this week’s Twitter spat between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Benny Gantz over the extension of Israeli law into the Jordan Valley was so refreshing. Both parties realized that the Valley will not fall victim to the divide. The vast majority of Israelis understand the security significance of the Jordan Valley for Israel, the strong biblical and historic ties, and the unique opportunity of having an American president who will not only not oppose the move, but may even support it. Bibi and Gantz recognize this, of course. They did not quarrel on whether Israel should annex the Valley, but rather who will set the move in motion sooner. A groundbreaking consensus, but for the usual naysayers, who put forth two main arguments — foreign policy and questions of legal authority. The foreign policy arguments begin, as is often the case, with the threat that all hell will break loose in the Middle East if the Jordan Valley is annexed. If this argument sounds familiar, it’s because we have heard it before: when President Trump signaled his intent to recognize Jerusalem, and Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Thankfully President Trump is not easily deterred. Both moves were accomplished and the world is still standing. Our neighbors in the region have long realized that they have much greater issues to deal with. They discovered that their attachment to the “Palestinian cause” is a source of internal volatility, while Israel is a stabilizing force in the region. Their choice is clear through their silence. Some European countries may not be happy with the move. But then again, when was the last time they were? It is of course prudent to maintain relationships. But let’s face it, Europe’s role hasn’t been helpful these past few years anyway. Instead of building trust, Europe has focused on judging Israel by different standards than other countries and pushing Israel into a corner. This was manifested only recently with the European Court of Justice ruling on labeling Israeli products made in Judea and Samaria. Passing up on an opportunity to secure Israeli borders with American approval will not be a show of diplomatic good will, but rather succumbing to foreign bullying. And then there is the threat of the International Criminal Court (ICC). This past month, the ICC prosecutor informed the court of its intention to open a war crimes probe into Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip as well as Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank. Annexing the Jordan Valley, so the argument goes, will feed into the ICC’s intent to prosecute Israelis and may even expedite the process. But thinking by this logic is to miss the point completely. The ICC is a rogue body. It has failed in its mission to prosecute real war criminals. The legal basis for the prosecution of Israelis it a hoax at best. Israel is not party to the Rome Statute. The Palestinian Authority, which is not even a state, cannot in good faith be party to it either. After a long history of failure to implement its mission the ICC is vested in showing that it can bring results in prosecuting Israel, facts notwithstanding. To give up a vital and timely Israeli interest for fear of the court, is to hand the ICC an undeserved, all-too-easy and wrong, win. Finally, opponents of the application of Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley annexation contend that given the political situation, the move would be illegal. Cloaking opposition in legal arguments is the Israeli left’s modus operandi to blocking unwanted moves that enjoy public support. The left’s argument is that election season is not the time to make such grave and substantial decisions, as the government no longer enjoys the trust of the Knesset. However, the Basic Law: The government (of constitutional status) clearly states that an outgoing government continues with all its duties until the next government is formed. In fact, even the Israeli Supreme Court, which at times has decided that outgoing governments’ decisions should be limited in scope, has ruled that if the decision at hand is timely and dependent on an opportunity that may no longer be available in the future (such as the support of an American president), the government is authorized to make the decision. Moreover, the legal vehicle for the government to extend Israeli law to the Jordan Valley was already put in place by the Knesset in 1967. Following the Six Days War, the Knesset amended the 1948 Act on the Order of Governance and Law, to include section 11B, empowering the Government of Israel to extend its law to any part of Eretz Yisrael (i.e., land that was under the British Mandate) via an order. The next day, the government acted on that authority and extended Israel’s law over Jerusalem. It was legal then. It is legal now. No doubt that a designated naysayer will be found to petition the court against the move. But judging by the wide range of support on both right and center, the court will be wise not to overstep its authority or breach the trust of the people.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said the Israeli leader will ask his Cabinet on Sunday to approve his plan to annex parts of the West Bank. Jonathan Urich made the announcement on Twitter late on Tuesday, shortly after Mr Netanyahu joined US President Donald Trump for the unveiling of his peace plan. The plan calls for leaving the Jordan Valley and all Israeli settlements under Israeli control. It sparked rejection from the Palestinians and condemnation from Jordan and Turkey. "This plan is an annexation plan that is aimed at killing the two state solution and stealing Palestinian lands," Turkey's Foreign Ministry said, describing Mr Trump's proposals as "stillborn". Mr Netanyahu's hard-line nationalist allies called for the immediate annexation of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Naftali Bennett, Israel's Defence Minister, said the proposal offered Israel "an opportunity to determine the territory of our country" and "include all the Israeli settlements in the land of Israel within the sovereign state of Israel." Mr Bennett, a hawkish member of the religious nationalist Yemina party, said that Israel "cannot wait until after the elections, and won't be satisfied with partial sovereignty. Take it all now". Ayelet Shaked, Israel's former justice minister and Mr Bennett's running mate, said Israel is at "a historic moment" and called for unilateral annexation of West Bank land. "The dangerous part of the plan, that is the establishment of a Palestinian state or recognition of a Palestinian state, won't happen," she wrote on Twitter.

An Israeli soldier stands guard during a tour made by Israeli members of parliament of the Jordan Valley, near the Jewish settlement of Ma’ale Efrayim, Jan. 2, 2014. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that a US peace plan envisages the proposed Palestinian capital be located in Abu Dis, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem. After US President Donald Trump presented his peace plan, Netanyahu told reporters the United States recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capital, “by which I mean, within its fences," an apparent reference to municipal boundaries. The right-wing leader, who faces a new election in March, said he would bring a proposal for applying Israeli jurisdiction to the Jordan Valley, the northern Dead Sea and West Bank settlements for cabinet approval at its next session, probably on Sunday. “Israel is offering the Palestinians, at the end of the process, conditional, limited sovereignty," Netanyahu said. Palestinians were absent from Trump's announcement and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the plan the "slap of the century." Netanyahu’s hardline nationalist allies called for the immediate annexation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank in reaction to Trump’s peace plan.

News article:
Israeli hardliners called on the government to immediately annex all Israeli settlements after the US published its long-awaited peace plan, while several left-wing politicians warned that the plan could lead to a form of “apartheid” control over the Palestinians. Trump’s plan calls for the creation of a Palestinian state with its capital in portions of East Jerusalem, but also allows for Israel to hold on to large chunks of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley and where settlements are located. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would begin working to annex areas okayed as Israeli under the plan as early as next week, despite only controlling a caretaker government that is generally restricted from making wide-ranging moves. Responding to the plan, the centrist Blue and White party said that the proposal “is entirely consistent with the principles of state and security espoused by Blue and White.” Trump said Tuesday that party leader Benny Gantz, whom he met with a day earlier, had endorsed the plan as a basis for talks with the Palestinians. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “President Trump’s peace plan provides a strong, viable basis for advancing a peace accord with the Palestinians, while preserving the existing arrangements between Israel and Jordan and Egypt, and enabling their expansion to additional countries in the region,” the party said in a statement. However, a party official told The Times of Israel that it would not support any implementation of the plan before March’s election. In its statement, the party noted that Netanyahu had been officially indicted in three separate corruption cases only hours earlier, saying he thus could not implement the plan. Advertisement Defense Minister and Yamina chairman Naftali Bennett called to immediately carry out annexation without hesitation. “History is knocking at the door. Now, the battle moves from the White House in Washington to the cabinet room in Jerusalem — not postponing after the elections, and not settling for partial sovereignty — take everything, and now,” Bennett said in a video released shortly after Trump and Netanyahu’s statements in the White House. According to Bennett, “The president told us tonight: ‘The decision is in your hands — apply Israeli law to all of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] immediately, now, in the next few days, and we the US will recognize sovereignty immediately.'” But Bennett also warned: “To be clear, we will not allow the Israeli government to recognize a Palestinian state under any circumstances. We will not allow Israel to deliver an inch of land to the Arabs. That’s what we’re here for, guarding the Land of Israel.” Netanyahu had touted the plan as “good for Israel and good for peace,” though it includes the creation of a Palestinian state opposed by much of his right-wing base. He promised to abide by the Trump plan, including its stipulation that Israel not build in areas designated for a future Palestinian state under the scheme. Transportation Minister Bezalel Smotrich, chair of the National Union faction within Yamina, also called for immediate annexation, saying, “Dare to win. We will continue to dare and with God’s help win more and more.” Advertisement But, like Bennett, Smotrich also said he would oppose any Palestinian state. “We continue to oppose any kind of Arab sovereignty in the Land of Israel. We do not accept the American program but take the good parts of it,” he said. Shas leader Aryeh Deri released a statement praising the plan and saying that his ultra-Orthodox party would support “the immediate application of sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and the territories of Judea and Samaria at the upcoming government meeting, as approved by the US government this evening.” Saying that, “The right of the people of Israel to it’s land was given historic recognition tonight,” the Shas leader added that “the historic opportunity [to annex parts of the Biblical land of Israel] must not be missed and must not be rejected.” Amir Peretz, leader of the center-left Labor-Gesher-Meretz union, said Israel’s future must be decided in direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, and not via unilateral steps. “We will determine our fate ourselves by direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, which will conclude with an agreement that will secure a Jewish and democratic state within safe borders for future generations,” he said. Peretz added that the timing weeks before a national election means “there is no legitimacy for the government to carry out diplomatic moves, despite American backing, and must be dealt with after the election.” MKs from the predominately Israeli Arab Joint List trashed the peace plan as a step towards potential apartheid rule. Advertisement “Like the separation policy in the southern US, apartheid, the Vietnam War and countless other stains on human history, the occupation will also end and the Palestinian people will live in an independent state alongside the State of Israel,” said Joint List chair Ayman Odeh in a tweet. “In the end, the just demand for equality and peace will overcome the surrender to supremacy and war.” He also released a statement decrying a section of the plan that opens the possibility of transferring areas of northern Israel where Arab citizens live to Palestinian control. “This is the inevitable end point of Trump and Bibi’s racist agenda: a green light to revoke the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arab citizens who live in northern Israel,” he said, using a nickname for Netanyahu. But Yisrael Beytenu leader Avigdor Liberman, who has described Israeli Arabs as a fifth column and has called in the past for giving some Arab towns to a future Palestinian state, said he was happy to see that his idea was adopted in the plan. Joint List MK Yousef Jabareen said in a statement that, “The American deal cannot be a ‘peace plan’ because it perpetuates the occupation of Palestinian lands and ignores the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people for self-determination. Thus, the plan will continue to perpetuate the conflict.” “We in the Joint List call upon international community to reject this plan and to continue to support the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state according to the 1967 borders with its capital in East Jerusalem and removal of the all settlements – which continue to be defined as war crimes according to international law,” Jabareen said. “Importantly, by accepting a state according to the 1967 border, Palestinians will be left with only 22% of the land of historical Palestine. This is an extremely painful compromise; Palestinians should not be required to accept additional compromises.”

News article:
Israel’s government will vote this weekend on annexing 30 percent of the West Bank, a move that comes just after President Trump rolled out his Middle East peace plan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would move forward on Sunday and ask his Cabinet to approve plans to annex West Bank territory, according to The Associated Press. Despite the upcoming vote, Netanyahu’s government signaled annexation may not need to be approved by the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, and that only the Cabinet needs to sign off on the plan. “Basically, this is the lifting of martial law and the implementation of Israeli law,” an Israeli government official told The Washington Post. “This does not require a Knesset decision.” The announcement of the vote came shortly after Trump’s unveiling of his peace plan, which would allow Israel to annex the settlements and the Jordan Valley, which sits at the border between Jordan and the West Bank. Under Trump’s plan, which would be the potential framework for future peace talks, Palestinians would ultimately be given a state that would cover roughly 70 percent of the West Bank plus the Gaza Strip in exchange for the concessions. Palestinians also would be granted other pockets of land in the south of Israel if they meet certain conditions. The White House said a future Palestine would be a “demilitarized” state that would not be allowed to have an army or air force. The territorial concessions, which would be greater than under most other peace plans offered in the past, sparked a firm rejection of the proposal from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday. “After the nonsense that we heard today we say a thousand no’s to the Deal of The Century,” Abbas reportedly said at a press conference in the West Bank. Despite Palestinians’ opposition to the deal, which Arab neighbors later echoed, the Trump administration said Israel did not need to delay annexation until negotiations are held over the plan.

Israel’s government will vote this weekend on annexing 30 percent of the West Bank, a move that comes just after President Trump rolled out his Middle East peace plan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would move forward on Sunday and ask his Cabinet to approve plans to annex West Bank territory, according to The Associated Press. Despite the upcoming vote, Netanyahu’s government signaled annexation may not need to be approved by the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, and that only the Cabinet needs to sign off on the plan. “Basically, this is the lifting of martial law and the implementation of Israeli law,” an Israeli government official told The Washington Post. “This does not require a Knesset decision.” The announcement of the vote came shortly after Trump’s unveiling of his peace plan, which would allow Israel to annex the settlements and the Jordan Valley, which sits at the border between Jordan and the West Bank. Under Trump’s plan, which would be the potential framework for future peace talks, Palestinians would ultimately be given a state that would cover roughly 70 percent of the West Bank plus the Gaza Strip in exchange for the concessions. Palestinians also would be granted other pockets of land in the south of Israel if they meet certain conditions. The White House said a future Palestine would be a “demilitarized” state that would not be allowed to have an army or air force.

* Hawk bids for right-wing vote ahead of Israeli election * Palestinians say Trump gave green light for annexation * Trump plan proposes two-state solution, with conditionsKushner says won't chase Palestinian leadership (adds Palestinian, Kushner quotes) By Stephen Farrell and Ari Rabinovitch JERUSALEM, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A leading government hawk called on Wednesday for Israel to establish sovereignty over nearly a third of the occupied West Bank, hours after U.S. Donald Trump announced a Middle East peace plan that Palestinians said amounted to apartheid. The remarks by Naftali Bennett, a coalition partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government, led Palestinians to say Trump's plan had given the "green light" for Israel to formally annex its settlements in the West Bank that it has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War. Trump's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, but with strict conditions that Palestinians have baulked at. He proposed a four-year schedule for the creation of a Palestinian state, with Palestinians first having to agree to halt attacks by the Islamist militant group Hamas which controls the enclave of Gaza. But the plan also gave U.S. recognition of Israel's West Bank settlements - deemed illegal under international law - Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, and a redrawn, demilitarised Palestinian state that would meet Israel's security requirements. Jerusalem would be the undivided capital of Israel, it said. ELECTION JOSTLING With Netanyahu still outside Israel after attending the plan's presentation in Washington, Bennett outlined his hardline interpretation of what the White House had offered Israel. "Last night history knocked on the door of our home and gave us a one-time opportunity to apply Israeli law on all settlements in Samaria, Judea, the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea," Bennett said, using the Hebrew names for areas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He had ordered a team to be set up to apply Israeli law and sovereignty on all Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Bennett is vying with Netanyahu for support from right-wing voters in an election set for March 2. It is unclear whether the present caretaker administration has a legal mandate to carry out such a move after two inconclusive elections in 2019. Netanyahu on Wednesday reiterated his support for Trump's plan, telling Fox television: "We will not contradict in any way the outline that the president put forward." But Amir Peretz, head of Israel's left-wing Labor Party, said no unilateral plan could work. "Now more than ever it's clear that we need a diplomatic compass," he said. SLAP OF THE CENTURY Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Trump's plan the "slap of the century" after it was announced. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Wednesday Trump's team had simply "copied and pasted" the blueprint that Netanyahu and Israeli settler leaders wanted to see implemented. "It's about annexation, it's about apartheid," he said in Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. "Moving to the de jure annexation of settlements is something that was given the green light yesterday." Palestinians also dismissed the proposal for a capital in Abu Dis, in the West Bank just outside the Israeli municipal borders of Jerusalems. It lies a mile east of the historic walled Old City, home to sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam but cut off by an Israeli wall and checkpoints. Palestinian leaders believe the Trump administration is biased towards Israel. Before announcing the much-touted plan, it had broken from international consensus by recognising disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital, halted aid to the Palestinians, and said it no longer considered the settlements a breach of international law. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and the plan's principal architect, shrugged off the Palestinian rejection. "We're not going to chase the Palestinians...the Palestinian leadership, you can't really treat them like they're a serious government, or capable or competent dealmakers," he told reporters. "They'll do what they've always done, which is screw everything up." The Palestinians could push for a U.N. condemnation of the plan. Israel's U.N. mission signaled on Tuesday it would work to thwart this in a diplomatic campaign with the United States. PALESTINIAN STATE Gaza political analyst Talal Okal said the deal gave Israel the right to take what it wanted "immediately, while the Palestinians have to wait four years to see whether they have rights or not". Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli head of military intelligence said: "This is the most favorable plan for Israel ever presented by an international player." However he said that because it included mention of a two-state solution, it could still cause problems for Netanyahu among his right-wing allies. Bennett seemed to confirm this. "The Israeli government will not recognise a Palestinian state," he said (Additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah, Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza and Ari Rabinovitch and Rami Ayyub in Jerusalem and Michelle Nichols in New York, Editing by Angus MacSwan) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

News article:
Israel has delayed a Cabinet vote to endorse annexation of settlement blocks in the occupied West Bank, which was scheduled for Sunday. That was despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s promise to move quickly to legalise the outposts after US President Donald Trump released his long-awaited peace plan. The plan, a 180-page document rejected by the Palestinians, advocates leaving settlements in occupied East Jerusalem and occupied West Bank in Israel’s hands despite much of the international community regarding them as illegal. Mr Netanyahu said immediately after the plan was introduced that he would ask the Cabinet to advance the extension of Israeli sovereignty over most Jewish settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley. The move would probably spark international outrage and complicate the White House's efforts to build support for the plan. Tourism Minister Yariv Levin told Israel Radio that the Cabinet vote was not technically feasible because of preparations, including "bringing the proposal before the attorney general and letting him consider the matter". But Mr Netanyahu's far-right Cabinet ministers immediately called for annexation. "History is knocking at the door," Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett, a patron of the settler movement, said as he urged Mr Netanyahu to annex all of Israel's settlements and snuff out any hopes for Palestinian independence. "Now the campaign is moving from the White House to the Cabinet room in Jerusalem. Take everything now." The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, on Wednesday took back comments that the Israeli government would be free to exercise annexation over occupied areas with settlements in the West Bank. Mr Friedman said any plans for annexation would require a “US-Israel committee” to review them. He also defended the plan from comparisons to apartheid in endorsing Israel security control and its upper hand in determining the timing of the Palestinian state. “This is the farthest thing from apartheid,” Mr Friedman said. “What the plan contemplates is that the Palestinians will be able to govern themselves.” The document also leaves all of Jerusalem inside the security barrier that lines its eastern flank with Israel, with a Palestinian state outside the wall, and its capital in the under-served Arab communities on the outskirts. Mr Friedman, who was a key donor to the settlements, said the plan did not call for any change to prayer arrangements around the Haram Al Sharif, a key Jerusalem mosque compound that was also the site of ancient Jewish temples. The compound has been often been a flashpoint of violence. Under a "status quo" agreement also involving neighbouring Jordan, Jewish prayer is prevented there, which is a source of frustration for some Israelis. Mr Trump's peace plan proposed that "people of every faith should be permitted to pray" at the disputed site in Jerusalem's Old City. But Mr Friedman described the statement as aspirational for now. "The status quo, in the manner that it is observed today, will continue, absent an agreement to the contrary," he said. "There is nothing in the plan that would impose any alteration in the status quo that is not subject to the agreement of all the parties. "Having said that, as we point out, we would like the region to be more open and free with regard to the exercise of freedom of religion." The Palestinians seek occupied East Jerusalem, which hosts some of the holiest sites in Islam and Judaism, as its capital of a future state. The Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank led a strike on Wednesday to protest against Trump´s Middle East plan. Demonstrations took place in the streets and public squares of Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin, Hebron and Gaza, and other Palestinian cities. Tens of thousands voiced their rejection of Mr Trump’s plan and supported Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s decision to boycott the US administration. The protesters held placards reading, "We will drop your deal and step on it", "Jerusalem is not for sale", and "Trump’s and Netanyahu’s deal will fall". All Palestinian factions issued statements rejecting Mr Trump’s plan and condemning his administration for seeking to entrench the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Mr Levin, a senior member of Mr Netanyahu's Likud party, said the Palestinian state envisioned by the plan was "roughly the same Palestinian Authority that exists today, with authority to manage civil affairs," but lacking "substantive powers" such as border control or a military. The White House had hoped to rally Arab countries around the plan, but so far reactions have been mixed. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, key US allies, welcomed the effort and encouraged negotiations without commenting on the plan. Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel, warned against any Israeli "annexation of Palestinian lands", reaffirming its commitment to an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza with occupied East Jerusalem as its capital. The head of the Arab League said on Wednesday that an initial study of the 50-page plan showed it "ignored legitimate Palestinian rights in the territories". Ahmed Abou Gheit said the Palestinian response would be key in shaping a "collective Arab position" on the plan. "Achieving a just and sustainable peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians depends on the will of both sides," he said. "The peace plan announced by the US president reflected a non-binding US vision." The Palestinian leadership will seek to gain Arab and international support towards their position and against the plan. It called for an urgent meeting with foreign ministers of Arab countries on Saturday, at which Mr Abbas will present the position of "all Palestinians". The meeting will seek to gain a united stance from the Arab League in rejection of Mr Trump’s plan, and any that contradictthe Arab peace initiative and international resolutions. The Palestinian Authority will also head to the UN Security Ciuncil and General Assembly, and the EU, to gain a rejection of the plan and renew international commitment towards resolutions and the two-state solution in line with 1967 lines. "Trump's plan is an assault on international law and on Security Council resolutions and on Palestinians' rights," Jamil Mizher, senior member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told The National. “This so-called peace plan is even worse than the status quo because it seeks to legitimise the occupation under the guise of a peace plan, and they are delusional for wanting the Palestinians to be a part of that." Osama Al Qawasmi, a spokesman for Fatah, said: “The Trump plan is nothing but a farce and the biggest political scam in history.” "The plan, in short, proposes Jerusalem, land, peace and security for Israel, and it proposes for the Palestinians apartheid and occupation." In the US, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren blasted the plan as a “rubber stamp for annexation". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that no Middle East peace plan was perfect, but the one put forward by Mr Trump should be considered by Palestinian leaders. "No peace plan is perfect but this has the merit of a two-state solution," Mr Johnson told Parliament. "It would ensure that Jerusalem is both the capital of Israel and of the Palestinian people." The unveiling of the peace plan came as Mr Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz visited Washington to meet Mr Trump. On Wednesday, a Dutch district court threw out a case alleging war crimes against Mr Gantz, a former Israeli Armed Forces chief. It was launched by a Dutch Palestinian who lost six relatives in an Israeli air strike on Gaza in 2014. The court said it did not have jurisdiction. A civil case for damages was filed referring to universal jurisdiction rules by claimant Ismail Ziada.

Osama Al Qawasmi, a spokesman for Fatah, said: “The Trump plan is nothing but a farce and the biggest political scam in history.” "The plan, in short, proposes Jerusalem, land, peace and security for Israel, and it proposes for the Palestinians apartheid and occupation." In the US, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren blasted the plan as a “rubber stamp for annexation". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that no Middle East peace plan was perfect, but the one put forward by Mr Trump should be considered by Palestinian leaders. "No peace plan is perfect but this has the merit of a two-state solution," Mr Johnson told Parliament. "It would ensure that Jerusalem is both the capital of Israel and of the Palestinian people." The unveiling of the peace plan came as Mr Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz visited Washington to meet Mr Trump. On Wednesday, a Dutch district court threw out a case alleging war crimes against Mr Gantz, a former Israeli Armed Forces chief. It was launched by a Dutch Palestinian who lost six relatives in an Israeli air strike on Gaza in 2014. The court said it did not have jurisdiction. A civil case for damages was filed referring to universal jurisdiction rules by claimant Ismail Ziada.

News article:
Israel has delayed a Cabinet vote to endorse annexation of settlement blocks in the occupied West Bank, which was scheduled for Sunday. That was despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s promise to move quickly to legalise the outposts after US President Donald Trump released his long-awaited peace plan. The plan, a 180-page document rejected by the Palestinians, advocates leaving settlements in occupied East Jerusalem and occupied West Bank in Israel’s hands despite much of the international community regarding them as illegal. Mr Netanyahu said immediately after the plan was introduced that he would ask the Cabinet to advance the extension of Israeli sovereignty over most Jewish settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley. The move would probably spark international outrage and complicate the White House's efforts to build support for the plan. Tourism Minister Yariv Levin told Israel Radio that the Cabinet vote was not technically feasible because of preparations, including "bringing the proposal before the attorney general and letting him consider the matter". But Mr Netanyahu's far-right Cabinet ministers immediately called for annexation. "History is knocking at the door," Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett, a patron of the settler movement, said as he urged Mr Netanyahu to annex all of Israel's settlements and snuff out any hopes for Palestinian independence. "Now the campaign is moving from the White House to the Cabinet room in Jerusalem. Take everything now." The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, on Wednesday took back comments that the Israeli government would be free to exercise annexation over occupied areas with settlements in the West Bank. Mr Friedman said any plans for annexation would require a “US-Israel committee” to review them. He also defended the plan from comparisons to apartheid in endorsing Israel security control and its upper hand in determining the timing of the Palestinian state. “This is the farthest thing from apartheid,” Mr Friedman said. “What the plan contemplates is that the Palestinians will be able to govern themselves.” The document also leaves all of Jerusalem inside the security barrier that lines its eastern flank with Israel, with a Palestinian state outside the wall, and its capital in the under-served Arab communities on the outskirts. Mr Friedman, who was a key donor to the settlements, said the plan did not call for any change to prayer arrangements around the Haram Al Sharif, a key Jerusalem mosque compound that was also the site of ancient Jewish temples. The compound has been often been a flashpoint of violence. Under a "status quo" agreement also involving neighbouring Jordan, Jewish prayer is prevented there, which is a source of frustration for some Israelis. Mr Trump's peace plan proposed that "people of every faith should be permitted to pray" at the disputed site in Jerusalem's Old City. But Mr Friedman described the statement as aspirational for now. "The status quo, in the manner that it is observed today, will continue, absent an agreement to the contrary," he said. "There is nothing in the plan that would impose any alteration in the status quo that is not subject to the agreement of all the parties. "Having said that, as we point out, we would like the region to be more open and free with regard to the exercise of freedom of religion." The Palestinians seek occupied East Jerusalem, which hosts some of the holiest sites in Islam and Judaism, as its capital of a future state. The Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank led a strike on Wednesday to protest against Trump´s Middle East plan. Demonstrations took place in the streets and public squares of Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin, Hebron and Gaza, and other Palestinian cities. Tens of thousands voiced their rejection of Mr Trump’s plan and supported Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s decision to boycott the US administration. The protesters held placards reading, "We will drop your deal and step on it", "Jerusalem is not for sale", and "Trump’s and Netanyahu’s deal will fall". All Palestinian factions issued statements rejecting Mr Trump’s plan and condemning his administration for seeking to entrench the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Mr Levin, a senior member of Mr Netanyahu's Likud party, said the Palestinian state envisioned by the plan was "roughly the same Palestinian Authority that exists today, with authority to manage civil affairs," but lacking "substantive powers" such as border control or a military. The White House had hoped to rally Arab countries around the plan, but so far reactions have been mixed. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, key US allies, welcomed the effort and encouraged negotiations without commenting on the plan. Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel, warned against any Israeli "annexation of Palestinian lands", reaffirming its commitment to an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza with occupied East Jerusalem as its capital. The head of the Arab League said on Wednesday that an initial study of the 50-page plan showed it "ignored legitimate Palestinian rights in the territories". Ahmed Abou Gheit said the Palestinian response would be key in shaping a "collective Arab position" on the plan. "Achieving a just and sustainable peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians depends on the will of both sides," he said. "The peace plan announced by the US president reflected a non-binding US vision." The Palestinian leadership will seek to gain Arab and international support towards their position and against the plan. It called for an urgent meeting with foreign ministers of Arab countries on Saturday, at which Mr Abbas will present the position of "all Palestinians". The meeting will seek to gain a united stance from the Arab League in rejection of Mr Trump’s plan, and any that contradictthe Arab peace initiative and international resolutions. The Palestinian Authority will also head to the UN Security Ciuncil and General Assembly, and the EU, to gain a rejection of the plan and renew international commitment towards resolutions and the two-state solution in line with 1967 lines. "Trump's plan is an assault on international law and on Security Council resolutions and on Palestinians' rights," Jamil Mizher, senior member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told The National. “This so-called peace plan is even worse than the status quo because it seeks to legitimise the occupation under the guise of a peace plan, and they are delusional for wanting the Palestinians to be a part of that."

With the release of US President Donald Trump’s long-awaited plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior members of the Israeli government called for the immediate annexation of the Jordan Valley and Jewish settlements in the West Bank. In the following hours, however, lawmakers began walking back those calls somewhat as Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he had to review the move as it may contradict the widely accepted view that caretaker governments are not meant to take such dramatic policy steps. The United States has also appeared to call for Israel to not begin the annexation process immediately, but to coordinate such a move through an as-yet-to-be-created joint committee. There is no concrete legal proscription that explicitly forbids the government’s annexation plans, but there are historical precedents against such a move. In cases concerning the powers of transitional governments, the High Court of Justice has maintained that these caretaker administrations are meant to strike a balance “between restraint and action.” This is seen as especially true for the current government, which did not win majority support in the last election and thus does not truly represent the democratic will of the people. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Court has ruled that while there are no formal limits on an interim government’s powers, it should only take actions beyond the public need “in cases in which an ‘essential public need’ demands immediate action and cannot be delayed until after the elections,” according to legal scholars Amichai Cohen and Amir Fuchs of the Israel Democracy Institute. An example of this would be the Israeli airstrike on the Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981, three weeks before parliamentary elections, which represented a significant military operation that had the potential to spark a war but had clear defense value. One of the more direct parallels to the current situation occurred in 2000, when Ehud Barak, who had recently dissolved his government, attempted to enter negotiations with Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat. A petition was filed to block the move, arguing that Barak was overstepping his bounds as an interim prime minister. The Court, under Justice Aharon Barak, rejected the appeal, allowing the prime minister to continue negotiations. Advertisement In that case, however, Ehud Barak’s attorney general told the Court that he would bring any proposed peace agreement to a vote in the Knesset before passage. Ultimately, the matter was for nought as the peace talks failed, with Arafat rejecting Barak’s offer. Now, the government may attempt to argue that there is a pressing need to act quickly in order to annex the Jordan Valley and Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as US support may waver on the matter or other external factors may prevent Israel from going forward with the plan in the future. If accepted, this could lead to the somewhat bizarre situation in which the current government is legally unable to easily perform simple budgetary actions like subsidize afternoon preschools or provide start-up grants to Israeli technology companies, but could radically alter the dynamics in the West Bank with a unilateral annexation. Though this is not necessarily a winning argument. According to Cohen and Fuchs, “it is unlikely that a government decision to carry out an annexation will be approved by the Supreme Court.” In his comments on the matter, Mandelblit was more circumspect. Advertisement “If a request is filed, I will examine it from a legal perspective. I don’t rule out anything. I will hear what the request is and what the explanation is for the urgency, and I will decide on that basis,” said Mandelblit on Tuesday, who earlier in the day filed an indictment against Netanyahu with the Jerusalem District Court in three corruption cases after the premier withdrew his request for immunity from prosecution. Of course, even if Mandelblit approves the annexation, the matter would almost certainly be challenged in court and could be blocked there. In order to avoid such an argument, the government could try a different tack: bringing the matter to a vote in the Knesset. Though formally disbanded, the parliament could be brought in to vote on annexation if it gets approval from the Arrangements Committee, which is responsible for procedural matters of the Knesset. If such a proposition were passed in the Knesset — a possibility but by no means a certainty — there would be no real legal recourse to prevent annexation.

News article:
Defense Minister Naftali Bennett on Wednesday announced that he had established a special team to lead the effort to annex West Bank Jewish settlements, the Jordan Valley and the area around the Dead Sea, following the release of US President Donald Trump’s plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bennett called for the interim government to begin annexing parts of the West Bank immediately, before the March 2 elections, despite the apparent contradiction with the widely accepted legal view that caretaker governments are not meant to make such dramatic policy steps. On Tuesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring a vote on annexing Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley to the cabinet on Sunday, though in the hours since then, other members of his party have walked back the timing of the vote, saying it would likely be delayed, in order to allow Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit sufficient time to weigh in on the matter. “Last night, people around the prime minister announced that the decision on sovereignty [over the Jordan Valley and settlements] would come to a vote on Sunday. This morning we’re hearing a different tune,” Bennett said, speaking at the annual conference of the Institute for National Security Studies think tank in Tel Aviv. The defense minister, who is head of the Yamina bloc of religious right-wing parties, said he would “not miss this opportunity” to annex portions of the West Bank. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “I will be clear: Whatever is postponed until after the elections will never happen. We all understand this,” Bennett said. “Therefore, I am announcing this morning that I ordered the formation of a special team to apply and carry out the implementation of Israeli law and sovereignty over all Jewish settlements in Judea and Samara, over the Jordan Valley, and the hotels around the Dead Sea,” he said, using the biblical term for the West Bank. The defense minister said the team would consist of representatives from the Israel Defense Forces, the Defense Ministry, various government offices and other security services. Advertisement On Sunday, the Defense Ministry refused to comment on whether it was making preparations for annexations in the West Bank, saying that the matter was “too political” to discuss given the upcoming election. Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, who is one of the plan’s architects, told CNN in an interview on Tuesday that he did not believe Israel would approve the annexations on Sunday, “at least not as far as I know.” Mandelblit said Tuesday night that he could rule in favor of a transitional government approving an annexation. “My point of view is that I need to help the government implement its policy and that has rules — restraint must be maintained during a transitional government,” said Mandelblit, who earlier in the day filed an indictment against Netanyahu with the Jerusalem District Court in three corruption cases after the premier withdrew his request for immunity from prosecution. “If a request is filed, I will examine it from a legal perspective,” he added. “I don’t rule out anything. I will hear what the request is and what the explanation is for the urgency, and I will decide on that basis.” The Ynet news site cited an unsourced estimation that Mandelblit would likely say the annexation was legal, but point out legal difficulties in making such a dramatic decision. It quoted a decision from almost 20 years ago, when attorney general Elyakim Rubinstein told prime minister Ehud Barak that there was no legal impediment to holding negotiations with the Palestinians during a transitional government, but that the timing was nevertheless inappropriate. Advertisement Former justice minister Ayelet Shaked, also a member of Bennett’s Yamina, said Wednesday, in an interview with Army Radio, that “Mandelblit will not block a historic move, such as applying [Israeli] sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. “All the restrictions on transitional governments have descended from court rulings that began 20 years ago and reins placed by legal advisers. It has no anchoring in the law,” she added. Netanyahu told reporters in Washington that the US had agreed to Israel’s immediate annexation of “additional areas” of the West Bank that are adjacent to the settlements. However, he said that Israel will not apply sovereignty immediately, but during a second phase, at a yet-undetermined time. “We need to do some work to define exactly [what we will annex],” he said. Netanyahu’s main rival, Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party, has said it would only support implementing the contours of the plan after the March 2 election. Breaking with past US administrations, the plan envisions the creation of a Palestinian state in part of the West Bank, a handful of neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and some areas of southern Israel — on condition that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and Hamas and other terror groups in the Gaza Strip disarm. The plan also calls for allowing Israel to annex settlements, granting the Jewish state sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and ongoing overall security control west of the Jordan River, and barring Palestinians from entering Israel as refugees.

News article:
JERUSALEM: Questions surfaced Thursday over whether Israel would immediately seek to annex parts of the West Bank, after US President Donald Trump’s controversial peace plan called for extending Israeli sovereignty to the area. The plan, seen as overwhelmingly supportive of Israeli goals, has been firmly rejected by the Palestinians. It gives the Jewish state a US green light to annex key parts of the occupied West Bank, including in the strategic Jordan Valley. But uncertainty was mounting over Israel’s next moves. After Trump unveiled his long-awaited plan in Washington on Tuesday, his ambassador to Israel David Friedman said the Jewish state “does not have to wait at all.” Israeli officials then said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch Trump ally, would seek cabinet approval on Sunday to annex settlements and territory that would be part of Israel under the US plan. But Jared Kushner — Trump’s adviser and son-in-law who spearheaded the Middle East initiative — said that Washington does not want any moves made before Israel’s March 2 election. Asked about the timing of any annexations in an interview with Gzero media, Kushner said: “The hope is they will wait until after the election. “We’ll start working on the technical stuff now, but I think we’d need an Israeli government in place in order to move forward,” he added. Netanyahu currently heads a caretaker government after his Likud failed to win a majority in two elections over the past year. Likud is again running neck-and-neck in the polls with the centrist Blue and White party led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz and it remains unclear if either bloc will be able to form a government following a new election scheduled for March. The Israeli premier also faces graft charges as he battles for re-election. Netanyahu’s office declined to comment when asked if the annexation issue remained on the agenda for Sunday’s cabinet meeting. The international community views Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank as illegal and an attempt to formally place them under Israeli sovereignty would likely trigger further global uproar. Netanyahu was however facing calls from the Israeli right to act. “Whatever will be delayed until after the election won’t ever happen. Everyone understands that. Every settlement, every yard of land that will be postponed to after the election will remain out (of Israel) for another 50 years,” Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said Wednesday. “If we delay or diminish applying sovereignty, the opportunity of the century will become the miss of the century.” Netanyahu was in Moscow on Thursday seeking to broaden international support for Israel’s ambitions. Tourism Minister Yariv Levin, who was traveling with him, told army radio that the government wanted to move on annexation “as quickly as possible, in a number of days.” At the start of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Netanyahu said Trump’s initiative offered “a new and perhaps unique opportunity,” without mentioning annexation. The Russian leader did not mention the peace plan at all in his public remarks. Meanwhile, Israel’s army announced that it had deployed extra troops to the West Bank and around the Gaza Strip ahead of any further Palestinian demonstrations against the Trump plan. The protests have been relatively muted since the Trump announcement, with only isolated clashes reported. But one rocket was fired from the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip on Wednesday evening. In response, Israeli aircraft struck a “number of Hamas terror targets” in the southern Gaza Strip, the army said. An Israeli military official told AFP the decision to deploy extra troops to the West Bank and the Gaza border was made “to minimize the risk of a flareup.” And police said they had decided to boost their forces in and around Jerusalem ahead of Friday prayers on the volatile Al-Aqsa mosque compound.

But Jared Kushner — Trump’s adviser and son-in-law who spearheaded the Middle East initiative — said that Washington does not want any moves made before Israel’s March 2 election. Asked about the timing of any annexations in an interview with Gzero media, Kushner said: “The hope is they will wait until after the election. “We’ll start working on the technical stuff now, but I think we’d need an Israeli government in place in order to move forward,” he added. Netanyahu currently heads a caretaker government after his Likud failed to win a majority in two elections over the past year. Likud is again running neck-and-neck in the polls with the centrist Blue and White party led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz and it remains unclear if either bloc will be able to form a government following a new election scheduled for March. The Israeli premier also faces graft charges as he battles for re-election. Netanyahu’s office declined to comment when asked if the annexation issue remained on the agenda for Sunday’s cabinet meeting. The international community views Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank as illegal and an attempt to formally place them under Israeli sovereignty would likely trigger further global uproar. Netanyahu was however facing calls from the Israeli right to act. “Whatever will be delayed until after the election won’t ever happen. Everyone understands that. Every settlement, every yard of land that will be postponed to after the election will remain out (of Israel) for another 50 years,” Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said Wednesday. “If we delay or diminish applying sovereignty, the opportunity of the century will become the miss of the century.” Netanyahu was in Moscow on Thursday seeking to broaden international support for Israel’s ambitions. Tourism Minister Yariv Levin, who was traveling with him, told army radio that the government wanted to move on annexation “as quickly as possible, in a number of days.” At the start of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Netanyahu said Trump’s initiative offered “a new and perhaps unique opportunity,” without mentioning annexation. The Russian leader did not mention the peace plan at all in his public remarks. Meanwhile, Israel’s army announced that it had deployed extra troops to the West Bank and around the Gaza Strip ahead of any further Palestinian demonstrations against the Trump plan. The protests have been relatively muted since the Trump announcement, with only isolated clashes reported. But one rocket was fired from the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip on Wednesday evening. In response, Israeli aircraft struck a “number of Hamas terror targets” in the southern Gaza Strip, the army said. An Israeli military official told AFP the decision to deploy extra troops to the West Bank and the Gaza border was made “to minimize the risk of a flareup.” And police said they had decided to boost their forces in and around Jerusalem ahead of Friday prayers on the volatile Al-Aqsa mosque compound.

News article:
Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) President Morton A. Klein and ZOA Chair Mark Levenson, Esq. on Friday urged Israel to immediately apply Israeli sovereignty to all of Judea and Samaria. In a statement, ZOA wrote: "ZOA President Morton Klein was proud be at the White House ceremony this week with President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister [Binyamin] when they announced the plan to end the Arab/Islamic war against Israel." "Klein and top Christian and Jewish leaders also attended a small meeting at the White House with top Administration officials discussing the plan in greater detail. Shortly after the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that Israel would quickly declare its sovereignty over Jewish communities in Judea/Samaria and the Jordan Valley. "The ZOA is disappointed to now read the reports that Israel’s exercise of her lawful sovereignty over Jewish communities in Judea/Samaria and the Jordan Valley, and US recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over these areas, is once again being delayed, until after the March 2, 2020 election; after Israel forms a government (which may take a very long time); after aerial photographs are taken; after a joint US-Israeli committee is formed and discusses various parameters; and after, and after. . . . "There is no reason for additional delay! "Israel has already delayed exercising her lawful sovereignty over Judea-Samaria and the Jordan Valley for over half a century. Almost 53 years have passed since Israel recaptured these lawful, historic, sacred, G-D given, international law approved Jewish lands in a defensive war, ending Jordan’s 19-year illegal occupation of Judea-Samaria. The 450,000 Jewish Israelis living in Judea-Samaria are entitled to have their homes fully integrated into, and recognized as part of the Jewish state. "The fact that Israel’s current interim current government supports exercising sovereignty is sufficient reason to move forward immediately. Last summer, the plan was to exercise sovereignty after the September 2019 election. But here we are again, Israel waiting to exercise Israel’s lawful rights until some indeterminate time after yet another election. And the polls indicate that Israel’s third election, in less than a year, may well result in another deadlock. "As for committees, we’re all familiar with the interminable delays that may be produced by committees. The laudatory and favorable portions of the Trump Peace Plan should not be subjected to such delays. At a very minimum, sovereignty should immediately begin to be implemented in stages." ZOA also quoted the US Treaty Obligation to Recognize Israel’s Sovereignty: "As ZOA has frequently pointed out, the 1924 Anglo-American Convention [Treaty] affirmed the mandate (trusteeship) to 'secure the establishment of the Jewish national home' and 'close settlement by Jews on the land' in the areas that include Judea-Samaria (and Jerusalem and the rest of Israel, etc.)." "The Convention was ratified by the US Senate, and signed by then-President Calvin Coolidge, making it a binding US treaty obligation-to this day! This binding US treaty, which guaranteed the Jewish people's rights, was never lawfully overturned. It follows that the US government is lawfully bound to recognize Israel’s sovereignty, and should do so with no further delay, especially since US leaders this week proclaimed their support for Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and every single Jewish community in Judea Samaria."

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — After Sunday’s Cabinet meeting was canceled – apparently over disagreements between Israel and the United States over the schedule of annexation of areas of Yehudah and Shomron – a report on Channel 13 said that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu planned to bring the entire “deal of the century” peace plan to the Cabinet for approval. The hope is that if the plan is adopted, the U.S. will give its blessing to annexation before the March 2 election. Netanyahu had planned to bring the annexation part of the plan to a vote separately from the rest of the plan, which gives Israeli consent to the establishment of a Palestinian state, if the conditions for establishment of that state are fulfilled – including the Palestinians’ recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, and the end of payments by the Palestinian Authority to terrorists and their families. While there is widespread support among the right, and in Yisrael Beytenu, for the annexation part of the plan, the rest of the plan is likely to be less popular. Netanyahu believes that if the Cabinet approves the plan, Washington will relent and allow at least one stage of the annexation to go through. After the momentum achieved at the presentation of the plan last week, Netanyahu is determined to at least begin the annexation process, although it’s highly unlikely that it will be completed before the election. The Yesha Council on Sunday launched an emergency campaign for imposition of sovereignty on areas of Yehudah and Shomron this week, saying that if it is not accomplished now, it will never happen. Naftali Bennett’s Yemina party on Thursday reiterated the need for a quick imposition of Israeli sovereignty on Jewish communities in Yehudah and Shomron – immediately, before the March elections. “Missing this opportunity would be a terrible blow to Jewish settlement, to the half a million Jews in Yehudah, Shomron and the Jordan Valley. Sovereignty is at our fingertips, we dare not miss the opportunity,” the party said in a statement. Meanwhile, Channel 12 said that the head of the CIA, Gina Haspel, has promised Palestinian Authority chief Mahmoud Abbas that her organization would work to prevent any annexation before the election. Haspel urged Abbas not to make any “hasty decisions” regarding the PA’s security cooperation with Israel and the U.S. At a meeting of the Arab League Saturday, Abbas said that the PA “ will not accept this framework under any circumstances, and I say directly that if Israel and the U.S. continue to violate the agreements with us, we will break off relations altogether, including security cooperation.” Over the past two years, the U.S. and the PA have communicated chiefly via the CIA. The PA has refused to meet with American diplomatic staff in the region, as the Authority is boycotting the U.S. administration.

Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett told settler leaders yesterday that the government is preparing for the annexation of occupied West Bank territory, reported the Jerusalem Post. According to the site, Bennett met with the leadership yesterday "prior to his departure for Washington". Bennett, whose ministry would play a key part in practical preparations for annexation, told settler leaders "that he supported the application of sovereignty now, irrespective of the US position, and that he would personally discuss the matter with the prime minister upon his return" from the US. "Bennett also told the settler leaders that he had created a team to prepare his ministry for the application of sovereignty," the Jerusalem Post added. READ: The annexation of the West Bank is coming Yossi Dagan, head of the settlers' so-called Samaria Regional Council, said he had also met separately with Bennett to affirm the need to move on annexation immediately. Dagan sent a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday telling him, "we chose you Mr. Prime Minister, not [US President Donald] Trump and not even [US special envoy Jared] Kushner". Meanwhile, in the Jordan Valley region of the occupied West Bank, the head of the settlers' Yesha Council, David Elhayani, "also demanded a sovereignty vote, or at the very least a vote on the application of sovereignty to the valley". READ: The West Bank was and still is the primary battleground of Israel "After 53 years, the time has come to apply sovereignty," Elhayani said. As explained by the Post, "settler leaders are pushing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ignore a White House directive not to apply Israeli sovereignty to West Bank settlements [i.e. annexation]" until after Israel's forthcoming 2 March elections. "Netanyahu had initially said he would bring it to a cabinet vote, but has since held off. No cabinet meeting has been scheduled so far this week," the report added.

Dagan sent a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday telling him, "we chose you Mr. Prime Minister, not [US President Donald] Trump and not even [US special envoy Jared] Kushner". Meanwhile, in the Jordan Valley region of the occupied West Bank, the head of the settlers' Yesha Council, David Elhayani, "also demanded a sovereignty vote, or at the very least a vote on the application of sovereignty to the valley". READ: The West Bank was and still is the primary battleground of Israel "After 53 years, the time has come to apply sovereignty," Elhayani said. As explained by the Post, "settler leaders are pushing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ignore a White House directive not to apply Israeli sovereignty to West Bank settlements [i.e. annexation]" until after Israel's forthcoming 2 March elections. "Netanyahu had initially said he would bring it to a cabinet vote, but has since held off. No cabinet meeting has been scheduled so far this week," the report added.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday suggested that he would advance applying Israeli sovereignty to parts of the West Bank only after the March 2 elections. At a campaign event in Beit Shemesh, Netanyahu urged attendees to help him get elected in the upcoming national vote, saying that a victory would allow his Likud party to gain approval for the Trump administration peace plan. The remarks were at odds with Netanyahu’s earlier vow to annex territory immediately following the plan’s release on January 28. The idea of immediate Israeli annexation was opposed by President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Jared Kushner. “If we win, when we win, we’ll continue to make history. As soon as we win, we’ll apply Israeli law to all of the Jewish communities in the Jordan Valley and in Judea and Samaria,” Netanyahu said, using Biblical terms for the West Bank. “We, the Likud, won’t let this great opportunity slip from our grasp. But in order to guarantee it, in order to guarantee Israel’s borders, in order to guarantee the future of Israel, I need every Likud member this time around to go out and vote and get others out to vote. This time we’re getting everyone out of the house, we’re not leaving anyone behind,” Netanyahu said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Trump’s plan envisions the Jewish state annexing key parts of the West Bank, including in the strategic Jordan Valley and all the settlements. The outline would see the eventual creation of a Palestinian state, with restricted sovereignty, over some 70 percent of the West Bank, without most of East Jerusalem, falling far short of minimal Palestinian demands. The Palestinians have firmly rejected the plan, with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas calling it the “slap of the century.” Netanyahu and the US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said hours after the plan was introduced on January 28 that Israel had the green light to immediately being annexing the West Bank areas allocated to it. Advertisement Distancing the White House from Israel’s position, however, Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Kushner made clear that the US expects Israel to wait until after the March 2 Knesset elections, at least, before doing so. Kushner said in an interview published on January 29 that such a decision would take several months, and that the Trump administration would not support a Knesset resolution before the election. “The hope is that they’ll wait until after the election, and we’ll work with them to try to come up with something,” Kushner said. Asked whether the Trump administration would support an immediate decision by Israel to annex the Jordan Valley and West Bank settlements, Kushner answered “no” and elaborated that “we would need an Israeli government in place” before moving forward. Friedman the same day suggested that it may take time before Israel can move forward with annexation plans, stressing that an Israeli-American committee to discuss the exact parameters of the ostensible annexation must be established first before Jerusalem can go ahead with its plans. The day before, Friedman had said that Israel was free to start annexing West Bank settlements right away. Following the plan’s unveiling at the White House, Netanyahu said he wanted to bring the annexation proposal for a vote at a cabinet meeting days later, but Likud MK Yariv Levin said that there were still several bureaucratic hurdles to leap, including “bringing the proposal before the attorney general and letting him consider the matter.” Advertisement A Likud official speaking on the condition of anonymity appeared to pour additional cold water on the possibility of an imminent annexation vote, saying “the PMO is working hard to prepare the [sovereignty cabinet] decision. This is complex work that includes maps and aerial photographs. We hope to complete it as soon as possible.” It is unclear whether Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit would okay such a move being made by a transitional government, which is largely limited from carrying out irreversible decisions. “My point of view is that I need to help the government implement its policy and that has rules — restraint must be maintained during a transitional government,” said Mandelblit at an Institute for International Security Studies conference hours before the plan’s release. “If a request is filed, I will examine it from a legal perspective,” he said in response to a question on whether he would allow the cabinet to move forward with annexation. “I don’t rule anything out. I will hear what the request is and what the explanation is for the urgency, and I will decide on that basis.” Defense Minister Naftali Bennett announced a day after the plan’s release that he had established a special team to lead the effort to annex West Bank Jewish settlements, the Jordan Valley and the area around the Dead Sea. Bennett called for the interim government to begin annexing parts of the West Bank immediately, before the March 2 elections. Netanyahu’s main rival, Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party, has said it would only support implementing the contours of the plan after the election, and would do so in coordination with the Palestinians, Egypt, Jordan and other players rather than unilaterally. Breaking with past US administrations, the plan envisions the creation of a Palestinian state in part of the West Bank, a handful of neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and some areas of southern Israel — on condition that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and Hamas and other terror groups in the Gaza Strip disarm. Advertisement The plan also calls for granting Israel ongoing overall security control west of the Jordan River, and barring Palestinians from entering Israel as refugees. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and East Jerusalem — areas captured by Israel in the 1967 war — for an independent state and the removal of more than 700,000 Israelis from these areas.

News article:
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has begun to draw up maps of land in the occupied West Bank that will be annexed in accordance with U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed peace plan, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday. Slideshow ( 3 images ) “We are already at the height of the process of mapping the area that, according to the Trump plan, will become part of the state of Israel. It won’t take too long,” Netanyahu said at an election campaign rally in the Maale Adumim settlement. Netanyahu said the area would include all Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in the 1967 Middle East war but which Palestinians want in a future state. “The only map that can be accepted as the map of Palestine is the map of the Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital,” said Nabil Abu Rdainah, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Prospects for annexations, which have already been widely condemned, are unclear. Israel will hold a national election on March 2 and Netanyahu, who is facing criminal corruption charges, is hoping to win a fifth term in office. He presently heads a caretaker government, whose legal authority to annex territory is still undecided by judicial authorities. Settlers make up part of Netanyahu’s right-wing voter base and many members of his coalition cabinet view the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people. Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in war to be a violation of international law. Trump has changed U.S. policy to withdraw such objections. Palestinians say the settlements make a future state non-viable. Israel cites security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land on which they are built. Trump’s plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, but it includes strict conditions that Palestinians reject. The blueprint gives Israel much of what it has long sought, including U.S. recognition of settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. A redrawn, demilitarized Palestinian state would be subject to Israeli control over its security, and would receive tracts of desert in return for arable land settled by Israelis. Right after Trump presented the plan on Jan. 28, Netanyahu said his government would begin extending Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the Jordan Valley within days. But Washington then appeared to put the breaks on that and Netanyahu has since faced pressure from settler leaders to annex territory despite any U.S. objections.

News article:
Unilateral Israeli steps to annex West Bank land would endanger US support for such plans, America’s Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said on Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said over the weekend that Israel had begun drawing up maps for annexing land in the West Bank, which Palestinians seek for a state, in accordance with US President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan. "President Trump's Vision for Peace is the product of more than three years of close consultations among the President, PM Netanyahu and their respective senior staff," Mr Friedman said on Twitter. "Israel is subject to the completion [of] a mapping process by a joint Israeli-American committee. Any unilateral action in advance of the completion of the committee process endangers the Plan & American recognition," Mr Friedman said. That process will probably not be completed before Israel's March 2 election, Mr Friedman later told reporters in Jerusalem. Right after Mr Trump presented the plan on January 28, Mr Netanyahu said his government would begin extending Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the Jordan Valley within days. But Washington then appeared to put the brakes on that and Mr Netanyahu has since faced pressure from settler leaders to annex territory despite any US objections. Although Mr Trump's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, it includes strict conditions that the Palestinians have rejected out of hand. Expand Autoplay Palestinian protesters burn Israeli flags during a demonstration against US President Donald Trump's Middle East peace proposal in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. AFP The blueprint gives Israel much of what it has long sought, including US recognition of settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. Settlers make up part of Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing voter base and many members of his coalition cabinet view the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people. As the election nears, pressure has mounted on Mr Netanyahu from settler leaders, and members of his right-wing cabinet with whom he is competing for votes, to move ahead with annexations before the ballot, despite White House calls to hold off. Mr Friedman's remarks appeared to provide Mr Netanyahu with some defence against those pressures. "The [US] recognition is the main thing and we don't want to endanger that," Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday. He said the annexed area would include all Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley – territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in the 1967 Middle East war but which Palestinians want in a future state. Right after Mr Trump presented the plan on January 28, Mr Netanyahu signalled his government would begin extending Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the Jordan Valley within days. But on Saturday Mr Netanyahu appeared to row back. "We've been waiting since 1967 and some people are making a big deal out of a few weeks," Mr Netanyahu said at the rally. Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in war to be a violation of international law. Mr Trump has changed US policy to withdraw such objections and the prospect of Israeli annexations have drawn widespread condemnation. Palestinians say the settlements make a future state unviable. Israel cites security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land on which they are built.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said over the weekend that Israel had begun drawing up maps for annexing land in the West Bank, which Palestinians seek for a state, in accordance with US President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan. "President Trump's Vision for Peace is the product of more than three years of close consultations among the President, PM Netanyahu and their respective senior staff," Mr Friedman said on Twitter. "Israel is subject to the completion [of] a mapping process by a joint Israeli-American committee. Any unilateral action in advance of the completion of the committee process endangers the Plan & American recognition," Mr Friedman said. That process will probably not be completed before Israel's March 2 election, Mr Friedman later told reporters in Jerusalem. Right after Mr Trump presented the plan on January 28, Mr Netanyahu said his government would begin extending Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the Jordan Valley within days. But Washington then appeared to put the brakes on that and Mr Netanyahu has since faced pressure from settler leaders to annex territory despite any US objections. Although Mr Trump's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, it includes strict conditions that the Palestinians have rejected out of hand.

AFP The blueprint gives Israel much of what it has long sought, including US recognition of settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. Settlers make up part of Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing voter base and many members of his coalition cabinet view the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people. As the election nears, pressure has mounted on Mr Netanyahu from settler leaders, and members of his right-wing cabinet with whom he is competing for votes, to move ahead with annexations before the ballot, despite White House calls to hold off. Mr Friedman's remarks appeared to provide Mr Netanyahu with some defence against those pressures. "The [US] recognition is the main thing and we don't want to endanger that," Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday. He said the annexed area would include all Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley – territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in the 1967 Middle East war but which Palestinians want in a future state. Right after Mr Trump presented the plan on January 28, Mr Netanyahu signalled his government would begin extending Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the Jordan Valley within days. But on Saturday Mr Netanyahu appeared to row back. "We've been waiting since 1967 and some people are making a big deal out of a few weeks," Mr Netanyahu said at the rally. Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in war to be a violation of international law. Mr Trump has changed US policy to withdraw such objections and the prospect of Israeli annexations have drawn widespread condemnation. Palestinians say the settlements make a future state unviable. Israel cites security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land on which they are built.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country is in the process of mapping areas of the West Bank that would be subjected to an extension of Israeli sovereignty, following the publication of US President Donald Trump’s peace plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, The Times of Israel reported. “We’re already in the process of mapping the territory that according to the Trump plan will be part of the State of Israel”, Netanyahu reportedly said during his party’s campaign event on Saturday. “This won’t take a lot of time and we’ll complete this”. “Don’t be mistaken, the Americans will go along with this, President Trump will go along with this”, the Israeli prime minister purportedly added. On 18 January, Donald Trump unveiled his long-anticipated peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict branded the “deal of the century”. The plan recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capital and acknowledged Tel Aviv’s sovereignty over numerous settlements in the West Bank that are home to an estimated 400,000 Israelis and 2 million Palestinians. Officials from the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) have repeatedly called the settlements illegal, and the UN has said they are a violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention.

Prime Minister Netanyahu addresses his push to apply Israeli sovereignty over areas of the West Bank, indicating Israel has independently begun mapping territory while appearing to concede that annexation of these areas can’t move forward without US approval. “In Washington, on my last visit, we made history. We brought an American plan according to which the US will recognize our sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, northern Dead Sea, all the settlements in Judea and Samaria without exception… and a large area enveloping it,” he says at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting. “This requires precise mapping of these areas, the entire territory,” Netanyahu continues. “The work has begun, the Israeli team has already started, the train set out and this work will be completed.” Netanyahu insists the Trump administration will eventually back Israel annexation of these areas, but acknowledges it won’t happen until the mapping process is complete — despite his vow to bring the matter for government approval within days of the Trump plan’s unveiling. “The US and we agreed that when this entire process is completed we’ll bring it to the government [for approval]. But the Americans are saying in the clearest manner: ‘We want to give you recognition and we’ll give you it when the entire process is complete,'” he says. “Recognition is the main thing. We brought this, I brought this,” the premier adds. “We don’t want to endanger this. We are working responsibility and intelligently.” Netanyahu also takes a shot at pro-settlement lawmakers he is allied with who are calling for Israel to annex these areas immediately. “For all the tweeters outside and even inside the government — we did the work, we’ll complete the work and therefore the work has begun and it will be completed, I hope very soon,” he says.

(photo: Oranit settlement near Qalqilya, northern occupied West Bank) The National Bureau for defending land and resisting settlements stated, in its latest weekly report, that US President Donald Trump’s adviser, Jared Kushner recently announced that Israel won’t annex Palestinian lands before the upcoming Knesset elections, thereby explaining the controversy among Likud, the government, and settlers regarding the annexation projects that the US administration stipulated in the so-called ‘Deal of the Century’. Kushner’s statements came as Netanyahu expressed his willingness to annex Palestinian lands to Israel before the upcoming Knesset elections scheduled for the 2nd of next March, PNN further reports. At the same time, the heads of settlement councils demanded, during their meeting with Netanyahu, to impose Israeli sovereignty over the settlements in the occupied West Bank without coordination with the United States of America. Moreover, Netanyahu added that the annexation process will take longer time, as it requires the demarcation of maps and matching them with those contained in the Trump plan, besides the necessity of coordinating them closely with the American Administration. Concurrently, work is going on with the heads of the settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank, to ensure that all settlements are included in the decision, in accordance with the major plans outlined by the us proposal, and to ensure that these settlement blocs will not be affected by the decision, in the long run. Within this context, the EU opposes the annexation, and affirmed that it does not recognize Israel’s sovereignty in the areas occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Syrian Golan Heights. As for the ‘Deal of the Century’, the EU announced that the plan exceeds the agreed upon international standards, and assured that it will continue to support the 2-state solution based on the 1967 borders. Worth mentioning is the fact that that 100 US Democratic Party Congressmen have expressed their rejection of the “deal,” and stressed that it will push Israelis and Palestinians toward more conflict, and added that the plan paves the way for Israel to permanently occupy the West Bank, and supports the unilateral annexation of Israeli settlements with the Jordan Valley, in return for a dismantled Palestinian State, under Israeli control, and surrounded with settlements. In parallel, Israel continues the policy of both Judaization and Israeli nationalization in Jerusalem, using various tools, including the Israeli Judiciary, which plays, particularly in Jerusalem, the role of infiltrating real-estate belonging to Palestinians, for settlement societies—especially the ‘Ateret Cohenim Settlement Association.’ Israel’s policy, in this regard, is an extension of that policy, which it initiated from the first years of the occupation, where the Judaization of Jerusalem began directly with the 1967 occupation, as Israel began the process of ethnic cleansing in the Moroccan Neighborhood, which was totally wiped out and its residents were replaced by Jewish settlers. On June 27th of the same year, the Israeli government approved a law annexing East Jerusalem, in addition to the annexation of 14 other Palestinian villages and confiscation of the lands of 29 villages; consequently, Israel doubled the area Jerusalem, when it occupied in 1948. Within the context of plundering the properties, lands and wealth of the Palestinian people, occupation authorities began digging a water well in the “Qadumim” settlement, naming it “Qadumim 1.” And, in the village of Jinsafoot, to the south of Qalqilia, farmers said that they lost their fertile lands as Israel expanded the “Karni Shamorn” settlement, in 1978. Data from the population register for settlers in the West Bank, in 2019, revealed that the number of settlers increased by 3.4%, which is twice the rate of population growth in Israel. Knowing that this data does not include Jews in the occupied Jerusalem and its surroundings, whose number exceeds 300,000 settlers. Within this context, a former member of the Knesset, and a former professor of political science at the Hebrew University, Dr. Ofer Kassiv, directed unusual and unprecedented criticism after he likened Israel to Nazi-Germany to a state on a slope that quickly slips toward fascism. Also, the Israeli historian, Daniel Baltman, described the statements of Yitzhar settlement rabbi David Dod Kibbits, made during the funeral of settler Itamar Ben Gal, in 2018—in which he called for the extermination of the Palestinian people—as an incitement to genocide. He described Palestinian lives in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as catastrophic, adding the people are humiliated, stylized, and imprisoned in an overcrowded ghetto. Houses are being raided and children are terrorized, living a very miserable condition, in addition to being mercilessly shot by Israeli soldiers.

News article:
HAR HEMED, West Bank (Reuters) - An election in Israel next week could bring many settlers in the occupied West Bank closer to a long-held goal - annexation of the settlements where they live. Daniella Weiss, an Israeli settler leader speaks to Israeli men during her interview with Reuters in the settlement outpost of Har Hemed near the settlement of Kedumim in the Israeli-occupied West Bank February 20, 2020. Picture taken February 20, 2020. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun But for hardline settlers, that prize could come with an unacceptable price - the creation of a Palestinian state. Their dream of consolidating Israel’s hold on the West Bank and their nightmare of giving some of it up are both included in the pages of U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for the Middle East, announced in January. Fighting for his political survival in Israel’s third election in less than a year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged, if he wins Monday’s vote, to apply Israeli sovereignty to the settlements, built on land captured in a war in 1967. His frequent campaign stops in settlements and promises of de-facto annexation - which Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said would create a fragmented and unviable “Swiss cheese” of a Palestinian state - could draw votes from the far-right. But Netanyahu’s annexation promises do not go far enough for some settlers. They believe God promised the land to their forefathers and want all the West Bank, for which they use the Biblical name Judea and Samaria, not just the settlements. “Rest assured that we will not stop claiming every single inch of this land when Netanyahu, please God, is elected,” said Daniella Weiss, a settler leader from Kedumim who helped establish the nearby settlement outpost of Har Hemed. The provisions of Trump’s plan will for the first time be a factor for voters as the contents were announced after Israel’s inconclusive elections on April 9 and Sept. 17 last year. The West Bank’s 450,000 settlers, living in more than 250 settlements and outposts among towns where 3 million Palestinians reside, make up only about five percent of Israel’s population. But the settler movement is influential, with a high voter turnout, and is powerful within Netanyahu’s Likud party. Slideshow ( 14 images ) “PIED PIPER” Netanyahu goes on trial on March 17 on corruption charges he denies. But opinion polls show Likud inching past the centrist Blue and White party of former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, though neither is likely to win a solid parliamentary majority. The settlements traditionally vote right-wing, with Likud mainly competing with religious and ultra-religious parties for votes. Every vote could be vital as the last two elections were extremely close -- a single seat in parliament could prove decisive when it comes to coalition-building. Seeking to shore up settler support, Netanyahu has held almost daily events in settlements, including visiting Ariel on Monday with Trump-appointed U.S. Ambassador David Friedman. Still, some settlers are skeptical he will make good on his annexation promise. “He talks about it a lot but something always comes up at the last minute,” said Yoni Novick, from Karnei Shomron settlement. Novick, 43, had come to the settlement’s pub to listen to a leader of Yemina, a far-right party competing with Likud for the settler vote. Asked for whom he would vote, he said: “I really don’t know.” Further south, in Maale Adumim, a settlement of more than 40,000 people about 15 minutes drive from Jerusalem, the red-roofed homes, shopping mall, flowerbeds and traffic make it look like many other Israeli cities. But most of the international community regards it and other settlements as a violation of international law. Israel rejects that view, and is largely backed by the Trump administration. Maale Adumim’s deputy mayor, Guy Yifrach, said he believed there was broad consensus among Israelis that sovereignty should be applied to settlements such as his. He does not believe Gantz would press ahead with annexation if he became prime minister. “The question is who will advance it, and who will drag his heels. If Netanyahu forms the government he will immediately advance it once he gets U.S. permission,” he said. But in Kiryat Arba settlement, settler leader Elyakim Haetzni said anyone supporting Netanyahu was being duped “like the children following the Pied Piper of Hamelin.” “Netanyahu says what is good for him at that moment. He saw that people want sovereignty, so he’s using it as bait. He wants them to bite at it in order to swallow the idea of a Palestinian state,” Haetzni said.

By Palestine Chronicle Staff Less than a week before Israelis return to the polls, right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has renewed his pledge to annex large parts of the occupied Palestinian territories into Israel, as soon as he is elected a Prime Minister. The March 2 elections will be the third time in less than a year that Israelis vote in a general election. Israel has already begun preparing maps that show the settlements under full Israeli sovereignty, even though they are all illegal under international law. A few days ago, Netanyahu said that his government would work to turn the West Bank into an integral part of “Israel!”???? pic.twitter.com/6uwVAQZjS2 — Rolagameel (@rolagameel) February 22, 2020 The embattled Israeli Prime Minister is hoping to stay in his post, especially as he faces a trial on March 17, for serious corruption charges. Desperate to clinch a victory, which would allow him to bargain for immunity at the Israeli Knesset (Parliament), Netanyahu has been wooing Israeli voters to vote for him. Much of Netanyahu’s campaigning efforts have focused on the country’s right-wing constituency, especially the illegal Jewish settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories. Meanwhile, over 500 former Israeli Air Force officers appealed to the country’s President, Reuven Rivlin, to prevent Netanyahu from forming the next government, Israel’s daily Hebrew newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported. Israeli Air Force pilots appeal to @PresidentRuvi: Don't task @netanyahu with forming next coalition. https://t.co/CnrRPYO1pX — The Jerusalem Post (@Jerusalem_Post) February 23, 2020 “In the State of Israel it is impossible for a situation to exist in which a man who is indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust will form a government,” the pilots appealed to Rivlin. They also asserted that a Prime Minister cannot “send the army to operations and wars, unless he is cleared of any wrong-doing by the court.” Among those who signed the letter, are mayor of Tel Aviv, Ron Huldai, and the former head of the Israeli Air Force, Avihu Ben-Nun.

Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at the event and gave his blessing to the move. 2 View gallery Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (L) and U.S. Ambassador David Friedman at the overlook near Ariel ( Photo: GPO ) “The joint mapping process of the Israeli team and the American team is underway here in Ariel. This is a major mission. The area has an 800-kilometer (500-mile) perimeter. There is serious work, but we will work as quickly as possible to get it done," said Netanyahu. “The mapping is underway in order to allow for the application of Israeli law on these areas and later American recognition as well." The process will be completed as quickly as possible. We will do this as rapidly as possible; there is no artificial impediment. For the mapping process, one must consider every valley, every section, every nook, and every line; this is serious. We are determining here lines that have historic implications. Therefore, the work will be done as quickly as possible, and we will not stop for anything.” Netanyahu then spoke about the recent round of violence with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. “Last night [Sunday], we attacked in both Gaza and Syria. I do not intend to let up. On the way here, I spoke with the security elements. As you can imagine, we will be in action today as well. Beyond the severe blows that we are inflicting on our enemies, Hamas and Islamic Jihad need to understand – it will not continue this way. If they do not stop firing completely, and I do not mean for a day or two, but in general, if there will not be a complete halt, we will be obliged to activate the plan for an extensive campaign that we have prepared," said Netanyahu. 2 View gallery IDF airstrikes in the Gaza Strip ( Photo: AP ) “These are not mere words. They contain new and surprising things that were not in Operation Cast Lead, Operation Pillar of Defense or Operation Defensive Shield, and whoever is in the Security Cabinet knows exactly what we are talking about.

This is the last option, but if there is no choice, we will go there. Woe to Hamas and Islamic Jihad if they reach that day. The choice is theirs. We will do what is necessary in order to restore complete security to the residents of the south.” Tourism Minister Yariv Levin also lauded the move, citing its historic significance. "The goal is to draw an accurate and complete map of the area so that Israeli sovereignty could be applied to it," said Levin. "It is definitely a historic and significant moment."

We will do what is necessary in order to restore complete security to the residents of the south.” Tourism Minister Yariv Levin also lauded the move, citing its historic significance. "The goal is to draw an accurate and complete map of the area so that Israeli sovereignty could be applied to it," said Levin. "It is definitely a historic and significant moment."

Israeli premier pledges to annex more lands of West Bank 'within weeks' if re-elected Iran Press TV Sunday, 01 March 2020 3:11 PM In an apparent attempt by Israel's scandal-hit premier to secure votes on the eve of a decisive general election, Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annex further parts of the occupied West Bank "within weeks" provided that he is re-elected. Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving premier, made the campaign pledge in an interview with the regime's public radio on Sunday, stressing that annexation of the strategically important Jordan Valley and other parts of the West Bank have been his top priority among "four major immediate missions." "That will happen within weeks, two months at the most, I hope," he said, 24 hours before polls were scheduled to open for vote-weary Israelis to cast their ballots for the third time in 12 months. Final polls showed yet another tight competition between Netanyahu-led right-wing Likud party and the centrist Blue and White party, led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz. The incumbent prime minister has already been accused of making last-minute plays to invigorate his right-wing base. However, he has failed to secure enough votes, in the two previous parliamentary elections, to win sufficient seats in the 120-member Knesset and form a majority government. He has also failed so far to form a coalition government. Netanyahu was particularly emboldened in annexing more Palestinian lands by US President Donald Trump in January, when the latter unveiled his much-delayed and self-proclaimed "deal of the century" during an event at the White House alongside the Israeli premier. Palestinian groups have unanimously rejected Trump's one-sided plan, which largely meets Israel's demands in the decades-old conflict with the Palestinians while envisioning a Palestinian state with limited control over its own security and borders. The so-called "peace plan" enshrines Jerusalem al-Quds as "Israel's undivided capital" and allows the regime to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank and the Jordan Valley. The plan also denies the right of return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland, among other controversial terms. Trump's plan has triggered waves of protest rallies both across the Palestinian occupied territories and around the globe. "The joint US-Israeli mapping committee started work a week ago," Netanyahu further said on Sunday, hoping to emerge victorious in Monday's election. However, many fear that the upcoming election fails to break the current political deadlock in the occupying regime and likely turns out to be inconclusive just like the two elections held in April and September, extending a painful political stalemate deep into 2020. Shortly after Netanyahu's pledge on Sunday, former Israeli minister of military affairs Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu's ex-ally, publicly lambasted the premier for engaging in empty political rhetoric. Lieberman said that he had "ironclad information" that the Israeli prime minister comments on the Jordan Valley had been at least partly insincere. "A few days ago, it became clear to me that he (Netanyahu) sent a message to (Jordan's) King Abdullah, (saying) 'Don't worry, it's just elections, there will be no annexation of the Jordan Valley'," Lieberman said in a TV interview. Many experts believe that a unilateral move by Netanyahu to annex the valley would definitely trigger further regional tensions and damage ties with neighboring Jordan, one of only two Arab countries that agreed a peace deal with the Israeli regime. On Friday, the European Union's Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell condemned Tel Aviv for its plan to build thousands of settler units in occupied East Jerusalem al-Quds, warning that such construction would sever territorial contiguity between the area and the rest of the occupied West Bank. "The EU reiterates its call on Israel to halt settlement construction, to suspend the publication of tenders and to refrain from any measures aimed at the advancement of such construction plans. Settlements are illegal under international law," Borrell added. His call came three days after Netanyahu announced that he had ordered the promotion of a plan for construction of some 3,500 illegal settler units in the so-called E1 area, which is located between the occupied al-Quds and the Ma'ale Adumim settlement. The move is widely believed to be an obvious attempt aimed at securing votes in the Monday's election. Palestinians want the West Bank as part of a future independent Palestinians state, with East Jerusalem al-Quds as its capital. However, the continued expansion of Israeli settlements is one of the major obstacles to the establishment of peace in the Middle East. The occupying regime seized East Jerusalem al-Quds in the 1967 Six-Day War. It later annexed the territory in a move never recognized by the international community. Around 600,000 Israeli settlers now live in over 230 settlements built in the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has already severed ties between the Palestinian Authority, which he leads, and the Israeli regime as well as the US in reaction to Trump's highly-provocative scheme. Apart from the Palestinian leaders, many other international blocs and organizations, including the European Union, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the African Union, have rejected Trump's plan.

News article:
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerian Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum told visiting envoys from other countries neighboring Libya on Thursday that he hoped their meeting would strengthen a fragile truce in the country and help avert more foreign influence there. Slideshow ( 5 images ) “Libya’s neighbors have the responsibility to facilitate a political solution,” he added before the start of his meeting with foreign ministers or other officials from Egypt, Tunisia, Chad, Niger, Sudan and Mali. Heiko Maas, the foreign minister of Germany, which hosted a summit on the Libyan crisis on Sunday, also joined the meeting. The eastern Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar launched an assault last year with his Libyan National Army (LNA) to capture Tripoli with backing from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russian mercenaries and African troops. The internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) is backed by Turkey, which has sent military advisers and trainers to help its armed forces ward off Haftar’s attack. In Berlin, foreign powers active in Libya agreed to shore up a shaky ceasefire but the meeting was overshadowed by Haftar’s blockade of energy fields. The conflict’s recent escalation has alarmed some of Libya’s neighbors, who fear it may provide more space for armed militant groups to operate across the Sahara and the Sahel region. “The Sahel is suffering from this crisis. Proliferation of arms in the region has facilitated the spread of terrorism,” said Chad’s Foreign Minister Mahamet Zene Cherif. Tunisia, located between Algeria and Libya, is also concerned about a possible influx of refugees. It was not initially invited to the Berlin summit this month, causing anger among many Tunisian politicians. It turned down a late invitation to attend, saying it had not been given time to prepare.

News article:
Two weeks ago, the Libyan National Army (LNA) launched its most assertive battle yet, resulting in the taking of Sirte and the siege of Tripoli. Turkey thus found itself on the verge of losing the war, so it decided to go to Berlin, where the final battle was to be fought. There, the victors and losers negotiated, hoping that realism would push everyone to an agreement that would end the years of violence. A UN-sponsored agreement was signed by the parties concerned, but it is more than likely that they will return to fight for the last few miles. The war in Libya has passed through some painful stages. In 2015, hopes of reconciliation were wiped out, with embassies closing their doors in Tripoli, the UN withdrawing its forces, and chaos taking over the capital. Rivalries of regional and major powers have caused the war to continue, with Turkey among them, fighting on Libyan territory through militias whose members are mostly foreigners. The Turks justify their involvement in the war by claiming that Libya owes them huge amounts of money after they financed projects during the late Qaddafi era. Turkey is also claiming that millions of citizens of Turkish origin are living in Libya, which of course is not true. Why is Turkey insisting on fighting in Libya? If it is out of a desire to build an empire, this is not possible because it does not have the resources, even with Qatar’s unlimited support. The truth is that Turkey has been left with just Libya when talking about the gains of the so-called “Arab Spring.” Libya is a dangerous corridor with the potential to destabilize Egypt’s security, and it could even be used to threaten Europe. Turkey has bet on the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, Egypt, Sudan and Libya, but these groups lost power, and with them Turkey lost all of these countries, except for Libya. Even in Libya, the Turkey-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) controls only 15 percent of Libyan territory, mainly in Tripoli and Misrata. It had previously lost the oil-producing areas to the LNA. Amid this bad situation, Ankara is threatening to send more troops to defend Tripoli. It must be noted that the Turkish experts and forces are foreign fighters who were involved in the war in Syria. After coming to an agreement with the Russians in Idlib, Turkey wants to get rid of one legacy of the Syrian war, which includes having to deal with thousands of foreign fighters on its territory. In case the Berlin deal fails, these fighters will fight alongside the GNA’s forces; and if they lose and the LNA takes Tripoli, they will sow chaos. Thus, they will be Erdogan’s bargaining tool to put pressure on European countries. This perception has been created by the threats of the Turkish president himself, who clearly said that Europe will not be safe if his allies in Libya fall. Egypt is the other target for the Turks in Libya. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi recently said Egypt is concerned about Libya’s stability, and regards Turkey’s intervention as a major threat to it. He added that Egypt may be the next target, which is why we see Cairo raising the tone of its speeches, declaring that it will not remain a spectator if the Turks go to war. Turkey can prolong and widen the chaos in Libya, but it will not be able to rule the country. Thus, everyone is now trying to push Ankara to be realistic and cooperate with any joint government that is formed in accordance with the Berlin agreement, until this absurd tragedy is over. Let us not forget that the current war is the result of the failure of an earlier opportunity to share power, when the extremists backed by Turkey coveted sole rule. The Turks, who want to use Libya to strengthen their status and make up for their failure in Syria, must know that Libya will become, for them, an additional burden, as well as a failure if they insist on supporting the war.

News article:
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry lauded on Thursday the outcome of a meeting on Libya, saying all participants rebuffed foreign attempts to meddle with Libya's internal affairs. The meeting today was very positive and comes at an important time in light of the continued armed conflict in Libya and the arrival of many militants in the country, Shoukry told MENA. The situation requires immediate coordination among all Libya's neighbours to help the brotherly country overcome this crisis, he said. All participants rejected foreign interference in Libya's affairs and attempts to bring terrorists or mercenaries to spark military confrontations in the North African country. He said Libya's neighbours should work hard with their Libyan brothers to reach a settlement to the Libyan crisis. He underlined the importance of addressing many issues in Libya, including re-forming the presidential council, re-distributing the country's wealth in a just way, dismantling armed militias and making the national army the only party authorised to protect the country. Shoukry also underlined the importance of fostering cooperation with international partners to settle the Libyan crisis, saying German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas took part in the meeting and expounded efforts to reach a peaceful settlement. About the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, he said technical teams are now meeting in Khartoum to add final touches to a draft deal on rules to fill and operate the dam, expecting it to be finalised today or tomorrow at most. Then, Shoukry said, we will go to the US to reach a final agreement. The $4.6 billion dam on the Blue Nile, which promises to provide much-needed electricity to Ethiopia´s 100 million people, has been a contentious point among the three main Nile Basin countries. Egypt fears that filling the dam’s reservoir too quickly could significantly reduce its share of the Nile water. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Last week an important international meeting was held in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's diplomatic efforts. Turkey, Russia, the UAE and Egypt, as well as representatives from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Congo, Algeria, United Nations and African Union, participated in the Berlin conference. From the Libyan side, both the Prime Minister of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) Fayez al-Sarraj and the head of the Libyan National Army (LNA) renegade Gen. Khalifa Haftar were present at Berlin, but they did not officially join the meeting. The outcome of the Berlin conference did not satisfy any of the parties. The meeting instead appeased instigators like Haftar and the UAE. The message of the conference was: "The Libyan crisis should be resolved by diplomatic means." Turkey's involvement on the side of the GNA changed the balance and pushed forward the possibility of a diplomatic process. Turkish military involvement and Turkey's diplomatic contacts with Russia constrained the expectations of Haftar's forces to take over the capital Tripoli. This balancing acts allowed for the Berlin conference, but the participants of the conference were not committed to stopping Haftar and his supporters' destabilizing efforts in Libya. The cease-fire, arms embargo and the return to the political process among the Libyan actors were the most important highlights of the 55 point conclusions document. It was clear for the analysts of the Libya Conflict that the Berlin conference is stillborn, as it just promised to form a 5+5 Military Committee proposed by the UNSMIL (United Nations Support Mission in Libya). Forming dysfunctional committees that do not have any political power is the most common approach to delay solutions on multilateral platforms. Once again, the Berlin conference demonstrated that multilateral platforms are dysfunctional in finding quick and practical solutions to complicated international conflicts. The inclusion of all the key stakeholders is crucial in reaching a sustainable agreement. This is an important norm that should be one of the fundamental pillars of the conflict management and conflict resolution processes. If the stakeholders do not have particular moral commitments or shared end goals, inclusion can be tricky and counterproductive. Inclusion may provide opportunities for the instigators and may turn them into more influential actors. There was no overarching shared logic or values that the participants agreed upon nor was respect a bottom-line criterion at Berlin. While the Berlin conference was going on, Haftar forces were shelling Tripoli. The UAE and Egypt did not stop their arms shipment to Haftar forces and were unable to invest in a viable military solution. The GNA, Prime Minister al-Sarraj and his supporters felt that they were betrayed in the Berlin meeting. Participants of the Berlin conference failed to force the parties to a permanent cease-fire. They instead requested the cessation of foreign involvement, but for everyone in Berlin, it was clear that the Haftar backers will continue their military support for the LNA. The Turkish side will try to balance the LNA and Haftar's allies until a credible cease-fire is reached. As it was seen in the failed cease-fire efforts in Moscow, Haftar is incapable of making any significant decision by himself. He had to consult with Cairo, Abu Dhabi and some other Western capitals as well. Within this circumstance, if a credible cease-fire cannot be reached any time soon, the Berlin conference may turn into another Geneve process like in the case of the Syrian civil war. Some international actors may be content to see an unstable Libya. As long as the oil flows from the key ports, and there is no significant refugee flow to Europe, international actors are ready to accept the continuation of a prolonged civil war in Libya. Only the Libyans will suffer from such dysfunctional diplomatic efforts. Turkey's involvement and military support for GNA-controlled forces, rather than the U.N. or the EU, are the only hopes of many Libyans in GNA-controlled areas. Only a credible cease-fire that is strictly monitored by a U.N.-recognized body can allow for genuine diplomatic contact between Libyan actors and other key international stakeholders. As the cease-fire gets delayed, the hope for a diplomatic solution to the Libyan crisis diminishes.

News article:
Libya’s National Oil Corporation was not consulted before a deal between the country’s Government of National Accord and Turkey over access to areas potentially rich in natural gas. In early December last year, the GNA and Turkey confirmed a new maritime border deal in the Mediterranean in exchange for military co-operation. Reports later emerged of thousands of Syrian fighters being sent to Libya through Turkey to bolster the security of the GNA in Tripoli. Libya’s dominant state oil company, which has tried to remain independent throughout the country’s civil war, was not involved in the deal between Ankara and Tripoli. But the company intends to play a central role in the development of offshore gas within the country’s maritime borders. The December deal, which would dramatically expand Turkish influence in the region, has been deeply criticised by Libya’s neighbours in the Mediterranean. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias dismissed it as “ridiculous”, while Egypt called it illegal. This month in Cairo, Egypt, France, Cyprus and Greece condemned the maritime and security agreements while affirming there could be no military solution to the conflict in Libya. The potential foothold gained by Ankara in Libya would infringe on plans by Egypt, Cyprus, Greece and Israel to turn the East Mediterranean into an energy centre after the discovery of massive reserves of natural gas. But the picture for Libya’s oil industry is bleak. After blockades on oilfields in the south of the country, production has fallen to 262,000 barrels per day. Plans to dramatically expand Libya’s production to 1.5 million barrels per day by the end of the year and 2.5 million by 2024 now look most unlikely. Chances of recovery for the Libyan oil sector and the country may lie in upholding the rule of law and for global superpowers to build on last week’s peace conference in Berlin. At the close of the one-day conference in Germany, world powers agreed to enforce the 2011 UN weapons embargo in Libya. The country’s rival leaders, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj, also agreed to send representatives to a military council that would negotiate a ceasefire to end fighting in Tripoli.

News article:
A review of the history of Turkey's regional relations reveals the importance of Tripoli for Turkey. Turkey's sensitivity to Libya was heightened when Sudanese political leaders such as Omar al-Bashir were ousted from power. However, Ankara, which does not want to lag behind its regional rivals in Libya, is trying to declare its presence in Libya and not lose to Saudi Arabia. Within this regard, Turkey now faces a new challenge and after entering northern Syria to create a safe and clear zone against terrorist elements and recently signing an agreement with the Tripoli government to boost its military presence in North Africa, it has seen some backlash. It has led some countries in the region, including Egypt, to conduct military exercises. And Turkey's decision to stay in Libya has not been accepted by Israel and Greece. After the death of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Libya, as an oil-rich country of North Africa, was divided into two parts. While Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates support the more secular Tobruk government, Turkey, along with Qatar and Sudan, are supporting Libya's other leading political representatives. Libya's importance to Turkey grew when the country was divided into two groups: Supporters of Gen. Khalifa Haftar and supporters of national sovereignty. Now, despite the split in the country, the government of consensus on the one hand, and militant-led militias on the other, are trying to achieve their goals. But this is not the whole story, and Haftar is trying to get the government to form an "independent" state. Haftar, as an extremist leader supported by countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and France, is trying to open a new generation of anti-Islamic war in the region. While Turkey has a good relationship with the Libyan national government and is considered a Muslim country, it is naturally concerned about its comprehensive support for the abolition of the Libyan national and Muslim government by a harsher military group and the need to intervene to prevent such an ominous plan. The battleground of powers Following the fall of Gadhafi, with the emergence of bilateral strife to gain power, regional and transregional states each supported either side of the conflict. On one side of the conflict, there is the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) government of Fayaz al-Sarraj, and on the other, the Libyan House of Representatives officials backed by the national army, led by Haftar. In fact, the government in Tripoli has been recognized by the United Nations and backed by some countries in the world, including Turkey and Qatar. But it has not been favored by Haftar forces, which also control much of the country's oil facilities. And with the backing of countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE, they are seeking to set up a national unity government. After increasing tensions between the nation's government and supporters of Haftar, the Egypt-Saudi-UAE axis increased tougher support for the abolition of the Libyan GNA. Turkey and Qatar, which have sought the U.N.-backed recognition and support of the Tripoli government, have opposed Egypt's decision with its allies and have declared their full support for the Tripoli government. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in a speech that Turkey is not intervening in Libya but is trying to grant aid to the U.N.-approved official government upon an official invitation. "What about the presence of 6,000 Sudanese and 6,000 mercenaries affiliated with Wagner's Russian company in Libya? You didn't even ask them what they were doing in Libya and what their mission was." Consequently, it can be said that Turkey's military presence in Libya, on the one hand, could become an obstacle to Gen. Haftar's military operation against the Tripoli government, and on the other hand increase Turkey's ability to exercise power in the Mediterranean. Turkey's goals in Libya While Turkish rivals are concerned about Turkey's expansion of influence in Libya and accuse Turkey of reviving Ottoman ambitions in the region, Ankara considers the support of the UAE and Saudi Arabia of Haftar as the main cause of instability and stalemate in Libya's stability and seeks to establish a unified government by the recognized administration in Libya. President Erdoğan's decision to target the military and even economic presence in Libya is influenced by several factors. First, the history of Turkish relations with Libya before the overthrow of the previous political system was a lasting one and Turkish economic activity in Libya was very high. The second factor is Turkey's new regional policy interest in the Mediterranean. And it is this new Turkish policy that has partly upset the Western and even European Union equations and raised concerns. But whether it will engage Turkey with the West, at least in political terms, it may damage Turkey's ties with the EU. Although Turkey does not like the EU, and there is some annoyance with it for Turkey, if Turkey increases its influence in the Mediterranean region, it will raise more serious concern for European and Western nations. As a result, opposition to the national government headed by al-Sarraj in Libya, despite being the only legitimate government approved by the U.N., has fallen on the heels of Haftar and with the backing of countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and even France. They are trying to overthrow the government of al-Sarraj because it will make it possible for them to take full advantage of this oil-rich African country. In the meantime, Turkey has declared the support for the forces affiliated with Gen. Haftar as illegal, citing the U.N. vote to legalize the government of al-Sarraj and as a Muslim country in the region, recognize the Tripoli-based GNA as the only legitimate government in Libya. * Fellow at the Iranian International Studies Association in Tehran.

News article:
The Berlin Conference on Libya was supposed to find a lasting solution to the crisis in the country, exacerbated by the meddling of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, writes Hany Ghoraba The civil war in Libya could have reached its closing chapters after the Libyan National Army led by Khalifa Haftar nearly controlled 90 per cent of the country’s territory and had the Islamist and terrorist militias besieged in the capital Tripoli. But then along came Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with his attempt at a last-ditch effort to save the Islamist interim Libyan President Fayez Al-Sarraj. Through an illegitimate naval demarcation and military cooperation agreement between Turkey and Al-Sarraj in December, Erdogan believed he could enforce his country’s presence in North Africa after a series of defeats for the terrorist militias led by Al-Sarraj at the hands of the Libyan National Army. Al-Sarraj’s desperate measures aimed to cling to power a little longer by prolonging the struggle. But though the moves may have earned him some time more in power, they will not change his legacy as a traitor to his country. Egypt, Greece, Cyprus and France denounced the Turkish-Libyan agreement, and the European Union and US expressed their concern, also refusing to recognise it. Meanwhile, Erdogan conducted a visit to neighbouring Tunisia earlier this month, and he will visit Algeria this week in search of support for his plans. In Tunisia, he was met by public scorn, especially after his pompous demeanour during a press conference with Tunisian President Kais Saied. In public speeches in Turkey Erdogan has not denied his ambitions to resurrect the Ottoman presence in the Mediterranean and to rule in Libya, citing Libyan citizens of Turkish descent. However, all patriotic Libyans will remember the Ottoman massacres of the Libyans when the country was part of the former Ottoman Empire, including the killing of 10,000 people from the Al-Jawazi tribe at the hands of Ottoman ruler of Libya Yusuf Karamanli Pasha in 1817. Fast forward to January 2020, and the Libyans still have painful memories of the Ottoman massacres and the rule of the Karamanli dynasty in their country. Patriotic Libyans, learning about the involvement of Turkey in the already bloody civil war in their country, have redoubled their nationalist sentiments and given even more support to the Libyan sovereign state and its army led by Khalifa Haftar. The Berlin Conference held on 19 January in the German capital was supposed to find a lasting solution to the Libyan crisis, which has lasted for nearly a decade. However, it fell short of doing so. The presence of Egypt in support of the Libyan cause at the conference hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel provided Haftar with a strong bargaining chip and a powerful negotiating standpoint. During the meeting, Egypt, Greece, Cyprus, France and several other EU countries shared the same view about the future of Libya and the importance of restoring peace, security and order to the battle-torn country. This view was expressed in a European Council press statement following the conference. European Council Spokesman Charles Mitchell highlighted some important points, including the enforcement of the embargo and the rejection of any foreign military intervention in Libya in what was a direct message to Erdogan to halt his ambitions of invasion or military deployment to save the skin of Al-Sarraj. The press statement was not conclusive on the steps to be taken by the council and the countries at the conference, but it contained a strong call for a ceasefire and the de-escalation of the situation. The Berlin Conference was only a first meeting, and it will be followed by subsequent meetings at different levels. It did not create a solution to the nine-year war in Libya. It may even have preserved the status quo to a certain extent, though it also provided Haftar with international recognition while not stripping this from Al-Sarraj. This could translate into waiting to see which side will turn the tide of events on the ground. Reports of breaching the truce between the two sides have come from a number of sources, as terrorists flooding in from Syria on Turkish planes have been landing in Libya to support the interim government. Consequently, the Libyan National Army has enforced a no-fly zone above the capital Tripoli. All the indications are that the fragile truce that preceded the Berlin Conference will not hold, and more military clashes will occur in the upcoming period. For Erdogan, his meddling in Libya is an attempt to regain the balance lost in the region through failed campaigns in Syria and Iraq against the Kurdish population, as well as the fall of the Muslim Brotherhood regimes in Egypt in 2013 and Sudan in 2019. Al-Sarraj may be Erdogan’s last real ally in North Africa, but he could also spell Erdogan’s demise if he attempts to make use of a sizeable Turkish force. After weeks of huffing and puffing, Turkey has declared that it has about 35 soldiers and army experts in Libya. This is a number that is hardly enough to secure a medium-sized shopping mall, let alone the Libyan capital Tripoli. Instead, the actual fighting will be conducted through Erdogan’s favourite method, which is to use jihadist and terrorist fighters to do his dirty business for him. The Libyan Army spokesman and the British media have reported that over 2,000 terrorists have been flown in from Syria to Libya for this purpose. However, the Libyan National Army is already hunting down these elements, and it will be relentless in cleaning the country of such terrorist elements that have wreaked havoc in Syria already but have nevertheless failed to oust Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad. For Egypt, Erdogan’s adventures in the region must end, and its military exercises in the Mediterranean have sent a message that the country will not tolerate a Turkish presence in a neighbouring country. Erdogan’s presence at the Berlin Conference was isolated. He was treated as a pariah by most of the attendees, while being photographed sitting with his Libyan lackey Al-Sarraj and another person at a corner table. On the opposite side, President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, among others, were all photographed discussing the future of Libya together and methods to end the struggle that the Turkish president is attempting to exacerbate. Libya, which has some of the world’s largest proven oil reserves, is still considered a jewel in the crown that is worth snatching by Erdogan, but now this will be beyond his reach given the interests of the international powers to restore order and stability to the country. This is something that remains off Erdogan’s agenda. The powers that gathered in Berlin will not be wrestled into accepting the Turkish troop deployment along with terrorist militias in Libya, as Erdogan desires. His regime will pay a severe price if he attempts to make more unwise moves in the country.

News article:
The Berlin Conference on Libya was supposed to find a lasting solution to the crisis in the country, exacerbated by the meddling of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, writes Hany Ghoraba The civil war in Libya could have reached its closing chapters after the Libyan National Army led by Khalifa Haftar nearly controlled 90 per cent of the country’s territory and had the Islamist and terrorist militias besieged in the capital Tripoli. But then along came Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with his attempt at a last-ditch effort to save the Islamist interim Libyan President Fayez Al-Sarraj. Through an illegitimate naval demarcation and military cooperation agreement between Turkey and Al-Sarraj in December, Erdogan believed he could enforce his country’s presence in North Africa after a series of defeats for the terrorist militias led by Al-Sarraj at the hands of the Libyan National Army. Al-Sarraj’s desperate measures aimed to cling to power a little longer by prolonging the struggle. But though the moves may have earned him some time more in power, they will not change his legacy as a traitor to his country. Egypt, Greece, Cyprus and France denounced the Turkish-Libyan agreement, and the European Union and US expressed their concern, also refusing to recognise it. Meanwhile, Erdogan conducted a visit to neighbouring Tunisia earlier this month, and he will visit Algeria this week in search of support for his plans. In Tunisia, he was met by public scorn, especially after his pompous demeanour during a press conference with Tunisian President Kais Saied. In public speeches in Turkey Erdogan has not denied his ambitions to resurrect the Ottoman presence in the Mediterranean and to rule in Libya, citing Libyan citizens of Turkish descent. However, all patriotic Libyans will remember the Ottoman massacres of the Libyans when the country was part of the former Ottoman Empire, including the killing of 10,000 people from the Al-Jawazi tribe at the hands of Ottoman ruler of Libya Yusuf Karamanli Pasha in 1817.

News article:
Turkey urged France on Wednesday to stop supporting Libya's eastern-based illegitimate forces and their leader, putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar. “It is no secret that France has supported warlord Khalifa Haftar since 2011 to have the upper hand over the natural resources of Libya,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said late Wednesday in response to French President Emmanuel Macron’s remarks claiming that Turkey is breaching an agreement to halt foreign interference in the conflict-ravaged north African country. “The French president tried to set his own agenda with his false claims,” the ministry said in the statement. “The main responsibility lies with France in the crisis in Libya, which has been continuing since 2011,” the statement added. “France is one of the countries militarily supporting Haftar, which fights against the legitimate government, the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya. His attacks are the main threat to Libya’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” the ministry said. “France should first end its support to Haftar if it wants to contribute to the peace process in Libya,” the statement read, adding, “France, whose dark past in Africa is well known, should undertake a contributing role instead of accusing Turkey.” The statement followed Macron's remarks earlier in the day during a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Macron's comments came a week after the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia – which all back Haftar forces – and Turkey – which backs the legitimate government in Tripoli – agreed with Western powers in Berlin to push for a lasting cease-fire and uphold an arms embargo. However, since then there has been an uptick in fighting with Haftar's forces attempting to open a new front by moving forces toward the city of Misrata in the west of the country. On Jan. 12, the conflict parties announced a cease-fire in response to a joint call by the Turkish and Russian leaders. But the talks for a permanent cease-fire deal ended without an agreement after Haftar left Moscow without signing the deal. Similarly, an attempt of the international community to find a solution to the Libyan crisis in the German capital Berlin on Jan. 19 remained inconclusive, despite Haftar accepting the terms in Berlin to designate members to a U.N.-proposed military commission with five members from each side to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire. Since then, attacks by Haftar’s forces have continued without regard to civilians. The conflict deepened in April last year when Haftar, who controls much of the south and east of Libya, launched an assault to seize capital Tripoli. Since the ousting of late ruler Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, two seats of power have emerged in Libya: one in eastern Libya supported mainly by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and the other in Tripoli, which enjoys U.N. and international recognition. The U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Fayez al-Sarraj has been under attack since April by Haftar's forces, with fighting killing over 280 civilians and 2,000 fighters. Ties between Paris and Ankara have become increasingly strained over multiple issues including disagreements over Syria and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Foreign Ministry, in its statement, also touched upon the fact that Macron previously hosted terrorists at Elysee Palace, namely representatives of PKK terror group’s Syrian wing, the YPG. Turkey and Libya also signed a maritime deal two months ago after a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, in Istanbul. The deal enabled Turkey to secure its rights in the Mediterranean while preventing any fait accompli by other regional states. However, Greece, one of the main regional actors, did not welcome the deal and regarded it as a violation of its rights, though international law says otherwise.

Artillery exchanges in Tripoli have significantly increased in recent days, causing an increase in civilian casualties due to indiscriminate shelling By Aidan Lewis and Michelle Nichols CAIRO/NEW YORK Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it was suspending operations at a refugee centre in Libya's capital because it could become a target while the U.N. envoy said a truce brokered by Russia and Turkey was holding "only in name". Artillery exchanges in Tripoli have significantly increased in recent days, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told the Security Council in a briefing, causing an increase in civilian casualties due to indiscriminate shelling. Since Jan. 12, when forces aligned with Tripoli's internationally recognised government and eastern based rivals led by Khalifa Haftar conditionally agreed to a truce, more than 110 violations had been recorded, Salame said. Libya's conflict has escalated since Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli in April, upending U.N.-led peace plans. International powers have supplied arms and air power, though there has been a lull in air strikes since Russia and Turkey called for a truce starting Jan. 12, and international powers met in Berlin on Jan. 19 trying to broker a ceasefire. Haftar has received support from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Russia and Egypt, while Turkey has recently stepped up its backing for the Tripoli government. U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the Security Council that "regrettably the promise of the Berlin conference is already under threat". It was "past time" for those violating an arms embargo "to face real consequences", she warned, without giving details. The 15-member U.N. Security Council has been negotiating a British-drafted resolution to endorse the outcomes of the Berlin conference, but it was not immediately clear when the text could be put to a vote. The U.N. says arms and fighters have continued to pour into Libya despite pledges in Berlin to uphold the arms embargo, while clashes have picked up on the ground with at least 18 civilians killed and three wounded in and around Tripoli since Jan. 6. "With recent developments on the ground, I regret to report that the truce holds only in name," Salame said. MILITARY EXERCISES The closure of the centre for refugees and asylum seekers in central Tripoli may further restrict protection for migrants frequently subjected to abuse including torture and forced labour, both in and out of detention. The UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF), which housed nearly 1,000 people, had been plagued with problems, reflecting the difficulties for international agencies working in a city controlled by armed groups. "Unfortunately UNHCR was left with no choice but to suspend work at the (GDF) after learning that training exercises, involving police and military personnel, are taking place just a few metres away from units housing asylum seekers and refugees," Jean-Paul Cavalieri, UNHCR's Libya head, said in a statement. "We fear that the entire area could become a military target, further endangering the lives of refugees, asylum seekers, and other civilians." Libya's western coast has been one of the main departure points for migrants attempting dangerous sea crossings to Europe, though the number of departures has dropped sharply since mid-2017. The country has a migrant population numbering hundreds of thousands, and several thousand are held in detention centres in or near Tripoli that have been left unguarded or hit by artillery or air strikes amid the fighting. In July, an air strike hit a detention centre in Tripoli's Tajoura district that was located in the same complex as an armed group's vehicle repair workshop, killing at least 53 migrants. A U.N. report issued this week repeated previous findings that the air strike was likely carried out by a foreign aircraft, but failed to name the state.

The U.N. says arms and fighters have continued to pour into Libya despite pledges in Berlin to uphold the arms embargo, while clashes have picked up on the ground with at least 18 civilians killed and three wounded in and around Tripoli since Jan. 6. "With recent developments on the ground, I regret to report that the truce holds only in name," Salame said. MILITARY EXERCISES The closure of the centre for refugees and asylum seekers in central Tripoli may further restrict protection for migrants frequently subjected to abuse including torture and forced labour, both in and out of detention. The UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF), which housed nearly 1,000 people, had been plagued with problems, reflecting the difficulties for international agencies working in a city controlled by armed groups. "Unfortunately UNHCR was left with no choice but to suspend work at the (GDF) after learning that training exercises, involving police and military personnel, are taking place just a few metres away from units housing asylum seekers and refugees," Jean-Paul Cavalieri, UNHCR's Libya head, said in a statement. "We fear that the entire area could become a military target, further endangering the lives of refugees, asylum seekers, and other civilians." Libya's western coast has been one of the main departure points for migrants attempting dangerous sea crossings to Europe, though the number of departures has dropped sharply since mid-2017. The country has a migrant population numbering hundreds of thousands, and several thousand are held in detention centres in or near Tripoli that have been left unguarded or hit by artillery or air strikes amid the fighting. In July, an air strike hit a detention centre in Tripoli's Tajoura district that was located in the same complex as an armed group's vehicle repair workshop, killing at least 53 migrants. A U.N. report issued this week repeated previous findings that the air strike was likely carried out by a foreign aircraft, but failed to name the state.

News article:
The UN's special representative for Libya said Thursday the country's warring sides are working to turn a provisional cease-fire into a formal agreement as they emerged from four days of talks. Ghassan Salame, head of the United Nations support mission in Libya, said rival military leaders are negotiating the remaining sticking points in a cease-fire deal. Those include the return of internally displaced people, the disarmament of armed groups and ways to monitor the truce. "The cease-fire agreement is made of a number of issues, and there have been points of convergence on many points. And there are points of divergence,'' Salame told reporters in Geneva. According to Salame, the United Nations expects eastern Libyan tribes leaders to submit by Thursday their list of conditions to reopen blocked oil terminals. The latest round of fighting in oil-rich Libya erupted last April when eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) under the command of Gen. Khalifa Haftar laid siege to Tripoli in a bid to wrest power from the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj. Sarraj and Haftar both sent delegations of military officials to represent them at the Geneva talks. The cease-fire talks come amid intensified diplomacy among world powers seeking to end the conflict that has ravaged Libya for nine years. LNA forces, which control much of Libya's east and south, rely on military assistance from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia. On the other side, Turkey, Italy and Qatar prop up the embattled Tripoli-based government. World powers have deplored the reality on the ground and pledged to uphold a widely flouted UN arms embargo at a peace summit last month in Berlin. But continued violations of the ban have dimmed hopes that international players in Libya can resolve the crisis. * This story was edited by Ahram Online. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
UN chief Antonio Guterres pledged to support any mediation efforts to resolve the Libyan crisis during the African Union summit on Sunday. African heads of state gathered at the AU headquarters in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa to discuss how the body could play a role in resolving conflicts across the continent. “The United Nations will support any mediation sponsored by the African Union to resolve the Libyan crisis, and we stress the need for a ceasefire,” Mr Guterres said in his address to the meeting. Mr Guterres said the African Union must play a greater role in resolving the conflict. The latest round of fighting erupted last April when eastern-based forces under the command of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar laid siege to Tripoli in a bid to drive out militias aligned with the Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj. A January 12 ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey reduced the level of fighting but there have been repeated breaches by both sides. Military commanders from the warring parties held indirect talks in Geneva last week on a permanent ceasefire. The officers, five from each side, are expected to hold further talks later this month. The Arab League Secretary General, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, vowed to “secure” the ceasefire and to stop external meddling in Libyan affairs. “The Arab League in partnership with the African Union will spare no efforts in alleviating the Libyan crisis,” Mr Aboul Gheit said. Arab states will support “an inclusive national reconciliation process,” he said. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi said the continuation of conflicts in the region increased the risk of terrorism and extremism on the African continent. “The transfer of insurgents from Syria to Libya will have serious repercussions not only for Libya but for its neighbouring countries,” Mr El Sisi said. “Security and stability will prevail in Libya through a peaceful settlement that allows for a fair distribution of wealth and power.” Mr El Sisi said Egypt planned to host an African counterterrorism summit.

News article:
The efforts of Turkey and Algeria, as well as the intensified efforts of the United Nations for finding a permanent, peaceful solution to the Libyan conflict, have seen results, while the ongoing talks for a lasting cease-fire in the war-torn country seem promising, Algerian Ambassador to Ankara Mourad Adjabi stated. “There is significant coordination and an understanding between Turkey and Algeria; it is thanks to the joint efforts of the two countries that the Berlin conference took place, which can be described as a direct result,” the ambassador said in an exclusive interview to Daily Sabah, adding that the two countries should continue to work toward their common objectives regarding the Libyan conflict. Pointing to bilateral visits between Algeria and Turkey, the ambassador indicated that Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu paid two visits in three months to Algeria, followed by the historic visit of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan when they tried to find a peaceful political solution. “For the first time since the outbreak of this conflict with the regrettable intervention of NATO in 2011, in particular France and the U.K., we have seen major developments in Berlin. This was the very first time the U.N., the EU, the African Union (AU) and the most important players, whether regionally or globally, decided to meet and discuss with a view to finding a durable solution that would be peaceful and political, including all Libyan stakeholders with the international communities' support,” the ambassador elaborated, underlining that the conference was the first genuine and serious attempt to find a solution and the starting point of a “promising process.” Fighting has continued on the ground despite a call for a cease-fire by Turkey and Russia starting on Jan. 12 and an international summit on Libya in Berlin on Jan. 19 aimed at putting an end to foreign interference. Last week the Geneva talks under the auspices of the U.N. took place for the first round of talks between eastern Libya based putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar and the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) based in the capital Tripoli. “Geneva is the transformation of a truce into a sustainable cease-fire,” the ambassador continued. “Although there was no agreement, both sides agreed on the need to expedite the resettlement of IDPs and agreed on an understanding to restore normalcy to conflict-affected areas.” “The situation continues to be complex, but there is a truce. Talks are ongoing, while there is a heavier engagement of the U.N. and the AU,” Adjabi said, indicating that Algeria is happy to see that the AU is now involved in the search for a solution to the conflict in Africa. “It is not easy to find a solution for a conflict that lasted for nearly a decade and worsened with foreign interference; yet, there is no alternative – the alternative to peace is war,” he said. Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in his inaugural speech following the presidential elections on Dec.12 listed the Libyan conflict as one of the priorities of Algeria in terms of its foreign policy. He pledged that the new Algeria will spare no efforts to find a solution to the conflict in Libya – a country with which Algeria shares a 1,000-kilometer border as well as a common past and future. The ambassador further elaborated that Algeria started a process to listen and talk with all parties, starting with Libya's Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and Çavuşoğlu, Egypt, Italy, Khalifa Haftar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the AU. Region suffers from war, terrorism Besides causing a humanitarian disaster within the country amid ongoing clashes and civilian casualties, the war in Libya has also taken a heavy toll on the region and neighboring countries. “The region is facing heavy threats, including terrorism, the smuggling of arms, illegal trafficking, migration and endangering the region's peace and stability,” Adjabi stated, explaining that Algeria was among the very first victims of the Libyan conflict when terrorists coming from Libya mobilized to blow up a vital oil facility in Algeria’s Tiguentourine in the south, constituting around 15% of total output, which was hindered by the Algerian army. The ambassador further indicated that the spread of terrorism in the Sahel region was dangerous, which was one of the reasons why Algeria proposed hosting negotiations between Libyan stakeholders and reiterated this aim during the AU’s recent summit on Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The importance of finding African solutions for African problems was underlined during the summit, while it was also highlighted that Libya is growing more complicated, with "sophisticated" arms being smuggled to the Sahel region from the country. Since the ouster of late ruler Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, two seats of power have emerged in Libya: Haftar, supported mainly by Egypt and the UAE, and the GNA, which enjoys U.N. and international recognition. Presidential visit expected soon “The two countries entered a new era in bilateral relations,” the ambassador stated, highlighting that President Tebboune will visit Turkey this year, following President Erdoğan’s invitation. Adjabi further indicated that during this visit the first session of the High-Level Cooperation Council will be held. Mentioning that Erdoğan’s recent visit was the fourth to Algeria, after his two visits as prime minister and now two as president, the ambassador said that it was a very successful visit with historic initiatives and projects planned, including the setting up of the High-Level Cooperation Council for the first time which would convene once every two years and would be co-chaired by the two presidents. The first session of this council will take place most probably in the coming months, he added, saying that it would supervise the implementation of all the decisions made in various fields. Indicating that the reconvening of the joint commission is also another significant initiative that could take place next month in Algeria, Adjabi said it had not taken place for the last eight years until the two presidents recently decided to revive it again. Algeria and Turkey will also open cultural centers in each other’s countries. Saying that the bilateral trade volume represents about $4 billion at present and is expected to be raised to $5 billion, Adjabi specified that Turkey is the first investor in Algeria outside the sector of hydrocarbons with $3.5 billion invested so far. The main sectors of bilateral cooperation are construction, textile, steel, energy and pharmaceuticals. Yet, the ambassador elaborated that Algeria aims to find new fields of cooperation beside the traditional ones. Algeria is the largest country in Africa, covering an area of 2,381,741 square kilometers, and possesses a sizable amount of natural gas and petroleum deposits, which makes it the fourth-biggest economy in the region. With a 1,200-kilometer Mediterranean shoreline, the country is an important gateway to global trade for Africa. “We are also planning to organize here in Turkey for the first time a huge meeting that would involve economic operators and businesspersons of the two countries in various fields, and this mechanism is to be institutionalized, in other words, we expect such a meeting to take place every year, alternately in Turkey and Algeria,” the Algerian ambassador said, underlining that the prospects of cooperation are highly promising. Mentioning the ancient bonds of fraternity between the two people, Adjabi said, “For a long time the history of the world and the history of the region has been written by outsiders, by Westerners, and it is more than urgent to rewrite our common history by ourselves.” Turkey’s relationship with Algeria dates back to the 16th century when Ottoman Navy Adm. Barbaros Hayreddin Paşa came to the country in 1516. The North African country was an Ottoman vassal state from 1519 to 1830, when the French invaded and colonized the country. The two countries celebrated the 500th anniversary of bilateral ties in 2016. Diplomatic relations between Ankara and Algiers were instituted in 1962 when Algeria reclaimed its independence from French colonialists.

Adjabi further indicated that during this visit the first session of the High-Level Cooperation Council will be held. Mentioning that Erdoğan’s recent visit was the fourth to Algeria, after his two visits as prime minister and now two as president, the ambassador said that it was a very successful visit with historic initiatives and projects planned, including the setting up of the High-Level Cooperation Council for the first time which would convene once every two years and would be co-chaired by the two presidents. The first session of this council will take place most probably in the coming months, he added, saying that it would supervise the implementation of all the decisions made in various fields. Indicating that the reconvening of the joint commission is also another significant initiative that could take place next month in Algeria, Adjabi said it had not taken place for the last eight years until the two presidents recently decided to revive it again. Algeria and Turkey will also open cultural centers in each other’s countries. Saying that the bilateral trade volume represents about $4 billion at present and is expected to be raised to $5 billion, Adjabi specified that Turkey is the first investor in Algeria outside the sector of hydrocarbons with $3.5 billion invested so far. The main sectors of bilateral cooperation are construction, textile, steel, energy and pharmaceuticals. Yet, the ambassador elaborated that Algeria aims to find new fields of cooperation beside the traditional ones. Algeria is the largest country in Africa, covering an area of 2,381,741 square kilometers, and possesses a sizable amount of natural gas and petroleum deposits, which makes it the fourth-biggest economy in the region. With a 1,200-kilometer Mediterranean shoreline, the country is an important gateway to global trade for Africa. “We are also planning to organize here in Turkey for the first time a huge meeting that would involve economic operators and businesspersons of the two countries in various fields, and this mechanism is to be institutionalized, in other words, we expect such a meeting to take place every year, alternately in Turkey and Algeria,” the Algerian ambassador said, underlining that the prospects of cooperation are highly promising. Mentioning the ancient bonds of fraternity between the two people, Adjabi said, “For a long time the history of the world and the history of the region has been written by outsiders, by Westerners, and it is more than urgent to rewrite our common history by ourselves.” Turkey’s relationship with Algeria dates back to the 16th century when Ottoman Navy Adm. Barbaros Hayreddin Paşa came to the country in 1516. The North African country was an Ottoman vassal state from 1519 to 1830, when the French invaded and colonized the country. The two countries celebrated the 500th anniversary of bilateral ties in 2016. Diplomatic relations between Ankara and Algiers were instituted in 1962 when Algeria reclaimed its independence from French colonialists.

News article:
The efforts of Turkey and Algeria, as well as the intensified efforts of the United Nations for finding a permanent, peaceful solution to the Libyan conflict, have seen results, while the ongoing talks for a lasting cease-fire in the war-torn country seem promising, Algerian Ambassador to Ankara Mourad Adjabi stated. “There is significant coordination and an understanding between Turkey and Algeria; it is thanks to the joint efforts of the two countries that the Berlin conference took place, which can be described as a direct result,” the ambassador said in an exclusive interview to Daily Sabah, adding that the two countries should continue to work toward their common objectives regarding the Libyan conflict. Pointing to bilateral visits between Algeria and Turkey, the ambassador indicated that Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu paid two visits in three months to Algeria, followed by the historic visit of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan when they tried to find a peaceful political solution. “For the first time since the outbreak of this conflict with the regrettable intervention of NATO in 2011, in particular France and the U.K., we have seen major developments in Berlin. This was the very first time the U.N., the EU, the African Union (AU) and the most important players, whether regionally or globally, decided to meet and discuss with a view to finding a durable solution that would be peaceful and political, including all Libyan stakeholders with the international communities' support,” the ambassador elaborated, underlining that the conference was the first genuine and serious attempt to find a solution and the starting point of a “promising process.” Fighting has continued on the ground despite a call for a cease-fire by Turkey and Russia starting on Jan. 12 and an international summit on Libya in Berlin on Jan. 19 aimed at putting an end to foreign interference. Last week the Geneva talks under the auspices of the U.N. took place for the first round of talks between eastern Libya based putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar and the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) based in the capital Tripoli. “Geneva is the transformation of a truce into a sustainable cease-fire,” the ambassador continued. “Although there was no agreement, both sides agreed on the need to expedite the resettlement of IDPs and agreed on an understanding to restore normalcy to conflict-affected areas.” “The situation continues to be complex, but there is a truce. Talks are ongoing, while there is a heavier engagement of the U.N. and the AU,” Adjabi said, indicating that Algeria is happy to see that the AU is now involved in the search for a solution to the conflict in Africa. “It is not easy to find a solution for a conflict that lasted for nearly a decade and worsened with foreign interference; yet, there is no alternative – the alternative to peace is war,” he said. Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in his inaugural speech following the presidential elections on Dec.12 listed the Libyan conflict as one of the priorities of Algeria in terms of its foreign policy. He pledged that the new Algeria will spare no efforts to find a solution to the conflict in Libya – a country with which Algeria shares a 1,000-kilometer border as well as a common past and future. The ambassador further elaborated that Algeria started a process to listen and talk with all parties, starting with Libya's Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and Çavuşoğlu, Egypt, Italy, Khalifa Haftar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the AU. Region suffers from war, terrorism Besides causing a humanitarian disaster within the country amid ongoing clashes and civilian casualties, the war in Libya has also taken a heavy toll on the region and neighboring countries. “The region is facing heavy threats, including terrorism, the smuggling of arms, illegal trafficking, migration and endangering the region's peace and stability,” Adjabi stated, explaining that Algeria was among the very first victims of the Libyan conflict when terrorists coming from Libya mobilized to blow up a vital oil facility in Algeria’s Tiguentourine in the south, constituting around 15% of total output, which was hindered by the Algerian army. The ambassador further indicated that the spread of terrorism in the Sahel region was dangerous, which was one of the reasons why Algeria proposed hosting negotiations between Libyan stakeholders and reiterated this aim during the AU’s recent summit on Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The importance of finding African solutions for African problems was underlined during the summit, while it was also highlighted that Libya is growing more complicated, with "sophisticated" arms being smuggled to the Sahel region from the country. Since the ouster of late ruler Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, two seats of power have emerged in Libya: Haftar, supported mainly by Egypt and the UAE, and the GNA, which enjoys U.N. and international recognition. Presidential visit expected soon “The two countries entered a new era in bilateral relations,” the ambassador stated, highlighting that President Tebboune will visit Turkey this year, following President Erdoğan’s invitation.

News article:
The UN Security Council endorsed a 55-point road map for ending the war in Libya on Wednesday and condemned the recent increase in violence in the oil-rich North African country. The vote on the British-drafted resolution was 14-0, with Russia abstaining even though Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the 12 leaders who agreed to the plan at a conference in Berlin on Jan. 19. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he abstained because the government has ``serious doubts'' about whether the resolution can be implemented and end the war between rival governments ``in the way we'd like to see it.`` He said the Berlin plan ``has one defect ... and that is a lack of clearly expressed consent from the Libyan sides themselves.'' ``Events will show us who was right,'' Nebenzia said. ``And if the resolution will have a positive impact in resolving the conflict, I will be the first to acknowledge I was wrong.`` British Ambassador Karen Pierce countered that ``the resolution is viable,'' saying all it does ``is give concrete expression to the commitments that leaders adopted at Berlin _ and that included adoption by President Putin.'' ``We all want to see it implemented,'' she said. ``But it will be up to the parties on the ground and their foreign backers as to whether or not it gets implemented. So to the Russians and the others who have very close interests in Libya, I would think the remedy is in their hands.'' Libya has been in turmoil since 2011, when a civil war toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. In the chaos that followed the country was divided A weak administration that holds the capital of Tripoli and parts of the country's west is backed by Turkey, which recently sent thousands of soldiers to Libya, and to a lesser degree Qatar and Italy. On the other side is a rival government in the east that supports the National Libyan Army's commander Khalifa Hafter, whose forces launched an offensive to capture the capital last April and are backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt as well as France and Russia. Acting US deputy ambassador Cherith Norman Chalet told the council after the vote that it's ``very unfortunate that foreign mercenaries, including from the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group, are making an inclusive political solution harder to achieve'' and making it harder for the two sides to get together. The resolution demands that all countries refrain from interfering in Libya's conflict and its internal affairs and observe a UN arms embargo, ``including by ceasing all support for and withdrawing all armed mercenary personnel.'' Russia sought unsuccessfully to change references to growing involvement of mercenaries in the initial draft to ``foreign terrorist fighters.'' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the Berlin agreement has been repeatedly violated by continuing arms deliveries to the warring parties and escalating fighting. He called the current offensives by rival forces ``a scandal,'' saying the commitments ``apparently were made without a true intention of respecting them.'' The resolution welcomes last week's cease-fire talks between Libya's warring sides in Geneva and calls for their continuation ``without further delay in order to agree a permanent cease-fire.'' It asks Guterres to submit his views on conditions for a cease-fire and proposals for effective monitoring of a truce, with a view to making detailed recommendations when a cease-fire is announced. The African Union, European Union and Arab League have been mentioned as possible participants in cease-fire monitoring along with the UN. Germany's deputy ambassador, Juergen Schulz, said the council was sending ``an important signal for peace in Libya, reaffirming the concrete commitments of all the participants of the Berlin conference.'' He welcomed the timing _ ahead of a Feb. 16 follow-up ministerial meeting of Berlin conference participants on the sidelines of the Munich security conference. ``The swift implementation of the Berlin conclusions is now crucial in light of the ongoing violations of international humanitarian law and reports of mounting civilian casualties,'' Schulz said. The resolution threatens sanctions against those supporting acts that threaten peace which Schulz said demonstrates the council's ``resolve to hold violators accountable.'' South African Ambassador Jerry Matjila, whose country chairs the African Union, stressed Libya's roots in Africa, saying the arms embargo must be observed to prevent the conflict spilling into the Sahel. ``The African Union has been very ready to play a central role, including the issue of monitoring of peace,'' he said. ``The road ahead is going to be very, very difficult, long. So it really needs all hands on deck, and you couldn't do that without African hands.'' Search Keywords: Short link:

Eastern Libyan forces attacked the sea port of Libya's capital on Tuesday as they targeted a Turkish vessel bringing in arms, an eastern official said according to a report by Reuters. Eastern officials did not provide details about the alleged arms shipment at the port, which has remained open for food and other imports as rival factions battle for control of the capital. The eastern-based Libya National Army (LNA) faction, led by Khalifa Haftar, started a campaign in April last year to take the city, which is seat of the internationally recognised government also backed by Turkey. Authorities moved all ships including fuel tankers out of the port after Tuesday's attack, two port officials said. The Tripoli forces said the LNA had fired four missiles. Since January, Turkey has sent several ships carrying arms and heavy trucks to Tripoli and Misrata, another western port, diplomats say. UN: Libya arms embargo is a 'joke' The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan and Russian mercenaries. Eastern ports and airports are out of range of the Tripoli forces. Tuesday's attack happened as officers from the Tripoli forces and LNA prepared to meet for a second round of talks in Geneva to establish a permanent truce. Both sides refused again to sit in the same room, UN Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told reporters, although he said he was hopeful of making progress. "So while the situation on the ground remains a situation where the truce is very fragile… nobody has so far reneged on the principle of accepting the truce and the political process is trying to find a way to move forward," he said. He added that a ceasefire was not a precondition for advancing on other matters such as how to better distribute state revenues from oil, saying economic discussions were going "pretty well". "It is going pretty well on the economic side, but it is harder on the military side," he said.

Tribesmen and other groups allied to the LNA joined with Haftar's forces a month ago to block major ports in eastern Libya and the southern Sharara oilfield, reducing oil output by more than 1 million barrels a day. Salame had spoken to some tribal leaders to hear their conditions to end the blockade. A further round of discussions is planned in Geneva next week.

He added that a ceasefire was not a precondition for advancing on other matters such as how to better distribute state revenues from oil, saying economic discussions were going "pretty well". "It is going pretty well on the economic side, but it is harder on the military side," he said.

Tribesmen and other groups allied to the LNA joined with Haftar's forces a month ago to block major ports in eastern Libya and the southern Sharara oilfield, reducing oil output by more than 1 million barrels a day. Salame had spoken to some tribal leaders to hear their conditions to end the blockade. A further round of discussions is planned in Geneva next week.

News article:
Eastern Libyan forces attacked the sea port of Libya's capital on Tuesday as they targeted a Turkish vessel bringing in arms, an eastern official said according to a report by Reuters. Eastern officials did not provide details about the alleged arms shipment at the port, which has remained open for food and other imports as rival factions battle for control of the capital. The eastern-based Libya National Army (LNA) faction, led by Khalifa Haftar, started a campaign in April last year to take the city, which is seat of the internationally recognised government also backed by Turkey. Authorities moved all ships including fuel tankers out of the port after Tuesday's attack, two port officials said. The Tripoli forces said the LNA had fired four missiles. Since January, Turkey has sent several ships carrying arms and heavy trucks to Tripoli and Misrata, another western port, diplomats say. UN: Libya arms embargo is a 'joke' The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan and Russian mercenaries. Eastern ports and airports are out of range of the Tripoli forces. Tuesday's attack happened as officers from the Tripoli forces and LNA prepared to meet for a second round of talks in Geneva to establish a permanent truce. Both sides refused again to sit in the same room, UN Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told reporters, although he said he was hopeful of making progress. "So while the situation on the ground remains a situation where the truce is very fragile… nobody has so far reneged on the principle of accepting the truce and the political process is trying to find a way to move forward," he said.

News article:
EU foreign ministers have agreed on naval and air measures to to try and stop weapon flows to Libya. Critics say it's a toothless deal that will fail to stabilize the country riven by civil war. After intense debate, EU foreign ministers in Brussels agreed Monday to launch a new mission to enforce the weapons embargo against Libya. After meeting his European counterparts, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas announced that a decision had been reached, adding that the new Libya mission would entail a "maritime component," meaning dispatched naval vessels. It will also include aerial and satellite assets. As agreed at the Libya peace conference in Berlin this January, the mission will form one pillar of the EU's revamped overall strategy aimed at stabilizing the North African country. Painstaking diplomatic progress Operation Sophia was suspended last year over Italy's protests that EU vessels were rescuing migrants in distress at sea and allowing them to disembark at Italian ports. More recently, Austria's government opposed restarting a mission, arguing that sending EU ships along the Libyan coast would lead to a rise in Europe-bound migrants. Maas stressed that the new mission would see EU ships dispatched only to the eastern Mediterranean, far away from the sea routes used by migrants, despite the fact that arms smugglers do not stick to observed routes. He reiterated that relaunching the EU mission would help fulfill the Berlin agreement, which envisions separating the warring parties in Libya and ensuring their respective international allies stop supplying arms. Read more: Migration worries shouldn't block EU Libya mission, German foreign minister says More recently, at the weekend's Munich Security Conference, the countries involved in the Libyan conflict once again agreed to honor the arms embargo. Yet UN deputy special envoy for Libya, Stephanie Williams, described the arms embargo as "a joke." "We all really need to step up here. It's complicated because there are violations by land, sea and air, but it needs to be monitored and there needs to be accountability," she said in Munich. Arms by land, sea and air After Libya's long-term ruler Moammar Gadhafi was toppled in 2011, regional militias armed themselves with weapons from Gadhafi's military. With the outbreak of civil war in 2014, arms imports to the country increased significantly. Last year, a bloody proxy war erupted on Libyan soil. Arms deliveries are reaching war-torn Libya by sea, land and air. Rebel warlord Khalifa Haftar, supported through arms deliveries from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Jordan and Russia, is pitted against the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, which is recognized by the UN and the EU and receives Turkish weapons. Read more: Libya's battle for Tripoli — what you need to know Both sides, rebels and government forces, receive weapons from their international backers Image: picture-alliance/Photoshot/H. Turkia How much influence does the EU have? EU diplomat-in-chief Borrell said negotiations over the new EU mission had been intense, but enough EU states had ultimately volunteered to send marine vessels. "There will be no shortage" of ships, Borrell said, adding that whenever an EU frigate discovers arms smugglers, it will be able to stop them. However, he admitted this will not be easy. Borrell could not specify how many Libya-bound arms actually arrive in the country by sea. He added that the EU could not be expected to use ground troops to patrol the the Egyptian-Libyan border, through which arms are still delivered. The aerial surveillance component of the EU's operation will only gather intelligence. To actually stop all arms deliveries to Libya, the EU would have to dispatch ground troops and fully control the country's airspace using fighter jets. A recent study from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) found, "There is no easy option for the EU that requires little work and guarantees success in enforce the existing arms embargo. All options have significant political, financial and military costs." The study argued that the EU lacks the military means to make this happen, and that economic sanctions would be key to cutting the arms flow. Maas (center) said it was important that international powers stop supplying sides in the Libyan conflict Image: picture-alliance/AP Photo/F. Seco Not enough, say critics Liberal party members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have reported over 100 recent breaches. They criticize the foreign minsters' agreement for not going far enough. Nicola Beer, an MEP with the business-friendly Free Democrats, said the foreign minsters had wasted an opportunity to "agree on sanctions that would send a clear message to Turkey, Russia or the United Arab Emirates." In her view, a mission without sanctions will not be enough to establish peace in Libya and fight the root causes of migration to Europe. In turn, Green MEPs have complained that the mission does not include migrant sea rescue. MEP Erik Marquardt said, "The vessels should be where people in distress are." He pointed out that over the past year, EU governments have prevented migrants from being rescued and simultaneously helped Libyan militias restrict migration possibilities.

The UN said on Friday ceasefire talks were back on track between the forces fighting over Libya’s capital. The statement comes days after the internationally-recognized government pulled out of the talks as its foes shelled Tripoli’s port. However, there was no immediate comment from the Government of National Accord (GNA), which withdrew from the talks on Tuesday, Reuters said. The rival Libyan National Army (LNA) Commander Khalifa Haftar was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti as saying a ceasefire would only be possible if Turkish and Syrian fighters stopped supporting the GNA. Turkey has backed the GNA to fend off the LNA, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Five military officers from both sides have been holding indirect talks meeting in separate rooms with the UN envoy Ghassan Salame shuttling between them, but with no sign of any progress on the ground.

Turkey confirms presence of allied Syria mercenaries in Libya Iran Press TV Friday, 21 February 2020 3:13 PM Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has confirmed for the first time the presence of pro-Turkish Syrian militants in Libya. "Turkey is there with a training force. There are also people from the Syrian National Army," Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul on Friday, referring to a group of anti-Damascus militants previously known as the so-called Free Syrian Army. Libya's internationally recognized government, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, has previously sought Turkey's support against rebels under the command of Khalifa Haftar, who receive support from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Haftar's rebels have been fighting to seize the Libyan capital. Since 2014, Libya has been divided between the Tripoli-based government and a camp in the eastern city of Tobruk, supported militarily by Haftar's rebels. Peace talks to end the fighting in Libya have failed. A shaky ceasefire has been agreed but has been routinely violated. Earlier on Friday, Haftar said he would be ready for a ceasefire on the condition that Turkish forces leave Libya and Ankara stops providing the government with weapons. He called for "the withdrawal of Syrian and Turkish mercenaries, an end to Turkish arms supplies to Tripoli, and the liquidation of terrorist groups" in the capital. The Turkish president hit out at Haftar and repeated allegations that Russia had dispatched 2,500 mercenaries from the Wagner, a private security company. Moscow denies the allegation. Erdogan said Haftar was backed by "nearly 15,000 terrorists." He also referred to mercenaries from Sudan, although a United Nations (UN) panel last month refuted the presence of Sudanese paramilitaries, saying there was no "credible evidence" on the issue. Libya plunged into chaos in 2011, when a popular uprising and a NATO intervention led to the ouster of long-time dictator, Muammar Gaddafi.

News article:
Russia says Turkey helping foreign militants enter Libya Iran Press TV Wednesday, 26 February 2020 10:12 AM Russia says Turkey is helping foreign militants cross into Libya, where rebel forces are attempting to unseat the internationally-recognized government. The Interfax news agency on Wednesday cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov as making the remark. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has previously confirmed the presence of pro-Turkish Syrian militants in Libya. "Turkey is there with a training force. There are also people from the Syrian National Army," Erdogan said last Friday, referring to a group of anti-Damascus militants previously known as the so-called Free Syrian Army. Turkey has also deployed its regular military forces to Libya to shore up the government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. Rebel forces under the command of a general named Khalifa Haftar have been fighting since April last year to capture Tripoli and unseat the government. Numerous attempts to bring about peace between the two sides have failed. A shaky ceasefire, brokered by Russia and Turkey, has been in place since January but has been violated dozens of times. The conflicting sides have recently been negotiating under the auspices of the United Nations in Geneva. Bogdanov also pointed out that Libya's warring sides were generally observing the truce, but did not seem to be ready to fully embrace the military and political decisions made in the Berlin conference in January, hinting at an agreement that the tentative truce would eventually become permanent to set the stage for the advancement of a political process. Libya rebels claim to have downed Turkish drone Separately on Wednesday, Libyan rebel forces said they had shot down a Turkish drone that was flying over the Mitiga International Airport, east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. A video released by the Libyan rebels on Wednesday showed a destroyed unmanned aerial vehicle purportedly south of Tripoli. Libya has since 2014 been divided between the internationally recognized government of Sarraj, and a camp in the eastern city of Tobruk, supported militarily by the rebels under the command of Haftar. The rebel militia receive support from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Their offensive on Tripoli has so far killed 1,000 people and displaced some 146,000 people, according to the UN. Back in November, Sarraj signed a military cooperation deal with President Erdogan, under which Ankara agreed to send troops to support the government.

The Syrian regime of Bashar Assad reopened the Libyan Embassy in Damascus on Tuesday after an eight-year hiatus and handed it over to the illegitimate government of east Libya-based putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar. The embassy was given to Haftar's government after the two signed a memorandum of understanding to reopen embassies, the official SANA news agency reported. The Syrian regime is the first to officially recognize Haftar's government with the approval of an embassy. Haftar has no other official international recognition, though Egypt, France and the United Arab Emirates have verbally expressed support. Notably, the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, enjoys U.N. and international recognition. Haftar launched an offensive to capture Tripoli from GNA last April, which led to chaos and bloodshed but stalled on the outskirts of the city.

Source: Xinhua| 2020-03-25 20:31:23|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close RAMALLAH, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestine on Wednesday urged Israel to immediately release over 5,000 Palestinian prisoners from its jails amidst an outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. In a press statement, the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Israeli Prisons Service (IPS) is not providing proper health protection to Palestinian prisoners, despite an alarming increase of coronavirus cases in Israel. "Israel is in violation of its obligations under international law, the Geneva Conventions and human rights principles that demand Israel, as the occupying power, to take full and direct responsibility for the life and health of the prisoners," said the statement. "Palestine will continue to follow up on the health conditions of the prisoners in light of the outbreak of this pandemic with the relevant international parties, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross," it added. Earlier, a Palestinian prisoner in an Israeli prison located in the south of Israel set fire to a room used by the prison guards in protest of the prison authorities "neglect of the health conditions for the prisoners," according to official sources. Qadri Abu Bakr, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Detainees Affairs Commission, said IPS reduced the medical staff in jails to only one nurse in every facility, warning that this situation could lead to serious reactions from the prisoners. Last week, Palestinian and Israeli sources said that four Palestinian prisoners in Megiddo prison were quarantined after they were suspected of contracting coronavirus disease from an Israeli interrogator. Abu Bakr urged the International Red Cross and other human rights organizations to intervene on behalf of the prisoners to make sure they get the proper health care amid the global coronavirus pandemic. There are over 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, including around 300 children, according to official data.

She explained, "They are entirely disconnected, and it can continue this way for months." Meeting with lawyers is one of the only ways that prisoners, many of whom have been locked up for years, can communicate with the outside world. Whatever the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis, Adalah lawyer Aiah Haj Odeh insisted that the Israeli authorities should not be allowed to run rampant over fundamental human rights. "International law requires that Israel must recognize the right of prisoners and detainees to visit with family, and to consult with lawyers and access the courts," he added.

News article:
Unsurprisingly, Israel has not heeded requests to safeguard the health of Palestinian prisoners in its jails. Besides recommending "precautionary measures", which are likely to provide no protection in confined spaces, it seems that Israel will persist with its medical neglect strategies, which have resulted in Palestinian prisoners dying. Yet again, there have not been, and nor are there likely to be, any repercussions from the international community. The initial appeal by the prisoners has been followed up with a petition launched by the Palestinian Prisoners' Society asking for international intervention. The petition calls for the release of over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners — the most vulnerable or susceptible to illness — given that Israel routinely disregards the health concerns and conditions of the people it puts behind bars. Two Israeli prison officers have already contracted the coronavirus Covid-19, and a recently released Palestinian prisoner has also tested positive, thus raising concerns about the spread of the virus while Israel, true to its extermination by stealth tactic, does nothing. Appealing for urgent humanitarian action is unlikely to prompt UN action against Israel. Bureaucratic statements and recommendations have failed to put an end to Israeli practices such as administrative detention — jailing someone indefinitely with neither charge nor trial — and the abuse of minors in prison; the deprivation of rights, including family visits; and both timely and appropriate medical attention. READ: Israel under cover of the coronavirus crisis The fear of medical neglect among prisoners is justified. Since 1967, 222 Palestinian prisoners have died after Israel refused treatment for life-threatening illnesses, including cancer. If Israel deprives Palestinians of treatment for illnesses which are not contagious, how will it act when faced with the possibility of a pandemic spreading which has the potential to wipe out the stalwarts of Palestinian resistance to its military occupation? On both political and humanitarian grounds, the UN should intervene to safeguard all Palestinian prisoners from the possibility of dying as a direct result of Israel's withholding of treatment.

Unsurprisingly, Israel has not heeded requests to safeguard the health of Palestinian prisoners in its jails. Besides recommending "precautionary measures", which are likely to provide no protection in confined spaces, it seems that Israel will persist with its medical neglect strategies, which have resulted in Palestinian prisoners dying. Yet again, there have not been, and nor are there likely to be, any repercussions from the international community. The initial appeal by the prisoners has been followed up with a petition launched by the Palestinian Prisoners' Society asking for international intervention. The petition calls for the release of over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners — the most vulnerable or susceptible to illness — given that Israel routinely disregards the health concerns and conditions of the people it puts behind bars. Two Israeli prison officers have already contracted the coronavirus Covid-19, and a recently released Palestinian prisoner has also tested positive, thus raising concerns about the spread of the virus while Israel, true to its extermination by stealth tactic, does nothing. Appealing for urgent humanitarian action is unlikely to prompt UN action against Israel. Bureaucratic statements and recommendations have failed to put an end to Israeli practices such as administrative detention — jailing someone indefinitely with neither charge nor trial — and the abuse of minors in prison; the deprivation of rights, including family visits; and both timely and appropriate medical attention. READ: Israel under cover of the coronavirus crisis The fear of medical neglect among prisoners is justified. Since 1967, 222 Palestinian prisoners have died after Israel refused treatment for life-threatening illnesses, including cancer. If Israel deprives Palestinians of treatment for illnesses which are not contagious, how will it act when faced with the possibility of a pandemic spreading which has the potential to wipe out the stalwarts of Palestinian resistance to its military occupation? On both political and humanitarian grounds, the UN should intervene to safeguard all Palestinian prisoners from the possibility of dying as a direct result of Israel's withholding of treatment. However, the UN's agenda is divested of protection for human rights, in particular those in association with colonial violence.

News article:
AMMAN: Palestinian Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Fadi Hidmi was released by Israeli police on Friday afternoon after being arrested for the fourth time without charge. Ministry spokesman Awad Awad told Arab News that Hidmi had been “warned” not to “move around” or “do any work in” Jerusalem in accordance with measures being taken to minimize the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Awad also claimed that Hidmi had been physically abused by the police, saying that the minister was “punched in the face and forced to wear a mask with blood on it.” CCTV at Hidmi’s Mount of Olives house show that he was manhandled by Israeli police during his arrest in the early hours of Friday. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld confirmed the arrest. Rosenfeld told the Israeli press that Hidmi was arrested “on suspicion of Palestinian activities in Jerusalem.” He said police searched Hidmi’s home and confiscated documents as well as “large sums of money. Israeli media said that the police had confiscated NIS10,000 ($2,750) found in the house. Hidmi, a Jerusalem resident, was the director of the Jerusalem Chamber of Commerce and Industry before accepting his current job in the Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh’s government. Before Hidmi’s release on Friday, Shtayyeh wrote on social media: “Israel targets who work for #Jerusalem, even at such critical moments as we work to save our people's lives from #COVID19.” East Jerusalem — with a population of 350,000 — has been all but ignored by the Israeli Ministry of Health in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Jamil Kousa, director of the St. Joseph hospital, told Palestine TV that he was only informed on March 25 that his hospital should be prepared to accept patients with COVID-19. Ahmad Buderi, the coordinator of the Jerusalem Alliance — an organization launched to help combat COVID-19 — has said that people in the city are depending almost solely on local initiatives to deal with the pandemic. Before his arrest, Hidmi launched the website madad.ps to coordinate the distribution of urgenly needed food and medical supplies to the city’s residents. Walid Nammour, secretary-general of the Jerusalem Hospital Network, estimates that the city’s six hospitals need $7 million to to deal with the potential spread of COVID-19 in East Jerusalem. Nammour told Arab News that 300-400 ventilators are needed and that only 26 are available at present.

YERUSHALAYIM (AP) — Israeli police arrested the Palestinian Authority’s minister for Yerushalayim for allegedly violating an Israeli ban on Palestinian political activities in the eastern part of the city. Fadi al-Hidmi was arrested at his home near Har Zeisim. His office circulated surveillance camera footage showing police searching his home with dogs. It said they confiscated 10,000 shekels (around $2,750). It was the fourth time he has been arrested. Israel bars the Palestinian Authority from operating in the capital or carrying out any political activities there. Palestinian officials claimed al-Hidmi was working to assist residents as part of their response to the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh tweeted: “We demand his immediate release.” Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said al-Hidmi was arrested “on suspicions of Palestinian activities in Yerushalayim.” He confirmed that police searched the home and confiscated documents as well as “large sums of money.” He said the arrest was not connected to any efforts to combat the pandemic.

A Palestinian in the Gaza Strip was arrested for carrying out activities which encourage normalisation of relations with Israel, the Ministry of Interior reported yesterday. Spokesman for the Hamas-run Ministry of Interior in the Gaza Strip, Iyad Al-Bazm, said Rami Aman had been arrested after a warrant was issued by the prosecution because he had established "normalisation activities with the Israeli occupation via the Internet". Aman and his colleagues had been referred for investigation and the legal procedures will be taken against them, Al-Bazm added. OPINION: The PA is provoking the Palestinians with its Israel normalisation meetings "Establishing any activity or communicating with the Israeli occupation under any cover is a crime punishable by law, and a betrayal of our people and their sacrifices," the official said. Cofounder of the Gaza Youth Committee, Aman held a two-hour Zoom call with "peace activists" from Israel, during which he discussed a number of topics including the coronavirus. According to his family, shortly after the call, he was summoned by the Hamas security apparatus and they have not heard from him since yesterday.

News article:
A Palestinian in the Gaza Strip was arrested for carrying out activities which encourage normalisation of relations with Israel, the Ministry of Interior reported yesterday. Spokesman for the Hamas-run Ministry of Interior in the Gaza Strip, Iyad Al-Bazm, said Rami Aman had been arrested after a warrant was issued by the prosecution because he had established "normalisation activities with the Israeli occupation via the Internet". Aman and his colleagues had been referred for investigation and the legal procedures will be taken against them, Al-Bazm added. OPINION: The PA is provoking the Palestinians with its Israel normalisation meetings "Establishing any activity or communicating with the Israeli occupation under any cover is a crime punishable by law, and a betrayal of our people and their sacrifices," the official said. Cofounder of the Gaza Youth Committee, Aman held a two-hour Zoom call with "peace activists" from Israel, during which he discussed a number of topics including the coronavirus. According to his family, shortly after the call, he was summoned by the Hamas security apparatus and they have not heard from him since yesterday.

Rami Aman, a 38-year-old peace activist from Gaza, has not been heard from since Thursday.

"The Israeli forces in Ramallah and al-Bireh arrested PLC member Mohammed Abu Tir from his home residence," Hamas said in a statement reported by the German News Agency. According to the statement, Israel transferred Abu Tir away from Jerusalem in 2011. After that, he was administratively detained several times, noting that he spent almost 30 years of his life in Israeli prisons. Abu Tir joins six other Palestinian MPs currently detained by Israel, including three Hamas members and Fatah member. Meanwhile the rest are members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.

Rami Aman, 36, the founder of the Gaza Youth Committee, and the five others were detained, accused of "treason", after speaking to the dozens of Israeli activists online.

"As a Palestinian, before I became a journalist, I am against normalization," said Khoudary. Amnesty confirmed that Khoudary had been a "short-term freelance contract worker" who helped document protests in Gaza last year, but said she no longer works for the organization.

Khoudary herself was detained by Hamas last year for posts supporting Gaza street protests. Aman was briefly detained two years ago on similar charges. Debate has flared on social networks, with some Palestinians condemning the latest arrests and others congratulating Khoudary for working against normalization. Collaborating or even communicating with Israelis is controversial among Palestinians, with many seeing such dialogue as a waste of time. 5 View gallery The border wall between Gaza and Israel ( Photo: Getty Images ) Others argue that shutting down dialogue makes a solution between the warring parties even more unlikely.

"In actuality what is needed before any kind of reconciliation process is an end to the continuous and structural violence - which in this case is the violent Israeli military occupation."

News article:
Palestinian prisoners today are trapped fighting two fronts: one against the coronavirus pandemic, and the other against Israel's horrific jail conditions; they're dying trying to survive. Four Palestinian prisoners have so far tested positive for the coronavirus with the number expected to increase greatly. Another detainee tested positive for the virus a few days after his release. There are approximately 5,000 Palestinian political prisoners being held in Israeli jails, according to prisoners' rights group Addameer. More than 700 male and female prisoners in Israeli jails are in need of serious healthcare – 17 of whom are in critical condition in the Ramla Prison hospital, which lacks adequate standards of medical care. The majority are cramped in tight quarters, where prisoners cannot practice any form of social distancing, and are left without the necessary cleaning equipment and medical care to ensure their safety from even a less deadly contagion, let alone the potentially fatal coronavirus. Numerous organisations have warned that it would take only one infected person to spread the virus across the whole captive population and lead to a devastating tragedy. READ: Hamas demands release 250 prisoners in exchange for information on missing Israelis In spite of calls to release prisoners to save lives, Israeli authorities are not shouldering the responsibility and assuage international concerns by protecting Palestinian prisoners. Israel is instead using the pretext of the coronavirus to heighten its abuse of Palestinian detainees by imposing harsher restrictions on them. The Israeli Prison Service (IPS) has limited sick and injured prisoners' visits to medical clinics and cancelled all their check-ups despite many suffering symptoms of the virus. It has also barred Palestinian prisoners' legal representatives from direct communication only allowing them to contact their clients over the phone, which leaves them unable to accurately assess the health and safety of the detainees. Cases have been reported of prisoners being denied access to cleaning products and asked to use socks as face masks. This is in addition to canteens in Israeli prisons having stopped supplying a total of 140 products, including vital cleaning supplies. Director of the Prisoners' Centre for Studies, Raafat Hamdouna, said that the Israeli policy of medical negligence is composed of four elements: intentional lack of proper medical examination, lack of proper medicines, lack of laboratory tests and postponing urgent surgeries. He added that the Israeli authorities prevent the Palestinian Ministry of Health from dispatching medicines to Palestinian prisoners. As alarm grows over the danger the virus poses to prisoners, many have forgotten the torture and lack of medical care which have been killing Palestinian detainees since 1967. READ: The coronavirus pandemic is a test of our humanity, morality and solidarity Since then, at least 222 Palestinian prisoners have died in Israeli prisons; at least 65 as a result of a lack of medical care, according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club. Late last year, political prisoner Sami Abu Diak died of terminal cancer and suffered from renal and pulmonary failure while in detention. The poor and inhumane prison conditions and deliberate medical negligence resulted in the spread of tumours in the 36-year-old's body. Abu Diak underwent various surgeries and suffered a number of complications, however, Israeli occupation authorities refused to release him on humanitarian grounds. Those who survive the often decades of detention live their lives with protracted illnesses that accompany them forever. It's slow murder. Precautions to protect the lives of the prisoners were never taken prior to the highly contagious disease. Is it really so shocking that nothing has changed? For decades, Palestinians have lost their lives as a result of medical negligence in prisons, while the Prisoners Affairs Commission explained that 95 per cent of detainees are subjected to torture from the moment of their arrest. This continues during interrogation and even after prisoners are placed in detention centres. Instead of accessing treatment in hospital, many are often held in solitary confinement. Misdiagnoses are common, Ehteram Ghazawneh, the coordinator of the documentation and research unit at Addameer, noted. This delays prisoners' access to the necessary treatment and, in many cases, results in death, he explained. READ: Israel settlers infected with coronavirus brutally attack Palestinian civilians Prisoners have said they plan to take action against their detention condition; this often means they launch open hunger strikes, which leave them weakened and more susceptible to disease. The absence of IPS health measures to protect Palestinian prisoners during the global pandemic makes it ever more clear that Israel seeks to take advantage of the deadly virus to rid it of its Palestinian problem. While the world is preoccupied with trying to cope with the fast spreading, deadly coronavirus, Palestinians continue to battle to survive under a reality that has left them not only prisoners to the occupation but also susceptible to illnesses that would have been treatable, if only they were Israeli.

News article:
Palestinian prisoners today are trapped fighting two fronts: one against the coronavirus pandemic, and the other against Israel's horrific jail conditions; they're dying trying to survive. Four Palestinian prisoners have so far tested positive for the coronavirus with the number expected to increase greatly. Another detainee tested positive for the virus a few days after his release. There are approximately 5,000 Palestinian political prisoners being held in Israeli jails, according to prisoners' rights group Addameer. More than 700 male and female prisoners in Israeli jails are in need of serious healthcare – 17 of whom are in critical condition in the Ramla Prison hospital, which lacks adequate standards of medical care. The majority are cramped in tight quarters, where prisoners cannot practice any form of social distancing, and are left without the necessary cleaning equipment and medical care to ensure their safety from even a less deadly contagion, let alone the potentially fatal coronavirus. Numerous organisations have warned that it would take only one infected person to spread the virus across the whole captive population and lead to a devastating tragedy. READ: Hamas demands release 250 prisoners in exchange for information on missing Israelis In spite of calls to release prisoners to save lives, Israeli authorities are not shouldering the responsibility and assuage international concerns by protecting Palestinian prisoners. Israel is instead using the pretext of the coronavirus to heighten its abuse of Palestinian detainees by imposing harsher restrictions on them. The Israeli Prison Service (IPS) has limited sick and injured prisoners' visits to medical clinics and cancelled all their check-ups despite many suffering symptoms of the virus. It has also barred Palestinian prisoners' legal representatives from direct communication only allowing them to contact their clients over the phone, which leaves them unable to accurately assess the health and safety of the detainees. Cases have been reported of prisoners being denied access to cleaning products and asked to use socks as face masks. This is in addition to canteens in Israeli prisons having stopped supplying a total of 140 products, including vital cleaning supplies. Director of the Prisoners' Centre for Studies, Raafat Hamdouna, said that the Israeli policy of medical negligence is composed of four elements: intentional lack of proper medical examination, lack of proper medicines, lack of laboratory tests and postponing urgent surgeries. He added that the Israeli authorities prevent the Palestinian Ministry of Health from dispatching medicines to Palestinian prisoners. As alarm grows over the danger the virus poses to prisoners, many have forgotten the torture and lack of medical care which have been killing Palestinian detainees since 1967. READ: The coronavirus pandemic is a test of our humanity, morality and solidarity Since then, at least 222 Palestinian prisoners have died in Israeli prisons; at least 65 as a result of a lack of medical care, according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club. Late last year, political prisoner Sami Abu Diak died of terminal cancer and suffered from renal and pulmonary failure while in detention. The poor and inhumane prison conditions and deliberate medical negligence resulted in the spread of tumours in the 36-year-old's body. Abu Diak underwent various surgeries and suffered a number of complications, however, Israeli occupation authorities refused to release him on humanitarian grounds. Those who survive the often decades of detention live their lives with protracted illnesses that accompany them forever. It's slow murder. Precautions to protect the lives of the prisoners were never taken prior to the highly contagious disease. Is it really so shocking that nothing has changed? For decades, Palestinians have lost their lives as a result of medical negligence in prisons, while the Prisoners Affairs Commission explained that 95 per cent of detainees are subjected to torture from the moment of their arrest. This continues during interrogation and even after prisoners are placed in detention centres. Instead of accessing treatment in hospital, many are often held in solitary confinement. Misdiagnoses are common, Ehteram Ghazawneh, the coordinator of the documentation and research unit at Addameer, noted. This delays prisoners' access to the necessary treatment and, in many cases, results in death, he explained. READ: Israel settlers infected with coronavirus brutally attack Palestinian civilians Prisoners have said they plan to take action against their detention condition; this often means they launch open hunger strikes, which leave them weakened and more susceptible to disease. The absence of IPS health measures to protect Palestinian prisoners during the global pandemic makes it ever more clear that Israel seeks to take advantage of the deadly virus to rid it of its Palestinian problem. While the world is preoccupied with trying to cope with the fast spreading, deadly coronavirus, Palestinians continue to battle to survive under a reality that has left them not only prisoners to the occupation but also susceptible to illnesses that would have been treatable, if only they were Israeli.

News article:
The annual commemoration of Palestinian Prisoners' Day can turn easily into a travesty of remembrance. This year, 17 April will be marked with statements calling for the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails on humanitarian grounds due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, there will be scant realisation that the humanitarian principle, when linked to temporary occurrences, is not sufficient as a premise for claiming human rights. It is the legitimate struggle that should frame the call for the prisoners' freedom, not Covid-19. Already in 2020 Israel has detained 1,324 Palestinians; a total of 5,000 are currently held in Israeli jails. In March, coinciding with the coronavirus outbreak in the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel detained 357 Palestinians, including children and women. Israel has built a false narrative about Palestinian resistance to promote its security narrative, hence the "Palestinian terrorists" label. In reality, the Palestinians have a legitimate right to conduct an anti-colonial struggle by any and all means at their disposal. On Palestinian Prisoners' Day, this must be brought to the world's attention before resorting to the humanitarian paradigm which exploits and insults the prisoners by prioritising the pandemic above their political freedom, their rights and the liberation of their land. READ: Israel holds 200 child prisoners with minimum healthcare provision If humanitarian principles were truly humanitarian, the anti-colonial struggle would form part of the international narrative. Palestinian prisoners have been defined by events and occasions rather than political principles and the Palestinian cause, perhaps to appease the international community's penchant of calling for human rights based upon humanitarian agendas. Hence, the heavily-publicised hunger strikes, for example, or a possible outbreak of coronavirus among Palestinian prisoners, which would indeed be catastrophic. However, these are simply part of the wider narrative of the freedom struggle, and emphasising temporary conditions rather than the root cause of the issue is damaging for both Palestinian prisoners and the anti-colonial cause. Commemorative days are useless if remembrance is tethered to a single occasion without a plan for continuous action. When there is a context other than the prisoners' struggle for Palestinian liberation, in this case the pandemic, it is easy to reverse priorities in a way that the pandemic takes precedence over the prisoners and their rights. If Palestinians were supported by the international community in their anti-colonial struggle, as they should be, there would be a different discourse in terms of the coronavirus and the Palestinians. Moreover, when the pandemic is over, will the call for the liberation of Palestinian political prisoners be ongoing? Or will it dwindle away to nothing because activism, despite all good intentions, once again availed itself of the pandemic to highlight temporarily the routine violations and negligence by the Israeli Prison Service? READ: Israel tells Palestinian prisoners, 'Use your socks to make masks,' as neglect continues Palestinian Prisoners' Day ought to be commemorated as a pinnacle to highlight a consistent strategy for liberation. After all, Palestinian political prisoners have embraced anti-colonial struggle on a permanent basis. They must be released because their anti-colonialism is a legitimate cause and does not violate international law. To argue that Palestinian prisoners must be released due to humanitarian concerns during the coronavirus pandemic is flawed, when it is well known that humanitarian principles are subject to the political interpretations of the international community. On Palestinian Prisoners' Day 2020, therefore, let us politicise humanitarian principles from the perspective of the Palestinian people's collective memory and narratives, in order to create a consistent strategy that is not dependent upon external circumstances.

News article:
The practical meaning of this is cells built to house some eight prisoners hold twelve or more inmates, according to a prison condition report from May 2019 by the Ministry of Justice. Yet, despite overcrowding, Israel's Prison Authorities haven't registered any COVID-19 cases among Palestinian prisoners with the exception of one disputed incident revolving around the release of 18-year-old Nur A-ddin Maher who allegedly tested positive for the virus right after he was released from the Ofer prison located next to Jerusalem. Israel denied the allegations put forward by the Palestinian Authority suggesting he had contracted the virus in prison and demanded a medical examination be done on Maher. Demands that have so far gone unanswered. Answering an official request for a comment, the Prison Authority said that there haven't been any coronavirus cases in Israeli prisons because of the measures they introduced during the early stages of the outbreak. "We have cancelled family and lawyers' visits but it was done in order to protect prisoners from potentially getting the virus. As for allegations that sanitation standards are lacking, these claims are groundless". Apart from providing prisoners with masks and disinfecting equipment, the Prison Authorities say they make sure to clean and disinfect the prison cells and facilities. In an attempt to educate the masses about the dangers of COVID-19 and the way to contain the spread of the pandemic, they have also introduced a number of videos screened on a daily basis in Arabic to guide prisoners on the dos and don'ts during this time. For Francis, however, these regulations are certainly not enough. "[Following the case of Maher], prisoners asked to be checked but all Israel did was to measure their temperature. No blood samples were taken. More alarming though is the fact that prison guards, who check up on prisoners at least five times a day, fail to wear masks. There is no need for them to enter each cell physically, they can monitor their movement through cameras, without putting prisoners' lives at risk". Protecting Prisoners Israel's Responsibility To change this situation and improve the lives of Palestinian prisoners, Addameer, who joined forces with other human rights groups, appealed to official Israeli institutions as well as international bodies to "remind [Israel] of its obligations". "It is the direct responsibility of the occupying power to take care of the health and safety of its prisoners. It is irrelevant which offence they committed, Israel should take care of all of them. While other countries are releasing prisoners, Israel insists to keep the 180 teens - whose only crime was to throw rocks - behind bars. The same holds true for females, elderly, and sick prisoners", Francis complained. At the end of March, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged states to release prisoners in an attempt to reduce the overcrowding of prisons and block the potential spread of COVID-19.

In an attempt to educate the masses about the dangers of COVID-19 and the way to contain the spread of the pandemic, they have also introduced a number of videos screened on a daily basis in Arabic to guide prisoners on the dos and don'ts during this time. For Francis, however, these regulations are certainly not enough. "[Following the case of Maher], prisoners asked to be checked but all Israel did was to measure their temperature. No blood samples were taken. More alarming though is the fact that prison guards, who check up on prisoners at least five times a day, fail to wear masks. There is no need for them to enter each cell physically, they can monitor their movement through cameras, without putting prisoners' lives at risk". Protecting Prisoners Israel's Responsibility To change this situation and improve the lives of Palestinian prisoners, Addameer, who joined forces with other human rights groups, appealed to official Israeli institutions as well as international bodies to "remind [Israel] of its obligations". "It is the direct responsibility of the occupying power to take care of the health and safety of its prisoners. It is irrelevant which offence they committed, Israel should take care of all of them. While other countries are releasing prisoners, Israel insists to keep the 180 teens - whose only crime was to throw rocks - behind bars. The same holds true for females, elderly, and sick prisoners", Francis complained. At the end of March, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged states to release prisoners in an attempt to reduce the overcrowding of prisons and block the potential spread of COVID-19.

As people around the world mark Palestinian Prisoners' Day, author Ramzy Baroud has said it is not just those who are in Israeli prisoners who are detained, "all Palestinians are experiencing some sort of imprisonment". "All Palestinians in some way are prisoners. If you Palestinian living in the Gaza Strip, born under siege in the Gaza Strip in the last 14 years, and you have never left Gaza … you are a prisoner," Baroud explained. "And if you are a Palestinian living in 'Area C' [of the Occupied west Bank] … you cannot leave without Israeli permission, you cannot cross any military checkpoint, you are a prisoner." Solidarity in the age of coronavirus: What the Arabs must do "Those who are living behind checkpoints and behind the Apartheid Wall in the West Bank are prisoners. All Palestinians are experiencing some sort of imprisonment," Baroud added during a talk to mark the day and to discuss his latest book "These Chains Will Be Broken: Palestinian Stories of Struggle and Defiance in Israeli Prisons". "The 5,000 prisoners, or so, who are in Palestine at the moment, are actually a microcosm of the protracted imprisonment in Israel over the past 50 plus years." On April 17, Palestinians mark Prisoners' Day to remind the public of the plight of those thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli military jails.

In a letter to the Secretary-General of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)’s Executive Committee, Saeb Erekat, UN chief Antonio Guterres pointed out to ways of protecting Palestinian detainees, including reducing the number of prisoners in order to improve public health conditions, reducing overcrowding and maintaining restrictions on family visitation and healthcare visits. Guterres also said that he asked the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nikolay Mladenov, to remain in contact with Israeli officials to ensure the protection of the Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The UN Chief stressed the need to conduct more tests, and to isolate prisoners showing symptoms of the infection. Guterres’s letter came in response to a letter sent by Erekat on March 30, that urged world leaders to pressure Israel, the occupying power, to protect Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and to release those who are highly vulnerable to the novel virus, including old people, women, and prisoners with underlying conditions.

News article:
Hamas authorities have arrested seven Gaza residents for participating in a videoconference with peace campaigners in Israel. The arrests, which Hamas confirmed and defended as rooted in national security, have triggered a debate in Palestinian Authority and Gazan Arab society over free speech, and prompted multiple condemnations. Hamas, which runs Gaza, bans many forms of communications with Israel and what it calls the “normalization” of relations with the Jewish state. “We absolutely condemn arrests of individuals because of practicing their right to peaceful expression and assembly,” Saleh Hijazi, the Amnesty International human rights group’s deputy director for the Middle East, told the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper. Rami Aman, 36, the founder of the Gaza Youth Committee, and the six others were accused of treason after speaking on Zoom to the dozens of Israeli activists last week, the newspaper reported Tuesday. The participants discussed their daily lives and expressed hopes for better leadership for both Israelis and PA and Gazan Arabs. Hind Khoudary, a former Amnesty International activist, reportedly played a key role in having the seven arrested, according to Asharq al-Awsat. She criticized Aman on Facebook over what Khoudary called “normalization” with Israel and also tagged several Hamas officials in the online post, prompting them to monitor the call, according to Asharq al-Awsat.

News article:
Amid concerns over the conditions of hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons during the coronavirus outbreak, many international bodies ramped up pressure on Israel not to discriminate against thousands of vulnerable Palestinian prisoners facing high-risk exposure to the coronavirus. The International Committee of the Red Cross urged for those over 65 or with health conditions to be released. "Those measures are meant to reduce the number of detainees and to limit the potential exposure for the most vulnerable," said David Quesne, head of the ICRC's mission in Jerusalem. "We would like them released to the extent possible and if not then removed from the risk." A group of United Nations human rights experts on Friday called on Israel to release thousands of vulnerable Palestinian prisoners facing high-risk exposure to the coronavirus. Women, children, elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions are among the most vulnerable, according to experts. "There are currently more than 4,520 Palestinian prisoners, including 183 children, 43 women and 700 detainees with preexisting medical conditions in Israeli jails," they noted. "They remain dangerously vulnerable in the context of the current pandemic and the relative increase in the number of transmission rates in Israel," the U.N. experts said. They also expressed serious concerns over reports that Israeli authorities are impeding efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19 in east Jerusalem. So far Israel says no cases have been detected among inmates. But the Palestinians said one released prisoner was infected and the justice ministry has called for an investigation. In one reported incident, Israeli authorities recently raided a testing clinic in the densely populated Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan under the pretext that its testing kits were provided by the Palestinian Authority. Israel has also arrested doctors, they said. The experts said that over the past month, Israel had released hundreds of Israeli prisoners as a preventive and protective step. It had not, however, applied similar measures to Palestinian prisoners. Israel's perpetual violations of Palestinians' basic rights in its prisons, including torture, repression and assaults, have long been under the spotlight. Last month, Israel's detention authority decided to reduce rations of bread, water and meat for Palestinian prisoners, exposing once again the ongoing systematic violations of human rights in Israeli jails.

News article:
Amid concerns over the conditions of hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons during the coronavirus outbreak, many international bodies ramped up pressure on Israel not to discriminate against thousands of vulnerable Palestinian prisoners facing high-risk exposure to the coronavirus. The International Committee of the Red Cross urged for those over 65 or with health conditions to be released. "Those measures are meant to reduce the number of detainees and to limit the potential exposure for the most vulnerable," said David Quesne, head of the ICRC's mission in Jerusalem. "We would like them released to the extent possible and if not then removed from the risk." A group of United Nations human rights experts on Friday called on Israel to release thousands of vulnerable Palestinian prisoners facing high-risk exposure to the coronavirus. Women, children, elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions are among the most vulnerable, according to experts. "There are currently more than 4,520 Palestinian prisoners, including 183 children, 43 women and 700 detainees with preexisting medical conditions in Israeli jails," they noted. "They remain dangerously vulnerable in the context of the current pandemic and the relative increase in the number of transmission rates in Israel," the U.N. experts said. They also expressed serious concerns over reports that Israeli authorities are impeding efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19 in east Jerusalem. So far Israel says no cases have been detected among inmates. But the Palestinians said one released prisoner was infected and the justice ministry has called for an investigation. In one reported incident, Israeli authorities recently raided a testing clinic in the densely populated Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan under the pretext that its testing kits were provided by the Palestinian Authority. Israel has also arrested doctors, they said. The experts said that over the past month, Israel had released hundreds of Israeli prisoners as a preventive and protective step. It had not, however, applied similar measures to Palestinian prisoners. Israel's perpetual violations of Palestinians' basic rights in its prisons, including torture, repression and assaults, have long been under the spotlight. Last month, Israel's detention authority decided to reduce rations of bread, water and meat for Palestinian prisoners, exposing once again the ongoing systematic violations of human rights in Israeli jails.

News article:
Ramallah - Asharq Al-Awsat The Palestinian Authority (PA) demanded Israel to immediately release detainee, Mohammad Majed Hassan, who had contracted the COVID-19 during his arrest. Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) Executive Committee, Saeb Erekat urged Hassan’s immediate release, saying his continued detention is a blatant violation of Israel's “obligations under international humanitarian law.” "We hold Israel fully responsible for his life and demand his immediate release,” he said, calling on international community and the UN Secretary-General to pressure Israel to free him so that he can receive the proper medical treatment. Israeli forces arrested Hassan from his home in Deir al-Sudan, north of Ramallah, on Wednesday. Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said the detainee is a student at Birzeit University and he is being held in the Maskubiyya detention center in Jerusalem. Hassan’s medical tests showed that he is infected with the coronavirus, while tests on his family members all came back negative, according to the minister. Israel confirmed that Hassan was tested at the moment of his arrest, and the results came back positive even though he did not show any symptoms. Majed Hassan, the detainee’s father, urged the concerned authorities to release his son. Majed is a former detainee and spent over 10 years in Israeli prisons. Mohammed’s sister, Shatha, who is also a student at Birzeit University, was arrested by Israeli forces in December. Hamas held Israel fully responsible for Mohammed’s life. Hamas leader Fathi al-Qarawi said that the prisoner’s arbitrary arrest, followed by his infection with the coronavirus, reflects the reality of the Palestinian people who are subject to crimes daily. The issue must be brought up before all relevant authorities, especially the international community, he demanded.

Palestinian activist Rami Aman, who participated in a two-hour video conference with Israelis earlier this month, has been arrested by Gaza police for attempting “normalizing relations with Israel” and for interrogation with regard to possible Israeli funding, according to Gaza-based journalist Alaa al-Asi. In a video uploaded to Facebook by Hamas’s Shehab News Agency on April 18, al-Asi said that all joint activities, cooperation or dialogue with any Israelis, including peace activists, must be viewed as collaboration with the enemy. Aman’s two-hour online meeting with Israelis, said al-Asi, “angered the Palestinians, especially in Gaza.” The next day, she added, “police in Gaza arrested Rami Aman for interrogation on cases of receiving external funding from Israel and other issues, including normalization with Israel.” Any dialogue with Israelis outside of the framework of the Palestinian “resistance,” even with Israeli peace activists, is unacceptable to “anti-normalizers,” she said. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “Dialogue—if it occurs outside the resistance framework—becomes dialogue for the sake of dialogue, which is a form of normalization, that hinders the struggle to end injustice.

Head of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee, Qadri Abu Baker, said on Thursday, on the eve of International Workers Day, that majority of Palestinian prisoners, inside Israeli jails and detention centers, belong to the labor sector and that their lives have been spent in jail. In his remarks, Abu Baker added that the Israeli occupation authorities have been abducting Palestinians since 1967, the year Israel occupied the Arab Palestinian East Jerusalem, along with the remainder of the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. On the eve of International Workers Day, Abu Baker maintained that Palestinian laborers have always been a symbol for the Palestinian resistance against the Israeli occupation, as they have been wounded, imprisoned or killed, by the thousands, in the struggle for freedom. For his part, director of the Palestinian Center for Prisoners’ Studies, Dr. Rafat Hamdouna, said that back in the 1970s, Israeli authorities exploited hundreds of Palestinian laborer prisoners, in works that benefited the occupation state of Israel. For the time being, Hamdouna said that Israeli prison authorities have intentionally given no chance for Palestinian prisoners to make their own foods or manage their own purchases from the prison cafeterias. He demanded all relevant international organizations to give some more attention to the suffering of Palestinian prisoners and even work on their release, as soon as possible. Israel holds around 5,000 Palestinian prisoners including women and children under the age of 18. Hundreds of those prisoners are reported to have been suffering from chronic diseases and are in need of special medical care. Image: Addameer

It said that among those who were detained by the Israeli authorities is Bilal al-Natsheh, secretary-general of the Popular Conference in Jerusalem, who was moved to an Israeli hospital right after he was arrested. "He and the other detainees were interrogated at an Israeli detention center in occupied East Jerusalem." Ashrawi warned that "the Israeli practices in Jerusalem are a real danger that threatens the life of the Palestinians in East Jerusalem and its suburbs." She called on the international community "to intervene and stop these practices." Enditem

News article:
Senior officials in the European Union and United Nations on Thursday warned Israel not to annex parts of the West Bank, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz signed a coalition agreement saying the move could potentially go ahead as early as July. The European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, issued a stark warning against the intention to annex parts of the West Bank, saying that such a move “would constitute a serious violation of international law.” Borrell said the 27-member bloc does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the territory and that it will “continue to closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and will act accordingly.” The Foreign Ministry slammed Borrell over his statement. “It’s unfortunate that Josep Borrell, who pretends to be responsible for the foreign relations of the European Union, chooses in this manner to welcome a new government of a central partner to the EU and prefers to see relations between Israel and the EU through the prism of the pandemic and the ‘status of the territories,’” the ministry said in a statement. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The ministry questioned Borrell’s decision to issue the statement, saying he did so only after failing to gain backing for it from all EU states. “We wonder which states the honorable gentleman is choosing to represent,” the ministry said. Foreign Minister Israel Katz thanked EU states that refused to back Borrell’s statement, but didn’t name them. Advertisement “I thank our friends in Europe who oppose Borrell’s announcement and prevented the adoption of the text in the EU’s name. These states recognize the value of relations with Israel and we’ll continue to advance relations between Israel and Europe together with them,” he said. However, a diplomatic source told The Times of Israel that the EU did not hold a vote on approving the text and the meeting dealt more with timing than substance. Meanwhile, in a video briefing with the Security Council, which holds a meeting each month on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the UN Middle East peace envoy, Nikolay Mladenov, said an Israeli annexation would deal a “devastating blow” to the internationally backed two-state solution. While hailing what he called “inspiring examples of cooperation across conflict lines” in the coronavirus battle, Mladenov warned that in the past month there has also been “continued confrontation and fighting, as the human toll of war continues to rise.” “The dangerous prospect of annexation by Israel of parts of the occupied West Bank is a growing threat,” Mladenov said, arguing that such a move would violate international law. The envoy said annexation would also “close the door to a renewal of negotiations and threaten efforts to advance regional peace.” Advertisement Mladenov called on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to “seize this moment to take steps towards peace” and “reject unilateral moves that will only deepen the wedge between the two peoples and undermine the chances for peace.” A peace plan unveiled earlier this year by US President Donald Trump — which angered the Palestinians and was rejected by much of the international community — gave Israel the green light to annex settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley area. Netanyahu and Gantz struck a power-sharing deal to form a national emergency government this week, after three inconclusive elections in less than a year. Netanyahu has heralded the Trump plan as a historic opportunity for Israel but Gantz has been more cautious, offering mixed signals about annexation. Netanyahu’s right-wing base is eager to move forward with annexation while the friendly Trump administration is in office. Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six Day War. The Palestinians seek those territories as part of a future independent state. Annexation of West Bank settlements would infuriate the Palestinians and Israel’s Arab neighbors. The Netanyahu-Gantz deal stipulates that any Israeli action would need US backing, and must take into account Israel’s peace treaties with neighboring Jordan and Egypt.

The European Union and several European states, including Germany, France and the United Kingdom, reiterated their opposition to the Israeli government's aspiration to annex parts of the West Bank in light of the coalition deal between Benjamin Netanyahu and Gantz. Corona keeps Bibi in power and unmasks the Mossad Credit: Haaretz "The European Union’s position on the status of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 remains unchanged," wrote foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Thursday, ahead of a meeting at the United Nations Security Counil. "The European Union does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank," Borrell stressed. He said that the European Union would view any annexation as a serious violation of international law and "will continue to closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and will act accordingly. Israel regretted Borrell's statement and said it is unrepresentative of the position of member states. "Considering the depth of our relations, and in light of the fact that, once again, a similar proposed statement did not receive the support of the EU member states only yesterday, we wonder what policy the distinguished gentleman is vying to represent," an official statement read. Israeli Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz thanked "our friends in Europe who opposed Mr. Borrell’s announcement." At the UN Security Council, the organization's Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said "Annexation of parts of the West Bank would constitute a serious violation of international law, deal a devastating blow to the two-state solution, close the door to a renewal of negotiations, and threaten efforts to advance regional peace." French Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière went further and said annexation "would not pass unchallenged and shall not be overlooked in our relationship with Israel." The United Kingdom mission said it is concerned that the Netanyahu-Gantz coalition deal will pave the way for annexation and stressed that the action would violate international law and jeopardize the peace process. The German mission said it "advises against the annexation of occupied Palestinian territories" as this would have negative repercussions on the viability of the two-state solution and Israel's standing in the international community. Palestinian Ambassador Mansour Riyad said the pandemic has brought into light Israel's crimes and that Israeli forces are blocking the Palestinian Authority's attempts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. He said that if Israel chooses annexation, it should not be surprised by the resulting chain of events. "How dare the Palestinian representative slander Israel's efforts and lie about IDF soldiers and blame them for spreading the virus, " replied Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon, calling Mansour's statements anti-Semitic. A statement was also made by Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney, who wished the Israeli coalition process well but said annexation is prohibited under international law "whenever and wherever it occurs, in Europe’s neighbourhood or globally. This is a fundamental principle in the relations of states and the rule of law in the modern world. No one state can set it aside at will." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former political rival Benny Gantz signed a coalition deal agreement Monday to co-lead an "emergency government", based on power share and rotation of the premiership. The two sides eventually agreed on annexation of parts of the West Bank, although it is not clear which. According to the political deal, Netanyahu can advance legislation to annex parts of the West Bank starting July 1, on the condition that the move is supported by the U.S. administration. On Wednesday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that annexing parts of the West Bank is "ultimately Israel's decision to make." In the first comment by a Trump administration official regarding the expected formation of a new government in Israel, Pompeo said the U.S. welcomed that development and is looking forward to continued cooperation with Israel. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas commented Wednesday that “No one should delude themselves that they can take advantage of the fact that the world is busy with the coronavirus crisis to violate our rights. We will not allow anyone to violate our rights."

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc would “continue to closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and will act accordingly”.

AP Mr Netanyahu’s pro-settler base is eager to move forward with annexation while the friendly administration of US President Donald Trump is in office.

News article:
Eleven European ambassadors to Israel on Thursday warned Jerusalem of severe consequences if it moves ahead with plans to annex parts of the West Bank as part of a government coalition deal. The envoys from the UK, Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and the EU issued a formal objection to the Foreign Ministry against the move, Channel 13 reported. The ambassadors made the protest during a video conference with the Foreign Ministry’s Europe deputy, Anna Azari. “We are very concerned about the clause in the coalition agreement that paves the way for annexing parts of the West Bank. The annexation of any part of the West Bank constitutes a clear violation of international law,” the ambassadors said. “Such unilateral steps will harm efforts to renew the peace process and will have grave consequences for regional stability and for Israel’s standing in the international arena.” The envoys also demanded a freeze on government plans to allow construction in the Givat Hamatos neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Also on Thursday, the Arab League said that the planned annexation constituted a “new war crime” against the Palestinians during a virtual conference chaired in Cairo. “The implementation of plans to annex any part of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan Valley… and the lands on which Israeli settlements are standing represents a new war crime… against the Palestinian people,” Arab foreign ministers said in a joint statement. The Arab League also urged the United States to “withdraw its support in enabling the plans of the occupying Israeli government.” Advertisement On Monday, the United States said it was ready to recognize Israel’s annexation of key parts of the West Bank, but said the offer was contingent on an offer of statehood to the Palestinians. “As we have made consistently clear, we are prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty and the application of Israeli law to areas of the West Bank that the vision foresees as being part of the State of Israel,” a US State Department spokesperson said when asked if the US would allow Israel’s new government to move forward with the process. “The annexation would be in the context of an offer to the Palestinians to achieve statehood based upon specific terms, conditions, territorial dimensions and generous economic support. This is an unprecedented and highly beneficial opportunity for the Palestinians,” the State Department spokesperson said. The Palestinians have refused to negotiate with the Trump administration, considering it biased. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas threatened last week to cancel all agreements with Israel and the US if Israel moved forward with annexation plans. US President Donald Trump in January unveiled a peace plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Rejected by the Palestinians and condemned by much of the international community, the plan gives Israel the green-light to annex Jewish settlements and other strategic territory in the West Bank. Advertisement An Israeli coalition government agreement reached last week includes a framework for implementing the annexations outlined in the plan, starting in July. Under the US proposal, the Palestinians would be granted a sovereign but demilitarized state in the remaining parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, along with promises of major investment. The Palestinian state’s capital would be on the outskirts of Jerusalem, which would remain fully under Israeli sovereignty. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that he was “confident” Trump would let him fulfill his election promise to apply Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank “a couple of months from now.” According to the wording of the “emergency government” deal between Netanyahu’s Likud party and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White faction, starting July 1, 2020, Netanyahu “will be able to bring the agreement reached with the US on the application of sovereignty [in the West Bank] for the approval of the cabinet and or the Knesset.” In addition, “the law will be passed as quickly as possible… and will not be disrupted or delayed by the chairmen of either the House or the Foreign Affairs and Defense committees.” The Netanyahu-Gantz deal stipulates that any Israeli action would need US backing, and must take into account Israel’s peace treaties with neighboring Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab states that have formal peace treaties and diplomatic relations with Israel. Netanyahu’s right-wing base is eager to move forward with annexation while the friendly Trump administration is in office. Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six Day War. The Palestinians seek those territories as part of a future independent state. Annexation of West Bank settlements would infuriate the Palestinians and Israel’s Arab neighbors.

European ambassadors warn Israel against annexing West Bank Iran Press TV Friday, 01 May 2020 3:26 PM The ambassadors of 11 European countries have warned the Israeli regime that its planned annexation of the occupied West Bank is a "clear violation of international law" that would have "grave consequences" for the regime. Envoys from the UK, Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, and Finland as well as, notably, the European Union (EU) presented their formal objection to the plan on Thursday, a Channel 13 report said, according to the Times of Israel. The protest by the European envoys came during a video conference with the Israeli foreign ministry's deputy for Europe Anna Azari. "We are very concerned about the clause in the coalition agreement that paves the way for annexing parts of the West Bank. The annexation of any part of the West Bank constitutes a clear violation of international law," the ambassadors said. Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to start plans for annexing parts of the occupied West Bank on July 1 as part of a deal setting up a future coalition cabinet. Until then, elections after elections had left the respective parties of both Netanyahu and Gantz short of a solid parliamentary majority to choose a new prime minister, and no coalition talks had also failed. "Such unilateral steps will harm efforts to renew the peace process and will have grave consequences for regional stability and for Israel's standing in the international arena," the European diplomats said. Many world leaders, governments, and international organizations have warned Israel against the measure. Israel was encouraged to annex settlements and other strategic territory in the occupied West Bank by United States President Donald Trump under a plan that he unveiled in January. The initiative also designated Jerusalem al-Quds as "Israel's undivided capital," among other privileges granted to Israel. While the plan was supposed to be a deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians, no Palestinian official had been involved in preparing it, and all Palestinian factions rejected the plan soon after it was announced.

EU’s mood changing as Israel threatens annexation Chris Doyle Short Url https://arab.news/zhqau The Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, in the occupied West Bank, February 15, 2017. (Reuters) During the 53 years of Israel’s occupation, complete with systematic violations of international law and contempt for UN Security Council resolutions, at no point has the EU or any other major Western power seriously considered sanctions. European politicians have baulked at the idea. It was an unthinkable option, not least owing to European guilt over the Holocaust and other past anti-Semitic atrocities. German leaders, in particular, backed off any such discussions for obvious reasons. But is this wall beginning to crumble due to the threat of imminent Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank? Are we starting to see the very first chinks in the resolute international refusal to hold Israel to account for its crimes? Remember the new Israeli coalition agreement permits Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring annexation to a vote at Cabinet or in the Knesset from July 1. When Netanyahu and his government first started to publicly push an agenda of annexation, the language from most European states was that such a move could not go “unchallenged.” No leader was prepared to spell out what this might mean, instead leaving it hanging out there as a vague threat. Israeli annexationists count on European inaction and cowardice. They have much to back up this expectation. Israel demolishes EU-funded projects in the West Bank to the sound of press releases expressing concern or — drum roll — grave concern. Perhaps frustration might even be mentioned. The EU routinely declares settlements to be illegal and a threat to peace, but still allows settlement trade. Added to that is the belief of many on the Israeli right that the coronavirus crisis will distract European leaders from taking any meaningful action. Yes, the EU is a dog that barks but does not bite. But perhaps some small teeth may be about to break through. Is this a watershed moment? Eleven EU ambassadors, perhaps surprisingly led by the UK, made a formal protest to Israel last week. According to a leak to the Israeli press, the delegation made clear that “annexation of parts of the West Bank would destabilize the region and harm Israel’s standing in the international community.” The states involved alongside the UK were Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Clearly, this represents the majority of Western Europe, hinting at the very different views among Eastern European states, most notably Hungary. The inclusion of the UK, France and Germany should trouble Israel’s leaders. The mood in Brussels is changing. The precedent of allowing Israel to seize occupied territory by force is alarming to those who believe in the international rules-based order. The EU moved very swiftly to impose sanctions on Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. It would be acutely vulnerable to the accusation of double standards if it just let Israel do the same. Why should Israel be let off when Russia was punished? Such a telling point was made in a letter signed by more than 130 British politicians from all parties to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday. Never before have so many UK parliamentarians so willingly backed the option of sanctions on Israel in the event of annexation. It included former Cabinet ministers, the acting co-leader of the Liberal Democrats, and a former European Commissioner. It is no longer a fringe position. The organization of the letter in just a few days told of how willing politicians were to sign up with little to no persuasion. Will Israel start getting worried about the EU? Probably not, given the continued US support. Netanyahu deliberately inserted annexation into the coalition agreement. In the past, he did not go down the annexation path, but his determination has been reinforced by the opportunity of Donald Trump’s presidency. Israel may never again have such a compliant White House. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was last month clear that annexation was ultimately Israel’s decision to make. The White House subsequently made it clear that this should happen in the context of a Palestinian state, as outlined in the Trump peace plan. This may delay the issue, but ultimately Netanyahu will not object too much, given he has accepted the plan and as long as the Palestinian state is as powerless and lacking in sovereignty as the Trump plan makes out. Israel would retain overall control of security and the borders. Israeli annexationists count on European inaction and cowardice. They have much to back up this expectation. Chris Doyle The EU will probably not have the consensus necessary for sanctions, and neither will the UK. But, given the anger and the changing mood, a European response may be more than words for once. Options could include complete non-recognition of the annexation, including for the purposes of trade with the annexed areas. This is a minimum and will hardly put Israel off. The EU could ban all products and services from settlement areas with the option of toughening measures if Israel does not reverse its position. This should have happened decades ago and might create a few nervous twitches among Israeli officials. A more effective measure would be to suspend the EU-Israel free trade agreement, ending all preferential access to the bloc for Israeli products. This would not be a sanction but would have an impact on trade. Some states may opt for the recognition of a Palestinian state. This would have symbolic value but should happen regardless of Israel’s illegal behavior. Netanyahu will not be put off by that. The tools to pressure Israel short of full sanctions are there. It is, as ever, a question of political will. A failure to challenge Israel will not go unnoticed across the world, not least among those states with outstanding territorial ambitions.

News article:
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France is urging its European Union partners to consider threatening Israel with a tough response if it goes ahead with a de facto annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank, three EU diplomats said. Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg also want to discuss the possibility of punitive economic measures during a foreign ministers’ meeting on Friday, the diplomats told Reuters, though all member states would have to agree to any collective action. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said cabinet discussions will start in July over extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, as was mooted under U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan. Palestinians have expressed outrage at Israel’s plans to cement its hold further on land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, territory they are seeking for a state. The EU diplomats did not give details on what punitive measures EU member states might consider to try to dissuade Israel from making the move. In terms of procedure, EU governments would need to ask the Commission and the EU foreign policy division, the EEAS, to draw up a list of options. All 27 EU nations would need to agree to any EU response and Israel’s closest allies such as Hungary and the Czech Republic could still block even preparatory work. An EU spokesman on Monday declined to comment on internal discussions but said: “annexation is contrary to international law and if annexation goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly”. TRADE, RESEARCH AT RISK Israel has long been a part of the EU’s research and innovation programme Horizon 2020, which was worth nearly 80 billion euros between 2014 and 2020, according to the European Commission. The EU is also Israel’s top trading partner and Israel benefits from trade preferences with the world’s largest trading bloc. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in February Trump’s plan departed from “internationally agreed parameters”. Borrell said that steps to annex Palestinian territory, “if implemented, could not pass unchallenged.” That is a view taken by France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, according to EU diplomats. “There is clearly a need to look at what annexation means in the context of international law and we do need to know our options,” said one senior EU diplomat involved in discussions. “We also need to say what exactly the consequences of annexation would be, ideally as a way to stop any such move,” the diplomat said. The Palestinians and many countries regard the West Bank settlements as illegal under the Geneva Conventions that bar settling on land captured in war. Israel disputes this, citing security needs and biblical, historical and political connections to the land.

Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg also want to discuss the possibility of punitive economic measures during a foreign ministers’ meeting on Friday, the diplomats told Reuters, though all member states would have to agree to any collective action. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said cabinet discussions will start in July over extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, as was mooted under U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan. Palestinians have expressed outrage at Israel’s plans to cement its hold further on land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, territory they are seeking for a state. The EU diplomats did not give details on what punitive measures EU member states might consider to try to dissuade Israel from making the move. In terms of procedure, EU governments would need to ask the Commission and the EU foreign policy division, the EEAS, to draw up a list of options. All 27 EU nations would need to agree to any EU response and Israel’s closest allies such as Hungary and the Czech Republic could still block even preparatory work. An EU spokesman on Monday declined to comment on internal discussions but said: “annexation is contrary to international law and if annexation goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly”. TRADE, RESEARCH AT RISK Israel has long been a part of the EU’s research and innovation programme Horizon 2020, which was worth nearly 80 billion euros between 2014 and 2020, according to the European Commission. The EU is also Israel’s top trading partner and Israel benefits from trade preferences with the world’s largest trading bloc. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in February Trump’s plan departed from “internationally agreed parameters”. Borrell said that steps to annex Palestinian territory, “if implemented, could not pass unchallenged.” That is a view taken by France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, according to EU diplomats. “There is clearly a need to look at what annexation means in the context of international law and we do need to know our options,” said one senior EU diplomat involved in discussions. “We also need to say what exactly the consequences of annexation would be, ideally as a way to stop any such move,” the diplomat said. The Palestinians and many countries regard the West Bank settlements as illegal under the Geneva Conventions that bar settling on land captured in war. Israel disputes this, citing security needs and biblical, historical and political connections to the land.

News article:
The European Union’s Foreign Affairs Commission is reportedly debating punitive measures against Israel should it push forward with its plans to annex parts of Judea and Samaria and the Jordan Valley in accordance with the Trump administration’s Middle East peace plan. Sources familiar with the initiative told Israel Hayom that European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is the one pushing for sanctions. Borrell, a Spanish diplomat, is known for his animosity toward Israel. This attitude is currently offset by the positive sentiment expressed towards Israel by Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen, a German diplomat and the sitting president of the European Commission. The European Union’s charter states that all major foreign policy decisions can be made only by a consensus among the bloc’s 27 member states. It is therefore believed that Israel’s allies in the European Union—Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic—will block any major punitive action Borrell may try to promote. Currently, Sweden, Ireland and Luxembourg are pushing for the harshest response, namely suspending the E.U.-Israel Association Agreement, which regulates relations between the two. Another potential measure being considered is the exclusion of Israel from Horizon Europe, an ambitious E.U. research and innovation framework slated to run between 2021 and 2027. The program “aims to strengthen the E.U.’s scientific and technological bases, boost Europe’s innovation capacity, competitiveness and jobs and to deliver on citizens’ priorities and sustain socio-economic model and values,” according to its website. A third scenario may see the European Union pull out of the open skies agreement with Israel, which it has yet to ratify. Each of these scenarios entail a significant economic impact on Israel. The E.U.’s foreign ministers are expected to debate the issue in their next meeting, scheduled for Thursday, though it is unlikely a decision will be made at that time, as the session will convene a mere day after the new Israeli government is to be sworn in. Over the weekend, a Palestinian NGO called on Borrell to impose sanctions on Israel over its plans to annex the large settlement blocs in Judea and Samaria, calling the move illegal, the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. In a letter to Borrell, the European Coordination of Committees and Associations for Palestine expressed “concerns” over Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the West Bank that P.A. seeks to maintain as part of a future state, calling the move “part of the ongoing ethnic cleansing, apartheid and colonization” pursued by Israel. The ECCP’s letter said that to confront “Israel’s unilateral land grab and annexation, immediate actions must to be taken, including sanctions and … [other] concrete measures.” Meanwhile, the Israeli Foreign Ministry summoned E.U. Ambassador to Israel Emanuele Giaufret last week for clarifications following the publication of a memo suggesting that groups supporting, identifying or affiliated with terrorist organizations could receive European Union funding. “The Union’s policy on financing terrorist organizations is a letter of endorsement for incitement, support and involvement in terrorism,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The E.U. Mission in Israel said in response that “the E.U. opposes any incitement to violence or hatred. The allegations that the E.U. supports terrorism are unfounded and unacceptable, and we strongly oppose any such statement.” This article first appeared in Israel Hayom.

A Palestinian flag is seen near the Israeli separation wall in the occupied West Bank. (Reuters) Ramallah - Kifah Zboun European Union foreign ministers are considering the possibility of imposing sanctions against Israel if it goes ahead with its plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian leadership will hold a meeting this week to draft a comprehensive strategy to respond to Israeli annexation plans. On Sunday, sources familiar with the European initiative told Israel Hayom that EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is known for his “animosity” toward Israel, is pushing for sanctions. Another well-informed European source told the Palestinian news agency, WAFA, that there has been growing momentum within the EU aimed at finding ways to confront the annexation plan, which, if implemented, would dash hopes for the implementation of the two-state solution. The source pointed out that any resolution taken within the Union must be approved by the 27 members, despite predictions that some countries will veto such a resolution due to their relations with Israel. "In order to avoid the veto," said the source, "the bloc will resort to other steps, such as freezing the Horizon Europe 2021-2027 program, through which Israeli think-tanks receive billions of dollars.” It is also considering the possibility of suspending the EU–Israel Association Agreement, which gives Tel Aviv the freedom of access to European markets. Non-renewal of the agreement means depriving Israel of significant economic advantages, WAFA reported. The source added that the EU will aim at pressuring Israel through diplomatic and political channels to prevent it from taking any unilateral steps. Meanwhile, Saeb Erekat, Secretary-General of the PLO Executive Committee, said the Palestinian leadership will hold a meeting, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, on Thursday to draft a full strategy to retaliate to annexation plans. Speaking to the official Voice of Palestine radio, he held the American administration fully responsible for any steps taken by Israel in this regard. He also slammed US ambassador to Israel David Friedman, for saying that the establishment of a Palestinian state will only take place "when the Palestinians become Canadians." He denounced the remarks as unprecedented insolence from a man promoting violence, murder and Israeli settlements.

Israeli plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank has drawn increasing international criticism, as many European countries consider punitive economic sanctions against Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Cabinet discussions will start in July about extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank. A Middle East peace plan announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in January gave U.S. recognition of the settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley while envisaging a demilitarized Palestinian state. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said it is up to Israel whether to annex parts of the West Bank, but Palestinians have expressed outrage at Israel's plans to further cement its hold on land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, territory they are seeking for a state. Like Turkey and much of the international community, the EU does not recognize Israel's sovereignty over the occupied territories. Since 1967, more than 700,000 Israelis have moved into settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Most of the international community considers Israel’s West Bank settlements illegal according to international law and an obstacle to a two-state solution to the conflict. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem as part of an independent state. The annexation of West Bank settlements would infuriate the Palestinians and Israel’s Arab neighbors, and likely eliminate any lingering hopes of establishing a viable new state. The EU diplomats did not give details on what punitive measures its member states might consider to try to dissuade Israel from making the move. In terms of procedure, EU governments would need to ask the Commission and the EU foreign policy division, the European Union External Action (EEAS), to draw up a list of options. All 27 nations would need to agree to any EU response and Israel's closest allies, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, could still block even preparatory work. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, last month said annexation would be a “serious violation” of international law and the EU will “act accordingly.” Last week, 11 European ambassadors reportedly registered a diplomatic protest over the annexation plan. Britain would not support Israel's annexation of parts of the West Bank as it would make a two-state solution with the Palestinians more difficult to achieve, junior Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said on Monday. Cleverly told parliament: "Our long-standing position is that we do not support the annexation of parts of the West Bank, and ... doing so could make a sustainable two-state solution harder."

Like Turkey and much of the international community, the EU does not recognize Israel's sovereignty over the occupied territories. Since 1967, more than 700,000 Israelis have moved into settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Most of the international community considers Israel’s West Bank settlements illegal according to international law and an obstacle to a two-state solution to the conflict. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem as part of an independent state. The annexation of West Bank settlements would infuriate the Palestinians and Israel’s Arab neighbors, and likely eliminate any lingering hopes of establishing a viable new state. The EU diplomats did not give details on what punitive measures its member states might consider to try to dissuade Israel from making the move. In terms of procedure, EU governments would need to ask the Commission and the EU foreign policy division, the European Union External Action (EEAS), to draw up a list of options. All 27 nations would need to agree to any EU response and Israel's closest allies, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, could still block even preparatory work. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, last month said annexation would be a “serious violation” of international law and the EU will “act accordingly.” Last week, 11 European ambassadors reportedly registered a diplomatic protest over the annexation plan. Britain would not support Israel's annexation of parts of the West Bank as it would make a two-state solution with the Palestinians more difficult to achieve, junior Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said on Monday. Cleverly told parliament: "Our long-standing position is that we do not support the annexation of parts of the West Bank, and ... doing so could make a sustainable two-state solution harder."

European Union foreign ministers say they will meet in Brussels Friday, a day after the swearing in of Israel’s new government, to consider punitive responses to Israel’s plans to extend its civil law to an unspecified portion of the West Bank. Several European nations led by France, and including Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, have reportedly expressed support for such threats of punitive action in a bid to deter the new Israeli government from carrying out the move. The EU bloc is Israel’s largest trading partner, grants Israel favored trading status, and helps fund Israeli scientific research and development through its massive Horizon 2020 program. According to the Haaretz daily, the proposed steps include announcing that Israel would be prevented from entering into trade agreements with the bloc, receiving EU grants or participating in other forms of cooperation with the union. It is not clear if the steps would apply to future agreement or freeze existing ones.

Foreign ministers representing member states of the EU on Friday will debate potential responses to Israel’s decision to annex parts of Judea and Samaria if that clause in the Likud-Kahol Lavan coalition agreement is implemented. Despite the fact that the newly appointed EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, wants to wait and see what the new Israeli government will do, some of the member countries are exerting pressure to approve sanctions in advance as a means of deterrence. This can include denying Israel membership in trade agreements, grants or other collaborative ventures in various industries. Sources close to the discussions told Haaretz that there is growing support among EU countries to slap sanctions that are meant to deter Israel from asserting sovereignty over any territory. Spain, France, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg are all reportedly to be calling for sanctions even before a final decision is made. The sources also said that when it comes to trade agreements, a unanimous agreement is not required by all the member states. This means that Israel won’t be able to rely on the veto of Israel’s EU allies like Hungary and the Czech Republic to rescue them from these types of decisions. Additionally, member states can enact their own independent protests against Israel. “No one wants to reach a stage were EU-Israel ties are damaged for the long term, but they will be in the event of a unilateral annexation. If only because of the precedent it would set anywhere else,” a source told Haaretz. This translates into the EU enforcing a “carrot and stick” approach whereby the option of opening a dialogue between the new EU leadership and the new Israeli government will be a first resort but at the same time, relaying messages of economic threats in the event of an Israeli decision on unilateral annexation. While speaking to journalists in Brussels on Monday, Peter Stano, the spokesman for EU external affairs, was asked by a reporter if there will be “some kind of sanctions” imposed on Israel as a response to annexation. Stano offered a rather vague response saying that the foreign ministers will discuss the situation in the Middle East on Friday during the meeting of the EU Council. He added that imposing sanctions “is up to the member states; at this stage, let’s not speculate.”

Though Gantz is believed to oppose unilateral action, he acquiesced to Netanyahu’s demand to allow the matter to be brought to a vote in parliament. “There is clearly a need to look at what annexation means in the context of international law and we do need to know our options,” a senior EU diplomat told Reuters. Advertisement “We also need to say what exactly the consequences of annexation would be, ideally as a way to stop any such move,” the diplomat said. On Monday, European External Action Service spokesman Peter Stano said any EU decision on future sanctions would depend on the results of Friday’s deliberations. “Annexation is contrary to international law and if annexation goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly,” he said, according to Reuters. And in February, foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said annexation “could not pass unchallenged.” The foreign ministers are unlikely to issue any decision on Friday. The Commission and the External Action Service, the EU’s executive and foreign service branches, have yet to propose specific options for member states to consider. Also key to the discussions will be finding potential punitive measures that would not require the unanimous agreement of all 27 bloc members, as Israel’s allies, including Hungary and the Czech Republic, would likely veto any proposals that require unanimity. Advertisement “No one wants to reach the point that Israel’s relations with the union are harmed for the long term, but that’s what will happen if Israel annexes, if only because of the precedent an annexation would set for every other place” where nations are fighting over disputed land, an EU source was quoted by Haaretz as saying. Annexation of settlements and the Jordan Valley has been a key campaign promise of Netanyahu and his Likud party in recent elections. A plurality of slightly fewer than half of Israelis back the idea, and fewer than a third think the government will actually go through with it, according to a survey of Israelis released Sunday. Asked whether they back annexation in the near future, 44.7 percent of respondents to an Israel Democracy Institute survey said they support or strongly support the move. The poll found 31.8% oppose annexation, and 23.5% didn’t know or didn’t answer. A slight majority of Jews — 51.7% — support annexation, the poll found, while only 8.8% of Arab Israelis were in favor. Among Jews, 27.9% opposed annexation, and 20.4% didn’t know or didn’t answer. Among Arabs, 51.9% were opposed, and 39.4% didn’t know or didn’t answer. Support for annexation among Jews was unsurprisingly divided along partisan lines, with 71% of self-defined right-wing Jews backing it, 31% of centrists and only 8% of left-wingers. Overall, 31.8% of Israelis think the government will actually push ahead with annexation in the coming year.

News article:
Israel has been increasingly critical of the EU in recent days, as multiple European leaders are voicing their opposition to a possible Israeli annexation in the West Bank. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The Israeli response is in continuation to public statements made by Netanyahu and his top ministers over the last few years, in which they accused the EU of pursuing anti-Israeli policies, supporting boycotts, and funding organizations supporting Palestinian terrorism. 5 View gallery EU Ambassador to Israel Emanuele Giaufret and President Reuven Rivlin at the President’s Residence in Jerusalem ( Photo: EU Delegation to Israel ) Harsh and undiplomatic language was repeatedly used by Israeli officials against Brussels, and this negatively impacted Israeli perceptions of the EU. Israel is wrong in depicting the EU as hostile to Israel, and the new government would do well to shift direction. The EU is a strategic ally of Israel – in trade and economy, in diplomacy and security, in technology and tourism, in research and culture. Its criticism targets Israel’s policy on the Palestinians and is not inherently anti-Israel as some portray it. The EU opposes the settlements and Israel’s annexation intentions. It also encourages differentiation between the Palestinian territories and Israel, but by no means does it advocate a boycott of Israel. The growing divisions among EU member states in recent years have undermined European consensus on a variety of foreign policy issues, among them the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu’s European supporters, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban who has eroded democracy in his own country, are actively engaged in thwarting EU criticism of Israeli policy in the territories. 5 View gallery Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban in Jerusalem last year ( Photo: Ruters ) The EU Foreign Affairs Council has not adopted joint resolutions on Israel since mid-2016. Europe’s focus on more urgent challenges, such as refugees, Brexit and now the coronavirus – is also a contributing factor in this regard. However, Europe is unwilling to ignore Netanyahu’s annexation intentions. The heads of the EU and key member states are finding ways to circumvent internal divisions in order to convey protests, opposition and warnings to Israel: Outspoken remarks by the EU new foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, joint declarations by European members of the UN Security Council, coordinated protests delivered to the Israeli Foreign Ministry by European ambassadors representing states with similar policy views, and cooperation with other international bodies, such as the Arab League, which also oppose annexation. 5 View gallery ( Photo: Reuters ) EU representatives have made use of all these tools in recent weeks. They have expressed unequivocal opposition to annexation, stressed that it would violate international law, recommended that Israel avoid doing so, and some even warned of legal consequences and deterioration of their relations with Israel. Countries like France, Belgium and Luxembourg have been working to place the issue on the agenda of the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council, calling on the EU to spell out punitive measures against Israeli annexation. Nevertheless, also due to internal divisions, Europe seems to be waiting to see the nature and extent of Netanyahu’s annexation decision before presenting concrete reactions and a real price tag. The differences in European approaches are evident in the phrasing of declarations. France, Ireland and Sweden, for example, express themselves in harsher fashion. Borrell, too, is outspoken, but the fact that he does not represent at this stage a unified stance of all member states weakens the significance of his remarks. At the same time, Borrell is seeking to boost EU ties with Jordan, which he identifies as a key state in regards to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 5 View gallery Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with former EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini ( Photo: Reuters ) Israel has become accustomed to viewing Europe as a weakened entity in the international arena and to dismissing its protests. However, this attitude could turn out to be wrong if Israel decides to take a formal annexation step, which many in Europe would regard as a game changer. Key European leaders might advance measures within EU institutions and elsewhere that would exact a toll on Israel. However, other than a threat of “sticks,” the EU is also offering “carrots” in the event that Israel chooses to progress toward a two-state solution. In 2013, the EU offered a significant upgrade of relations with Israel to that of a Special Privileged Partnership if it makes peace with the Palestinians. It is time to examine this offer, to which Israel has yet to respond, in a positive light. That, in turn, requires a change in the new Israeli government’s attitude toward the EU. The new government should regard the EU as a friend and partner, and cease EU bashing. It should support a strong EU that plays a key role in the international arena and prioritize ties with those European states that are guided by liberal democratic values. 5 View gallery EU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell ( Photo: AFP ) The government should seek to renew its high-level political dialogue with the EU and reconvene the Israel-EU Association Council, which has been suspended since 2012. It should also welcome EU involvement in efforts to advance Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, including European support to pro-peace and pro-democracy civil society organizations. However, recalibrating Israel-EU relations will not be possible while Israel is promoting annexation. These two things do not go together. Israel’s new foreign minister should indeed convey a new message to the Europeans as he takes office – of partnership and friendship, commitment to democratic values, willingness for dialogue and openness to criticism – but at the same time he should seek to block annexation. Not only because of European opposition, but primarily out of concern for Israel’s national interests, democratic character, and quest for peace.

Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The Israeli response is in continuation to public statements made by Netanyahu and his top ministers over the last few years, in which they accused the EU of pursuing anti-Israeli policies, supporting boycotts, and funding organizations supporting Palestinian terrorism. 5 View gallery EU Ambassador to Israel Emanuele Giaufret and President Reuven Rivlin at the President’s Residence in Jerusalem ( Photo: EU Delegation to Israel ) Harsh and undiplomatic language was repeatedly used by Israeli officials against Brussels, and this negatively impacted Israeli perceptions of the EU. Israel is wrong in depicting the EU as hostile to Israel, and the new government would do well to shift direction. The EU is a strategic ally of Israel – in trade and economy, in diplomacy and security, in technology and tourism, in research and culture. Its criticism targets Israel’s policy on the Palestinians and is not inherently anti-Israel as some portray it. The EU opposes the settlements and Israel’s annexation intentions. It also encourages differentiation between the Palestinian territories and Israel, but by no means does it advocate a boycott of Israel. The growing divisions among EU member states in recent years have undermined European consensus on a variety of foreign policy issues, among them the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu’s European supporters, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban who has eroded democracy in his own country, are actively engaged in thwarting EU criticism of Israeli policy in the territories. 5 View gallery Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban in Jerusalem last year ( Photo: Ruters ) The EU Foreign Affairs Council has not adopted joint resolutions on Israel since mid-2016. Europe’s focus on more urgent challenges, such as refugees, Brexit and now the coronavirus – is also a contributing factor in this regard. However, Europe is unwilling to ignore Netanyahu’s annexation intentions. The heads of the EU and key member states are finding ways to circumvent internal divisions in order to convey protests, opposition and warnings to Israel: Outspoken remarks by the EU new foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, joint declarations by European members of the UN Security Council, coordinated protests delivered to the Israeli Foreign Ministry by European ambassadors representing states with similar policy views, and cooperation with other international bodies, such as the Arab League, which also oppose annexation. 5 View gallery ( Photo: Reuters ) EU representatives have made use of all these tools in recent weeks. They have expressed unequivocal opposition to annexation, stressed that it would violate international law, recommended that Israel avoid doing so, and some even warned of legal consequences and deterioration of their relations with Israel. Countries like France, Belgium and Luxembourg have been working to place the issue on the agenda of the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council, calling on the EU to spell out punitive measures against Israeli annexation. Nevertheless, also due to internal divisions, Europe seems to be waiting to see the nature and extent of Netanyahu’s annexation decision before presenting concrete reactions and a real price tag. The differences in European approaches are evident in the phrasing of declarations. France, Ireland and Sweden, for example, express themselves in harsher fashion. Borrell, too, is outspoken, but the fact that he does not represent at this stage a unified stance of all member states weakens the significance of his remarks. At the same time, Borrell is seeking to boost EU ties with Jordan, which he identifies as a key state in regards to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 5 View gallery Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with former EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini ( Photo: Reuters ) Israel has become accustomed to viewing Europe as a weakened entity in the international arena and to dismissing its protests. However, this attitude could turn out to be wrong if Israel decides to take a formal annexation step, which many in Europe would regard as a game changer. Key European leaders might advance measures within EU institutions and elsewhere that would exact a toll on Israel. However, other than a threat of “sticks,” the EU is also offering “carrots” in the event that Israel chooses to progress toward a two-state solution. In 2013, the EU offered a significant upgrade of relations with Israel to that of a Special Privileged Partnership if it makes peace with the Palestinians. It is time to examine this offer, to which Israel has yet to respond, in a positive light. That, in turn, requires a change in the new Israeli government’s attitude toward the EU. The new government should regard the EU as a friend and partner, and cease EU bashing. It should support a strong EU that plays a key role in the international arena and prioritize ties with those European states that are guided by liberal democratic values. 5 View gallery EU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell ( Photo: AFP ) The government should seek to renew its high-level political dialogue with the EU and reconvene the Israel-EU Association Council, which has been suspended since 2012. It should also welcome EU involvement in efforts to advance Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, including European support to pro-peace and pro-democracy civil society organizations. However, recalibrating Israel-EU relations will not be possible while Israel is promoting annexation. These two things do not go together. Israel’s new foreign minister should indeed convey a new message to the Europeans as he takes office – of partnership and friendship, commitment to democratic values, willingness for dialogue and openness to criticism – but at the same time he should seek to block annexation. Not only because of European opposition, but primarily out of concern for Israel’s national interests, democratic character, and quest for peace.

News article:
European Union representatives are set to meet in Brussels on Friday to weigh in on Israel’s plan for the illegal annexation of the occupied West Bank and mull sanctions if it proceeds with the illegal action, a report stated on Tuesday. According to Israeli outlet Haaretz, foreign ministers of EU member states will meet in the Belgian capital to review proposed measures against Israel – should the government proceed with plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. EU foreign policy spokesperson Peter Stano said that ministers will hold a video conference on Friday to discuss the annexation. “Annexation is not in line with international law. If it goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly,” Stano told the European Commission’s daily press briefing on Monday. Asked if Israel will be sanctioned by the EU, Stano said the decision was “up to the member states; at this stage, let’s not speculate”. EU countries want to approve the planned sanctions as soon as possible to discourage Israel from going forward with its plan, while EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell is inclined to wait, the Haaretz report said. France, Spain, Ireland, Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg are all pushing for tough punishments against Israel if it ignores warnings on the annexation, sources familiar with the discussions told Haaretz. A Reuters report confirmed the member states were pushing for a “tough EU response” to the planned annexation. EU mulls deterrent sanctions *in advance of* annexation. Europe understands correctly that once annexation happens, it'll be almost impossible to undo. The point is to prevent, not punish afterward. https://t.co/m8a6nAKHgJ — Ron Skolnik (@Ron_Skolnik) May 12, 2020 On April 20, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz signed a coalition agreement that includes a clause to advance plans to annex parts of the West Bank, including Israeli settlements, starting on July 1. But Palestinians have expressed outrage at Israel’s plans to cement its hold further on land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, a territory they are seeking for a state On May 6, US envoy to Israel David Friedman said that Israel is expected to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank within the coming weeks. Israel in February began mapping the areas it seeks to seize control of as part of the plan, and is expected to finish that mapping process in the coming weeks, Friedman told Israel Hayom.

European Union foreign ministers were set to meet Friday to consider potential measures against Israel over its plan to annex parts of the West Bank. The ministers were expected to meet virtually due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Several European nations led by France, and including Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, have reportedly expressed support for threats of punitive action in a bid to deter the new Israeli government — set to be sworn in on Sunday — from carrying out the move with a green light from Washington. On Tuesday EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said annexation plans and the union’s response to them would be “the most important item on the agenda” of Friday’s meeting. The EU bloc is Israel’s largest trading partner, grants Israel favored trading status, and helps fund Israeli scientific research and development through its massive Horizon 2020 program. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Proposed steps include announcing that Israel would be prevented from entering into trade agreements with the bloc, receiving EU grants or participating in other forms of cooperation with the union. It is not clear if the steps would apply to future agreements or freeze existing ones. As part of their coalition agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White party chief Benny Gantz agreed that the government can begin moving forward with applying Israeli sovereignty to settlements and the Jordan Valley after July 1, a move expected to enjoy backing from a majority of lawmakers in the Knesset. Advertisement Though Gantz is believed to oppose unilateral action, he acquiesced to Netanyahu’s demand to allow the matter to be brought to a vote in parliament. Borrell said that once the new government was sworn in he would speak with the new foreign minister, Gantz ally Gabi Ashkenazi, to receive information on the Israeli plans moving forward. “There is clearly a need to look at what annexation means in the context of international law and we do need to know our options,” a senior EU diplomat told Reuters earlier this week. “We also need to say what exactly the consequences of annexation would be, ideally as a way to stop any such move.” On Monday, European External Action Service spokesman Peter Stano said any EU decision on future sanctions would depend on the results of Friday’s deliberations. “Annexation is contrary to international law and if annexation goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly,” he said, according to Reuters. In February, Borrell said annexation “could not pass unchallenged.” Advertisement The foreign ministers are unlikely to issue any decision on Friday. The Commission and the External Action Service, the EU’s executive and foreign service branches, have yet to propose specific options for member states to consider. Also key to the discussions will be finding potential punitive measures that would not require the unanimous agreement of all 27 bloc members, as Israel’s allies, including Hungary and the Czech Republic, would likely veto any proposals that require unanimity. “No one wants to reach the point that Israel’s relations with the union are harmed for the long term, but that’s what will happen if Israel annexes, if only because of the precedent an annexation would set for every other place” where nations are fighting over disputed land, an EU source was quoted by Haaretz as saying. Annexation of settlements and the Jordan Valley has been a key campaign promise of Netanyahu and his Likud party in recent elections. A plurality of slightly fewer than half of Israelis back the idea, and fewer than a third think the government will actually go through with it, according to a survey of Israelis released Sunday. Netanyahu’s plan to annex portions of the West Bank has been met with harsh criticism from nearly the entire international community, including Washington’s European allies and key Arab partners. President Donald Trump’s Mideast peace plan allows for the possibility of US recognition of such annexations provided Israel agrees to negotiate under the framework of the proposal that was unveiled in January. According to the proposed plan, the US will recognize an Israeli application of sovereignty over parts of the West Bank following the completion of a survey conducted by a joint US-Israel mapping committee and Israel’s acceptance of both a four-year freeze of the areas earmarked for a future Palestinian state and a commitment to negotiate with the Palestinians based on the terms of Trump’s peace deal. Alone among most governments, the Trump administration has said it will support the annexation of West Bank territory claimed by the Palestinians for an eventual state as long as Israel agrees to enter peace talks. US Ambassador David Friedman said last week that Washington is ready to recognize Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank should it be declared in the coming weeks.

A plurality of slightly fewer than half of Israelis back the idea, and fewer than a third think the government will actually go through with it, according to a survey of Israelis released Sunday. Netanyahu’s plan to annex portions of the West Bank has been met with harsh criticism from nearly the entire international community, including Washington’s European allies and key Arab partners. President Donald Trump’s Mideast peace plan allows for the possibility of US recognition of such annexations provided Israel agrees to negotiate under the framework of the proposal that was unveiled in January. According to the proposed plan, the US will recognize an Israeli application of sovereignty over parts of the West Bank following the completion of a survey conducted by a joint US-Israel mapping committee and Israel’s acceptance of both a four-year freeze of the areas earmarked for a future Palestinian state and a commitment to negotiate with the Palestinians based on the terms of Trump’s peace deal. Alone among most governments, the Trump administration has said it will support the annexation of West Bank territory claimed by the Palestinians for an eventual state as long as Israel agrees to enter peace talks. US Ambassador David Friedman said last week that Washington is ready to recognize Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank should it be declared in the coming weeks.

European Union foreign ministers were set to meet Friday to consider potential measures against Israel over its plan to annex parts of the West Bank. The ministers were expected to meet virtually due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Several European nations led by France, and including Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, have reportedly expressed support for threats of punitive action in a bid to deter the new Israeli government — set to be sworn in on Sunday — from carrying out the move with a green light from Washington. On Tuesday EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said annexation plans and the union’s response to them would be “the most important item on the agenda” of Friday’s meeting. The EU bloc is Israel’s largest trading partner, grants Israel favored trading status, and helps fund Israeli scientific research and development through its massive Horizon 2020 program. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Proposed steps include announcing that Israel would be prevented from entering into trade agreements with the bloc, receiving EU grants or participating in other forms of cooperation with the union. It is not clear if the steps would apply to future agreements or freeze existing ones. As part of their coalition agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White party chief Benny Gantz agreed that the government can begin moving forward with applying Israeli sovereignty to settlements and the Jordan Valley after July 1, a move expected to enjoy backing from a majority of lawmakers in the Knesset. Advertisement Though Gantz is believed to oppose unilateral action, he acquiesced to Netanyahu’s demand to allow the matter to be brought to a vote in parliament. Borrell said that once the new government was sworn in he would speak with the new foreign minister, Gantz ally Gabi Ashkenazi, to receive information on the Israeli plans moving forward. “There is clearly a need to look at what annexation means in the context of international law and we do need to know our options,” a senior EU diplomat told Reuters earlier this week. “We also need to say what exactly the consequences of annexation would be, ideally as a way to stop any such move.” On Monday, European External Action Service spokesman Peter Stano said any EU decision on future sanctions would depend on the results of Friday’s deliberations. “Annexation is contrary to international law and if annexation goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly,” he said, according to Reuters. In February, Borrell said annexation “could not pass unchallenged.” Advertisement The foreign ministers are unlikely to issue any decision on Friday. The Commission and the External Action Service, the EU’s executive and foreign service branches, have yet to propose specific options for member states to consider. Also key to the discussions will be finding potential punitive measures that would not require the unanimous agreement of all 27 bloc members, as Israel’s allies, including Hungary and the Czech Republic, would likely veto any proposals that require unanimity. “No one wants to reach the point that Israel’s relations with the union are harmed for the long term, but that’s what will happen if Israel annexes, if only because of the precedent an annexation would set for every other place” where nations are fighting over disputed land, an EU source was quoted by Haaretz as saying.

BRUSSELS, Belgium — The EU will make a diplomatic push to try to stop Israel going ahead with a plan to annex parts of the West Bank, the bloc’s foreign policy chief said Friday. Josep Borrell said the bloc would use “all our diplomatic capacities” to try to dissuade Israel’s incoming government from going ahead with the move, approved under US President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan. While EU countries are alarmed at the prospect of annexation, which they say would violate international law and harm the chances of peace, they are divided about what action to take against Israel. “What everybody agreed is we have to increase our efforts and reach out to all relevant actors in the Middle East,” Borrell said after talks Friday between EU foreign ministers. “We are ready to do that and we will do that in the next days using all our diplomatic capacities in order to prevent any kind of unilateral action,” Borrell said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The push will involve talking to Washington and Arab countries as well as Israel and the Palestinians, Borrell said. Israel’s long-awaited unity government will be sworn in on Sunday — after three inconclusive elections in less than a year and a power-sharing agreement between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former rival Benny Gantz. Some EU countries have pushed for the bloc to take a hard line against Israel, with Luxembourg’s veteran foreign minister Jean Asselborn in particular calling for the recognition of a Palestinian state. Advertisement But others have urged caution and dialogue with Israel, which is seen as an important EU partner in the Middle East. “We are in a dialogue with the responsible parties, including in Israel,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. “We have always made it clear… that we are committed to the goal of a negotiated two-state solution, and that we believe that annexations are not compatible with international law.” Ahead of the meeting, there were reports that several European nations led by France, and including Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, expressed support for threats of punitive action in a bid to deter the new Israeli government. The EU bloc is Israel’s largest trading partner, grants Israel favored trading status, and helps fund Israeli scientific research and development through its massive Horizon 2020 program.

The comments by Morgan Ortagus, made during a phone briefing with Israeli reporters, came after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a lightning trip to Jerusalem Wednesday for talks with Israeli leaders on a number of issues. “He [Pompeo] said that annexation is up to Israel,” Ortagus said, stressing that annexation was “certainly, by no means, the reason” for Pompeo’s trip. “We think these discussions should be a part of the peace process, part of President Trump’s Vision for Peace. So it should be part of discussions between the Israelis and the Palestinians. I don’t really have much more to say on it than that.” Asked directly whether Israel still has a “green light” for unilateral annexation, especially since the Palestinians are proving “unwilling to consider the Trump peace plan,” or whether Israel should put annexation on hold, Ortagus did not give a direct yes or no answer. She said, rather, that the US administration has put out a “comprehensive” peace plan… We’re going to continue to push for this vision for peace that the president has. We have certainly by no means given up hope. In fact it will continue to be a major part of our foreign policy to press for the Palestinians to come to the table as a part of this peace plan, as a part of this process.”

News article:
EU countries are planning to issue Israel with a warning not to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, to try to head off a diplomatic clash. The bloc is alarmed by the incoming Israeli unity government’s plans to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which it says would violate international law and harm the chances of peace with the Palestinians. Advertisement But there is no agreement among EU countries over what punitive action to take should Israel press ahead with the move, which has the support of US President Donald Trump. For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app In an interview with AFP, Luxembourg’s veteran Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said he had discussed a declaration with his EU counterparts during video talks on Friday. “A very large number of countries on Friday supported a draft text that we drew up with my Irish counterpart Simon Coveney in which we warn against an annexation that would be a violation of international law,” Asselborn told AFP. Read more: Annexation of occupied West Bank up to Israel: Pompeo Russia: Israel annexing West Bank would undermine prospect of Palestinian state Arab League condemns Israel’s plan to extend sovereignty to parts of West Bank He said Austria and Hungary had refused to sign the declaration, so it could not be issued in the name of all 27 EU states. “But the fact that a very large number of countries support this line is a success,” he said. The Israeli unity government formed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former rival Benny Gantz is due to be sworn in on Sunday, and the plan is for the statement to be issued after that, on Monday. “We are not talking about sanctions. We’re talking about prevention. This text is not aggressive,” Asselborn said. The four-point statement welcomes the new government and recalls the EU’s close ties with Israel, but warns annexation would violate international law. “The European Union wants to cooperate with neighboring states and countries in the region and reiterates its support for a negotiated two-state solution for a viable peace perspective between Israelis and Palestinians,” Asselborn said. “There is no alternative to this solution. No-one has presented another viable solution,” Asselborn said. The EU has criticized Trump’s Middle East peace plan, unveiled in January, which gave Israel the green light to annex key parts of the West Bank. “If we don’t succeed in convincing Israel to give up its project, the hardest part will be ahead of us,” warned Asselborn. After Friday’s talks the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he would make a concerted diplomatic push to try to steer Israel away from annexations. But he admitted there were deep divisions among the EU states, as some like Asselborn push for a tough line and others argue for dialogue. A European official insisted that options for punitive measures were in place: freezing bilateral agreements, suspending scientific cooperation, cancelling trade preferences and recalling ambassadors. But adopting such measures would require unanimity among the 27 EU countries.

EU countries are planning to issue Israel with a warning not to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, to try to head off a diplomatic clash. The bloc is alarmed by the incoming Israeli unity government’s plans to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which it says would violate international law and harm the chances of peace with the Palestinians.

The four-point statement welcomes the new government and recalls the EU’s close ties with Israel, but warns annexation would violate international law. “The European Union wants to cooperate with neighboring states and countries in the region and reiterates its support for a negotiated two-state solution for a viable peace perspective between Israelis and Palestinians,” Asselborn said. “There is no alternative to this solution. No-one has presented another viable solution,” Asselborn said. The EU has criticized Trump’s Middle East peace plan, unveiled in January, which gave Israel the green light to annex key parts of the West Bank. “If we don’t succeed in convincing Israel to give up its project, the hardest part will be ahead of us,” warned Asselborn. After Friday’s talks the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he would make a concerted diplomatic push to try to steer Israel away from annexations. But he admitted there were deep divisions among the EU states, as some like Asselborn push for a tough line and others argue for dialogue. A European official insisted that options for punitive measures were in place: freezing bilateral agreements, suspending scientific cooperation, cancelling trade preferences and recalling ambassadors. But adopting such measures would require unanimity among the 27 EU countries.

It is headed by Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White party. The coalition agreement calls for the men to trade places as prime minister after 18 months. It also allows the government to push ahead with annexation of large parts of the occupied West Bank, likely within months. Though bitter rivals on a personal level, the pair are no strangers to working closely together to advance anti-Palestinian goals: Netanyahu was prime minister and Gantz was army chief when Israel launched its 2014 war on Gaza, killing more than 2,200 Palestinians, including 550 children. Gantz, like Netanyahu, supports West Bank annexation, though as I noted in the interview, the leaders may quibble about minor tactical details. I was asked whether recent statements from Jordan’s King Abdullah warning that annexation would lead to “massive conflict” would have any restraining effect on Israel. I noted that such warnings – which various leaders have been sounding for years – count for nothing if not accompanied by action. Jordan, for example, has signed a multi-billion dollar deal to buy natural gas from Israel. Despite its deep unpopularity with the Jordanian public and parliament, the government in Amman has insisted on pressing ahead with it. I also pointed out that some European Union diplomats have recently made noises about sanctions, but that this too should not be taken seriously, given the EU’s unrelenting and unconditional support for Israel. An indeed last Wednesday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell confirmed that the 27-nation bloc is “far away from discussing about sanctioning” Israel. For these reasons, Israel has little to fear from the so-called international community as it forges ahead with efforts to complete the colonization of Palestine.

News article:
After eradicating the coronavirus that ravaged the countries of Europe and mending the deep rifts within its ranks, the European Union has circled back to focus on its favorite pet issue: Israel. The new Israeli government, which was barely assembled and hasn’t even published a plan of action yet, is already facing E.U. threats of punitive action, including economic sanctions and even the suspension of diplomatic ties if Israel dares follow through with its intention to apply Israeli law in parts of Judea and Samaria. The bureaucrats at E.U. headquarters in Brussels can’t actually drag Europe into a war on Israel, which has close ties with many countries on the continent, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and others. These countries all harbor animosity for the European Union, which failed in the moment of truth and left them, each on their own, to contend with the quarantines, deaths and economic crises caused by the coronavirus. But several leading European countries, chief among them France, Belgium, Spain and Ireland, are determined to spearhead an anti-Israel initiative and have threatened to enact punitive measures even if the majority of E.U. countries don’t join them. Disagreements between friends are legitimate, but when it comes to Israel-Europe relations, or to be more precise, Israel’s relations with several specific E.U. countries, this isn’t the case. The European Union doesn’t care about the Palestinians whatsoever. Its concern for international law, which it says Israel is violating, also isn’t a top priority. After all, the European Union is indifferent to the Turkish occupation of Cyprus, and Brussels doesn’t typically care about Tibet or Western Sahara either. Israel, however, is always seen as an attractive target to flagellate, for the purpose of winning Arab and Muslim brownie points. Beyond that, the European Union still abides by its decades-long fixation whereby the Palestinian issue is the key to solving all of the Middle East’s ills. And while the Europeans don’t care much about the levels of poverty and distress throughout the Middle East, they are worried about the waves of immigration flooding their continent due to unrest and instability in the Arab world, and are convinced that reprimanding Israel will help them turn the tide. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories It appears, however, that there’s another inherent motive for this European obsession with Israel: The Europeans flog Israel, but their aim is to hurt U.S. President Donald Trump, who many Europeans view as an adversary. It is a symptom of deeply rooted anti-American sentiment, which combines jealousy with a touch of condescension, toward a president who represents such a successful antithesis to the “old continent.” The close-knit alliance between the United States and Israel undoubtedly adds to Israel’s clout and opens up numerous paths for Israel across the globe. Not in Europe. After all, in the eyes of the Europeans, the increasingly intimate bond shared by Washington and Jerusalem is something akin to original sin. Hence the arrows being launched from Europe at Israel—instead of at Washington—in the hope that the White House feels the sting along with the Israeli government. This, therefore, is a profound European undercurrent that even an arrangement with the Palestinians isn’t likely to reverse. Israel’s relations with these European countries will inevitably return to normal, as there are enough mature leaders in Europe—for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel—who are attentive to Israel and its problems and are cognizant of Europe’s own interests in maintaining ties with it. But we can assume that the bureaucrats in Brussels, supported by several European countries, will wait for the next opportunity to kick Israel.

Source: Xinhua| 2020-05-21 01:10:52|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The four EU members of the UN Security Council -- Belgium, Estonia, France and Germany -- plus Poland, which has just left the council, on Wednesday warned against Israel's planned annexation of occupied Palestinian territory. The five countries expressed grave concern over Israel's plan to annex parts of the West Bank as stated by the prime minister when presenting his government to the Knesset (parliament) on May 17 and as envisaged in the coalition agreement signed earlier. "We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to international law," said the five countries in a joint statement. "International law is a fundamental pillar of the international rules-based order. In this respect, we recall that we will not recognize any changes to the 1967 borders, unless agreed by Israelis and Palestinians," said the statement. The two-state solution, with Jerusalem as the future capital for both states, is the only way to ensure sustainable peace and stability in the region, it said. The five countries congratulated the new government in Israel and looked forward to continuing to work with the Israeli government in a constructive and comprehensive way. They showed their willingness to support and facilitate resumed direct and meaningful negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians in order to resolve all final-status issues and achieve a just and lasting peace. "We stand ready to engage immediately with the new government and with all relevant stakeholders," said the statement. Enditem

Houses in the Israeli settlement of Kedumim are seen in the foreground as part of the Palestinian city of Nablus is seen in the background (far left) in the West Bank, Feb. 20, 2020. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat France and the United Nations envoy to the Middle East urged Israel on Wednesday against annexing parts of the occupied West Bank. A partial annexation would be a serious violation, and France is working with European partners to come up with a joint action plan for prevention and reprisal should Israel make such a move, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday. "For the past few days we have held several video conferences with European colleagues ... with a view to deciding on a joint preventive action and eventually a reprisal if such a decision were taken," he said at a parliament hearing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said cabinet discussions will start in July over extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, as was mooted under US President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan. Israel must abandon its threat to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, said UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov, branding such a plan as a serious violation of international law that would “close the door to a renewal of negotiations.” “The continuing threat of annexation by Israel of parts of the West Bank would constitute a most serious violation of international law, deal a devastating blow to the two-state solution, close the door to a renewal of negotiations,” he said during a meeting of the UN Security Council. “Israel must abandon its threat of annexation. And the Palestinian leadership to re-engage with all members of the quartet,” he said, referring to the United States, Russia, the European Union and the UN. He urged the quartet to “come forward with a proposal that will enable the quartet to take up its mediation role.” Mladenov urged the 15-member council to back a push by UN chief Antonio Guterres against unilateral steps that would hinder diplomatic efforts to renew negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Such a statement by the council is unlikely as it has to be agreed by consensus and the United States traditionally shields its ally Israel from any action. “This council cannot dictate the end to this conflict. We can only encourage the parties to sit down together to determine how they wish to make progress,” US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said. Pompeo ‘regrets’ Palestinian threats Several Security Council members such as Indonesia and the European countries have warned Israel against the planned annexations. In a joint statement France, Belgium, Germany and Estonia reaffirmed that they "will not recognize any changes to the 1967 borders, unless agreed by Israelis and Palestinians." "We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to international law," they said, reaffirming their support for a two state solution as the only one capable of bringing peace to the region. The Palestinians have rejected Trump’s peace plan. On Tuesday, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas announced an end to the Palestinians' security arrangements with Israel over its annexation plans. Mladenov said he would speak Thursday with Palestinian leaders about the practical consequences of their announcement, which were not spelled out by Abbas. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday voiced regret at Palestinian threats to end security coordination if Israel annexes occupied territory. "We hope that the security arrangements will continue to be in place, that the work that's done on the ground there to keep people in Israel and Palestinians safe will continue," Pompeo told reporters. Pompeo, who met Netanyahu in Jerusalem last week, said the Palestinians would benefit from the Trump plan, which promises them an independent but condensed and demilitarized state as well as international investment. "The Palestinians have continued to refuse to just simply sit down and enter into negotiation based on President Trump's Vision for Peace," Pompeo said. Joe Biden, Trump's presumptive Democratic challenger in November elections, on Tuesday declared his opposition to annexation, saying it would undermine hopes for peace.

News article:
After eradicating the coronavirus that ravaged the countries of Europe and mending the deep rifts within its ranks, the European Union has circled back to focus on its favorite pet issue: Israel. The new Israeli government, which was barely assembled and hasn’t even published a plan of action yet, is already facing E.U. threats of punitive action, including economic sanctions and even the suspension of diplomatic ties if Israel dares follow through with its intention to apply Israeli law in parts of Judea and Samaria. The bureaucrats at E.U. headquarters in Brussels can’t actually drag Europe into a war on Israel, which has close ties with many countries on the continent, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and others. These countries all harbor animosity for the European Union, which failed in the moment of truth and left them, each on their own, to contend with the quarantines, deaths and economic crises caused by the coronavirus. But several leading European countries, chief among them France, Belgium, Spain and Ireland, are determined to spearhead an anti-Israel initiative and have threatened to enact punitive measures even if the majority of E.U. countries don’t join them. Disagreements between friends are legitimate, but when it comes to Israel-Europe relations, or to be more precise, Israel’s relations with several specific E.U. countries, this isn’t the case. The European Union doesn’t care about the Palestinians whatsoever. Its concern for international law, which it says Israel is violating, also isn’t a top priority. After all, the European Union is indifferent to the Turkish occupation of Cyprus, and Brussels doesn’t typically care about Tibet or Western Sahara either. Israel, however, is always seen as an attractive target to flagellate, for the purpose of winning Arab and Muslim brownie points. Beyond that, the European Union still abides by its decades-long fixation whereby the Palestinian issue is the key to solving all of the Middle East’s ills. And while the Europeans don’t care much about the levels of poverty and distress throughout the Middle East, they are worried about the waves of immigration flooding their continent due to unrest and instability in the Arab world, and are convinced that reprimanding Israel will help them turn the tide. It appears, however, that there’s another inherent motive for this European obsession with Israel: The Europeans flog Israel, but their aim is to hurt U.S. President Donald Trump, who many Europeans view as an adversary. It is a symptom of deeply rooted anti-American sentiment, which combines jealousy with a touch of condescension, toward a president who represents such a successful antithesis to the “old continent.” The close-knit alliance between the United States and Israel undoubtedly adds to Israel’s clout and opens up numerous paths for Israel across the globe. Not in Europe. After all, in the eyes of the Europeans, the increasingly intimate bond shared by Washington and Jerusalem is something akin to original sin. Hence the arrows being launched from Europe at Israel—instead of at Washington—in the hope that the White House feels the sting along with the Israeli government. This, therefore, is a profound European undercurrent that even an arrangement with the Palestinians isn’t likely to reverse. Israel’s relations with these European countries will inevitably return to normal, as there are enough mature leaders in Europe—for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel—who are attentive to Israel and its problems and are cognizant of Europe’s own interests in maintaining ties with it.

News article:
Hungary and Austria on Wednesday warned their counterparts in the European Union against endorsing a double standard against Israel with regard to E.U. resolutions. Budapest and Vienna have consistently been the sole opponents of the harsh criticism expressed by E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell against the Jewish state since Israel’s government said it plans to go ahead with plans to apply Israeli law to large parts of Judea and Samaria. Borrell said last week that he will explore the option of imposing sanctions on Israel if it goes through with the move, which is endorsed by the United States. The 27-nation European Union decides on foreign policy moves by consensus, but Borrell has repeatedly disregarded the opposition of a minority of member states to his threats against and condemnations of Israel. On Monday night, Borrell, with the support of 25 E.U. member states, issued a statement saying, “We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to International Law.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said his country rejects “prejudice” against Israel and called to hold a dialogue with the new government, according to the Austrian news site Kurier. According to The Jerusalem Post, Austria and Hungary urged Borrell to invite Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi to the E.U. Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Friday. The Israeli Foreign Ministry criticized Borrell’s “megaphone diplomacy,” saying, “we called for a gradual approach of caution, not rushing forward and certainly not alienating Israel,” the Hungarian source said. “We believe Israel is a really important strategic partner in the Mediterranean region.” Borrell’s belligerent rhetoric does a disservice to the European Union, especially if it wants to be taken seriously by Israel and the United States as a player in the Middle East peace process, a ministry official said. Hungary and Austria opposed Borrell’s previous statements against Israel, including one that said that the application of Israeli law to the Jordan Valley and parts of Judea and Samaria “would not go unchallenged,” which Israel’s Foreign Ministry described as a threat. Also on Wednesday, French Ambassador to the United Nations Nicolas de Riviere warned Israel that any annexation move “would not be without consequences to the E.U. relationship with Israel.” Annexation “would be detrimental to Israel’s role in the world, to its integration in its regional environment, as well as to Israel’s relationships with its partners,” he said. Belgian Ambassador to the United Nations Marc Pecsteen told the Security Council that his country remained “deeply concerned” about the portions of Israel’s coalition agreement that would allow the country to extend its law to Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria as early as July. “We call on the international community to exert all efforts to prevent any such steps,” he said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft called on Israelis and Palestinians to return to the negotiating table. “If both sides are serious about their talking, it is time for both sides to prove it,” she said. Craft told the UNSC that statements of “concern” would not resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “This council cannot dictate the end to this conflict,” she said. “We can only encourage the parties to sit down together to determine how they wish to make progress.” This article first appeared in Israel Hayom.

Although Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, on Monday warned Israel against its annexation plans, saying that the EU would not recognize any changes to the 1967 boundaries not agreed upon by both Israel and Palestine, the bloc appears to be conflicted on the issue. “The EU is wringing their hands. They’re making threats. The EU, taken as one bloc, is Israel’s largest trading partner. The EU is divided on the issue … France and Sweden and Luxembourg are making a lot of noise about this and saying that Israel can’t go through with this. On the other side, many of the Eastern European countries and Central European countries - Hungary, Romania, Austria and [the] Czech Republic - are basically nixing any idea of sanctions,” Sleboda explained. Last month, several European states, including France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and the UK, filed a formal protest document with the Israeli Foreign Ministry, warning Israel of "serious consequences for regional stability and for Israel's position in the international arena" if it proceeds with the annexation. However, Israel’s closer friends, like Hungary, have taken a more cautious approach. In February, Italy, Hungary, Austria and the Czech Republic opposed an EU resolution that would have condemned Israeli annexation of the West Bank. “They do not have consensus on this,” Sleboda added. “If there are eventual sanctions, punishments coming from the EU, it will be very weak and watered down.” In January, Trump unveiled his “Vision for Peace” plan for Israel and Palestine. Under the plan, Israel would be allowed to exercise sovereignty over approximately 30% of West Bank territory and the Jordan Valley, with a joint US-Israeli mapping committee subsequently working on drawing up specific boundaries of the territory outlined in the plan.

News article:
Several European leaders reportedly sent personal letters to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent days asking him not to push ahead with plans to unilaterally annex parts of the West Bank. “I ask you, in a spirit of friendship, that your new government not take unilateral action [in the West Bank]. Such a move would destabilize the Middle East,” French President Emmanuel Macron told Netanyahu, according to a report aired Tuesday on Channel 13. “Only dialogue with the Palestinians and a just and balanced solution will provide Israel with peace, security and stability.” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and their Italian counterpart Giuseppe Conte reportedly sent Netanyahu letters expressing similar sentiments. Several European nations are currently considering ways to deter Israel from moving forward with its declared intention to apply sovereignty to the entire Jordan Valley and all settlements across the West Bank — territory much of the international community wants to see become a Palestinian state — and how to punish it if it ignores their warnings and carries out the annexation, according to the report. According to the coalition agreement on which Israel’s new government was founded, Netanyahu can bring the annexation plan to a vote in the government and the Knesset as soon as July 1, as long as it’s done in full coordination with the US. The administration of US President Donald Trump has vowed to recognize Israel’s annexation as long as Jerusalem does it on the basis of the peace plan issued by Washington earlier this year. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms According to the network, Palestinian leaders are concerned that leading Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Gulf states, have reacted with seeming indifference about the prospect of annexation. While Jordan has threatened to review its ties with Israel over the annexation plans, most other Arab states have made little fuss. Citing an unnamed Palestinian source, Channel 13 said that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, having severed security ties with Israel, may resort to still more dramatic measures if Israel presses ahead with unilateral annexation, including dismantling the PA. Advertisement Last week, Abbas announced the end of security cooperation with Israel in reaction to the annexation plans, in what was seen as his most extreme move yet to attempt to thwart Israeli intentions to claim sovereignty over areas the Palestinians seek for their future state. On Monday, Netanyahu reportedly told lawmakers from his Likud faction that he was sticking to plans to begin the annexation process on July 1, rebuffing domestic and international pressure against the move. Among the most outspoken opponents of the annexation plans has been the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who in recent weeks released several statements condemning the annexation plans, causing much chagrin in Jerusalem. Borrell spoke with Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi Tuesday, but surprisingly did not highlight the bloc’s vociferous opposition to Israel’s plan to annex parts of the West Bank. A readout of the conversation provided by Borrell’s office quoted him reaffirming the EU’s wish to “continue working with the new Israeli government in a constructive and comprehensive way, in the spirit of the longstanding friendship that binds the EU and Israel together.” Ashkenazi and Borrell had “an honest and open exchange of views on a broad range of bilateral and regional issues,” the readout continues, without elaborating. Advertisement The EU’s foreign policy czar “underlined the EU’s unequivocal commitment to the security of the State of Israel, which is not negotiable for the EU” and reaffirmed the union’s intention to “address jointly issues of mutual interest and concern and to work with Israel to promote global peace and security and to contribute to building trust, in particular in the region and the immediate neighborhood.” The fact that the readout did not explicitly mention annexation is to be seen as an indication of the union’s “willingness to engage” with the new Israeli government, an EU source told The Times of Israel. The source added, however, that the EU’s position on annexation “is abundantly clear.” Last week, the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem slammed Borrell’s “megaphone diplomacy” after he repeatedly warned Israel against annexation. “Israel and the EU share history, values, interests, opportunities and both face threats. It is regrettable that once again, the security of Israel, a key partner of the EU, and the threats that Israel face, were not mentioned at all and were not given the centrality that they should be in such a message,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat said at the time. “This ‘megaphone diplomacy’ is not a substitute for intimate diplomatic dialogue and will not advance the role the EU is seeking to fulfill.” On May 18, Borrell had issued a brief statement that largely focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the need for a two-state solution, the importance of international and Brussel’s “grave concerns” over Jerusalem’s supposed plan to unilaterally annex the Jordan Valley and all settlements across the West Bank. “The two-state solution, with Jerusalem as the future capital for both States, is the only way to ensure sustainable peace and stability in the region,” Borrell declared. “In this vein, we note with grave concern the provision – to be submitted for approval by the Israeli cabinet – on the annexation of parts of occupied Palestinian territories. “We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to International Law,” he said. Advertisement The statement was issued in Borrell’s name because there was no consensus on it among the EU’s 27 member states. According to several sources familiar with the matter, Hungary, Austria and other countries reasoned that now was not the time for such statements. On the other hand, some member states, including Ireland and Luxembourg, sought to issue a statement that was even harsher, including mentioning steps the EU may consider if Israel were to advance its annexation plans. Given the near-certain veto of such a text by Budapest and Vienna, some countries considered issuing a separate joint statement listing possible sanctions against Israel as a deterrent against annexation, but this has not materialized so far. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

News article:
By Zalman Ahnsaf YERUSHALAYIM — International pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu‏‏ to abandon his plans for annexation of parts of Yehudah and Shomron ramped up on Tuesday as several European leaders sent letters to him imploring a change of course. French President Emmanuel Macron told PM Netanyahu in his missive: “I ask you, in friendly spirit, that your new government not take unilateral action. Such a move will destabilize the Middle East. Only dialogue with the Palestinians and a just and balanced solution will provide Israel with peace, security and stability,” Channel 13 quoted him as saying. France recently suggested the possibility of unspecified reprisals if Israel should proceed with annexations. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has been notably friendly to Israel, was reported to express similar sentiments. The leaders of Spain and Italy urged Israel to act only within the framework of international law, which they say disallows any unilateral action in the region. Meanwhile, in an odd counterpoint on Tuesday, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, reportedly had his first conversation with Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, in which the two did not touch on the vexed issue of annexation, at least not for public consumption. This was surprising, since Borrell has in recent weeks taken it upon himself to denounce the annexation plans even without the formal backing of the E.U. The Israeli Foreign Ministry in turn denounced Borrell for “megaphone diplomacy.” A readout of the conversation provided by Borrell’s office quotes him stressing the EU’s wish to “continue working with the new Israeli government in a constructive and comprehensive way, in the spirit of the longstanding friendship that binds the EU and Israel together.” The two had “an honest and open exchange of views on a broad range of bilateral and regional issues,” the readout said, without elaborating. The EU’s foreign policy czar “underlined the EU’s unequivocal commitment to the security of the State of Israel, which is not negotiable for the EU” and reaffirmed the union’s intention to “address jointly issues of mutual interest and concern and to work with Israel to promote global peace and security and to contribute to building trust, in particular in the region and the immediate neighborhood.”

News article:
By Zalman Ahnsaf YERUSHALAYIM — International pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu‏‏ to abandon his plans for annexation of parts of Yehudah and Shomron ramped up on Tuesday as several European leaders sent letters to him imploring a change of course. French President Emmanuel Macron told PM Netanyahu in his missive: “I ask you, in friendly spirit, that your new government not take unilateral action. Such a move will destabilize the Middle East. Only dialogue with the Palestinians and a just and balanced solution will provide Israel with peace, security and stability,” Channel 13 quoted him as saying. France recently suggested the possibility of unspecified reprisals if Israel should proceed with annexations. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has been notably friendly to Israel, was reported to express similar sentiments. The leaders of Spain and Italy urged Israel to act only within the framework of international law, which they say disallows any unilateral action in the region. Meanwhile, in an odd counterpoint on Tuesday, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, reportedly had his first conversation with Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, in which the two did not touch on the vexed issue of annexation, at least not for public consumption. This was surprising, since Borrell has in recent weeks taken it upon himself to denounce the annexation plans even without the formal backing of the E.U. The Israeli Foreign Ministry in turn denounced Borrell for “megaphone diplomacy.” A readout of the conversation provided by Borrell’s office quotes him stressing the EU’s wish to “continue working with the new Israeli government in a constructive and comprehensive way, in the spirit of the longstanding friendship that binds the EU and Israel together.” The two had “an honest and open exchange of views on a broad range of bilateral and regional issues,” the readout said, without elaborating. The EU’s foreign policy czar “underlined the EU’s unequivocal commitment to the security of the State of Israel, which is not negotiable for the EU” and reaffirmed the union’s intention to “address jointly issues of mutual interest and concern and to work with Israel to promote global peace and security and to contribute to building trust, in particular in the region and the immediate neighborhood.”

News article:
Several European leaders have recently sent letters urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, according to a Tuesday Axios report. European nations have previously expressed opposition to Israel’s West Bank annexation ambitions, deeming them a violation of international law and detrimental to prospects of peace. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote Netanyahu to say the annexation plans will “undermine stability in the Middle East”, and dialogue with Palestinians alone will give Israel “peace, security and stability”, according to Axios. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also wrote a letter in coordination with France, Axios reported, citing European and Israeli officials. Spain and Italy’s prime ministers have also emphasized the need for negotiations with Palestinians and respect for international law. Israel’s annexation plans, which are backed by the US and rejected by the Palestinians, have drawn international opposition. Aside from most of the EU’s push to dissuade Israel from annexing parts of the West Bank, Turkey has previously stated it will “not allow” Israel to move forward with its plans. Jordan, which has signed a peace treaty with Israel, warned of a “massive conflict” and said it would review its relationship with Israel if annexation plans move ahead. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu renewed his pledge to annex part of the occupied Palestinian West Bank in July. Palestinians have expressed outrage, appealing to the international community to block the Israeli step, which, if implemented, would be considered the final nail in the two-state solution’s coffin. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced on May 19 that the PA is canceling all agreements with Israel and the US, as a direct response to Israel’s annexation plans.

News article:
Austria on Friday warned Israel against its planned annexation of parts of the West Bank, saying it would contravene international law. The statement came despite the fact that Austria previously blocked a declaration on the matter that was to be issued by the European Union and offered public support for Jerusalem earlier this year with the unanimous passing of a resolution that called for condemnation of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. “The unilateral expansion of territory is against international law and numerous resolutions of the United Nations Security Council since 1967,” Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told Die Presse, according to the Haaretz daily. “There are no doubts about the Austrian position regarding annexation,” Schallenberg said, adding that he had made the country’s position clear to Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi. A coalition deal underlying Israel’s new unity government allows it from July 1 to initiate moves to implement US President Donald Trump’s controversial peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The plan, rejected by the Palestinians, gives the green light from Washington for Israel to annex Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley, a swath of land running along the border with Jordan. Palestinians say the US plan ends prospects for a two-state solution to their decades-long conflict with Israel. A statement on the matter on May 18 was issued in the name of the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell because there was no consensus on it among the EU’s 27 member states. According to several sources familiar with the matter, Austria, Hungary and other countries reasoned that now was not the time for such statements. Borrell’s brief statement largely focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the need for a two-state solution, the importance of international law, and Brussels’s “grave concerns” over Jerusalem’s supposed plan to unilaterally annex the Jordan Valley and all settlements across the West Bank. Advertisement “The two-state solution, with Jerusalem as the future capital for both States, is the only way to ensure sustainable peace and stability in the region,” Borrell declared. “In this vein, we note with grave concern the provision — to be submitted for approval by the Israeli cabinet — on the annexation of parts of occupied Palestinian territories. “We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to International Law,” he said. Several European leaders reportedly sent personal letters to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent days asking him not to push ahead with plans to unilaterally annex parts of the West Bank. Jordan’s foreign minister on Thursday night warned the top diplomats of the US and UK against the “unprecedented threat” Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the West Bank posed to the region, his office said. Last week Amman threatened to review its relationship with Israel if the Jewish state goes ahead with the controversial plans. Washington on Thursday warned its citizens to take extra caution when traveling to the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, anticipating potential violence. Advertisement A security alert by the US Embassy in Jerusalem advised citizens to “maintain a high level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness.” Israel’s military liaison to the Palestinians earlier this week warned the Israel Defense Forces’ chief of staff and the defense minister of a potential wave of violence if the government follows through with its plans to unilaterally annex portions of the West Bank. Last week, PA President Mahmoud Abbas announced that his security forces were halting coordination with Israel over its plans. While Israeli security officials have confirmed the PA has ended security cooperation, Channel 13 reported that Ramallah had sent messages to Israel saying it would not allow terror attacks against Israelis or a mass popular uprising. Though not widely discussed publicly, Israel’s cooperation with Palestinian security forces has been credited with thwarting many major terror attacks and being a significant factor in the relative calm in the West Bank in recent years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said he has set a July date for when Israel will extend its sovereignty over West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley, and informed Likud lawmakers he had no intention of changing it. The move would be coordinated with the US, in accordance with the Middle East plan Trump unveiled in January, which endorsed extending Israeli sovereignty over roughly 30 percent of the West Bank. However, in recent days even Trump administration officials have appeared to seek to dampen expectations that Washington will quickly green-light the move without any progress in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Advertisement The State Department’s chief spokesperson said earlier this month that any action should be part of discussions between Israel and the Palestinians on the Trump administration’s peace plan. Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report.

News article:
The member states of the European Union—both individually and collectively via the Quartet—are in a tizzy and hypocritically warning Israel against annexation, even as those same countries continue to occupy numerous territories that they have annexed. Let’s start with the French. France recently urged the European Union to take punitive measures against Israel if it annexes anything. That’s right, France—which has been ruling the 890-square mile Reunion Island, off the southeast coast of Africa, for more than 300 years. And the 144-square mile Mayotte Island for nearly 200 years. The area of the Gush Etzion communities is all of 45 square miles. France, which has been occupying the five so-called “Scattered Islands” in defiance of a 1979 U.N. resolution demanding that those islands be surrendered to Madagascar. France, which in 1955 announced that the thousands of miles of what it calls “French Southern and Antarctic Lands” would henceforth be considered an official French Overseas Territory. By what right, exactly? Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories And France, the Grand Annexer, lectures Israel on annexation? How do you say chutzpah in French? While it has one foot in and the other out of the European Union, England, too, has weighed in. The Brits are furious at the thought of Israeli annexation. Cabinet minister (and chairman of the ruling Conservative Party) James Cleverly told parliament that such Israeli action would be make it “harder” to achieve peace. I wonder why the British never had such concerns when Jordan annexed all of Judea and Samaria—not just the tiny portion Israel is considering—back in 1950. In fact, England was one of only two countries in the entire world (the other was Pakistan) that recognized the Jordanian annexation. So, it was OK for Jordan—a country that didn’t even exist until the British created it out of whole cloth in 1922—to annex it. But not Israel, even though the area has been at the heart of the Jewish homeland for 3,000 years. London is hoping the rest of us won’t notice that there are no less than 14 “British Overseas Territories” that they have forcibly made and kept a part of the British Empire—from the Falkland Islands (that Britain went to war with Argentina in 1982 over the latter’s claims to the islands) to Bermuda. Some are in the South Atlantic, some in the North Atlantic, some in the Caribbean—pretty much everywhere you look on the globe, you can find pieces of the old British Empire still in operation. What are some of the other E.U. member states who presume to lecture and threaten Israel? There’s Portugal, which annexed the 908 square-mile Azores Islands some 500 years ago. Spain, illegal occupier of the 3,000 square-mile Canary Islands since the 15th century. Greenland was forcibly made part of Denmark in 1814. Don’t forget Curaçao and Aruba, which were annexed by Holland, along with Saint Martin, Saba and Bonaire. There are many more examples. The issue is not just that these countries are incredibly hypocritical for haranguing Israel about annexation while themselves annexing any territory they can get their hands on. No, the main issue is that France, England and the rest have no moral, historical or legal right to annex those territories, while Israel has every right to incorporate the parts of Judea and Samaria under discussion. Those areas have been at the center of the Jewish national home since biblical times. Israel won them in self-defense and by international law has no obligation to surrender them. And they have only a small Arab population, so annexation—“reunification” is more accurate—poses no demographic danger to Israel. So, here’s my message to the European annexationists that criticize Israeli annexation: Mind your own business. I mean that literally. Go attend to the business of convincing your own governments to release the many lands that they have occupied and annexed—and then you can come talk to Israel about the subject. Stephen M. Flatow is a vice president of the Religious Zionists of America, an attorney in New Jersey and the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered in an Iranian-sponsored Palestinian terrorist attack in 1995.

The member states of the European Union—both individually and collectively via the Quartet—are in a tizzy and hypocritically warning Israel against annexation, even as those same countries continue to occupy numerous territories that they have annexed. Let’s start with the French. France recently urged the European Union to take punitive measures against Israel if it annexes anything. That’s right, France—which has been ruling the 890-square mile Reunion Island, off the southeast coast of Africa, for more than 300 years. And the 144-square mile Mayotte Island for nearly 200 years. The area of the Gush Etzion communities is all of 45 square miles. France, which has been occupying the five so-called “Scattered Islands” in defiance of a 1979 U.N. resolution demanding that those islands be surrendered to Madagascar. France, which in 1955 announced that the thousands of miles of what it calls “French Southern and Antarctic Lands” would henceforth be considered an official French Overseas Territory. By what right, exactly? Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories And France, the Grand Annexer, lectures Israel on annexation? How do you say chutzpah in French? While it has one foot in and the other out of the European Union, England, too, has weighed in. The Brits are furious at the thought of Israeli annexation. Cabinet minister (and chairman of the ruling Conservative Party) James Cleverly told parliament that such Israeli action would be make it “harder” to achieve peace.

News article:
Egypt has written to the UN Security Council about Ethiopia’s failure to reach an agreement over the operation of Addis Ababa’s nearly-completed dam that Cairo fears will significantly reduce its share of the Nile’ waters. News of the letter broke late on Wednesday night in an Egyptian Foreign Ministry statement about a phone call between Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and Urmas Reinsalu, his counterpart from Estonia, which currently chairs the 15-member council. The ministry did not release the full text of the letter, saying only that it was sent recently. The letter appears to be part of Egypt’s drive to take its dispute with Ethiopia over the dam on the Blue Nile to the international community after years of inconclusive negotiations involving Sudan, another Nile basin country. Egypt has publicly accused Ethiopia of time-buying tactics and of intransigence after its refusal to sign an agreement brokered by the United States. The dispute has entered a potentially explosive phase with Ethiopia’s recent announcement that it intended to start filling the hydroelectric dam’s massive reservoir this summer. Egypt wants the reservoir to be filled over six to seven years to reduce the impact downstream. It also wants Ethiopia to release 40 billion cubic metres of water annually and show flexibility during sustained droughts. Ethiopia has baulked at these demands and the two countries have been engaged in a bitter war of words for months. Expand Autoplay A general view of the construction works at the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), near Guba in Ethiopia. AFP The Egyptian foreign ministry said the letter to the Security Council pointed out Egypt’s flexibility in the deadlocked negotiations while conforming with the rules of international law. It expressed the wish to see Ethiopia “seriously engaged” in negotiations to reach a fair and balanced settlement for all three nations. Such an outcome, it added, would guarantee peace and security in the region. Egypt, the most populous Arab nation with 100 million people, depends on the Nile for more than 90 per cent of its water needs. It has maintained that a significant reduction in its share of Nile water would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and affect its food security. It has said it appreciates Ethiopia’s development needs and that its goal is to reach an agreement that would reduce the impact of the dam to manageable levels. Ethiopia denies that the dam would harm Egypt, which it accuses of an unwarranted sense of entitlement to the river’s water. Sudan, Egypt’s neighbour to the south, is unlikely to be affected by the dam the same way as Egypt since it has an alternative source of water in rainfall and the White Nile, which runs through the entire length of the vast Afro-Arab country. The White Nile originates in central Africa and merges with the Blue Nile, whose source is on the Ethiopian highlands, in Khartoum to become the river Nile that flows across the deserts of northern Sudan and across Egypt to the Mediterranean. The Blue Nile contributes about 65 per cent of the water reaching Egypt. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi has described Egypt’s water security as an existential issue and vowed that Cairo would never accept a de facto situation imposed on it. Some pro-government media voices have suggested military action to stop the Ethiopians from harming Egypt’s vital water interests. Mr El Sisi, a former military chief, has stated his preference for a negotiated settlement.

News article:
Ethiopia has a very diverse topography that includes both flat and mountainous areas and receives an average of about 1.2 metres of rainfall annually, generating several rivers that originate in Ethiopia and flow through its southern, eastern, northern and western borders. Forests and wildlife are common, with huge pastures and rain-fed crops. It is believed by many Ethiopians that Egypt has captured their Blue Nile waters, established its ancient civilisation and present renaissance, leaving them in poverty and deprivation. This is not true; Ethiopia has built a great history and civilisation in East Africa. Currently, Ethiopia is trying hard to revitalise and develop its security in the region, as well as promote the vision of electrical links between its dams and neighbouring countries to export electricity, just like the Congo in West Africa. Unfortunately, Ethiopia, like many others, believed that Egypt after the 2011 unrest would be too overwhelmed to fight for its water rights and made sure to use that opportunity and lay down the corner stone of the Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile in April 2011. They increased the capacity of the dam several times until it reached the latest design capacity of 74 billion cubic metres in the beginning of 2012. It should be mentioned that a dam with this capacity gives Ethiopia total control over the Blue Nile waters. However, Egypt returned to the negotiating table in June 2013. The negotiations on the Renaissance Dam were a ploy to distract Egypt and Sudan until it becomes a reality that cannot be changed. Egypt has been negotiating in good faith until it was obvious that the negotiations were not going anywhere, and announced the failure of negotiations and the need for an international mediator to facilitate the GERD talks and ensure that negative impacts are minimised on the downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. In November 2019, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia agreed to a time frame for the negotiations under the supervision of the United States of America and the World Bank, with the aim of reaching an agreement on the rules for filling and operating the dam so as not to cause significant harm to the downstream countries. The negotiations continued with positive statements from all participants, until we Ethiopia did not attend the last session in Washington in February 2020, and announced its sudden withdrawal from the negotiations. Ethiopia has argued that the draft of this agreement is an extension of the old colonial agreements for the management of the Nile Basin water, in an attempt to provoke upstream countries aiming to be strengthened by them in this international confrontation. Ethiopia has since made statements filled with violent accusations and false allegations, including that the Washington agreement did not highlight Ethiopia's right to "reasonable and equitable utilisation of the waters of the Blue Nile" and that the US should not underestimate this Ethiopian right under the pretext of water needs in the two downstream countries. In addition, Ethiopia has been calling for the redistribution of the Nile waters according to the Entebbe Agreement – which was previously rejected by Egypt, Sudan and the Congo – meaning enforcing the water allocation according to the Ethiopian preference and that of some upstream countries. Ethiopia continued to claim that it took all steps that ensure that the Renaissance Dam would not harm Egypt, but rather claimed that the dam will bring Egypt tremendous benefits, playing the role of the adversary and the judge at the same time. If we examine the Ethiopian actions regarding other transboundary rivers, we can notice that this same exact ploy has happened before with its neighbouring countries Somalia, Eritrea and Kenya, where it built dams on shared rivers without prior notifications, studies, negotiations, or agreements, and without taking into consideration the reasonable and equitable utilisation of water. Recently, the Ethiopian media has repeatedly stated that Ethiopia’s plan was initially to fill the Renaissance Dam in three years, but agreed to Egypt's request to extend the period to seven years, in order to not harm Egypt, which will cause tremendous losses in the dam's electricity sales during this period. The truth is that the Ethiopian demand to fill a dam of this magnitude in three years is a provocative request, whereby Ethiopia seeks to deepen its policy of domination in the region. The dam has a capacity of 74 billion cubic metres, and filling it over three years requires 25 billion cubic metres annually, in addition to 3 billion cubic metres lost annually to evaporation from the reservoir surface, meaning, storing 28 billion cubic metres annually from the river’s natural flow. The average annual flow of the river is around 49.5 billion cubic metres, meaning that Ethiopia wants to store 28 billion cubic metres annually, which leaves Egypt and Sudan together with 20 billion cubic meters, that is of course assuming it is not a dry year. Which leaves us with the question: what would happen in a dry year scenario? Will Ethiopia store the water in the dam, while Egypt and Sudan suffer? Ethiopia claims that the Renaissance Dam is for development purposes and for the good of the Ethiopian people. Let’s examine that claim carefully. The GERD will supposedly generate 12,000 gigawatts of electricity annually, meaning that the annual electricity production of the Renaissance Dam will reach 12 billion kilowatt-hr. The price of electricity in Ethiopia for household use is only one US cent, and the commercial price is 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, making the average local price (domestic and commercial) about 1.4 cents/ kilowatts-hour. This means that if the electricity of the Renaissance Dam is used solely within Ethiopia, then the total revenue of electricity production is about $160 million annually, which will not be enough to cover the expected annual expenses for operating and maintaining the dam and paying the annual instalments for the dam loans. Assuming the government raises the local electricity price 3-4 times in order to cover the annual income for operation and maintenance costs, and the instalment loans, can the Ethiopian citizen live with this increase in power prices? In order to be able to afford the operation and maintenance costs of the dam, the Ethiopian government must raise the local electricity price and export part of the electricity abroad. The economic feasibility study of the electrical connection with Egypt and Sudan was based on the export of more than 3 megawatts to Egypt and Sudan (about more than half of the dam's electricity, one-third for Sudan and two-thirds for Egypt) at a price of 8 US cents per kilowatt-hour, which increases the annual income of the dam to about $550 million, which covers the costs of operation and maintenance, and provides an annual premium for dam loans to be repaid over 15-20 years. It may be necessary to double the internal price several times and increase the export price to 9-10 cents per kilowatt to be able to better pay the dam debt. However, after Ethiopia has revealed its true face with Egypt during the negotiations, Egypt will of course, not import any electricity from Ethiopia. On the other hand, Sudan alone will not be able to absorb this large amount of electricity aside from the fact that it has not yet started the construction of electricity transmission lines from the dam site and its need to develop its own internal electrical network. Moreover, Ethiopia has not finished the transmission line to transfer the dam's electricity to its own internal network (financed by a Chinese loan), and it may need one to two years to be completed, and it is desperate to double the price of local electricity three or four times to compensate for the deficit resulting from Egypt not purchasing Ethiopian electricity. Meanwhile, there are many obstacles that prevent the filling and operation of the dam, since the middle part of the dam still has a long way to go and the establishment of electricity transmission lines for the Ethiopian and Sudanese internal networks could take years. Now the question to ask here is: why is Ethiopia in such a hurry to start filling the GERD? * The writer is the former Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation in Egypt Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Ethiopia has a very diverse topography that includes both flat and mountainous areas and receives an average of about 1.2 metres of rainfall annually, generating several rivers that originate in Ethiopia and flow through its southern, eastern, northern and western borders. Forests and wildlife are common, with huge pastures and rain-fed crops. It is believed by many Ethiopians that Egypt has captured their Blue Nile waters, established its ancient civilisation and present renaissance, leaving them in poverty and deprivation. This is not true; Ethiopia has built a great history and civilisation in East Africa. Currently, Ethiopia is trying hard to revitalise and develop its security in the region, as well as promote the vision of electrical links between its dams and neighbouring countries to export electricity, just like the Congo in West Africa. Unfortunately, Ethiopia, like many others, believed that Egypt after the 2011 unrest would be too overwhelmed to fight for its water rights and made sure to use that opportunity and lay down the corner stone of the Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile in April 2011. They increased the capacity of the dam several times until it reached the latest design capacity of 74 billion cubic metres in the beginning of 2012. It should be mentioned that a dam with this capacity gives Ethiopia total control over the Blue Nile waters. However, Egypt returned to the negotiating table in June 2013. The negotiations on the Renaissance Dam were a ploy to distract Egypt and Sudan until it becomes a reality that cannot be changed. Egypt has been negotiating in good faith until it was obvious that the negotiations were not going anywhere, and announced the failure of negotiations and the need for an international mediator to facilitate the GERD talks and ensure that negative impacts are minimised on the downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. In November 2019, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia agreed to a time frame for the negotiations under the supervision of the United States of America and the World Bank, with the aim of reaching an agreement on the rules for filling and operating the dam so as not to cause significant harm to the downstream countries. The negotiations continued with positive statements from all participants, until we Ethiopia did not attend the last session in Washington in February 2020, and announced its sudden withdrawal from the negotiations. Ethiopia has argued that the draft of this agreement is an extension of the old colonial agreements for the management of the Nile Basin water, in an attempt to provoke upstream countries aiming to be strengthened by them in this international confrontation. Ethiopia has since made statements filled with violent accusations and false allegations, including that the Washington agreement did not highlight Ethiopia's right to "reasonable and equitable utilisation of the waters of the Blue Nile" and that the US should not underestimate this Ethiopian right under the pretext of water needs in the two downstream countries. In addition, Ethiopia has been calling for the redistribution of the Nile waters according to the Entebbe Agreement – which was previously rejected by Egypt, Sudan and the Congo – meaning enforcing the water allocation according to the Ethiopian preference and that of some upstream countries. Ethiopia continued to claim that it took all steps that ensure that the Renaissance Dam would not harm Egypt, but rather claimed that the dam will bring Egypt tremendous benefits, playing the role of the adversary and the judge at the same time. If we examine the Ethiopian actions regarding other transboundary rivers, we can notice that this same exact ploy has happened before with its neighbouring countries Somalia, Eritrea and Kenya, where it built dams on shared rivers without prior notifications, studies, negotiations, or agreements, and without taking into consideration the reasonable and equitable utilisation of water. Recently, the Ethiopian media has repeatedly stated that Ethiopia’s plan was initially to fill the Renaissance Dam in three years, but agreed to Egypt's request to extend the period to seven years, in order to not harm Egypt, which will cause tremendous losses in the dam's electricity sales during this period. The truth is that the Ethiopian demand to fill a dam of this magnitude in three years is a provocative request, whereby Ethiopia seeks to deepen its policy of domination in the region. The dam has a capacity of 74 billion cubic metres, and filling it over three years requires 25 billion cubic metres annually, in addition to 3 billion cubic metres lost annually to evaporation from the reservoir surface, meaning, storing 28 billion cubic metres annually from the river’s natural flow. The average annual flow of the river is around 49.5 billion cubic metres, meaning that Ethiopia wants to store 28 billion cubic metres annually, which leaves Egypt and Sudan together with 20 billion cubic meters, that is of course assuming it is not a dry year. Which leaves us with the question: what would happen in a dry year scenario? Will Ethiopia store the water in the dam, while Egypt and Sudan suffer? Ethiopia claims that the Renaissance Dam is for development purposes and for the good of the Ethiopian people. Let’s examine that claim carefully. The GERD will supposedly generate 12,000 gigawatts of electricity annually, meaning that the annual electricity production of the Renaissance Dam will reach 12 billion kilowatt-hr. The price of electricity in Ethiopia for household use is only one US cent, and the commercial price is 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, making the average local price (domestic and commercial) about 1.4 cents/ kilowatts-hour. This means that if the electricity of the Renaissance Dam is used solely within Ethiopia, then the total revenue of electricity production is about $160 million annually, which will not be enough to cover the expected annual expenses for operating and maintaining the dam and paying the annual instalments for the dam loans.

News article:
Egypt is pushing back against Addis Ababa’s plans to the filling of the reservoir of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) this summer. Government officials say they have to take seriously the statements made by Ethiopian officials that the filling process will be initiated during this rainy season, with or without an agreement with Egypt and Sudan. “We cannot ignore the fact that they could start the filling. Regardless of the amount of water they extract from the Blue Nile, it would be a violation of [existing] legal agreements, and an indication that Ethiopia was never serious about reaching an agreement to get the dam up and running in a way that does not harm Egypt and Sudan,” said an informed government official. Under construction since 2011, GERD is a gravity mega dam with a reservoir capable of storing 74 billion m3. It will be the largest hydrological dam on the continent, designed to generate 6,450 megawatts. This week, Egyptian sources estimated that the dam is close to 85 per cent complete, which means it is technically possible to store water in the reservoir. On Monday the Ethiopian News Agency quoted Ethiopian Water, Irrigation and Energy Minister Sileshi Bekele saying that Addis Ababa is determined to start the filling in July and that it will not succumb to pressure from downstream states to reverse its plans. There was no immediate response from either Cairo or Khartoum to this statement though Egyptian officials speaking off the record said it revealed the extent to which Ethiopia had been “playing games” during the past five years of negotiations. Addis Ababa, said one official, had only been “pretending to look for a consensual agreement”. In March 2015 Egypt signed the Declaration of Principles with Ethiopia and Sudan under which the completion and operation of the dam was made dependent on a comprehensive agreement being reached between the three states. Last year, following more than four years of inconclusive negotiations, Cairo requested the mediation of the US and the World Bank. The talks that began in Washington last autumn produced a text that Egypt initialed. Sudan declined to sign in the absence of Ethiopia, which had absented itself from the final negotiations hosted by the US. Egypt had hoped the US would put enough pressure on Ethiopia that it would sign the deal. By last month, however, Egyptian authorities realised that was not happening, and the US administration’s attention was focused elsewhere. “The US repeatedly promised to pressure Ethiopia to honour the outcome of the Washington negotiation process but this did not happen. Ethiopian officials are now saying they will start the filling this summer with or without an agreement,” said one Cairo source. The source argued that “there seems to be a split” in the US administration: while the US Treasury Department, which co-facilitated the talks with the World Bank, seems to have a good understanding of Egypt’s “legitimate concerns regarding possible severe water shortages”, the US State Department seems to be more aligned with Ethiopia. “The State Department’s view is that it is important to stand by Abiy Ahmed who is facing internal political opposition and needs to move ahead with GERD to be able to defy his opponents.” It was concern that an effective US intervention would not materialise, the same source said, that prompted Cairo to seek political support from the UN Security Council. Egypt must now use the next few weeks to build enough international pressure to get Ethiopia to return to the negotiating table and commit to the Washington treaty, or at the very least suspend its plans to start filling the reservoir without an agreement. Earlier this month Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri sent a letter to Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu, the current chair of the UN Security Council (UNSC), demanding that the body responsible for world peace and security ensures that Addis Ababa makes good on its 2015 commitment not to start filling the dam in the absence of an agreement. Ethiopian officials promptly leaked a copy of the letter to the Ethiopian press. The letter and its annexed aide memoire detailed the long process of negotiations that led to the drafting of the text of a treaty in Washington earlier this year, before Ethiopia opted to walk out on the deal. The letter emerged after Egypt and Sudan declined an offer made by Ethiopian Prime Minister Ahmed in April, to engage in a new round of negotiations over an interim agreement on the first filling of the reservoir. According to Egyptian diplomatic sources, in his talks with Reinsalu and other foreign ministers Shoukri explained that Egypt is losing faith in the intentions of Ethiopia which seems determined to maintain an open-ended negotiating process without taking any of the steps needed to reach an agreement. Hani Raslan, a Nile affairs specialist at Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies (ACPSS), says the refusal of Ahmed’s offer to negotiate an interim agreement and the sending of a letter to the UNSC reflect Cairo’s realisation that a prompt and effective US intervention is unlikely to be forthcoming. “It is significant that Egypt is now taking the matter to the highest possible political forum in anticipation of an Ethiopian decision to start filling the dam this summer, and any subsequent reaction from Cairo will match the grave threat such an Ethiopian move would constitute.” Egyptian officials say the letter to the UNSC is the opening salvo in an intense political move Cairo is planning for the coming weeks as it seeks to persuade the international community to get Ethiopia to abandon its plans to start filling the reservoir this summer. According to Raslan, it was important for Egypt to explain its position to the international community to counter “the misleading Ethiopian narrative that suggests Egypt is seeking to monopolise the water of the Nile.” Ethiopia has announced that it is drafting a reply to the Egyptian letter, to be sent to the current chair of the UNSC. It promised its reply would refute Egyptian claims that the filling and operation of GERD would cause significant harm to downstream countries. Raslan says Ethiopia “will find it difficult to convince the international community that Egypt is trying to block Ethiopian development. “In its letter to the chair of the UNSC Egypt states clearly it has no objections to the filling and operation of the dam. What it wants are solid reassurances that this filling and operation will not cause severe water shortages in Egypt.” If the diplomatic offensive fails to persuade Ethiopia to pursue a consensual agreement, Raslan says it will then be up to Egypt to consider its choices “in light of the support it is building in the international community”. Ayman Abdel-Wahab, an expert on the management of water resources at the ACPSS, argues that the time is ripe for Egypt to expand its Nile focus beyond GERD. “I think that what Egypt needs to do now is pursue a far more comprehensive vision of the management of the Nile and its resources by all the riparian states,” he says. In 2010 Egypt suspended its membership of the Nile Basin Initiative in protest at an agreement that several Nile Basin countries were promoting to rework Egypt’s share of Nile water. Egypt refused the argument being made by these states that existing agreements specifying Egypt’s water share were void given that they were concluded when most of the Nile Basin countries were under colonial occupation. Instead, Cairo argued the historic agreements remained legally binding. Egyptian officials agree that Ethiopia is not the only country with plans to build barrages on the Nile. Nor is GERD likely to be the last dam Ethiopia seeks to build on the Nile. Egypt faces growing water scarcity. The Nile provides over 90 per cent of Egypt’s water. Cairo’s worst fear is that Ethiopia plans not only to use GERD to generate electricity — its stated aim — but intends to withhold water for agricultural purposes. This scenario, say Egyptian officials, explains why Addis Ababa is so resistant to agreeing a resolution mechanism for disputes arising from the amounts of water held by GERD. It is a clear indication, they say, that Ethiopia has “other plans” for its mega dam beyond the generation of electricity. *A version of this article appears in print in the 14 May, 2020 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

Hani Raslan, a Nile affairs specialist at Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies (ACPSS), says the refusal of Ahmed’s offer to negotiate an interim agreement and the sending of a letter to the UNSC reflect Cairo’s realisation that a prompt and effective US intervention is unlikely to be forthcoming. “It is significant that Egypt is now taking the matter to the highest possible political forum in anticipation of an Ethiopian decision to start filling the dam this summer, and any subsequent reaction from Cairo will match the grave threat such an Ethiopian move would constitute.” Egyptian officials say the letter to the UNSC is the opening salvo in an intense political move Cairo is planning for the coming weeks as it seeks to persuade the international community to get Ethiopia to abandon its plans to start filling the reservoir this summer. According to Raslan, it was important for Egypt to explain its position to the international community to counter “the misleading Ethiopian narrative that suggests Egypt is seeking to monopolise the water of the Nile.” Ethiopia has announced that it is drafting a reply to the Egyptian letter, to be sent to the current chair of the UNSC. It promised its reply would refute Egyptian claims that the filling and operation of GERD would cause significant harm to downstream countries. Raslan says Ethiopia “will find it difficult to convince the international community that Egypt is trying to block Ethiopian development. “In its letter to the chair of the UNSC Egypt states clearly it has no objections to the filling and operation of the dam. What it wants are solid reassurances that this filling and operation will not cause severe water shortages in Egypt.” If the diplomatic offensive fails to persuade Ethiopia to pursue a consensual agreement, Raslan says it will then be up to Egypt to consider its choices “in light of the support it is building in the international community”. Ayman Abdel-Wahab, an expert on the management of water resources at the ACPSS, argues that the time is ripe for Egypt to expand its Nile focus beyond GERD. “I think that what Egypt needs to do now is pursue a far more comprehensive vision of the management of the Nile and its resources by all the riparian states,” he says. In 2010 Egypt suspended its membership of the Nile Basin Initiative in protest at an agreement that several Nile Basin countries were promoting to rework Egypt’s share of Nile water. Egypt refused the argument being made by these states that existing agreements specifying Egypt’s water share were void given that they were concluded when most of the Nile Basin countries were under colonial occupation. Instead, Cairo argued the historic agreements remained legally binding. Egyptian officials agree that Ethiopia is not the only country with plans to build barrages on the Nile. Nor is GERD likely to be the last dam Ethiopia seeks to build on the Nile. Egypt faces growing water scarcity. The Nile provides over 90 per cent of Egypt’s water. Cairo’s worst fear is that Ethiopia plans not only to use GERD to generate electricity — its stated aim — but intends to withhold water for agricultural purposes. This scenario, say Egyptian officials, explains why Addis Ababa is so resistant to agreeing a resolution mechanism for disputes arising from the amounts of water held by GERD. It is a clear indication, they say, that Ethiopia has “other plans” for its mega dam beyond the generation of electricity. *A version of this article appears in print in the 14 May, 2020 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Egypt is pushing back against Addis Ababa’s plans to the filling of the reservoir of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) this summer. Government officials say they have to take seriously the statements made by Ethiopian officials that the filling process will be initiated during this rainy season, with or without an agreement with Egypt and Sudan. “We cannot ignore the fact that they could start the filling. Regardless of the amount of water they extract from the Blue Nile, it would be a violation of [existing] legal agreements, and an indication that Ethiopia was never serious about reaching an agreement to get the dam up and running in a way that does not harm Egypt and Sudan,” said an informed government official. Under construction since 2011, GERD is a gravity mega dam with a reservoir capable of storing 74 billion m3. It will be the largest hydrological dam on the continent, designed to generate 6,450 megawatts. This week, Egyptian sources estimated that the dam is close to 85 per cent complete, which means it is technically possible to store water in the reservoir. On Monday the Ethiopian News Agency quoted Ethiopian Water, Irrigation and Energy Minister Sileshi Bekele saying that Addis Ababa is determined to start the filling in July and that it will not succumb to pressure from downstream states to reverse its plans. There was no immediate response from either Cairo or Khartoum to this statement though Egyptian officials speaking off the record said it revealed the extent to which Ethiopia had been “playing games” during the past five years of negotiations. Addis Ababa, said one official, had only been “pretending to look for a consensual agreement”. In March 2015 Egypt signed the Declaration of Principles with Ethiopia and Sudan under which the completion and operation of the dam was made dependent on a comprehensive agreement being reached between the three states. Last year, following more than four years of inconclusive negotiations, Cairo requested the mediation of the US and the World Bank. The talks that began in Washington last autumn produced a text that Egypt initialed. Sudan declined to sign in the absence of Ethiopia, which had absented itself from the final negotiations hosted by the US. Egypt had hoped the US would put enough pressure on Ethiopia that it would sign the deal. By last month, however, Egyptian authorities realised that was not happening, and the US administration’s attention was focused elsewhere. “The US repeatedly promised to pressure Ethiopia to honour the outcome of the Washington negotiation process but this did not happen. Ethiopian officials are now saying they will start the filling this summer with or without an agreement,” said one Cairo source. The source argued that “there seems to be a split” in the US administration: while the US Treasury Department, which co-facilitated the talks with the World Bank, seems to have a good understanding of Egypt’s “legitimate concerns regarding possible severe water shortages”, the US State Department seems to be more aligned with Ethiopia. “The State Department’s view is that it is important to stand by Abiy Ahmed who is facing internal political opposition and needs to move ahead with GERD to be able to defy his opponents.” It was concern that an effective US intervention would not materialise, the same source said, that prompted Cairo to seek political support from the UN Security Council. Egypt must now use the next few weeks to build enough international pressure to get Ethiopia to return to the negotiating table and commit to the Washington treaty, or at the very least suspend its plans to start filling the reservoir without an agreement. Earlier this month Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri sent a letter to Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu, the current chair of the UN Security Council (UNSC), demanding that the body responsible for world peace and security ensures that Addis Ababa makes good on its 2015 commitment not to start filling the dam in the absence of an agreement. Ethiopian officials promptly leaked a copy of the letter to the Ethiopian press. The letter and its annexed aide memoire detailed the long process of negotiations that led to the drafting of the text of a treaty in Washington earlier this year, before Ethiopia opted to walk out on the deal. The letter emerged after Egypt and Sudan declined an offer made by Ethiopian Prime Minister Ahmed in April, to engage in a new round of negotiations over an interim agreement on the first filling of the reservoir. According to Egyptian diplomatic sources, in his talks with Reinsalu and other foreign ministers Shoukri explained that Egypt is losing faith in the intentions of Ethiopia which seems determined to maintain an open-ended negotiating process without taking any of the steps needed to reach an agreement.

News article:
To prevent Ethiopia from completing construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and begin operations without first reaching an agreement with Egypt and Sudan, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri has appealed to the UN Security Council to prevail on Ethiopia to settle the dispute over the dam in a way that serves the interests of all parties and safeguards regional stability. In a formal letter to the Security Council, Shoukri warned of the impact on peace and security in the region should Ethiopia begin filling the dam in July, without Egyptian or Sudanese approval. He urged the Security Council to encourage Addis Ababa to sign the draft agreement prepared by the US Treasury Department, in collaboration with the World Bank. Egypt has already initialled the agreement, despite Ethiopia not turning up for the scheduled signing ceremony. As Ethiopia is still refusing to either sign the agreement or return to the negotiating table, the chances are slim for ending the current deadlock in the absence of significant pressure being brought to bear on Addis Ababa. On Monday, the Ethiopian irrigation minister said Ethiopia has “prepared a comprehensive document that provides sufficient response” to the complaint Egypt filed to the Security Council. Few expect Ethiopia to budge from its current position, which is to reject anything that might restrict its use of Blue Nile waters for agricultural and electricity generating purposes, regardless of how this impacts on downstream nations. It has been reported that Addis Ababa wants the Washington agreement to provide a fixed quota of Nile water for Ethiopia, and to allow Ethiopia to build as many dams as it likes on the river. It claims that 50 million Ethiopians live in the Blue Nile Basin, and the river is their main source of fresh water. Yet Ethiopia has 12 major rivers, 22 lakes and abundant underground water resources. It also receives 800 billion m3 of rainwater a year, half of the total amount of rainwater that falls on the 10 Nile Basin countries. For any Security Council response to be effective, the US must back a strongly worded resolution calling on Addis Ababa to heed international laws and conventions regulating the use of transboundary watercourses. Under the UN Watercourses Convention, countries must take every appropriate measure to prevent significant harm to countries on the same watercourse. The principle of avoidance of harm includes not just depriving others of their water rights but also severe impairment of previously existing agricultural and electricity generating facilities on the watercourse. Washington could, of course, take the initiative and act itself. It could assert pressure on Addis Ababa to either sign the agreement that the Treasury Department and World Bank drafted, or to return to the negotiating table to resolve outstanding differences. Washington certainly has the leverage in the form of the economic and military assistance it gives Ethiopia, which included $1 billion in counter-terrorism assistance in 2018 alone. Regardless of the methods it chooses, Washington should follow through on President Donald Trump’s pledge that his administration will continue with its efforts to get the three countries to conclude an agreement, and US Treasury Security Steven Mnuchin should make it clear to Ethiopia that it must not commence filling the GERD reservoir until an agreement is reached. If Washington fails to act, either independently or through the Security Council, because it is preoccupied with the fight against coronavirus or with November’s presidential elections, the crisis will continue to seethe. Egypt will not allow it to be swept under the carpet. Egypt has other avenues to pursue. While it cannot ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to arbitrate — both parties need to make such a request — it can lodge a grievance against Ethiopia with the ICJ for violating existing agreements and conventions regulating hydraulic works on the Blue Nile, the Sobat and Atbara rivers and their tributaries. Another alternative is to turn to the UN General Assembly for a resolution, which would avert the possibility of a veto being wielded by one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Such a resolution would bring powerful moral pressure to bear on Ethiopia. Egypt could also ask Italy, China and other countries that have been assisting Ethiopia with the construction of GERD to suspend technical advice, construction and/or funding until the dispute over the dam is settled and Ethiopia signs a binding agreement. Cairo also has the option of asking friendly countries that have major investment projects in Ethiopia or that host large numbers of Ethiopian workers to intervene with Addis Ababa to encourage it to show the flexibility necessary to reach an agreement. In March, Shoukri travelled to 16 Arab, African and European countries to explain Egypt’s position and highlight the flexibility Egypt has shown, the initiatives it has taken and the concessions it has made to try and resolve the dispute. His presentations put paid to Ethiopian propaganda that Egypt is seeking to obstruct construction of the dam in order to undermine Ethiopia’s right to pursue development. Egypt also exposed the many actions Ethiopia has taken to obstruct negotiations and other efforts to reach an agreement, including its boycott of the last round of talks in Washington in order to avoid signing the draft agreement. Another positive outcome of Egypt’s diplomatic drive is that it has prepared the international community for any action Egypt might be forced to take to prevent the dam from going into operation before Addis Ababa commits to an agreement regulating its filling and operation in a manner that averts significant harm to Sudan and Egypt. Egypt’s position is backed by Washington and the World Bank, which have witnessed Ethiopia’s intransigence over several negotiating rounds in Washington and its manoeuvring as it boycotted the last round, giving just one day’s notice that it would not to attend. In addition to Upper Nile Basin countries — the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Tanzania, Rwanda and South Sudan — Shoukri’s tour also covered South Africa, the current chair of the African Union, Niger, one of the G5 Sahel states, France, a major partner in Ethiopian development, and Belgium, seat of the EU headquarters and a major contributor to peace-making and development efforts in Africa. In his meetings with key officials in these countries, Shoukri drove home Egypt’s desire to reach a just, equitable and sustainable agreement that serves Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. Such an agreement was at hand thanks to the efforts of Washington and the World Bank, he said. In addition to Shoukri’s tour, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry delegation headed by Assistant Minister for Arab Affairs Yasser Osman, and Deputy Assistant Minister for Nile Water Affairs Yasser Sorour, visited Algeria, Tunisia and Mauritania. They presented letters from President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi stressing the need for an agreement over GERD that safeguards the rights of all parties. After the Arab League adopted a resolution backing Egypt’s position, Shoukri visited Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium. These countries’ leaders, who also received letters from President Al-Sisi, expressed understanding of the Egyptian viewpoint, and many of them lauded Egypt for its flexibility and constructiveness. For example, DRC President Félix Tshisekedi expressed his admiration for Egypt’s flexibility in efforts to reach an agreement such an existential matter. President of Niger Mahamadou Issoufou also lauded Egyptian efforts and underscored the need to respect the principles of international law. Shoukry noted that European officials were equally sympathetic, and appreciated Egypt’s flexibility. They also understood the implications of Ethiopian intransigence for stability in the Horn of Africa. “Europe feels it important to play a role in preventing any tensions in this region,” he said. Stressing the need for Arab solidarity in defence of Egypt’s national security, Shoukri said that Egypt would remain in contact with its Arab partners on matters relating to Egypt’s water security, and with the US in its capacity as a sponsor of the tripartite negotiations over GERD. *A version of this article appears in print in the 14 May, 2020 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

His presentations put paid to Ethiopian propaganda that Egypt is seeking to obstruct construction of the dam in order to undermine Ethiopia’s right to pursue development. Egypt also exposed the many actions Ethiopia has taken to obstruct negotiations and other efforts to reach an agreement, including its boycott of the last round of talks in Washington in order to avoid signing the draft agreement. Another positive outcome of Egypt’s diplomatic drive is that it has prepared the international community for any action Egypt might be forced to take to prevent the dam from going into operation before Addis Ababa commits to an agreement regulating its filling and operation in a manner that averts significant harm to Sudan and Egypt. Egypt’s position is backed by Washington and the World Bank, which have witnessed Ethiopia’s intransigence over several negotiating rounds in Washington and its manoeuvring as it boycotted the last round, giving just one day’s notice that it would not to attend. In addition to Upper Nile Basin countries — the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Tanzania, Rwanda and South Sudan — Shoukri’s tour also covered South Africa, the current chair of the African Union, Niger, one of the G5 Sahel states, France, a major partner in Ethiopian development, and Belgium, seat of the EU headquarters and a major contributor to peace-making and development efforts in Africa. In his meetings with key officials in these countries, Shoukri drove home Egypt’s desire to reach a just, equitable and sustainable agreement that serves Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. Such an agreement was at hand thanks to the efforts of Washington and the World Bank, he said. In addition to Shoukri’s tour, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry delegation headed by Assistant Minister for Arab Affairs Yasser Osman, and Deputy Assistant Minister for Nile Water Affairs Yasser Sorour, visited Algeria, Tunisia and Mauritania. They presented letters from President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi stressing the need for an agreement over GERD that safeguards the rights of all parties. After the Arab League adopted a resolution backing Egypt’s position, Shoukri visited Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium. These countries’ leaders, who also received letters from President Al-Sisi, expressed understanding of the Egyptian viewpoint, and many of them lauded Egypt for its flexibility and constructiveness. For example, DRC President Félix Tshisekedi expressed his admiration for Egypt’s flexibility in efforts to reach an agreement such an existential matter. President of Niger Mahamadou Issoufou also lauded Egyptian efforts and underscored the need to respect the principles of international law. Shoukry noted that European officials were equally sympathetic, and appreciated Egypt’s flexibility. They also understood the implications of Ethiopian intransigence for stability in the Horn of Africa. “Europe feels it important to play a role in preventing any tensions in this region,” he said. Stressing the need for Arab solidarity in defence of Egypt’s national security, Shoukri said that Egypt would remain in contact with its Arab partners on matters relating to Egypt’s water security, and with the US in its capacity as a sponsor of the tripartite negotiations over GERD. *A version of this article appears in print in the 14 May, 2020 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

Ethiopia sees no reason to delay filling its controversial mega-dam despite warnings from Egypt that such a move could destabilize the region, according to a letter from Ethiopia’s foreign minister to the UN Security Council. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has been a source of tension in the Nile River basin ever since Ethiopia broke ground on the project in 2011. Advertisement Addis Ababa says the dam is crucial for its economy, while Cairo fears it will disrupt the river that provides almost all its water. For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app. Talks earlier this year involving the two governments and Sudan - another downstream country - failed to produce a breakthrough. Read more: Sudan rejects Ethiopia’s proposal to fill controversial mega-dam Ethiopia asks US to postpone final talks over dam dispute In April Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed proposed proceeding with “first stage filling” that would collect 18.4 billion cubic meters of water in the dam’s reservoir over two years. But both Egypt and Sudan fear the reservoir - which has a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters - will trap their essential water supplies. Filling and operating the dam “would jeopardize the water security, food security, and indeed, the very existence of over 100 million Egyptians, who are entirely dependent on the Nile River for their livelihood,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said in a letter to the UN Security Council dated May 1. “This is a situation that potentially poses a serious threat to peace and security throughout the region,” he said. In a response dated May 14 and seen Monday by AFP, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew accused Egypt of being obstructionist. “Ethiopia does not have a legal obligation to seek approval of Egypt to fill the dam,” Gedu said. “Ethiopia has made extraordinary efforts to accommodate Egypt’s unending demands and unpredictable behavior,” he added. Egypt wants Ethiopia to endorse a draft agreement emerging from the talks earlier this year facilitated by the US Treasury Department, which stepped in after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi put in a request to his ally US President Donald Trump. But Ethiopia skipped the most recent round of those talks and denies any deal was agreed. While Egypt’s letter to the Security Council raises the stakes further, the possibility of armed conflict stemming from the dam dispute is still “very unlikely,” said William Davison of the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organization. “We could expect some sort of diplomatic escalation, more aggressive rhetoric. But a negotiated resolution to this is obviously the best way out for everyone, and there still seems to be plenty of possibility of that,” Davison said.

News article:
The prime ministers of Egypt and Sudan discussed Ethiopia’s controversial dam project on the River Nile during a meeting held on Tuesday via video conference that was attended by both countries' intelligence chiefs and irrigation and foreign ministers. Egypt's Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and his Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok discussed “all aspects” of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) during the meeting, Egypt’s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday. The massive $4.8 billion mega project, under construction on the Blue Nile since 2011, has triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Ethiopia. During the meeting, Hamdok said he will call Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to “discuss the resumption of the tripartite negotiation as soon as possible,” Sudan’s official news agency SUNA said. Cairo and Khartoum stressed during the meeting “the need to reach a tripartite agreement that takes into account the interests of the three countries, and to continue negotiations based on what was agreed upon in Washington,” SUNA added. The US, represented by the Treasury Department, along with the World Bank stepped in last year to host tripartite negotiations that began in November after years-long negotiations between the three countries hit a dead end. Following four months of negotiations brokered by Washington, during which the three nations initially agreed on mitigation mechanisms to adjust the filling and operation of the dam during dry periods and drought, the US and the World Bank drafted a deal that was due to be signed in late February. Ethiopia skipped the latest round of talks and only Egypt initialled the deal. Ethiopian Irrigation and Electricity Minister Sileshi Bekele said on Tuesday that his country has the right to use the 86 percent share of water it contributes to the River Nile, stressing the dam has no significant harm on any of the downstream countries, according to the Ethiopian News Agency ENA. Also on Tuesday, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to “peacefully resolve any remaining differences and to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.” Ethiopia has backpedalled on a 2015 Declaration of Principles deal that obliges the three African countries to reach an agreement on the guidelines of filling and operating the dam, telling the UN Security Council (UNSC) in a 14 May letter that it “does not have a legal obligation to seek the approval of Egypt to fill the dam.” Article 5 of the Declaration of Principles stipulates that all three countries should reach an agreement on the rules of filling and operating the 6,000-megawatt dam before starting the process of filling the reservoir. Ethiopia’s 22-page letter to the UNSC came in response to an Egyptian letter sent to the president of the UNSC on 1 May stressing Egypt’s "unwavering commitment" to concluding a comprehensive agreement on the GERD based on the 2015 deal. According to the Egyptian letter, the Ethiopian prime minister sent on 10 April a letter to the president of Egypt and the prime minister of Sudan proposing they agree to an Ethiopian plan covering only the first stage of the filling of GERD. The Ethiopian proposal was rejected by both countries, the Egyptian 17-page letter said, stressing that any agreement on the GERD must be comprehensive and "must regulate the complete process of filling the dam and its operation". Egypt also blamed Ethiopia for trying to establish a deal without taking the interests of downstream countries into consideration, the letter noted. Last week, Sudan joined Egypt in repudiating efforts by Ethiopia to progress its mega-dam, with Hamdok sending a letter to his Ethiopian counterpart disapproving of Addis Ababa’s proposed agreement which he said lacks several technical and legal aspects, according to the Sudanese cabinet. "The signing of any partial agreement for the first stage cannot be approved as technical and legal aspects must be incorporated in the agreement, including the coordination and data exchange mechanism, dam safety and environmental and social impacts," Hamdok said in his letter. Ethiopia hopes the massive $4.8 billion megaproject on the Blue Nile will allow it to become Africa’s largest power exporter. But Egypt, which relies on the Nile for the vast majority of its freshwater, fears the dam will diminish its water supply that has already been below scarcity level. Egypt has a water share of around 570 cubic metres per person annually, well below the water scarcity level of 1,000 cubic metres per person per year. The figure is expected to drop further to 500 cubic metres by 2025. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Source: Xinhua| 2020-05-22 19:44:58|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said it is willing to resume negotiations with Sudan and Ethiopia over the filling of the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), state-run Ahram newspapers reported on Friday. "Egypt is always ready to enter into negotiations and participate in upcoming meetings between the ministers of irrigations of the three countries," the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement. It added that "serious and constructive talks would contribute to a fair, balanced, and comprehensive agreement." The ministry said the agreement would have to take into account "Egypt's water interests as well as those of Ethiopia and Sudan." The statement came after the announcement on Thursday by Khartoum and Addis Ababa "to resume technical discussions about the filling and operation of the dam." On Thursday, Prime Minister of Sudan Abdalla Hamdok and Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed held an online meeting and agreed to resume the talks in order to reach a final agreement on the filling and operation policies of the GERD. The meeting came after Addis Ababa said it would not delay filling the GERD, which it began constructing in 2011. Both Egypt and Sudan fear the reservoir, which has a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters, will impact their essential water supplies. Hamdok and Abiy's talks were the first after a diplomatic spat that broke out between Egypt and Ethiopia reached the United Nations Security Council. The negotiations between the three countries reached a deadlock last February after Ethiopia skipped the final round of talks in Washington. Enditem

Source: Xinhua| 2020-05-22 19:44:58|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said it is willing to resume negotiations with Sudan and Ethiopia over the filling of the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), state-run Ahram newspapers reported on Friday. "Egypt is always ready to enter into negotiations and participate in upcoming meetings between the ministers of irrigations of the three countries," the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement. It added that "serious and constructive talks would contribute to a fair, balanced, and comprehensive agreement." The ministry said the agreement would have to take into account "Egypt's water interests as well as those of Ethiopia and Sudan." The statement came after the announcement on Thursday by Khartoum and Addis Ababa "to resume technical discussions about the filling and operation of the dam." On Thursday, Prime Minister of Sudan Abdalla Hamdok and Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed held an online meeting and agreed to resume the talks in order to reach a final agreement on the filling and operation policies of the GERD. The meeting came after Addis Ababa said it would not delay filling the GERD, which it began constructing in 2011. Both Egypt and Sudan fear the reservoir, which has a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters, will impact their essential water supplies. Hamdok and Abiy's talks were the first after a diplomatic spat that broke out between Egypt and Ethiopia reached the United Nations Security Council. The negotiations between the three countries reached a deadlock last February after Ethiopia skipped the final round of talks in Washington. Enditem

(Elias Asmare / AP) Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein The African Union (AU) has welcomed the announcement of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to resume the technical discussions on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), as part of efforts exerted by the three parties to reach an agreement on the dam’s filling and operation. Chairperson of AU’s Commission Moussa Faki welcomed the recent developments on GERD. He commended Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan for agreeing to resume technical-level engagements through their water ministers to resolve outstanding differences and reach an amicable solution. The Chairperson encouraged the three states to pursue their engagements in good faith, guided by principles of cooperation, common understanding and transparency, as stipulated in the 2015 Declaration of Principles on the GERD. Faki also expressed the AU Commission’s willingness to assist all parties in finding a peaceful resolution and achieving a mutually beneficial agreement. A statement issued by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry last week said Cairo is willing to resume negotiations with Ethiopia and Sudan on the rules for filling and operating the dam. However, the Ministry stressed the importance that the negotiations be serious and constructive, and contribute to reaching a fair, balanced and comprehensive agreement that preserves Egypt’s water interests while also taking into account the interests of Ethiopia and Sudan. Negotiations between the three countries had stalled in February after Ethiopia skipped the final round of US-brokered negotiations held earlier this year and refused to sign a draft agreement prepared by Washington and the World Bank. Only Egypt initialed the resulting draft agreement. Later, Addis Ababa warned that it would begin filling the dam in July without signing an agreement. But earlier this month, Sudan rejected Ethiopia’s proposal. Last week, UN chief Antonio Guterres, the European Union and China encouraged Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to persevere with efforts to overcome their differences and reach agreement on the dam.

News article:
CAIRO: Ethiopia has opened the floodgates to further controversy over a giant dam scheme by rejecting Egypt’s historic claims to the waters of the Nile. Ahead of the anticipated resumption of stalled talks over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project, two Ethiopian ministers poured water over the Egyptian stance on river rights. In a speech to political party representatives and religious leaders regarding the latest developments in GERD negotiations, Ethiopian Minister of Water, Irrigation and Energy Seleshi Bekele said the talks, also involving Sudan, were being “clouded by Egypt’s tendency to recall and confirm the so-called (historic rights) in water, which can never be accepted by Ethiopia or Nile-sharing countries.” Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs Gedu Andargachew added that his country’s position was firm with regard to utilizing its water resources in a fair way “in accordance with the agreed cooperation principles and not causing any major damage.” Meanwhile, Ethiopian religious leaders have called on the government to press ahead with the construction of the dam while negotiating with Nile-sharing countries. Ethiopia’s official news agency ENA, reported that a statement issued during a press conference by the Ethiopian inter-religious council of seven institutions, “underlined Ethiopia’s natural right in developing the Nile.” The council also called for the resumption of tripartite discussions. Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Patriarch Abune Mathias said the government needed to continue with construction of the dam on the basis of mutual understanding with upstream countries and without any foreign intervention. Mathias pointed out that the Ethiopian people had played a big part in funding the project in the hope of improving their living conditions and seeing the development for their country, adding that work should carry on “for the sake of the people” without causing any damage to Nile-sharing countries. Cardinal Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel, head of the Ethiopian Catholic Church, said that Ethiopia had “the right to develop its rivers in order to provide electricity for millions of its citizens, just like Egypt did. Egyptians are provided with electricity better than the Ethiopians. In our situation, students and families do not have electricity. “Upstream countries must know that the Ethiopian people do not have the intention to harm Egypt or Sudan,” he added. Ethiopian Islamic Affairs Supreme Council Secretary-General Sheikh Qassem Mohammed Tag El-Din also agreed that Ethiopia should carry on with building the dam “in the best interest of its people who are living in darkness and who do not have electricity. “Concerning the dam, we need to stand together in harmony and even make sacrifices if this is what it takes to complete the project,” he added. The tripartite negotiations, which have been stalled for several months, are close to resuming. The Sudanese Ministry of Irrigation announced that two separate meetings were recently held between Sudanese Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasser Abbas and his counterparts from Egypt and Ethiopia, Mohammed Abdel-Ati and Bekele, respectively. The ministry added that two members of the delegation from each country attended the meetings which had been set up to pave the way for fresh GERD negotiations. In a statement, Sudan’s irrigation ministry said that the ministerial meetings had followed recent talks held between Sudanese Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdok and his Egyptian and Ethiopian counterparts. Abbas Sheraqy, professor of water resources at Cairo University’s faculty of African studies, said Ethiopia’s attempts to return to the negotiation table to settle the GERD issue had swung between resumption and manipulation. He pointed out that Ethiopia was ready to resume GERD discussions despite having failed to attend the final day of the last round of negotiations in Washington in February last year, when it was due to sign an agreement, drafted by the US in collaboration with the World Bank, on the filling and operation of the dam. Ethiopia’s U-turn did “not befit a sovereign state that is a UN member under the pretext that it needed more consultations, as if nine years of negotiations were not enough,” he added. Sheraqy underlined the need to resume the talks in Washington and not to allow Ethiopia to cancel them which, he said, was its precondition to resuming them. He added that Ethiopia recently called for allowing downstream countries to attend the negotiations under the umbrella of the African Union. Addis Ababa, he noted, was aiming to waste time and further complicate the GERD issue and was pushing Egypt into a new issue with downstream countries. Egypt has stressed during its negotiations with Ethiopia the need to maintain its historic rights to the Nile waters. A 1929 treaty (and a subsequent one in 1959) gave Egypt and Sudan rights to nearly all of the Nile waters. The document also gives Egypt veto powers over any projects by upstream countries that would affect its share of the waters. Ethiopia launched construction in 2011 on the Blue Nile in the northern Ethiopian highlands, from where 85 percent of the Nile’s waters flow. One of Egypt’s main worries is that if the water flow diminishes, it could affect Lake Nasser, the reservoir further downriver, behind Egypt’s Aswan Dam. Ethiopia said that 73 percent of the GERD project had been completed. Its government is to start deliberations within a month on a date to start filling the dam.

Khartoum’s letter to the UNSC comes a few weeks after Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan agreed to resume the technical discussions on the GERD following months of disputes Sudan has urged the United Nations Security Council to encourage all parties with a stake in the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) to “refrain from any unilateral measures” that could affect regional and international peace and security. In a letter to the Security Council on Tuesday, Sudanese Foreign Minister Asma Abdalla explained Sudan’s position on the ongoing developments related to the dam, including an initiative adopted by Sudan to resume negotiations on the disputed dam with Egypt and Ethiopia. Sudan asked the Security Council to support its efforts to resume talks in good faith to reach a comprehensive agreement between all parties. The letter stressed Sudan’s principled decision on “negotiating in good faith,” to which it has committed during negotiations given its belief in the importance of a solid foundation for cooperation between the three countries. The letter listed some of the potential positive impacts of the mega-dam on Sudan, including the regulation of the flow of the Blue Nile, which would reduce annual floods during rainy seasons and enable the country to better manage its irrigation system. The dam will also increase the power generation from existing hydropower plants, and will increase the navigation depth of the Blue Nile, the letter added. On the other hand, listing the negative impacts of the dam, Sudan said that the GERD would completely change the flow of the Blue Nile by flattening its hydrograph. “With this gigantic size, the GERD risks causing significant negative impacts to Sudan if not properly designed, constructed, filled and operated,” reads the letter. “These impacts range from threatening the lives and safety of millions of Sudanese citizens living directly downstream from the GERD, to the operational safety of the Sudanese dams, to the flood-plain agricultural system of the country, and the socioeconomic and environmental impacts along the Blue Nile downstream from the main Nile River, all the way up to the border with Egypt," the letter added. “For the positive impacts to be realised and for the negative impacts to be mitigated there has to be an agreement in place with Ethiopia on how to fill and operate the GERD, otherwise the GERD stands to cause substantial risk to Sudan," Khartoum said. In the letter Sudan also requested the Security Council encourage all parties to refrain from taking unilateral actions such as filling the dam’s reservoir without reaching a comprehensive agreement. It also asked the Security Council to encourage the avoidance of any action which jeopardises “regional and international peace and security.” It also asks the UN council to support Sudan’s efforts and call upon all the parties to resume immediate negotiations in good faith with “the objective of resolving the pending issues and concluding a final comprehensive agreement.” Sudan also affirmed its commitment to the rules of international law stipulated in the UN’s Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. The rules mainly cover the equitable and reasonable use of watercourses and the obligation not to cause significant harm to other watercourses, and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. Khartoum’s letter a comes few weeks after Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan agreed to resume technical discussions on the mega-dam. The tripartite negotiations reached a deadlock in February after Ethiopia skipped a final round of talks in Washington, leading to a diplomatic war of words between Cairo and Addis Ababa. On 1 May, Egypt sent a memo to the Security Council blaming Ethiopia for trying to establish a deal without taking the interests of downstream countries, Egypt and Sudan, into consideration. Egypt rejected, along with Sudan, an Ethiopian proposal put forth last month amid the ongoing discord, wherein Addis Ababa proposed a “partial agreement” that would only cover the first stage of the filling. Addis Ababa told the Security Council in May in a letter sent in response to the Egyptian memo that it “does not have a legal obligation to seek the approval of Egypt to fill the dam.” Egypt has said it is ready for a revival of talks but stressed the importance of "serious and constructive” talks between the three countries’ irrigation ministers to contribute to a fair, balanced and comprehensive agreement that would preserve Egypt’s water rights and the interests of both Sudan and Ethiopia. Some 85 percent of the Nile water that reaches Egypt flows from the Ethiopian highlands, mainly from the Blue Nile. Egypt receives 55.5 billion cubic metres of water from the Nile annually, but requires over 80 billion cubic metres to cover its needs. Search Keywords: Short link:

The border between Ethiopia and Sudan is the scene of occasional fighting. Recent deadly skirmishes could however complicate matters between the two countries. Amid heightened tension along its border with Ethiopia, Sudan swore in a new defense minister. Major General Yassin Ibrahim Yassin was recalled from retirement to fill the position following the death of General Gamal al-Din Omar. Yassin's swearing-in came after an alleged Ethiopian cross-border attack which left at least one Sudanese soldier and a child dead, according to Sudan's military. Three Sudanese civilians and a soldier were also wounded. The attack, which took place in the eastern province of al-Qadarif, started after an Ethiopian militia group penetrated Sudan's border to fetch water at the Atbara river, Brigadier Amer Mohammed al-Hassan, a spokesman for the Sudanese military, said. "It is not clear exactly what triggered a flare-up of this long-standing border dispute. Sources suggest that Sudanese security forces may have responded to incursions by Ethiopian farmers, which in turn brought in Ethiopian security forces," William Davison, senior Ethiopia analyst at the International Crisis Group, told DW. The heavy exchange of fire reportedly left one Ethiopian militia wounded. "If these allegations are true, then it is an escalation," Kjetil Tronvoll, professor of peace and conflict studies and Research Director of International Studies at Bjorknes University College in Oslo, told DW. The border clashes flared up as Ethiopia and Sudan were preparing to meet in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, for a second round of talks aimed at resolving the border dispute. "There have been negotiations and they reached an understanding that most or all of this contested land can be under Sudan," Tronvoll said. "The interesting aspect is why there is new violence now and possibly also at a higher level than before." Sudan sent more troops along the border with Ethiopia to stop the incursions Image: picture-alliance/Photoshot/M. Babiker According to Sudan's military, tensions along the border between the two countries have recently heated up amid increasing attacks on Sudanese troops. Following the incident, Sudan summoned Ethiopia's envoy and urged the Ethiopian government to do all it can to end such border clashes. Ethiopia's call for diplomacy Ethiopia offered its "deep sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims of the conflict along the Ethiopia and Sudan border." Addis Ababa urged the two countries to pursue diplomacy as a means of resolving the border dispute saying there was no need for the countries to "descend into hostility". Last month, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent General Adam Mohamed Mahmoud, the country's military chief to Khartoum in a bid to ease the tensions. For Tronvoll, solving the dispute via diplomatic means is reasonable and should be encouraged. However, he said there could be more to the clashes. "There are various actors and processes within the region, and this is an opportune moment for some to ignite some tension between Sudan and Ethiopia," Tronvoll said. "Hopefully, the two sides can sit at the negotiating table and come to a conclusion." Sudan's ousted former president Omar al-Bashir had tolerated Ethiopia's encroachment along the border Image: Ashraf Shazly/AFP/Getty Images Root of Ethiopia-Sudan border dispute Sudan and Ethiopia share a common boundary that stretches over 1,600 kilometers (994 miles). The border was drawn following a series of treaties between Ethiopia and the colonial powers of Britain and Italy. However, to date, this boundary lacks clear demarcation lines. Sudan's al-Fashqa region which covers approximately 600 km, is a rich fertile land conducive for agriculture. For decades, Ethiopia has allowed its farmers to plant crops there. Former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir largely turned a blind eye to his country's territorial incursion. However, Sudan's transitional authorities, who took over after popular protests which eventually led to the ousting of al-Bashir, have initiated talks with Ethiopia in a bid to have to Ethiopian farmers withdraw. More Sudanese boots at the Ethiopian border For the first time in nearly 25 years, Sudan deployed its troops along the al-Fashqa border strip at the end March. This came after an attack which prompted a top security team to visit the area. "There are old problems. Herders have lost their livestock and farmers have lost their lands," Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, Chairman of Sudan's Sovereignty Council, said in an interview with the national network, Sudan TV, after touring the border region. Al-Burhan defended the troop deployment saying the armed forces were left with no choice but to protect their territory because the Ethiopians had imposed their presence. Sudan's military has vowed that it is willing and ready to protect its citizens and territory. Sudan's about-turn in Ethiopia's mega dam project The border dispute could complicate Ethiopia's plan to construct the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). On Wednesday, Sudan wrote to the UN Security Council calling on it to urge Ethiopia and Egypt, not to take unilateral action on the dam. Sudan had initially backed Ethiopia's project but later refused to sign on an initial agreement which would have paved the way for Ethiopia to begin filling the dam. Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam project has increased tensions along the River Nile Image: DW/Negassa Desalegen For Ethiopia analyst Davison, the border dispute has little to do with GERD. "Ethiopia and Sudan are holding regular discussions to prepare the ground for the resumption of trilateral GERD talks, so the process is restarting rather than stalled," Davison said. "It does not appear therefore that the border incident has caused a significant disruption to the negotiations." According to Davison, Sudan and Ethiopia need to ramp up their existing discussions over the borderlands in order to come to an understanding that will lead to a final resolution of the issue.

The border between Ethiopia and Sudan is the scene of occasional fighting. Recent deadly skirmishes could however complicate matters between the two countries. Amid heightened tension along its border with Ethiopia, Sudan swore in a new defense minister. Major General Yassin Ibrahim Yassin was recalled from retirement to fill the position following the death of General Gamal al-Din Omar. Yassin's swearing-in came after an alleged Ethiopian cross-border attack which left at least one Sudanese soldier and a child dead, according to Sudan's military. Three Sudanese civilians and a soldier were also wounded. The attack, which took place in the eastern province of al-Qadarif, started after an Ethiopian militia group penetrated Sudan's border to fetch water at the Atbara river, Brigadier Amer Mohammed al-Hassan, a spokesman for the Sudanese military, said. "It is not clear exactly what triggered a flare-up of this long-standing border dispute. Sources suggest that Sudanese security forces may have responded to incursions by Ethiopian farmers, which in turn brought in Ethiopian security forces," William Davison, senior Ethiopia analyst at the International Crisis Group, told DW. The heavy exchange of fire reportedly left one Ethiopian militia wounded. "If these allegations are true, then it is an escalation," Kjetil Tronvoll, professor of peace and conflict studies and Research Director of International Studies at Bjorknes University College in Oslo, told DW. The border clashes flared up as Ethiopia and Sudan were preparing to meet in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, for a second round of talks aimed at resolving the border dispute. "There have been negotiations and they reached an understanding that most or all of this contested land can be under Sudan," Tronvoll said. "The interesting aspect is why there is new violence now and possibly also at a higher level than before."

South Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation issued a statement resolving the controversy over its approval of Cairo's request to establish a military base near the Ethiopian border. The ministry announced in a statement on Wednesday that the information circulated on social media about this agreement is unfounded. The statement indicated that: "No agreement has ever been reached to allocate a land lot for an Egyptian military base in South Sudan." The ministry conveyed: "Both countries, Ethiopia and Egypt, are good friends of South Sudan, and cooperate to implement the reactivated agreement to resolve the conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, especially in the second chapter that deals with security arrangements, as well as contributing to combating the coronavirus pandemic." READ: Sudan calls on UNSC to prevent Ethiopia, Egypt taking unilateral decisions on dam The ministry pointed out that Ethiopia is helping to maintain peace and security in the border region of Abyei, in cooperation with the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), adding that: "These false allegations and propaganda are launched by the enemies of peace in the country, in order to disturb our relations with neighbouring countries and the entire region." The ministry mentioned that South Sudan is a: "Peace-loving country, and will continue to support peaceful coexistence with its neighbours, the region and the world for the mutual benefit of all." Juba TV reported that the government of South Sudan agreed to Egypt's request to build a military base in the Pajok region, where a military official was quoted as stating that the base would harbour about 250 Egyptian soldiers, to be ready for all possibilities related to the construction of the Renaissance Dam by Ethiopia. "The government of the Republic of South Sudan and the South Sudan Defence Forces agreed to allocate a land lot to our Egyptian brothers, who asked for a plot of land in eastern [South Sudan] to deploy their forces," Juba TV revealed. This came in line with the statement of the military official who indicated, on condition of anonymity, that this step will boost development in the country. In a related context, an official at South Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs disclosed that the land lot will only be used for development purposes that Egypt has pledged to provide to the smallest country in the world, noting that the Egyptians will use the land to boost a much-needed development in the Republic of South Sudan. READ: Sudan defends UN submission on Ethiopia dam South Sudan's News Now quoted an official in the Foreign Ministry as stating that: "Egypt is the only country in Africa that has been at our side for the past decade since we gained our independence." Earlier, Ethiopia announced its intention to start filling the reservoir of the Renaissance Dam this year, without prior agreement with Egypt and Sudan, which was rejected by the Egyptian authorities, submitting a memorandum to the Security Council. However, last Thursday Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopian minister of water, irrigation and energy, asserted that his country would not recognise Egypt's historical rights to the Nile's water.

In this file photo taken on December 27, 2019 a general view of the Saddle Dam, part of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Ethiopia, near Guba in Ethiopia. (AFP) Asharq Al-Awsat Sudan has called for the resumption of talks with Egypt and Ethiopia on the giant Blue Nile hydropower dam after the collapse of a US-led mediation effort earlier this year. Sudan's irrigation minister on Monday invited his Egyptian and Ethiopian counterparts to resume negotiations digitally on Tuesday "in order to reach a comprehensive and satisfactory agreement that meets the interests of the three countries." The three countries have been at odds over the filling and operation of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), under construction near Ethiopia's border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, which flows into the Nile river. The dam is the centerpiece in Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter but has sparked concerns in Cairo that Egypt's already scarce supplies of Nile waters, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted. Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt had been expected to sign an agreement in Washington on the filling and operation of the dam in February but Ethiopia skipped the meeting and only Egypt initialed the deal.

(AFP) Asharq Al-Awsat Sudan has called for the resumption of talks with Egypt and Ethiopia on the giant Blue Nile hydropower dam after the collapse of a US-led mediation effort earlier this year. Sudan's irrigation minister on Monday invited his Egyptian and Ethiopian counterparts to resume negotiations digitally on Tuesday "in order to reach a comprehensive and satisfactory agreement that meets the interests of the three countries." The three countries have been at odds over the filling and operation of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), under construction near Ethiopia's border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, which flows into the Nile river. The dam is the centerpiece in Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter but has sparked concerns in Cairo that Egypt's already scarce supplies of Nile waters, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted. Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt had been expected to sign an agreement in Washington on the filling and operation of the dam in February but Ethiopia skipped the meeting and only Egypt initialed the deal.

CAIRO: Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi strongly rebuked Ethiopia on Tuesday, accusing Addis Ababa of stalling negotiations over a mega-dam being built on the Nile and moving ahead with plans to start filling the reservoir before reaching a deal. “A timeline must be set to finish up negotiations, so it does not turn into a new tactic of stalling and shirking responsibility from the 2015 Declaration of Principles which all three countries agreed to,” El-Sisi’s office said in a statement. The agreement signed by Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan paved the way for diplomatic talks after Addis Ababa began construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam nearly a decade ago. The strongly-worded statement from El-Sisi’s office said Ethiopia’s position was “inconsistent” with its legal obligations and “casts a shadow over the negotiations.” It came on the day the three countries resumed talks, after Sudan on Monday coaxed Egypt back to the negotiating table. But Egypt said Tuesday the invite “comes three weeks too late” as Ethiopian authorities had already “signalled their intention to move forward with filling the reservoir of the Renaissance Dam without reaching an agreement.” Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told lawmakers on Monday that his country would stick to its plan to soon begin partial filling of the reservoir which can hold 74 billion cubic meters of water. “The dam is a project that will pull Ethiopia out of poverty. Ethiopia wants to develop together with others, not hurt the interests of other countries,” he said. In mid-May, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew accused Egypt of being obstructionist and said his country “does not have a legal obligation to seek the approval of Egypt to fill the dam.” Irrigation and water ministers from the three Nile basin countries began meeting via videoconference Tuesday along with three observers from the United States, European Union and South Africa. Following several failed rounds of negotiations, the United States and the World Bank sponsored talks from November 2019 aimed at reaching a comprehensive agreement. Both Khartoum and Cairo fear the 145-meter-high (480-foot-high) dam will threaten essential water supplies once the reservoir starts being filled in July as planned by Addis Ababa. But while Egypt, which is heavily dependant on the Nile, worries about its share of the water, Sudan hopes the dam could provide much-needed electricity and help regulate flooding. The 6,600-kilometer-long (3,900-mile) Nile is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to the 10 countries it traverses. Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Niles, converge in the Sudanese capital Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea.

Cairo - Khartoum - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein and Mohammed Amin Yassin Talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) were marred by disputes for the second consecutive day Wednesday. In two separate statements, the irrigation ministries of Egypt and Ethiopia agreed that talks, which would last until June 13, “did not produce any tangible results.” Cairo placed four conditions during the virtual meeting between the ministers of the three countries, including a call to Addis Ababa to declare it would take no “unilateral action” on filling the dam. The talks were held in the presence of observers from the European Union, the US and South Africa. Observers told Asharq Al-Awsat that the bumpy start of the negotiations and the insistence of Ethiopia not to heed the agreements reached in previous talks in Washington, are signs that there is no solution, and that the crisis is heading towards more escalation. Egypt says the reference for discussions should be the discussions held in Washington during talks brokered by the US and the World Bank in February. Egypt was the only country that initialed the document issued during the talks after the US failed to secure the signatures of Ethiopia and Sudan. Ethiopia has planned to start filling the reservoir of the dam in July. In a statement, the Sudanese irrigation ministry said that during Wednesday’s meetings the three countries expressed their viewpoints. The Egyptian delegation held to the February 21 document as the basis for negotiation, it said. It added that the three countries would continue negotiations to work on a consensual solution. Sudan has rejected a proposal by Ethiopia to sign a partial bilateral agreement for the initial filling of the dam. Nasreddine Allam, former Egyptian Minister of Water Resources, told Asharq Al-Awsat that Egypt’s negotiators would not tolerate Ethiopia’s intransigence and its attempt to bring talks back to square one. Hani Raslan, an expert on Sudan at Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, hinted at the “failure of the talks.” In a tweet, Raslan wrote that Ethiopia wants to destroy all what has been accomplished by insisting to start filling the dam next month.

News article:
A construction worker walks near the stop log section at Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam as it undergoes construction on the Blue Nile in Guba Woreda, Sept. 26, 2019. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt said Saturday that tripartite talks with Ethiopia and Sudan over a controversial mega-dam on the River Nile were deadlocked because of Addis Ababa's "intransigence". The Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam (GERD) has been a source of tension in the Nile River basin ever since Ethiopia broke ground on it nearly a decade ago. Ethiopia sees the dam as essential for its electrification and development, while Sudan and Egypt view it as a threat to essential water supplies. Mohamed al-Sebaie, spokesperson for Egypt's Water Resources and Irrigation Ministry, said he "is not optimistic about the prospects of achieving a breakthrough during the ongoing negotiations" on the dam in a press release posted to the ministry's Facebook page. This was due to "Ethiopia's intransigence which, once again, became abundantly clear during the ongoing meetings of the ministers of water resources of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan", he added. The strongly-worded statement follows days of negotiations over the project amid heightened urgency to reach a deal ahead of Addis Ababa's plans to start filling the dam in July. "Ethiopia's position is that Egypt and Sudan should either sign a text that would make them hostages to Ethiopia's will and whim or accept Ethiopia's decision to unilaterally fill the GERD," Sebaie's statement said. Talks between the irrigation and water ministers from the three Nile basin countries resumed Tuesday after a four-month hiatus along with three observers from the United States, European Union and South Africa. After several rounds of failed negotiations, the United States and the World Bank sponsored talks from November 2019 geared towards reaching a comprehensive agreement, after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi put in a request to US President Donald Trump. But the process ran aground after the Treasury Department urged Ethiopia to sign a deal that Egypt backed as "fair and balanced". Ethiopia's water ministry criticized Egypt on Thursday for detailing its grievances over the dam in a May letter to the UN Security Council. The 6,600-kilometer-long (3,900-mile) Nile is a lifeline supplying water and powering electricity in the 10 countries it traverses. Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Niles, converge in the Sudanese capital Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt and Sudan said talks over a controversial massive Nile dam would be resumed Monday, amid Egyptian accusations that Ethiopia has sought to scrap “all agreements and deals” they had previously reached, and that “many fundamental issues” remain rejected by Ethiopia, the third party to the talks. The construction of the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile, which is over 70 percent complete and promises to provide much-needed electricity to Ethiopia’s 100 million people, has been a contentious point among Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt, the three main Nile Basin countries. The three countries have been holding talks for years, without reaching a deal. Those talks came to an acrimonious halt in Feb. when Ethiopia rejected a US-crafted deal and accused the Trump administration of siding with Egypt. Ethiopia wants to begin filling the dam’s reservoir in the coming weeks, but Egypt has raised concerns that filing the reservoir behind the dam too quickly could significantly reduce the amount of Nile water available to Egypt. After months of deadlock, Sudanese, Egyptian and Ethiopian water and irrigation ministers resumed talks last week, with observers attending from the US, the European Union and South Africa, which is the current head of the African Union. Sudan’s Irrigation Ministry said Saturday’s talks focused on technical matters of the operating of the dam and the filling of its massive reservoir during rainy seasons, droughts and prolonged droughts. It said it will craft a draft paper based on Egyptian and Ethiopian notes to be discussed on Monday. Egypt’s Irrigation Ministry said the June 9-13 talks revealed the differences that remain with Ethiopia. These issues included Ethiopia’s “total” rejection of addressing technical issues related to “the mitigation measures for droughts and prolonged droughts and measures to address prolonged dry years," the ministry statement said. Ethiopia rejected to “the inclusion of a legally binding dispute resolution mechanism," it said. “Egypt reaffirmed that these are essential components in any agreement that relates to an existential matter that affects the lives of over 150 million citizens of Egypt and Sudan,” the statement said. Ethiopia’s Water and Energy ministry said the talks have achieved progress and they will result in “finalizing the process with a win-win outcome.” It said. Mohammed el-Sebaei, a spokesman for Egypt’s Irrigation Ministry, said Ethiopia rejected a Sudanese proposal last week that could be a basis for negotiations between the three countries. Instead, Addis Ababa introduced a “worrisome” proposal that included its vision on the dam’s operation. He said Ethiopia lacks the “political will” to compromise a deal, and wants Egypt and Sudan to “abandon their water rights and to recognize Ethiopia’s right to use the Blue Nile waters unilaterally and to fill and operate the Renaissance Dam in accordance with its vision.” “The proposal is not legally and technically sound,” he told reporters in Cairo. “It is a clear attempt to impose a fait accompli on my downstream country.” Both Egypt and Sudan rejected the Ethiopian proposal, he said. The Ethiopian ministry said el-Sebaei's comments were “regrettable.” The Blue Nile flows from Ethiopia into Sudan where it joins the White Nile near the capital, Khartoum, to form the Nile River. Eighty-five percent of Nile waters originate in Ethiopia from the Blue Nile, which is one of the Nile’s two main tributaries. Egypt last week called for Ethiopia to “clearly declare that it had no intention of unilaterally filling the reservoir” and that a deal that was prepared by the US and the World Bank in February serves as the starting point of the resumed negotiations. The US had crafted a draft deal in February after more than four months of talks, and said the final testing and filling of the dam “should not take place without an agreement.” The deadlock over the dam became increasingly bitter in recent months, with Egypt saying it would use “all available means” to defend “the interests” of its people.

News article:
Egypt may resort to the United Nations Security Council to prevent Ethiopia from taking a "unilateral step" on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the country's foreign minister announced yesterday. "Egypt has adhered to the approach of negotiating with the Ethiopian side and exercised sincere intentions to reach an equitable agreement for the two parties," Sameh Shoukry told reporters on the sidelines of a Canada Egypt Business Council conference. He added that Addis Ababa was "intransigent and evaded the negotiation". Shoukry pointed out that his country's recent negotiations with Sudan and Ethiopia had not yielded "positive results", adding that Egypt would "consider other options, such as the UN Security Council in order to prevent Ethiopia from taking unilateral action that could negatively affect Egypt's water rights." The dam is the centrepiece in Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter, but has sparked concerns in Cairo that Egypt's already scarce supplies of Nile waters, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted.

News article:
Egypt may resort to the United Nations Security Council to prevent Ethiopia from taking a "unilateral step" on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the country's foreign minister announced yesterday. "Egypt has adhered to the approach of negotiating with the Ethiopian side and exercised sincere intentions to reach an equitable agreement for the two parties," Sameh Shoukry told reporters on the sidelines of a Canada Egypt Business Council conference. He added that Addis Ababa was "intransigent and evaded the negotiation". Shoukry pointed out that his country's recent negotiations with Sudan and Ethiopia had not yielded "positive results", adding that Egypt would "consider other options, such as the UN Security Council in order to prevent Ethiopia from taking unilateral action that could negatively affect Egypt's water rights." The dam is the centrepiece in Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter, but has sparked concerns in Cairo that Egypt's already scarce supplies of Nile waters, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted.

News article:
Sudan's continued insistence on maintaining a neutral stance in the negotiations between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Renaissance Dam could be hindering rather than assisting the prospect of finding a resolution to the long running dispute. Despite the clear benefits the damn would bring to Sudan, Khartoum is walking a political tight rope in a bid not to offend Egypt or alienate Ethiopia. Online negotiations between the three countries have stalled in recent weeks as the deadline nears for Ethiopia's plan to begin filling the dam next month. Sudan has wavered between its two neighbours but is now siding with Egypt by insisting that negotiations have to be concluded before preparations to make the dam operative can begin. Ethiopia is hoping to begin filling the dam during its rainy season starting next month to allow operations for the Dam to start in 2021. The Ethiopian government is refusing to accept Egyptian claims that the dam will have a detrimental effect on the downstream water flow into Sudan and Egypt. According to the Ethiopians, the dam will resolve three major problems: electricity supply for its citizens; boost its nation development and generate foreign exchange through the sales of the electricity to its neighbours. READ: Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan to meet again amid strained talks over dam It is estimated that in the event Ethiopia fills the dam over a ten-year period, Egypt's Nile water flow could be reduced by 14 per cent. However, experts also suggest a speedier five-year target to fill the dam would result in a up to a 50 per cent loss with Egyptian arable farming land drying up as a result of desertification. Ethiopian commentators, Yonus Bira and Yohannes Gedamu, writing in an English language online news outlet – Fortune, accused Sudan, "of echoing Egypt's groundless suggestion that the design and the construction of the "gigantic" dam represents a serious threat to millions of its (Egypt's) population." As for Sudan, the dam would bring good news. First, it would prevent the loss of life and property that occurs every year when the Blue Nile river floods the surrounding areas in the rainy season. Second, it would transform Sudan's irrigation of crops and in turn improve production yields in areas close to the dam. Thirdly, it would also allow Sudan to benefit from the cheap electricity that would be produced by the dam's 6,000-megawatt output. However, international water law experts like Ahmed Mufti, a former Sudanese negotiator, believes in the long run Sudan would be the most adversely affected if it could not guarantee a long-term water security agreement through a legally binding agreement over the designated water shared between the three countries. Currently, Egypt and Sudan are abiding by a1959 agreement which allocates 55 billion of the total 84 billion cubic metres of water to Egypt and 18 billion to Sudan. The agreement also gives the two countries a veto over any upstream development. Ethiopia was never party to that agreement and protracted negotiations between the ten countries that share the Nile water broke down in 2010 when Egypt and Sudan walked out of the Entebbe Agreement. Egypt insist that those water levels have to be maintained. In a press conference yesterday, Sudan's Minister of Irrigation Yasir Abbas pointed out that Khartoum would not accept a unilateral decision by Ethiopia to begin filling the dam, or any unilateral decision taken by Egypt which plans to ask the United Nation's Security Council to intervene. The Sudanese stance seeks to strike a balance between the sides, but it means that its neutrality may be inadvertently maintaining the stand-off between Cairo and Addis Ababa. READ: Egypt, UK agree to enhance coordination on Ethiopia's dam Sudan's stance may be politically prudent, and credit has to be given to its Prime Minister, Hamdok for restarting the negotiations but experts are suggesting that the concentration of political interest around this issue is unlikely to ultimately bring long-lasting solutions. Professor Allam Ahmed of the World Association for Sustainable Development, criticised Sudan's stance and said there could be no real political solution. "I do not think that is the right way to solve the problem (politically), we need to look at the bigger picture, this is fundamentally a sustainable development issue, that should be left to the scientists and experts to resolve," he told Qatar-based Al Jazeera. The final sticking points yet to be resolved between the sides are three. An agreement on the water share, a consensus on the proposed length of the agreement and future agreements and an agreed mechanism to resolve disputes. In October 2019, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was widely misquoted as saying he was prepared to go to war against Egypt, when in fact his brief statement in parliament expressly stated that going to war would not be in the interests of any of the parties but nevertheless his words have only served to inflame tensions. Given the threats made by Egypt to destroy the dam and its movement of soldiers on the Eritrean border in 2018 thought to have been in preparation to attack the project, the prospect of open conflict is a genuine possibility in the absence of a comprehensive agreement. Sudan's government is hoping its conciliatory, sit on the fence, neutral tactics will help avert possible conflict but with just over ten days before Ethiopia's promised deadline to start filling the dam, the pressure on all sides to find a negotiated solution is building.

World Bank President David Malpass said on Thursday that he had discussed with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed the latest bank financing for the country, and its cooperation on water-sharing, in an indirect reference to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). “Important to unify the expensive dual exchange rate & that Ethiopia and its neighbors sustain constructive dialogue plus cooperation on water sharing” Malpass said on his official Twitter account. On Wednesday, the World Bank’s board approved $250 million in supplemental financing to Ethiopia, half as a grant and half as a loan. According to a press release from the bank, the supplemental financing will help to mitigate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis on the government’s reform agenda. The World Bank and the US administration sponsored a round of talks in the winter between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on the GERD’s filing and operation, but negotiations reached a deadlock in February as Ethiopia and Sudan did not sign the resulting draft agreement. On Wednesday, Egypt’s irrigation ministry said that a new set of negotiations that began this month had reached a deadlock after Addis Ababa refused to enter into a legally binding agreement on the controversial project.

News article:
Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam is seen as it undergoes construction work on the Nile. Reuters file photo Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein Negotiations over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) continued for the seventh day between Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan in hopes for reaching a solution to the legal points on water sharing. Cairo and Addis Ababa exchanged verbal accusations, with Egypt threatening to resort to the UN Security Council, and Ethiopia saying that Cairo’s position has become an obstacle in the ongoing talks. The negotiations were held via video conferencing with the participation of observers from the United States, the European Union, and South Africa, which is the current chair of the African Union. Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas announced that the three countries agreed on the majority of the technical issues. However, Egypt wants to sign a comprehensive agreement to fill and operate the dam, which Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, before beginning to fill the reservoir as scheduled in July. The Ethiopian Foreign Minister, Gedu Andargachew, accused Egypt of obstructing the negotiations, stressing that Cairo is only looking for its own interest. "Egypt came to the latest negotiation with one leg on the talks and another aimed at lodging a complaint to the UN Security Council," Andargachew said, according to state-owned Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). "Egypt wants to take everything for itself with no willingness to give," he was quoted as saying. On Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry warned that Cairo may resort to the Security Council to prevent Ethiopia from taking any “unilateral” action on the hydropower project if Addis Ababa remains "intransigent." He pointed out that the recent tripartite talks did not yield positive results due to the Ethiopian obstinacy. Meanwhile, informed sources said the countries agree on the technical issues relating to the safety of the dam, filling it during the upcoming Ethiopian rain season and in regular seasons, and drought management rules. However, differences remain on a number of legal matters such as mandatory clauses that ensure compliance and mechanisms to resolve disputes. Sudan suggested holding negotiations at the level of prime ministers if no agreement was reached, but Ethiopia and Egypt preferred to continue talks among water resources ministers and legal experts. In 2015, the leaders of the three countries signed an initial agreement on the Renaissance Dam to guarantee Egypt’s share of 55 billion cubic meters of the Nile water. Egyptian water expert Mohamed Nasreddine Allam said that the negotiations could end with one of three possible scenarios. He believes Ethiopia could hold onto its position, after which Egypt will announce the failure of the talks and warn Addis Ababa against filling the dam, further escalating the situation. Allam indicated that the second possible outcome could be that Ethiopia responds to the demands of Sudan and Egypt, and agrees to an initial agreement, or the final scenario, where Addis Ababa agrees to some of the demands and continues negotiating on other controversial issues which require additional time.

However, Egypt wants to sign a comprehensive agreement to fill and operate the dam, which Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, before beginning to fill the reservoir as scheduled in July. The Ethiopian Foreign Minister, Gedu Andargachew, accused Egypt of obstructing the negotiations, stressing that Cairo is only looking for its own interest. "Egypt came to the latest negotiation with one leg on the talks and another aimed at lodging a complaint to the UN Security Council," Andargachew said, according to state-owned Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). "Egypt wants to take everything for itself with no willingness to give," he was quoted as saying. On Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry warned that Cairo may resort to the Security Council to prevent Ethiopia from taking any “unilateral” action on the hydropower project if Addis Ababa remains "intransigent." He pointed out that the recent tripartite talks did not yield positive results due to the Ethiopian obstinacy. Meanwhile, informed sources said the countries agree on the technical issues relating to the safety of the dam, filling it during the upcoming Ethiopian rain season and in regular seasons, and drought management rules. However, differences remain on a number of legal matters such as mandatory clauses that ensure compliance and mechanisms to resolve disputes. Sudan suggested holding negotiations at the level of prime ministers if no agreement was reached, but Ethiopia and Egypt preferred to continue talks among water resources ministers and legal experts. In 2015, the leaders of the three countries signed an initial agreement on the Renaissance Dam to guarantee Egypt’s share of 55 billion cubic meters of the Nile water. Egyptian water expert Mohamed Nasreddine Allam said that the negotiations could end with one of three possible scenarios. He believes Ethiopia could hold onto its position, after which Egypt will announce the failure of the talks and warn Addis Ababa against filling the dam, further escalating the situation. Allam indicated that the second possible outcome could be that Ethiopia responds to the demands of Sudan and Egypt, and agrees to an initial agreement, or the final scenario, where Addis Ababa agrees to some of the demands and continues negotiating on other controversial issues which require additional time.

Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam is seen as it undergoes construction work on the Nile.

News article:
Talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on a dispute over a massive dam being built on the Nile by Addis Ababa ended in deadlock on Wednesday. Egypt said there was a lack of “tangible progress" on the issue. Cairo fears the hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile, which originates in the Ethiopian highlands, will reduce its share of the river’s water, which supplies more than 90 per cent of its needs. It is seeking a deal that would minimise the effect on its water supply and make provisions to protect its growing population from future drought. Ethiopia says the dam is essential to its development and accuses Egypt of clinging to colonial-era treaties that unfairly gave it access to most of the water without considering the needs of the 10 other Nile Basin countries. It regards Cairo’s demands as an infringement on its sovereignty. Mohammed Abdel Aty, Egypt’s Water Minister, blamed Ethiopia’s “intransigence” for the failure of the negotiations. Mr Abdel Aty said Addis Ababa resisted signing a deal that was binding under international law. Instead, he said, Ethiopia only wanted guidelines on the operation of the dam that it had the power to amend. Mr Abdel Aty said Ethiopia also rejected the creation of a binding legal process to settle disputes and refused to commit to effective measures for any future drought. It also wanted a free hand to proceed with more projects on the Blue Nile, he said. He said Ethiopia rejected a proposal for the prime ministers of the three nations to meet and search for solutions. “That led to the end of the negotiations,” Mr Abdel Aty said on Wednesday. There was no immediate comment from Ethiopia on the Egyptian charges and no word from any of the three nations on when negotiations would resume. Ethiopia has in the past rejected similar complaints from Egypt, claiming they were meant to exert pressure on its government to allow the dispute to be settled on an international forum. The latest round of negotiations was held on video conference because of the coronavirus pandemic. Representatives of the US, the EU and South Africa sat in on the meetings as observers. The talks, which began on June 9, were the first after Ethiopia in February refused to sign a deal sponsored by the US.

Expand Autoplay Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam under construction on September 26, 2019. Reuters But analysts believe such a step would be unlikely to further Egypt’s aims, even though its position on the dam dispute has gained international support in recent months. They say a military intervention to halt building works at the dam would be ineffective. Riccardo Fabiani, of the international Crisis Group, on Wednesday told an online briefing that an Egyptian strike was “the least likely scenario”. “Military intervention would not stop Ethiopia from completing the project," Mr Fabiani said. "At best it could delay it. “A military strike will reduce to zero the chance of a lasting, enduring and comprehensive agreement.” In an editorial in Cairo daily Al Shorouq this week, editor Imad Hussein, who is close to the Egyptian government, gave Addis Ababa a stern warning about bringing in international pressure. “It’s Ethiopia’s right to count on whoever it chooses, but it’s also our right to send them a simple and clear message: You will not see any development, stability or progress if Egypt’s water rights are hurt,” Hussein wrote. “We either enjoy stability, security and development together or you live with the consequences.” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi has described the dam dispute as an existential issue but has never spoken publicly about the possibility of military action. But Egypt will have its back to the wall if Ethiopia goes ahead with its threat to start filling the dam’s reservoir next month. Although unlikely, any military action by Egypt against Ethiopia would face challenges. The two countries do not share a border and any intervention would prove difficult to justify as a legitimate act of self-defence. The dam has been under construction since 2011 and is set to generate 6,000 megawatts of electricity when completed.

Tel Aviv resident Ruti Arenfeld says she’s attending the protest in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square to show solidarity with many of her friends who have lost their jobs as a result of the government’s crippling restrictions aimed at curbing the pandemic. “I’m not here to make a political statement. There are some who are trying to make this about Bibi’s corruption, but I think that’s a mistake,” she says as a man walks by her with a poster reading “corrupt ones go home,” next to a picture of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I’m here to call on the government to do what it has promised. To transfer the money to the wage workers and small businesses,” continues Arenfeld. “You told them to close and they did that. Now it’s your turn to help them before it’s too late,” she adds. While organizers billed the demonstration as apolitical, some of the protesters chant, “Bibi [Netanyahu], go home,” in what appears to represent the sentiment among many of the participants. Dozens of police officers are roaming in and around Rabin Square, with some of them playing a pre-recorded message asking protesters to abide the government’s coronavirus guidelines by remaining two meters apart from one another and wearing masks. — Jacob Magid

News article:
Hundreds of people demonstrated outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem on Friday, demanding that he resign over his indictment on corruption charges. It was the third such demonstration this week at the junction of Gaza Street and Balfour Street, the road where the Prime Minister’s Residence is located. A previous protest, attended by several thousand people on Tuesday, turned violent and dozens were arrested during clashes with police. Many of the protesters turned up in bathing suits and with beach towels in a dig at the Netanyahu government’s decision in principle to shut beaches from next weekend, saying his government is not only corrupt, but also chaotic and inept. Protesters held up signs, saying “A tsunami is coming” and pictures of dead fish with the caption the “stench of corruption.” Police blocked off parts of Gaza Street. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Among those taking part in the protest was former IDF chief of staff Dan Halutz. “Enough is enough,” he told the Walla news site. “I hope that the defendant who is sitting only a few hundred meters from here is listening.” “Before he destroys the country, we need to get him out of his position. His priority is defending himself and as far as he is concerned the country can burn and all the people can starve,” Halutz said. Advertisement The demonstration followed protests on Tuesday and Thursday. Although organizers had called for protesters to spend Thursday night sleeping on the sidewalk, police warned that the demonstration must end on time at 11 p.m. and that participants would not be permitted to sleep on the street. Nevertheless, about 100 people spent the night at the site. Organizers called the rallies a “Siege of Balfour” and said the event was also to protest the government’s plans to introduce weekend lockdowns and ban public gatherings as part of the efforts to halt the spread of the coronavirus. “Preventing public gatherings and applying a lockdown is only intended to free Netanyahu from the siege,” organizers said in a statement reported Thursday by Walla. Justice Minister Avi Nissenkorn indicated Friday that protests would still be able to go ahead despite any lockdown measures. Advertisement This weekend, there are no new restrictions on movement and beaches will remain open, subject to social distancing. But a tighter weekend lockdown is likely to take effect from Friday, July 24, including restrictions on movement. As of July 24, beaches are also set to be closed on weekends. While protests Thursday and Friday were relatively calm and ended without any reports of violent incidents, the memory of Tuesday’s clashes with police remained vivid in the minds of some protesters. “Tuesday was insane, huge, historic. We can’t recreate it, even if we wanted to. It was unreal. It was important to experience it to understand what happened,” said Sasha, a 19-year-old Jerusalem resident. “At one point I needed to hide behind an announcement board with a bunch of other people to avoid being attacked by cops on horseback. It was terrifying,” Sasha said. Thursday’s protest, by contrast, had an almost carnivalesque atmosphere. Young people intending to sleep at the protest, wearing pajamas and clutching teddy bears, sat in meditation circles on the ground. A handful of circus performers entertained the crowd by spewing fire from their mouths. An activist at the protest told The Times of Israel that she was planning a dawn yoga session for the sit-in. “Police came here today prepared for a violent protest. There were almost 20 police cars on the street by the afternoon, which was something that didn’t happen earlier, and they’ve erected those barricades on either side. But they’ve found instead a protest with very strong, positive energy,” Shimon, 59, told The Times of Israel. On Tuesday night, police used water cannons and officers mounted on horses to disperse several hundred people who blocked the Jerusalem light rail system after midnight, following a large protest outside the official residence. Several thousand people had gathered Tuesday evening calling on Netanyahu to quit over his indictment on corruption charges, as several separate social protests took place at the same time across the country. Advertisement Some of the demonstrators attempted to break through security barriers at the scene and clashed with police. As the protest ended, hundreds moved downtown, where they blocked the light rail system, chanting “shame, shame” and “Bibi [the prime minister’s nickname], go home.” Police then turned water canons on the demonstrators and mounted police charged up and down the light rail tracks on Jaffa Street, sending protesters scattering to the side of the streets before regrouping. Many then marched down Keren HaYesod Street, with some pushing garbage dumpsters and chain-link fences into the streets as makeshift barricades. Several dumpsters were set on fire. Police said one officer was lightly wounded and 50 protesters were arrested. The Jerusalem demonstrations are part of the ongoing “black flag” anti-corruption protests against Netanyahu, who is standing trial in a series of graft cases. Demonstrations have been held regularly around the country, with protesters waving signs reading “crime minister” and calling for Netanyahu to resign. Netanyahu faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases, as well as bribery in one of them. He has denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges are part of an effort by political opponents, the media, law enforcement and prosecutors to remove him from office.

At least 34 people were arrested when clashes broke out after midnight Tuesday as thousands of people gathered in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government’s policies. One woman sparked outrage after she posed topless on a statue of a menorah at a traffic circle near the Knesset (– not the iconic bronze Knesset Menorah). After largely peaceful protests during which the demonstrators marched to the nearby Knesset and back, police began forcibly clearing people from Paris Square outside Netanyahu’s home at about 1 a.m. Officers, assisted by mounted police and water cannons, grappled with demonstrators and at least 34 were arrested for breaking the peace and attacking officers, police said. All of those held were released Wednesday. Before that the demonstrations had a largely carnival mood. Many chanted “no to violence,” while others danced, sang and beat drums, threatening to stay in the streets all night. The protests brought together a wide range of groups with some demonstrators railing against the government’s handling of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and others calling for the premier to resign over his indictment on graft charges.

Many of the protesters marched from the Prime Minister’s Residence to the nearby Knesset after receiving police permission. Several protesters climbed on a statue of a menorah near the parliament building. One of the demonstrators posed topless atop the candelabra, provoking outrage from Knesset Speaker Yariv Levin, who called for her to be arrested. “Shame. I stand by every person’s right to protest, demonstrate and express their opinion,” Levin wrote on Facebook. “But no country allows you to desecrate its symbols of state.” Levin called for her to be “brought to justice, not just to punish her, but also for the educational and civil message that needs to be very clear.” Advertisement The protesters climbed on a sculpture of a menorah and a Star of David in a traffic circle just outside the Knesset and not on the iconic bronze Knesset Menorah, which is the state symbol. The unnamed woman told Nir Hasson, a reporter from the Haaretz newspaper, that she was a social work student. “Maybe now if I take off my shirt somebody will care about the social workers, it’s meant to change perceptions,” she said. Israel’s social workers appeared to have reached a deal with the Finance Ministry late Tuesday evening after several hours of negotiations, following a 16 day open-ended labor strike. Social workers have long complained of what they describe as an unreasonable workload, with low salaries and the constant danger of violence and their union made the decision to strike earlier this month after repeated negotiations with the government failed to produce a change in their working conditions. A small number of Netanyahu supporters held a counter-demonstration nearby and police closed off several roads around the Prime Minister’s Residence due to the protests. Advertisement Hebrew-language media outlets put turnout for the rallies at more than 2,000. Adjacent to the Prime Minister’s Residence, restaurateurs handed out food to passersby in protest of restrictions on eateries. Earlier Tuesday, the Knesset’s Coronavirus Committee reversed a cabinet decision that would bar restaurants from serving patrons on site, limiting them to takeout and delivery. Some 150 restaurant owners also demonstrated in Haifa against the closures forced upon them in recent months. The restaurateurs, Jewish and Arab and from various areas of northern Israel, blocked roads and called for compensation and for the government to “resign.” המושבה הגרמנית בחיפה. עשרות מסעדנים חסמו את הכביש הראשי שדרות בן גוריון. המחאה זולגת גם לחברה הערבית…אבל לאט לאט pic.twitter.com/7XH1f6baeG — Jack khoury.جاك خوري (@KhJacki) July 21, 2020 Tuesday’s protest followed several other recent demonstrations outside the Prime Minister’s Residence and elsewhere, amid growing discontent with Netanyahu over his handling of the pandemic and the economic fallout caused by government lockdown measures. A number of the rallies have seen the blocking of roads by demonstrators and clashes between police and protesters, including over the weekend in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Unemployment in Israel is at some 21 percent — or 850,000 people — and is rising, as restrictions imposed amid record daily coronavirus infections further batter the economy.

News article:
In a televised national address on Wednesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out parts of an economic-stimulus package intended to ease the financial burden of the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Yet in addition to outlining parts of a plan for jumpstarting the economy, Netanyahu addressed a growing phenomenon of left-wing civil unrest. “The conspiracy industry exists in Israel; it is simply unbelievable. I heard about a public representative who is calling for a civil rebellion,” he stated. The “public representative” is head of the opposition Yair Lapid. Not only is he agitating public demonstrations, but he has repeatedly warned that aggrieved citizens could turn violent. In an interview with Reuters week, Lapid stated that: “We are talking to people who are becoming more and more desperate and angry, who feel, and rightly so, that the country has deserted them at their hardest hour.” “We are trying to be responsible … to calm things down, telling people, ‘You know violence is not the answer,’ ” he said. “But it’s getting harder by the day … I sympathise with the anger and I also worry about the possibility of violence as a result of this anger. What I am trying to do is not to encourage it but to raise a red flag as to what might happen.” A few days earlier, Lapid told Maariv, “It is going towards violence. People are in despair because they don’t have what to eat.” Just days after Lapid’s remarks, more than 10,000 Israelis joined a protest in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square on Saturday night against the government’s handling of the economic fallout of the pandemic. Almost on cue, the protest turned violent with various acts of vandalism, including the setting ablaze of garbage dumpsters. A brick was thrown through the window of a local bank branch. Three officers were lightly injured, and 12 protesters were arrested. While Saturday night’s protest was the largest to date over the past several months, it was not limited only to financially aggrieved small business owners and recently unemployed Israelis. Rather, it was the most recent installment of an ongoing series of “black flag” protests led by Israel’s political opposition, aimed specifically at destabilizing a nation already weathering health and financial crises. Various protests have focused on protecting democracy, protecting the environment, protecting Israel’s Supreme Court, opposing Israel’s application of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, and most prominently, dealing with Netanyahu’s criminal proceedings. Printed posters at nearly all of the protests accuse Netanyahu of being the “Crime Minister.” On Tuesday night, just three days after the larger Tel Aviv event, a separate smaller protest outside the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem—themed around Netanyahu’s criminal proceedings—turned violent. Fifty protesters were arrested. The prime minister’s residence has been the stage of multiple protests over the past several weeks. One of the protest organizers, former Israeli Air Force Gen. Amir Haskel, who was arrested for disturbing the peace at a protest two weeks ago, recently told The Media Line that “I took to the streets for the first time back in 2016,” over what he called Netanyahu’s “attacks on the democratic foundations of Israel.” “We have one demand, which is that Netanyahu resign,” said Haskel. He explained the tactics of recruiting Israelis disenfranchised over other issues and joining with them, stating, “We cooperate with all of these movements, and gladly.” One of Haskel’s fellow protesters, Sadi Ben Shitrit, who began protesting “about two years ago,” said that “dictatorships are never toppled in the parliament or in the government. They’re toppled in the streets.” He insisted that “it’s a matter of a few months. He can’t stay. Pretty soon his own base, when they get hungry [because of the pandemic and resulting high unemployment], they’ll come out against him. It’ll be chaos in the streets.” Yet Ben Shitrit also mimicked some of the most disturbing political discourse of the past several months, stating, “They can only shut me up in one way: with a bullet to the head. If that’s what it takes, I’m willing to pay that price.” These shocking statements are part of an ongoing theme of hateful and dangerous speech that has gone on for months without censure. At another protest outside the prime minister’s residence, protester Haim Shadmi was accused of threatening the life of Netanyahu’s son Yair. Protesters blasted a recording outside the residence saying of Netanyahu’s son, “We know why you need bodyguards, one day we will find you when they are away, [that would be] a pity!” At the time, the prime minister filed a formal complaint with police stating “the incitement among the radical left crossed all red lines. These are real threats to the life of my son, threats that cannot be ignored.” Lapid responded to Netanyahu’s complaint, tweeting, “Netanyahu is filing all these complaints because this is his method: To threaten, incite, lead to violence and then claim he’s a victim. Always playing the victim and whining.” Back in May, when Netanyahu’s trials first began, Lapid said: “There was a coup attempt yesterday, and it was led by Netanyahu. He tried to attack the police, the prosecution, the courts, the media. He tried to threaten his judges. The moment he drags his ministers to the court with him, incites his followers, tries to lead us towards a civil war, then he can’t be allowed to remain in office.” “Israel changed yesterday. It won’t be the same. A serving prime minister was put on trial. His trial didn’t start with a presentation of the evidence, it started with wild incitement against the rule of law, against the courts … ,” said Lapid. “He knows it will end in violence, but he doesn’t care.” Lapid’s opposition partner, far-left Meretz Party chair Nitzan Horowitz, similarly accused Netanyahu of “incitement” for questioning the legitimacy of the unprecedented legal cases against Israel’s longest-serving premier. “The inciters, led by Netanyahu, must know that if God forbid blood is spilled here, they’ll be responsible,” stated Horowitz. This dangerous rhetoric did not start with Netanyahu’s trial. It was a constant theme of his (and then political ally turned foe Benny Gantz) electoral attempt to unseat Netanyahu. After the prime minister warned against the left-wing’s plans to form a minority government with self-proclaimed anti-Zionist Arab parties, Lapid stated: “The words coming out of Netanyahu’s mouth in the past few days are incitement to violence. They are words spoken by followers of Baruch Goldstein, not by a prime minister. It will end badly. He knows it will end badly. He’s been there.” Goldstein was a Jewish doctor who murdered 29 Arabs and injured 125 others while inside a mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron in 1994. Back in November, when Gantz was still running together with Lapid, the prime ministerial challenger spoke at a rally commemorating the 24th anniversary of the murder of Yitzhak Rabin. The former prime minister was assassinated at the same site as last week’s “financial” protests. At the memorial, he, too, subversively accused Netanyahu of stirring incitement that could lead to bloodshed. “Twenty-four years, Yitzhak Rabin is no longer with us, but incitement raises its ugly head … and hatred has again become a dangerous weapon in the hands of politicians without limits,” said Gantz. These dangerous sentiments, which have now become commonplace in Israel’s political dialogue, do not represent in any way the sentiments of everyday Israelis. And with the exception of the financial protest in Tel Aviv, which managed to successfully recruit normal Israelis hurt by the financial damage of coronavirus restrictions, most of the protests are attended primarily by radicals whose political views sit at the far-left fringe of Israel’s diverse political spectrum. Pictures of the protests do not show proud Israelis hurt by the coronavirus, but anarchists seeking to destabilize Israel in the same way manner that recent racial protests turned violent in the United States. And while Netanyahu has correctly warned against the dangers of a minority left-wing government backed by Arab parties and questioned the legality of the criminal proceedings against him, he has never called for—or even mentioned—the possibility of violence. While rolling out his financial stimulus this week, he stated, “I want you to understand: Israel is a free democracy. Freedom of expression and protest are reserved for every person and group, certainly in times of economic distress such as this. But the revolt … this is real danger,” adding that the recent scenes in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are “not just a protest, that is legitimate. We saw violence against police and against civilians. This violence deserves all condemnation.” He warned that Israelis “must not talk about civil rebellion. We cannot fall into gratuitous hatred. We cannot fall into hating our brothers. … We cannot go there. We must behave in exactly the opposite manner. We must deepen the unity between us. We must watch our own. I believe that with joint forces, we will fight the coronavirus and defeat it.” Reprinted with author’s permission from Jewish News Syndicate

News article:
Following controversy over the deployment of water cannons to disperse demonstrators calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s resignation at a demonstration Thursday night, police waited longer and used somewhat different tactics to disperse Saturday’s anti-Netanyahu crowds. At least 5,000 demonstrators gathered to call for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in front of the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem, the largest protests seen since the rallies began two weeks ago. (Channel 13 put the Jerusalem turnout at 10,000, and said it was the largest demonstration of its kind to date.) Earlier in the day, protesters also gathered on around 250 overpasses across the country, as well as in front of Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea. Police repeatedly stipulated that the demonstrators in Jerusalem, who filled Paris Square near the Prime Minister’s Residence, could continue to protest until 11 p.m. when they would be ordered to disperse. But thousands of demonstrators remained in the square past the deadline on Saturday, cheering as the clock struck 11. The police force, which has been criticized for what some say is excessive use of force during previous rallies, waited until later in the night than usual to forcefully compel protesters to clear the area. Police sources told Channel 12 news that they had no intention of using stronger tactics against demonstrators, despite the reported pressure of Public Security Minister Amir Ohana. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms More than an hour and a half after the deadline had passed, the vast majority of protesters had left the square, leaving several hundred who seemed determined to remain until police dispersed them. Unlike Thursday, Jerusalem police still did not publicly declare the demonstration illegal and order protesters to leave the scene. The operation to clear the square on Saturday night began at around 1 a.m. Rather than inaugurate the dispersal by blasting protesters with a water cannon, as on previous nights, Jerusalem police instead opted to first surround the crowd as they stood in Ben Maimon Street in front of a police barricade. Dozens of riot police, known in Hebrew as Yassam, repeatedly entered the crowd, pushing demonstrators aside, to drag out individual protesters, sometimes aggressively and seemingly at random. Some of those dragged out appear to have been immediately released without being detained. Advertisement Police later said 12 people were detained or arrested for “various offenses included disturbing public order or attacking other protesters.” The number seemingly included members of a pro-Netanyahu group reportedly detained for beating up activists leaving the Jerusalem rally. (This compared with 55 arrests at Thursday night’s demonstration.) Ranks of Yassam officers broke the demonstration in two, as officers closer to the Prime Minister’s Residence began pushing the crowd away. A Magen David Adom medic pleaded with officers to be allowed through to reach demonstrators farther down the street, but were refused access. Four mounted police arrived behind the Yassam officers and charged demonstrators, riding up onto the sidewalks and forcing the crowd back into Paris Square. When some demonstrators still refused to leave, two water cannons were deployed on the scene, sending protesters fleeing down Agron Street. At least a hundred riot police followed them; at times it seemed as though there were as many Yassam officers as protesters walking in two waves away from the square. As police pushed protesters down Agron Street in a mass, the crowd began chanting slogans again as the remnants of the demonstration coalesced again into a march. As riot police watched in formation from higher up the street, the two water cannons rolled down Agron Street and fired on protesters again, sending blasts into alleys where some demonstrators were attempting to take shelter from the high-pressure water behind dumpsters. “Despite legitimate protest by most protesters, who dispersed voluntarily, a handful of protesters remained who refused to disperse after the police repeatedly announced the end of the protest and asked the protesters to leave voluntarily. The police were eventually forced to disperse them and restore public order,” the Jerusalem Police said in a statement. Advertisement Oren, a 28-year-old Jerusalem resident who has attended several demonstrations at Paris Square, said that he had seen an overall escalation in the police’s use of force from protest to protest. “It becomes an attempt to suppress the protesters, to threaten them and to scare them, so they won’t even want to protest in the first place,” Oren said. While police have used water cannons at several protests since the mass demonstrations began two weeks ago, a video published by Channel 12 brought renewed controversy over the tactic. The video showed a water cannon firing directly at a protester’s head during a demonstration last week, and striking him in the face with a blast of high-pressure water, his head snapping back violently as he was thrown to the ground. Targeting the heads of protesters with water cannons violates police procedure, which state that “at no point are water cannons to spray in the direction of protesters’ heads for fear of traumatic injury to sensitive areas.”

Visiting an IDF command post near the northern border, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns Hezbollah and its Iranian patron against testing Israel, the day after an apparent skirmish on the Blue Line. “All that is happening now is the result of an attempt to establish a military foothold in our area by Iran and its satellites in Lebanon,” Netanyahu says. He accuses Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah of serving Iranian interests on backs of the Lebanese state. “I don’t suggest anyone test the IDF or Israel. We are determined to defend ourselves,” he adds. Netanyahu indicates Israel will continue its bombing campaign in Syria meant to thwart Iran and says the country is “prepared for an scenario.” The apparent Hezbollah attack on Monday, in which a group of terrorists infiltrated into Israel, according to the IDF, was seen as revenge for a bombing near Damascus last week in which a member of Hezbollah was killed.

Hundreds of Israelis on Wednesday once again protested in front of prime minister's home in Jerusalem by reading the prayer of Tisha B'Av, an annual fast day on which a number of disasters in Jewish history occurred, including the distruction of the biblical temples. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Israelis have been demonstrating in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence for weeks, calling on the leader to resign over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing corruption trial. 3 View gallery A sitting rally in Jerusalem ( Photo: Yoav Dudkevitch ) The protest was organized by "Darkenu," Israel's largest non-partisan civil society movement. The group's CEO, Yair Fink, said the protest symbolizes how today's Israel is being destroyed just like the two temples. "We came here tonight to make sure our beloved home is not destroyed again," he said. "Our previous home was destroyed because of corruption, extremism and violence and we, the moderate majority, must stand up, take to the streets and defend our home." Among the demonstrators was the grandson of former Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, who served as Israeli leader from 1963 to 1969.

News article:
TEL AVIV (JTA) — Noam Ofer might have been an unlikely candidate to join Israel’s burgeoning protest movement. At 76, he is older than most of the people who have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. He also doesn’t share the political views of many of the protesters. But Ofer was there anyway on Tuesday evening marching outside the Tel Aviv home of Israel’s internal security minister in charge of law enforcement, Amir Ohana, who was caught on tape pressuring a senior police official to ban demonstrations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “He’s trying to illegally shut down protests,” Ofer said. “I came because the minister said that we’re all on the left. I’m on the right. He said we are anarchists, but the only ones creating anarchy are the ones around Netanyahu.” Ofer’s perspective reflects the deep and bipartisan frustration that many Israelis are feeling about the country’s leadership nearly six months since Israel recorded its first coronavirus case. Thousands of Israelis have been staging loud protests for weeks, mostly outside the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem, but also in Tel Aviv and other spots across the country. Some commentators have called it the country’s largest grassroots movement since 2011, when hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested the cost of living. After drawing international praise for how he efficiently imposed a strict and effective lockdown, Netanyahu acknowledged earlier this month to reopening Israel too soon. Cases have risen sharply, restrictions have been reimposed and unemployment is near its all-time high. Stimulus checks from the government have fallen short of their promised amount. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s trial on three corruption charges has been delayed for a second time — after Ohana, in his previous stint as justice minister, shut down courts amid the pandemic in March, effectively postponing legal proceedings against the prime minister. The demonstrations have reenergized those who have been calling out Netanyahu in recent years over his legal problems and what they perceive as his goal to weaken democratic institutions like the judiciary. The result is a movement made up of Israelis across the political spectrum, whose numbers seem to be growing every week. Police were bracing for large rallies Thursday night with the end of the Tisha B’Av observance. As the protests have widened in focus, demonstrators have faced harsh crackdowns by police, who have drawn criticism for using water cannons and tear gas. Many at Tuesday evening’s protests, which was organized by the anti-Netanyahu Black Flag movement, said they were incensed by Ohana’s statement to Doron Yadid, the commander of the Jerusalem police district — a recording of which was leaked in the media — that he didn’t “understand why we don’t ban” anti-Netanyahu protests. “I want to challenge the ruling of the court,” Ohana said, referring to a recent ruling allowing the protests to go ahead, generating widespread anger and prompting President Reuven Rivlin to issue a public statement declaring that the right to protest “must not be harmed.” Ohana is “trying to cancel protests and circumvent the law,” complained Maor, a 25-year-old law student from the coastal city of Ashdod who said he had attended a number of demonstrations outside the prime minister’s residence and had been “subject to police violence” for engaging in civil disobedience. “It was brutal, they used a water cannon against me,” he said, describing how he was shot with a high pressure water jet while participating in a sit-in. “I bruised my ankle. I couldn’t work for two days.” Another protester, Eliana Barbel, showed off a large bruise on the back of her leg as she described her experience at a protest last week that ended in violent clashes with police. “I was arrested on Thursday. I was hit and arrested and spent the night in jail for protesting,” Barbel said. “When I was arrested, the cops were very violent. I was sitting on the ground and three riot policemen picked me up and took me. “They want to scare us, but this will only bring more people out,” she added, holding up a sign decrying violence against Arabs, haredi Orthodox, Ethiopians and leftists, and promising to continue to protest even “if I’m arrested 10 times.” Echoing a theme that has emerged in recent American Black Lives Matter protests that have faced police crackdowns, Efrat Safran, a 57-year-old dual American-Israeli citizen from Ramat Hasharon, carried a sign bearing the slogan “Mothers Against Police Violence.” Safran said she was ready to protect younger protesters from the police with her own body. “We’re trying to save democracy,” she said. While the crowd protesting near Ohana’s apartment was overwhelmingly secular, Pinchas, 30, a haredi attorney from Bnei Brak, a largely ultra-Orthodox city, said he decided to come out because “government corruption is dangerous to all of us, including the haredim.” Tuesday night’s protest was marked by tense but not violent exchanges with police. (Five protesters reportedly were hospitalized after being attacked, the Black Flag movement said, by individuals not associated with the police.) After several hours, the protesters drifted away from the zone marked out for them by law enforcement and began marching down a nearby road, stopping traffic and eventually running into a line of policemen backed up by mounted officers. Large groups of protesters eventually began making their way back, trying to circumvent the police and reach Ohana’s apartment building, leading to several clashes during which officers shoved several people, leading to renewed chants of “no to violence.” As police and protesters faced off, the mounted officers repeatedly rode up to the edge of the crowd trying to force its members back. Most of the marchers began to walk through the city, snarling traffic as they made their way through a series of Tel Aviv landmarks, including the square in front of the Habima Theater and the popular Dizengoff Center shopping mall.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz clashed at Sunday’s cabinet meeting, with the premier accusing protesters against him of “trampling on democracy,” while the Blue and White chief responded that people had a right to demonstrate and must be protected. “I condemn any violence. It has no place, on either side, and we have zero tolerance for any manifestation of violence or any threat of violence,” Netanyahu said at the meeting. “I see an attempt to trample on democracy. There is a distortion of all the rules. Nobody restricts the demonstrations. On the contrary — they are accommodating toward them,” he said. But, he added, “it’s a coronavirus incubator, there are rules that are not enforced, no one restricts it and no one has even tried to restrict it.” No outbreaks have so far been traced back to the protests. “These demonstrations are fueled by a media mobilization, the likes of which I don’t remember before,” the premier declared. “They are encouraged, allowed to paralyze neighborhoods and block roads, in stark contrast to everything that was accepted in the past.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The prime minister continued his protest of media coverage of the events, saying: “I condemn the one-sidedness of most media outlets. They do not report the demonstrations — they participate in them. They add fuel. “There has never been such a distorted mobilization — I wanted to say Soviet but it has already reached North Korean terms — of the media in favor of the protests,” he said. Netanyahu said the media ignored “wild and unfettered incitement, including daily calls — including the day before yesterday — to murder the prime minister and his family.” Advertisement Gantz, who also serves as alternate prime minister, responded to Netanyahu at the meeting emphasizing his belief that the right to demonstrate is the “lifeblood of democracy” and condemning violence against protesters. “As a government, we have a responsibility to allow the demonstrations to take place and to protect the demonstrators, who were unfortunately attacked yesterday.” Gantz said he discussed the issue with Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, adding that he reiterates his call “for everyone to refrain from violence, and for the Israel Police to act with the minimum force necessary to maintain the law.” The latest Jerusalem rally on Saturday night drew some 10,000 participants, according to estimates. It was by and large peaceful. Five people were taken into custody for allegedly accosting those protesting against Netanyahu and 12 people were detained at the end of a protest after police said they refused to vacate the area. Protesters have for weeks been holding regular rallies outside the Prime Minister’s Residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, as well as in Tel Aviv and other areas, calling on the premier to resign due to his indictment on corruption charges. They have been joined in recent weeks by people protesting the government’s economic policies during the coronavirus pandemic, with crowds in the thousands and rising. Advertisement Netanyahu has protested media coverage of the protests, which he claims blows them out of proportion. On Saturday night, he again lashed out at TV news stations, as his Likud party accused the major networks channels 12 and 13 of “delivering propaganda for the anarchist left wing demonstrations.” “They are desperately trying to brainwash the public, in order to bring down a strong prime minister from the right,” Likud wrote in a post retweeted by Netanyahu. Netanyahu further accused the media of “ignoring the violent nature of the protests and the calls within them to murder the prime minister and his family.” The premier is on trial for a series of cases in which he allegedly received lavish gifts from billionaire friends and traded regulatory favors with media moguls for more favorable coverage of himself and his family. He has denied any wrongdoing, accusing the media and law enforcement of a witch hunt to oust him from office. Also Sunday, Science and Technology Minister Izhar Shay of Gantz’s Blue and White party called on Netanyahu to publicly calm the tensions. “The prime minister must take responsibility and calm things down,” Shay told the Ynet news site. “I do not know where this is going, but it is clear that the public is showing its heart. We’ve insisted on the ability of the Israeli public to demonstrate [despite the coronavirus pandemic], that the basic democratic right should be in every law and regulation. Some are against us, and we respect that.” An estimated 10,000 people packed Jerusalem’s Paris Square Saturday night to call for Netanyahu’s resignation, in the largest-yet rally by a burgeoning anti-government movement that has brought activists, many of them young and newly politically active, to the streets. Tensions were especially high after a number of earlier protests saw attacks by suspected assailants against protesters. Advertisement Police allowed the protesters to remain in the square until around 1 a.m. but, once most people had left on their own, began calling for the remaining group to leave. Eventually officers were deployed to physically remove the remaining core of demonstrators and 12 people were detained or arrested, police said. Another protest was held outside Netanyahu’s private home in the coastal town of Caesarea, while thousands waved flags and chanted against the premier on bridges and highway overpasses across the country. Hundreds also gathered at Charles Clore park in Tel Aviv to protest the government’s economic policies during the coronavirus pandemic. The demonstrators dispersed from each of those rallies without major police intervention. Agencies contributed to this report.

News article:
Israel is roiling with angry street protests that local observers have warned could erupt into open civil strife – a development Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be encouraging. For weeks, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have been the scene of large, noisy demonstrations outside the official residences of Mr Netanyahu and his public security minister, Amir Ohana. On Saturday night around 13,000 marched through Jerusalem shouting “Anyone but Bibi”, Netanyahu’s nickname. Their calls were echoed by tens of thousands more at locations across the country. Turnout has been steadily growing, despite attacks on demonstrators from both the police and Netanyahu’s loyalists. The first protests abroad by Israeli expats have also been reported. The protests, in defiance of physical distancing rules, are unprecedented by Israeli standards. They have bridged the gaping political divide between a small constituency of anti-occupation activists – disparagingly called “leftists” in Israel – and the much larger Israeli Jewish public that identifies politically as on the centre and the right. For the first time, a section of Netanyahu’s natural supporters is out on the streets against him. In contrast to earlier protests, such as a large social justice movement that occupied the streets in 2011 to oppose rising living costs, these demonstrations have not entirely eschewed political issues. The target of the anger and frustration is decidedly personal at this stage – focused on the figure of Netanyahu, who is now Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. Protesters have renamed him Israel’s “crime minister”. But also fuelling the protests is a larger mood of disenchantment as doubts grow about the state’s competence to deal with multiple crises unfolding in Israel. The virus has caused untold social and economic misery for many, with as much as one fifth of the labour force out of work. Netanyahu’s supporters in the lower middle-classes have been hit hardest. Now well into a second wave, Israel has a per capita rate of infection that outstrips even the US. The shadow of a renewed lockdown amid government mishandling of the virus has undermined Netanyahu’s claim to be “Mr Security”. There are concerns too about police brutality – starkly highlighted by the killing in May of an autistic Palestinian, Eyad Hallaq, in Jerusalem. Police crackdowns on the protests, using riot squads, undercover agents, mounted police and water cannon, have underlined not just Netanyahu’s growing authoritarianism. There is a sense too that the police may be ready to use violence on dissenting Israelis that was once reserved for Palestinians. After manipulating his right-wing rival, the former military general Benny Gantz, into joining him in a unity government in April, Netanyahu has effectively crushed any meaningful political opposition.

News article:
Fire and rescue services say arson balloons launched by terrorist organizations over the Gaza border ignite at least 19 fires in southern Israel. It is the 10th consecutive day of fires, which mostly cause damage to brush and agricultural areas. The balloons, which sometimes carry explosive devices, have sparked well over 100 fires in Israel in the past week. The IDF bombed Hamas targets in Gaza over the past four nights in response to the attacks. Israel also closed its cargo crossing into the Gaza Strip for all goods except food and humanitarian supplies, and reduced Gaza’s allowed fishing zone to pressure Hamas to rein in the balloons. Israel’s Thursday normalization agreement with the UAE ratcheted up tensions in the Palestinian territories, sparking protests in Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank, and an outcry from the Palestinian leadership.
