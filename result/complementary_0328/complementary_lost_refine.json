The image outlines the process of how the INSTEX system would operate. It shows that Iran would export goods to the EU, such as pistachios, and receive payment in euros through a bank in the EU. The EU would then use the funds to purchase goods from Iran, such as medicine. The transactions would be conducted without involving Iranian banks, which could face US sanctions."
