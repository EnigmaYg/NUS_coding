News article:
KABUL (Reuters) - Efforts to negotiate a peace deal to end the 17-year war in Afghanistan, already beset by disagreement about the agenda, are facing a new hurdle over the venue for the talks. FILE PHOTO: Zalmay Khalilzad, former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, listens to speakers during a panel discussion on Afghanistan at the Conservative Political Action conference (CPAC) in Washington, February 12, 2011. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo Last week, Taliban leaders called off a fourth round of talks with U.S. officials in the Arab Gulf state of Qatar due to an “agenda disagreement”, and refused to allow “puppet” Afghan government officials to join. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, is holding talks with regional powers and was expected to meet the Taliban in the coming days. But diplomatic sources said differences over the venue had caused a delay. “Saudi Arabia and the UAE (United Arab Emirates), have made it clear that they will not participate in the peace talks if the meeting takes place in Qatar. But the Taliban insists on holding them in Qatar,” said a Kabul-based diplomat whose country shares a border with Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab nations severed ties with Qatar in 2017, alleging that Doha funded militants and had close ties to Iran. Qatar denied funding militants, but restored diplomatic relations with Iran after the crisis with its neighbors. Washington has pushed the Gulf nations to end their dispute at a time when their support is crucial in talks with the Taliban. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who stopped in Doha on Sunday during a Middle East tour, said the rift between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors had gone on for too long. The Taliban this month pushed to shift the venue for the talks from Saudi Arabia to Qatar in a bid to fend off Riyadh’s bid to include the Afghan government in them. “Differences between Saudi Arabia and Qatar have in fact damaged our peace process. The Saudis unnecessarily put pressure on us to announce a ceasefire which even the U.S. delegation didn’t pursue,” a Taliban leader, who declined to be named, told Reuters. The Saudi and UAE embassies in Kabul declined to comment. The Afghan government said on Monday that attempts to introduce bilateral rivalries were an added complication for the peace process. “Unfortunately, the kind of rivalry which has started between the regional countries about the peace process has proved harmful to Afghanistan,” Mujiburrahman Rahimi, a spokesman for Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah was quoted as saying by Tolo News, Afghanistan’s largest private broadcaster. The tensions underscore what diplomats say is a lack of consensus among powers in the region, whose support is crucial for long-term peace in Afghanistan. “There is a whole load of posturing. They are not monolithic,” a Western diplomat in Kabul said of Afghanistan’s neighbors. A senior Iranian diplomat said holding the peace talks in Saudi Arabia would be unacceptable to Tehran. “The U.S. officials want the venue to be in Saudi Arabia, but we are not comfortable,” he said. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid declined to confirm the date or location of the next meeting, though a senior Taliban source told Reuters it could take place on Tuesday. The Taliban regards the United States as its main adversary in the Afghan war and views direct talks with Washington as a legitimate effort to seek the withdrawal of foreign troops before engaging with the Afghan government. “Even though there are a number of discussions, there’s nothing particularly formal or structured or substantive to them,” said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center. “It’s very easy to get sidetracked, and it’s easy for the Taliban to back out when it feels any one discussion doesn’t serve its interests,” he said.

News article:
Iran and the Taliban have long had their ups and downs. In 1998, the two sides nearly came to a direct clash when Taliban forces killed Iranian diplomats, though the incident ended without a major conflict. However, the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the fear of a resurgent ISIS in Afghanistan and water issues have prompted Tehran to ramp up its engagement with the Taliban. This tactical alliance will enable Iran to further expand its influence in Afghanistan. Iran has had covert contacts with the Taliban, the most dangerous terror group in Afghanistan, for many years. But recently, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), went public with the relationship, claiming that contacts had been made with the aim of “curbing the security problems in Afghanistan.” The announcement came as a surprise not because the public was unaware of Iran’s secret relations with the Taliban, but because Tehran has always tried to keep its ties to terror groups an “open secret” in an attempt to maintain plausible deniability. Why did Tehran decide to go public about the Taliban connection now? Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories A review of the relationship’s history may help to explain the mullahs’ thinking. During the period of Taliban rule, Iran saw the group as a threat to its interests. The two sides almost came to a direct clash in September 1998, when Taliban forces kidnapped and killed nine Iranian diplomats, and one journalist, in the Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) vowed revenge and prepared to launch an all-out attack. But the crisis ended without a major clash, perhaps due to the fear that Islamabad would retaliate in support of the Taliban or that Afghanistan might become a quagmire for Iranian forces similar to that experienced by the Soviet Union in 1979-89. The 2001 U.S.-led military operation that led to the collapse of Taliban rule prompted the Iranian leadership to reconsider its original calculation and recalibrate its approach. It welcomed high-level Taliban figures who escaped to Iran (e.g., Abdul Qayum Zakir and Mullah Naim Barich) and began extending support to Taliban fighters. While the two sides are on different ends of the religious spectrum, Tehran views the Taliban as a useful point of leverage against the United States. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a NATO force composed of American, British, Canadian and other troops, was created by the United Nations in 2002 and tasked with training the fledgling Afghan army and protecting the government of Hamid Karzai and his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The Iranian regime viewed the ISAF with concern, as it feared that the United States might use Afghanistan as a base from which to launch a kinetic attack on Iran. The Taliban insurgency thus became viewed by Tehran as a tool with which to keep American forces preoccupied. To assist in the Taliban’s fighting of the ISAF, Iran allowed the Afghan terror group to open an office in Tehran and invited its leaders to attend a two-day International Islamic Unity Conference held by the World Forum for Proximity of Islamic Schools of Thought in Tehran. Iran’s support for the Taliban did not terminate even when President Barack Obama assured the mullahs that the military option was no longer official U.S. policy towards Iran. Intelligence reports indicate that Tehran’s military and financial support for the Taliban has in fact escalated ever since. Afghan military officials have accused the Revolutionary Guards of providing military, financial, and logistical support to the terror group, to the extent that Tehran’s support enabled the Taliban to capture districts in western Afghanistan, including the provinces of Farah and Ghor, and the Taywara district. There are also reports indicating that Quds Force operatives had a “physical presence” in Ghor assisting Taliban fighters in their offensive against the central government. Fighting ISAF was only one of the goals of the Quds Force in Afghanistan. Drug smuggling from Afghanistan to Iran has been a profitable business for the Quds Force, which is known for its extensive ties to drug cartels in South America. In 2012, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (DOT) designated Brig. Gen. Gholamreza Baghbani, the chief of the Quds Force in the Zahedan office, a narcotics trafficker. The DOT document noted that in return for Iranian business, Afghan traffickers moved weapons to the Taliban. Financial incentives aside, the emergence of ISIS in Afghanistan, especially in provinces that border Iran, such as Herat, Farah and Nimruz—rattled the Iranian regime, prompting the leadership to ramp up its engagement with the Taliban. Unlike Al Qaeda and the more malleable Taliban, the radical anti-Shi’ite ISIS poses a real threat to Iran’s interests in Afghanistan. Providing better training for the Taliban was thus not only a way to undermine the American-led ISAF, but a barrier to a new ISIS caliphate across the Afghan border. Various reports indicate that the IRGC created a training camp in South Khorasan province (Khorasan Jonobi) to train Taliban fighters, providing them with weapons and explosives. The Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation (Komite Emdad Imam Khomeini) in the same province is said to be donating untold amounts of capital to the terror group in addition to calling for volunteers to fight alongside Taliban forces. Some observers have directly linked improvements in the Taliban’s performance, and ISIS’s consequent inability to establish a strong foothold in Afghanistan, to Iranian support. Since mid-2017, Taliban and ISIS forces have regularly clashed in eastern Nangarhar province, with the Taliban easily defeating ISIS thanks to the military support it has received from the Quds Force. As one commentator put it, the “scale, quality and length of training is unprecedented and marks not only a shift in the proxy war between the United States and Iran in Afghanistan, but also a potential change in Iran’s ability and will to affect the outcome of the Afghan war.” Other commentators have noted that Iran’s backing of the Taliban’s assaults on government forces were linked to water issues. Iran has been attempting to enable the Taliban to derail energy projects that are currently under construction, namely the Poze Lich Hydropower plant in Ghor, and the Bakhshabad and Salma dams in the neighboring province of Farah and Herat, respectively. The construction of these dams, which would massively boost local energy and water supplies, is not acceptable to Iran. On July 5, 2017, President Hassan Rouhani declared that Iran “cannot remain indifferent to the issue [water dams], which will damage our environment.” According to Rouhani, “construction of several dams in Afghanistan would affect Khorasan and Sistan-Baluchistan provinces,” and Tehran “is not going to stand idly by.” It is worthy of note that the publicizing by Iran of its ties to the Taliban came days after reports appeared on talks between the United States and the Taliban over proposals for a ceasefire in Afghanistan. Iran is sending a message to Washington and Kabul that if its concerns are not addressed, it can sabotage any attempt at a permanent peace in Afghanistan. Certainly, given Iran’s ties to the Taliban and the new regional arrangements (i.e., Trump’s decision to withdraw half of U.S. forces from Afghanistan), Iran will be able to further expand its political, economic and sectarian influence in that country.

But the crisis ended without a major clash, perhaps due to the fear that Islamabad would retaliate in support of the Taliban or that Afghanistan might become a quagmire for Iranian forces similar to that experienced by the Soviet Union in 1979-89. The 2001 U.S.-led military operation that led to the collapse of Taliban rule prompted the Iranian leadership to reconsider its original calculation and recalibrate its approach. It welcomed high-level Taliban figures who escaped to Iran (e.g., Abdul Qayum Zakir and Mullah Naim Barich) and began extending support to Taliban fighters. While the two sides are on different ends of the religious spectrum, Tehran views the Taliban as a useful point of leverage against the United States. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a NATO force composed of American, British, Canadian and other troops, was created by the United Nations in 2002 and tasked with training the fledgling Afghan army and protecting the government of Hamid Karzai and his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The Iranian regime viewed the ISAF with concern, as it feared that the United States might use Afghanistan as a base from which to launch a kinetic attack on Iran. The Taliban insurgency thus became viewed by Tehran as a tool with which to keep American forces preoccupied. To assist in the Taliban’s fighting of the ISAF, Iran allowed the Afghan terror group to open an office in Tehran and invited its leaders to attend a two-day International Islamic Unity Conference held by the World Forum for Proximity of Islamic Schools of Thought in Tehran. Iran’s support for the Taliban did not terminate even when President Barack Obama assured the mullahs that the military option was no longer official U.S. policy towards Iran. Intelligence reports indicate that Tehran’s military and financial support for the Taliban has in fact escalated ever since. Afghan military officials have accused the Revolutionary Guards of providing military, financial, and logistical support to the terror group, to the extent that Tehran’s support enabled the Taliban to capture districts in western Afghanistan, including the provinces of Farah and Ghor, and the Taywara district. There are also reports indicating that Quds Force operatives had a “physical presence” in Ghor assisting Taliban fighters in their offensive against the central government. Fighting ISAF was only one of the goals of the Quds Force in Afghanistan. Drug smuggling from Afghanistan to Iran has been a profitable business for the Quds Force, which is known for its extensive ties to drug cartels in South America. In 2012, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (DOT) designated Brig. Gen. Gholamreza Baghbani, the chief of the Quds Force in the Zahedan office, a narcotics trafficker. The DOT document noted that in return for Iranian business, Afghan traffickers moved weapons to the Taliban. Financial incentives aside, the emergence of ISIS in Afghanistan, especially in provinces that border Iran, such as Herat, Farah and Nimruz—rattled the Iranian regime, prompting the leadership to ramp up its engagement with the Taliban. Unlike Al Qaeda and the more malleable Taliban, the radical anti-Shi’ite ISIS poses a real threat to Iran’s interests in Afghanistan. Providing better training for the Taliban was thus not only a way to undermine the American-led ISAF, but a barrier to a new ISIS caliphate across the Afghan border. Various reports indicate that the IRGC created a training camp in South Khorasan province (Khorasan Jonobi) to train Taliban fighters, providing them with weapons and explosives. The Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation (Komite Emdad Imam Khomeini) in the same province is said to be donating untold amounts of capital to the terror group in addition to calling for volunteers to fight alongside Taliban forces. Some observers have directly linked improvements in the Taliban’s performance, and ISIS’s consequent inability to establish a strong foothold in Afghanistan, to Iranian support. Since mid-2017, Taliban and ISIS forces have regularly clashed in eastern Nangarhar province, with the Taliban easily defeating ISIS thanks to the military support it has received from the Quds Force. As one commentator put it, the “scale, quality and length of training is unprecedented and marks not only a shift in the proxy war between the United States and Iran in Afghanistan, but also a potential change in Iran’s ability and will to affect the outcome of the Afghan war.” Other commentators have noted that Iran’s backing of the Taliban’s assaults on government forces were linked to water issues. Iran has been attempting to enable the Taliban to derail energy projects that are currently under construction, namely the Poze Lich Hydropower plant in Ghor, and the Bakhshabad and Salma dams in the neighboring province of Farah and Herat, respectively. The construction of these dams, which would massively boost local energy and water supplies, is not acceptable to Iran. On July 5, 2017, President Hassan Rouhani declared that Iran “cannot remain indifferent to the issue [water dams], which will damage our environment.” According to Rouhani, “construction of several dams in Afghanistan would affect Khorasan and Sistan-Baluchistan provinces,” and Tehran “is not going to stand idly by.” It is worthy of note that the publicizing by Iran of its ties to the Taliban came days after reports appeared on talks between the United States and the Taliban over proposals for a ceasefire in Afghanistan. Iran is sending a message to Washington and Kabul that if its concerns are not addressed, it can sabotage any attempt at a permanent peace in Afghanistan. Certainly, given Iran’s ties to the Taliban and the new regional arrangements (i.e., Trump’s decision to withdraw half of U.S. forces from Afghanistan), Iran will be able to further expand its political, economic and sectarian influence in that country.

News article:
Alwaght – Iran and Afghanistan, neighbors with the same language, have always had a close political and cultural relationship. But recently some sides appear to seek to sow division between the two neighbors while they are experiencing a considerable growth of bilateral closeness. While the top senior Iranian officials, including foreign minister, the national security council chief, and deputy foreign minister the visited the Central Asian nation to show full support to the central government and backed talks with the Taliban as a solution to the decades-long crisis, some internal groups in Afghanistan, mainly those with proximity to the Western sides and mainly the US, have brought accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The suspicious anti-Iranian accusations The anti-Tehran allegations come while Iran and Afghanistan work towards further progress in their bilateral ties. Some analysts argue that the allegations against Iran serve Trump administration’s scheme to put a maximum pressure against the Iranian government. The charges surround the Iranian support for talks between Kabul and the Taliban militant organization. The allegations drew a reaction from the Afghan foreign ministry spokesman. Iran is under fire by a suspicious propaganda campaign for its advocacy of peace talks in the war-hit nation while now key regional players, including Pakistan, the UAE, and Qatar, and even the international actors, like the US and India, are for the idea of Kabul-Taliban negotiations. Now, the US government envoy to Afghanistan Zalmy Khalil is busy talking to the Taliban representatives in the UAE and Qatar. The Indian army chief said last week that New Delhi considered direct contacts to the insurgent organization. With this in mind, taking stances against similar measures by Iran look quite unusual and are in line with the anti-Iranian postures of the US and Saudi Arabia, both the main architects of the militant organization in the 1980s, one nurturing it and the other supporting the group financially. Recently, the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in an interview with an Indian TV channel said the Taliban should be allowed some weight in the future Afghanistan government but added that this weight should not give the group the lead in the country’s politics. Zarif, answering a question about the role of the militant group in the Afghan future, said that the Afghan people should be allowed to determine whom they want. Having in mind that the Iranian diplomats see a key place for the people in the determination of the future, baselessly accusing Tehran of working against the Afghan interests only plays into the hands of an American-designed scenario, especially that the Iranian contacts to the other Afghan groups come with full knowledge of the Afghan government. Iran’s legitimate concerns It should be noted that Iran has the legitimate right to be concerned about the future of peace and stability in Afghanistan, a country sharing deep cultural and lingual roots with Iran. Iran shares 1,000 kilometers of borders with Afghanistan, something giving Tehran every right to put emphasis on the Afghan security which is its own security. A look back to the 1980 and 1990s makes it clear that the war and instability in Afghanistan meaningfully affected Iran. In the early 1980s when the Soviet Red Army invaded Afghanistan, over 3 million people fled into Iran. When the US invaded Afghanistan in 2001, Iran once again suffered the humanitarian consequences of the Afghanistan occupation. So, political stabilization of Afghanistan will positively reflect on the eastern Iranian borders. This is the main drive behind the Tehran advocacy to the advancement of peace in Afghanistan in a process covering all Afghan groups. Iran is among the rare countries that fully accomplished its commitments to the Afghan government. Tehran has been one of the key investing sides in Afghanistan over the past few years. The investment covered infrastructural projects, including agriculture, bridge and road building, health, and energy. One example is the $4-billion Khaf-Herat railroad project that connects eastern Iran to western Afghanistan. The project is crucial to Afghanistan, a landlocked country. The heavy investment in Afghanistan highlights the need for sustainable peace and growth in the war-ravaged country and strong Iran-Afghanistan ties which are the priority in the Iranian policy of helping peace proceed. Cracking Iran-Afghanistan bonds Iran is working for peace in Afghanistan and, So far, has offered the largest-scale supports to strengthen the Kabul government. Furthermore, Iran hosts a considerably large number of Afghan refugees whose presence in the country boosts the cultural bonds between the two nations. But, apparent enough, Iran’s role in Afghanistan, no matter how much constructive, is opposed to by the US, an occupying power with thousands of troops on the Afghan soil. As the recent developments display, the US Department of State goes to great lengths to block further closeness of the neighbors. Washington is worried that once its forces quit Afghanistan, Kabul leaders, remembering the past aids, lean towards Tehran. Such a fear energizes pro-division efforts by the US that also can be tracked in the recent anti-Iranian remarks by some Afghan sides.

News article:
The recent flurry of shuttle diplomacy towards reconciliation with the aim to bring peace to the war-torn Afghanistan had generated hopes and smiles on the otherwise bruised and fractured Afghan society in particular and Pakistan in general. Rounds of talks have been going on for the last few weeks with the US, Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the Taliban as major players, while the Afghan National Unity Government and India remained out of the pail. Ignoring the government in Kabul caused despair among various stakeholders on both sides that is Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly the Pakhtun nationalists and democrats.Hopes to hammer out peaceful resolution through dialogue, efforts of Zalmay Khalilzad notwithstanding, appears to have hit a snag when the Taliban refused to accept the joining of the Afghan government’s delegation to the parleys in Qatar. Already a number of analysts and leaders, such as Asfandyar Wali Khan, familiar with history and outcome of such negotiations, were skeptical. The reason being that keeping out a segment of public leaders, particularly Pakhtun nationalists, was not only bound to create suspicion and concerns but also seemed elusive.Before analysing the current events, it is necessary to recap the archives of such dialogues and their outcomes on the region after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union. The 1998 Geneva Accords were negotiated between the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan but unfortunately the major guarantors failed to honour their main provisions regarding ending military support to the warring groups. The current euphoria about the reconciliation reverberates the same optimism and hopes of the international interlocutors, amidst refusal of mujahideen to hold talks with Dr Najeebullah-led government even after the withdrawal of Soviet Army. Trying to reach a reconciliation, Dr Najeeb offered his adversaries major concessions, including declaring a six-month unilateral ceasefire, approving a new constitution that recognised Islam as the state religion, introducing an electoral and multiparty system, implementing economic reforms to respect private property, granting amnesty to opposition leaders, releasing more than 16,000 political prisoners, and offering the opposition half of the posts in a government of national reconciliation. In such a backdrop, the team of those negotiators attempted to reach a peace agreement between the mujahideen and the Communist government in Kabul in early 1990. Finally, main divergent mujahideen groups through their representatives inked a political power-sharing compromise, commonly known as the “Peshawar Accords” in April 1992. However, the acrimony between key personalities and the parties they represented resulted in a civil war with devastating effect on the country. Ultimately, the power vacuum so created was filled by the forceful entry of the Taliban. Again, we saw the US in a new role when its own strategic interests and social order came under attack. They entered Afghanistan with boots on ground with the basic aim to dismantle centres of terrorism and to incapacitate al Qaeda. Hillary Clinton, the former US foreign secretary, said, “We also have a history of moving in and out of Pakistan. Let’s remember here the people we are fighting today, we funded 20 years ago. We did because we were locked in struggle with Soviet Union. They invaded. We did not want to see them control Central Asia. We went to war. We said, ‘pretty good idea! Let’s deal with the ISI, the Pakistan’s military. Let’s recruit mujahideens. Let’s bring Saudi Arabia, importing their brand of Islam, so we can beat and they retreated. What we sow we would harvest.’ We left. So we thus left Pakistan, we said, ‘OK you deal with the stingers we left all over your country. You deal with the mines along the border’.”If history is to teach lessons then all such events of the past suggest that superpowers have their own strategic interests to achieve and all their moves centre on that. The US has, in its own wisdom, incapacitated the al Qaeda network which is no longer considered strong enough to threaten their vital national interests and social order. However, other regional players with their own interests have jumped into the arena to have their share of the pie. With this object in mind, these players are also banking on the Taliban while they consider the IS another radical group as a threat which has to be counter-balanced by the Taliban. Reports from various sources suggest that the Taliban are in a belligerent mood trying to advance their influence on ground using the negotiating table as part of the tactics. After nearly three decades, we are at square one. The immediate withdrawal of the US, without bolstering the National Unity Government with the presence of neutral forces to the satisfaction of all stakeholders, may plunge the country into chaos. We have to be mindful that the Afghan society is multidimensional. The Taliban are not their real face but a gun-toting militant force. Therefore, only appeasing them will never curry favour with other segments of society who believe in diversity and accommodation of all cultural identities and religious groups. Projecting the Taliban as the sole player within Afghanistan is a departure from the path of reconciliation as it neglects other major players within society. Though the Taliban with their grand strategy are harping to end US occupation and giving assurances to the US about their future concern. However, those associated with their mindset know very well that their ultimate aim is to capture power. Once they broker agreement and become part of the government, their influence is likely to grow. The Taliban, with guns in hand and freedom to move in all directions, will provide no free choice to those sitting on the sidelines. As such they will have to switch loyalty to them. Such a situation will be at the cost of participatory democracy, human rights and gender equality.Published in The Express Tribune, January 23, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

Let’s deal with the ISI, the Pakistan’s military. Let’s recruit mujahideens. Let’s bring Saudi Arabia, importing their brand of Islam, so we can beat and they retreated. What we sow we would harvest.’ We left. So we thus left Pakistan, we said, ‘OK you deal with the stingers we left all over your country. You deal with the mines along the border’.”If history is to teach lessons then all such events of the past suggest that superpowers have their own strategic interests to achieve and all their moves centre on that. The US has, in its own wisdom, incapacitated the al Qaeda network which is no longer considered strong enough to threaten their vital national interests and social order. However, other regional players with their own interests have jumped into the arena to have their share of the pie. With this object in mind, these players are also banking on the Taliban while they consider the IS another radical group as a threat which has to be counter-balanced by the Taliban. Reports from various sources suggest that the Taliban are in a belligerent mood trying to advance their influence on ground using the negotiating table as part of the tactics. After nearly three decades, we are at square one. The immediate withdrawal of the US, without bolstering the National Unity Government with the presence of neutral forces to the satisfaction of all stakeholders, may plunge the country into chaos. We have to be mindful that the Afghan society is multidimensional. The Taliban are not their real face but a gun-toting militant force. Therefore, only appeasing them will never curry favour with other segments of society who believe in diversity and accommodation of all cultural identities and religious groups. Projecting the Taliban as the sole player within Afghanistan is a departure from the path of reconciliation as it neglects other major players within society. Though the Taliban with their grand strategy are harping to end US occupation and giving assurances to the US about their future concern. However, those associated with their mindset know very well that their ultimate aim is to capture power. Once they broker agreement and become part of the government, their influence is likely to grow. The Taliban, with guns in hand and freedom to move in all directions, will provide no free choice to those sitting on the sidelines. As such they will have to switch loyalty to them. Such a situation will be at the cost of participatory democracy, human rights and gender equality.Published in The Express Tribune, January 23, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
The recent flurry of shuttle diplomacy towards reconciliation with the aim to bring peace to the war-torn Afghanistan had generated hopes and smiles on the otherwise bruised and fractured Afghan society in particular and Pakistan in general. Rounds of talks have been going on for the last few weeks with the US, Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and the Taliban as major players, while the Afghan National Unity Government and India remained out of the pail. Ignoring the government in Kabul caused despair among various stakeholders on both sides that is Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly the Pakhtun nationalists and democrats.Hopes to hammer out peaceful resolution through dialogue, efforts of Zalmay Khalilzad notwithstanding, appears to have hit a snag when the Taliban refused to accept the joining of the Afghan government’s delegation to the parleys in Qatar. Already a number of analysts and leaders, such as Asfandyar Wali Khan, familiar with history and outcome of such negotiations, were skeptical. The reason being that keeping out a segment of public leaders, particularly Pakhtun nationalists, was not only bound to create suspicion and concerns but also seemed elusive.Before analysing the current events, it is necessary to recap the archives of such dialogues and their outcomes on the region after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union. The 1998 Geneva Accords were negotiated between the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan but unfortunately the major guarantors failed to honour their main provisions regarding ending military support to the warring groups. The current euphoria about the reconciliation reverberates the same optimism and hopes of the international interlocutors, amidst refusal of mujahideen to hold talks with Dr Najeebullah-led government even after the withdrawal of Soviet Army. Trying to reach a reconciliation, Dr Najeeb offered his adversaries major concessions, including declaring a six-month unilateral ceasefire, approving a new constitution that recognised Islam as the state religion, introducing an electoral and multiparty system, implementing economic reforms to respect private property, granting amnesty to opposition leaders, releasing more than 16,000 political prisoners, and offering the opposition half of the posts in a government of national reconciliation. In such a backdrop, the team of those negotiators attempted to reach a peace agreement between the mujahideen and the Communist government in Kabul in early 1990. Finally, main divergent mujahideen groups through their representatives inked a political power-sharing compromise, commonly known as the “Peshawar Accords” in April 1992. However, the acrimony between key personalities and the parties they represented resulted in a civil war with devastating effect on the country. Ultimately, the power vacuum so created was filled by the forceful entry of the Taliban. Again, we saw the US in a new role when its own strategic interests and social order came under attack. They entered Afghanistan with boots on ground with the basic aim to dismantle centres of terrorism and to incapacitate al Qaeda. Hillary Clinton, the former US foreign secretary, said, “We also have a history of moving in and out of Pakistan. Let’s remember here the people we are fighting today, we funded 20 years ago. We did because we were locked in struggle with Soviet Union. They invaded. We did not want to see them control Central Asia. We went to war. We said, ‘pretty good idea! Let’s deal with the ISI, the Pakistan’s military. Let’s recruit mujahideens. Let’s bring Saudi Arabia, importing their brand of Islam, so we can beat and they retreated. What we sow we would harvest.’ We left. So we thus left Pakistan, we said, ‘OK you deal with the stingers we left all over your country. You deal with the mines along the border’.”If history is to teach lessons then all such events of the past suggest that superpowers have their own strategic interests to achieve and all their moves centre on that.

US, Taliban May Have Reached Accord on Troop Exit, VOA Told By Ayaz Gul January 26, 2019 The United States and the Taliban may have agreed on a plan for American troops to leave Afghanistan, sources privy to the development told VOA Saturday. In return, the insurgent group has given assurances that no international terrorist groups would be allowed to use Afghan soil to threaten America or any other country in the future. The understanding is the outcome of nearly a week of intense, uninterrupted dialogue between U.S. and insurgent representatives in Doha, Qatar. Representatives of the host government and Pakistan also have been in attendance. The sources told VOA they expected the two negotiating sides to announce the withdrawal plan by Monday at the latest, if all goes as planned. The U.S. drawdown plan would require the Taliban to observe a cease-fire. Both the withdrawal and the cease-fire, however, will be "limited and conditional." Sources did not rule out the possibility that President Donald Trump might announce and give details of the final agreement with the Taliban at his State of the Union speech, whenever that is scheduled. The U.S. special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, has been leading the American side in what observers describe as an unprecedented engagement between the two adversaries in the 17-year-old war. Still work to do Khalilzad tweeted late Saturday that after six days in Doha, he was headed to Afghanistan for consultations. "We have a number of issues left to work out. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and 'everything' must include an intra-Afghan dialogue and comprehensive cease-fire," he said. Khalilzad described his meetings in Doha as "more productive than they have been in the past" and added that the two sides had made "significant progress on vital issues." He did not elaborate and said the talks would resume shortly. Late Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet, "Encouraging news from @US4AfghanPeace (Khalilzad). He reports significant progress in talks with the Taliban on #Afghanistan reconciliation." He added later, "The U.S. is serious about pursuing peace, preventing #Afghanistan from continuing to be a space for international terrorism & bringing forces home. Working with the Afghan gov't & all interested parties, the U.S. seeks to strengthen Afghan sovereignty, independence & prosperity." Shortly after Khalilzad's tweets, the Taliban issued their own statement, saying the negotiations "revolving around the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and other vital issues saw progress." "The policy of the Islamic Emirate [the Taliban] during talks was very clear – until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon, progress in other issues is impossible," the group noted. But the issues under consideration are of "critical nature and needed comprehensive discussions," the group said. The Taliban added that the two sides would share details of the Doha meetings and receive guidance from their "respective leaderships" before they reconvened to discuss "unsolved" matters to find an "appropriate and effective solution." The Taliban statement did not explain further. Sources told VOA they believed the agreement on a conditional and limited withdrawal and cease-fire would give both sides an opportunity to test the waters "without taking too huge a political risk." Pakistan takes credit Officials in Pakistan took full credit for persuading the Taliban to engage in the dialogue at the U.S. request. "Pakistan's success is that it has sincerely and faithfully diverted the recent positive environment and energy in its relations with the U.S. to the complete benefit of the Afghan peace process, and Afghanistan as a whole," a senior official told VOA as the talks progressed in Doha. Islamabad insists a peaceful Afghanistan is key to Pakistan's future security and economic stability as well as those of the region in general. Pakistani officials believe any agreement at this stage will help bridge the trust gap between the U.S. and the Taliban and will "add much needed political capital" to Washington's account to achieve the ultimate goal of peace in Afghanistan. This agreement may prove an important asset in later, more serious stages of negotiations, they said. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's nascent government, which has made resolution of the Afghan conflict its top foreign policy priority, sees continued U.S. involvement in Afghanistan reconstruction as key to the future security and economic stability of the region. "This political reconciliation must succeed. ... We wish that the U.S. leaves Afghanistan as friend of the region, not as a failure," Pakistan army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor stated prior to the Doha talks. Afghan president's outburst It is not clear whether the Taliban have agreed to talk directly with President Ashraf Ghani's national unity government in Afghanistan, an administration that critics say remains fragile, is marred with political controversies and suffers from "disunity." The Taliban have so far refused to engage with the Afghan government in a peace process, dismissing it as an illegitimate entity and an "American puppet." Speaking during the World Economic Forum this week in Davos, Ghani for the first time publicly criticized the Khalilzad-led peace effort and indicated the Afghan government might not accept any possible outcome of the Doha talks. Ghani warned that any truce the U.S. signs with the Taliban must pave the way for direct talks between his government and the insurgents to decide all issues, including foreign troop withdrawal. "There's discussion, but this discussion needs to be shared back. A discussion that does not involve the region, we will not trust," Ghani said when asked whether the talks in Qatar were nearing a breakthrough. "If we don't get all the pieces right, one piece alone doesn't suffice," he added. During his interaction, Ghani also revealed that since he took office in late 2014, Afghan security forces have lost more than 45,000 personnel while battling the Taliban. The United Nations continues to document record levels of civilian casualties in its annual reports. Millions of others have been made refugees within Afghanistan, and the warfare discourages many more from returning from refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran. Aside from the humanitarian consequences of the fighting, it has cost the United States nearly $1 trillion while its military has lost nearly 2,500 personnel. The presence of 14,000 American soldiers means Washington will continue to pay around $45 billion annually to sustain operations if peace talks fail to produce desired results. An American university research report released late last year noted that the Afghan war had killed about 150,000 people, including government forces, insurgents, U.S. and personnel of the NATO-led coalition. The U.S.-led military invasion stemmed from terrorist attacks on American cities in September 2001 that were plotted by al-Qaida, allegedly out of its bases in Afghanistan.

Happy Monday and welcome to Overnight Defense. I’m Rebecca Kheel, and here’s your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter. THE TOPLINE: After more than 17 years, is the war in Afghanistan coming to a close? Hopes are being raised after the Trump administration’s top envoy for Afghan peace confirmed that the United States and the Taliban have agreed in principal to a peace framework. “We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,” the envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said in an interview with The New York Times in Kabul. “The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.” The comment comes after six days of negotiations with the Taliban in Qatar that Khalilzad had said on Twitter made “significant progress.” While the framework is still very preliminary, its existence is the first significant shift in the Afghanistan stalemate in years. What’s in the framework: Details still need to be “fleshed out,” Khalilzad said. But in general, the Taliban would agree not to allow Afghanistan to be used by terrorists to plot attacks, which would allow the United States to withdraw. The United States is also looking for a ceasefire followed by the Taliban negotiating directly with the Afghan government, according to several reports. That’s where an agreement could get tricky. An unnamed senior American official told the Times the Taliban delegation asked for time to confer with their leadership on the U.S. requirements for a ceasefire and direct talks with the Afghan government. What the Taliban says: The Taliban on Saturday said the Doha talks were productive but reiterated the demand that U.S. and other foreign troops agree to leave. “Until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon, progress in other issues is impossible,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. At the Pentagon: Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan called the progress on the talks with the Taliban “encouraging.” But, he added, there is no concrete plan yet for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon that he would discuss possible troop drawdown plans after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. “Hopefully, later on this week, when we get together we can talk about some of the encouraging conversations that are going on with the Taliban,” Shanahan said in his first remarks to the press since taking the acting role on Jan. 1.

NEW VENEZUELA SANCTIONS: The Trump administration is ramping up its pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to give up power. The administration, in the White House briefing room, announced Monday new sanctions against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company. National security adviser John Bolton told reporters at the White House that the sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA) will target $7 billion in assets and could result in $11 billion in lost sales over the next year. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described the state-owned company as a vehicle for “embezzlement and corruption,” and argued the sanctions would further pressure Maduro to cede power. The move comes less than a week after Trump recognized Juan Guaidó, the leader of the Venezuelan National Assembly, as the country’s interim president. The defense connection: As the U.S. steps up its pressure on Maduro, questions have been raised about whether the Trump administration would resort to military action for regime change. Trump himself has raised the possibility of military action in Venezuela, saying in August 2017 that he would not rule out “the military option.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Axios over the weekend that Trump broached the idea of using military force in a conversation earlier this month. Per Graham’s account, Trump asked him “What do you think about using military force?” Graham said he replied by saying, “Well, you need to go slow on that, that could be problematic.” Trump replied, according to Graham, “well, I’m surprised, you want to invade everybody.” “And I said, ‘I don’t want to invade everybody, I only want to use the military when our national security interests are threatened,’ ” Graham told Axios. Asked Monday about the prospect of further measures should Maduro cling to power, including military action, Bolton reiterated that “all options are on the table.” MARK YOUR CALENDAR: The State of the Union has been rescheduled for Feb. 5. One of the casualties of the partial government shutdown, the annual address was originally scheduled for this Tuesday. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rescinded his invitation to give the speech in the House chamber during the shutdown, the president decided to wait until the shutdown ended rather than deliver it elsewhere. With the government reopened, Pelosi and Trump agreed Monday to reschedule the speech for next week. Coast Guard pay: The government being reopened also means paychecks that were missed are being processed. Coast Guard Vice Commandant Adm. Charles Ray said over the weekend that Coast Guard civilians should get their back pay by Thursday. Service members should receive their back pay as early as Tuesday but no later than Wednesday. Thursday’s regularly scheduled paycheck is expected to come on time. TREATY DEADLINE APPROACHES: The Trump administration’s 60-day deadline for Russia to come back into compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty is coming up Saturday. Your Overnight Defense correspondent teamed up with The Hill’s Morgan Chalfant to take a look at what comes next… The Trump administration is poised to suspend a landmark, Soviet-era arms control pact with Russia, a move likely to inflame already high tensions between Washington and Moscow. Current and former officials and experts widely agree that Russia has been flouting the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. But the Trump administration’s decision to pull out has implications for U.S.-Russia relations and the broader global strategic environment. “As they get out of the treaty, can they do it in a way that maintains a level of stability in the U.S.-Russia strategic relationship? And secondly, how do they ensure that the alliance is talking with one voice?” said Frank Rose, who served as assistant secretary of state for arms control under former President Obama. “It’s not just a bilateral treaty from the United States and Russia. It really goes to the heart of Eurasian security,” Rose added. Read the rest here.

Happy Monday and welcome to Overnight Defense. I’m Rebecca Kheel, and here’s your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter. THE TOPLINE: After more than 17 years, is the war in Afghanistan coming to a close? Hopes are being raised after the Trump administration’s top envoy for Afghan peace confirmed that the United States and the Taliban have agreed in principal to a peace framework. “We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,” the envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said in an interview with The New York Times in Kabul. “The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.” The comment comes after six days of negotiations with the Taliban in Qatar that Khalilzad had said on Twitter made “significant progress.” While the framework is still very preliminary, its existence is the first significant shift in the Afghanistan stalemate in years. What’s in the framework: Details still need to be “fleshed out,” Khalilzad said. But in general, the Taliban would agree not to allow Afghanistan to be used by terrorists to plot attacks, which would allow the United States to withdraw. The United States is also looking for a ceasefire followed by the Taliban negotiating directly with the Afghan government, according to several reports. That’s where an agreement could get tricky. An unnamed senior American official told the Times the Taliban delegation asked for time to confer with their leadership on the U.S. requirements for a ceasefire and direct talks with the Afghan government. What the Taliban says: The Taliban on Saturday said the Doha talks were productive but reiterated the demand that U.S. and other foreign troops agree to leave. “Until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon, progress in other issues is impossible,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. At the Pentagon: Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan called the progress on the talks with the Taliban “encouraging.” But, he added, there is no concrete plan yet for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon that he would discuss possible troop drawdown plans after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. “Hopefully, later on this week, when we get together we can talk about some of the encouraging conversations that are going on with the Taliban,” Shanahan said in his first remarks to the press since taking the acting role on Jan. 1.

NEW VENEZUELA SANCTIONS: The Trump administration is ramping up its pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to give up power. The administration, in the White House briefing room, announced Monday new sanctions against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company. National security adviser John Bolton told reporters at the White House that the sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA) will target $7 billion in assets and could result in $11 billion in lost sales over the next year. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described the state-owned company as a vehicle for “embezzlement and corruption,” and argued the sanctions would further pressure Maduro to cede power. The move comes less than a week after Trump recognized Juan Guaidó, the leader of the Venezuelan National Assembly, as the country’s interim president. The defense connection: As the U.S. steps up its pressure on Maduro, questions have been raised about whether the Trump administration would resort to military action for regime change. Trump himself has raised the possibility of military action in Venezuela, saying in August 2017 that he would not rule out “the military option.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Axios over the weekend that Trump broached the idea of using military force in a conversation earlier this month. Per Graham’s account, Trump asked him “What do you think about using military force?” Graham said he replied by saying, “Well, you need to go slow on that, that could be problematic.” Trump replied, according to Graham, “well, I’m surprised, you want to invade everybody.” “And I said, ‘I don’t want to invade everybody, I only want to use the military when our national security interests are threatened,’ ” Graham told Axios. Asked Monday about the prospect of further measures should Maduro cling to power, including military action, Bolton reiterated that “all options are on the table.” MARK YOUR CALENDAR: The State of the Union has been rescheduled for Feb. 5. One of the casualties of the partial government shutdown, the annual address was originally scheduled for this Tuesday. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rescinded his invitation to give the speech in the House chamber during the shutdown, the president decided to wait until the shutdown ended rather than deliver it elsewhere. With the government reopened, Pelosi and Trump agreed Monday to reschedule the speech for next week. Coast Guard pay: The government being reopened also means paychecks that were missed are being processed. Coast Guard Vice Commandant Adm. Charles Ray said over the weekend that Coast Guard civilians should get their back pay by Thursday. Service members should receive their back pay as early as Tuesday but no later than Wednesday. Thursday’s regularly scheduled paycheck is expected to come on time. TREATY DEADLINE APPROACHES: The Trump administration’s 60-day deadline for Russia to come back into compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty is coming up Saturday. Your Overnight Defense correspondent teamed up with The Hill’s Morgan Chalfant to take a look at what comes next… The Trump administration is poised to suspend a landmark, Soviet-era arms control pact with Russia, a move likely to inflame already high tensions between Washington and Moscow. Current and former officials and experts widely agree that Russia has been flouting the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. But the Trump administration’s decision to pull out has implications for U.S.-Russia relations and the broader global strategic environment. “As they get out of the treaty, can they do it in a way that maintains a level of stability in the U.S.-Russia strategic relationship? And secondly, how do they ensure that the alliance is talking with one voice?” said Frank Rose, who served as assistant secretary of state for arms control under former President Obama. “It’s not just a bilateral treaty from the United States and Russia. It really goes to the heart of Eurasian security,” Rose added. Read the rest here. ON TAP FOR TOMORROW The House Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on Pentagon support at the southern border with testimony from under secretary of Defense for policy John Rood and director of operations for the Joint Staff Vice Adm.

News article:
As the US withdraws from Afghanistan the country is expected to undergo major changes in its political and economic structure. It is most uncertain as to how this transition would take place. Nonetheless, it is clear that the Taliban would be in a dominant position by virtue of the area they control and the military advantage they have over the Afghan forces. The US realising this has been directly negotiating the terms and conditions of withdrawal with the Taliban, despite President Ghani’s serious reservations. This is a major departure from Washington’s previous position but it shows how frustrated President Trump is with the prevailing situation in Afghanistan. It is also a reiteration of his commitment to disengage from unending conflicts especially this one that has lasted over 17 years and cost the US exchequer a trillion dollars. Moreover, until August of last year over 2,375 American lives were lost and 20,320 service members wounded in action in Afghanistan. In addition nearly 1,730 US civilian contractor fatalities occurred.The current US approach indicates that President Trump, notwithstanding his idiosyncrasies, is pragmatic and has a set of priorities different from that of his generals who would like to continue with an unending war.Even if the Taliban demands were met and they agree to a ceasefire it would not necessarily lead to peace in Afghanistan. There has to be a political understanding of the Taliban also with progressive forces that constitute mostly the urban middle class and elite of Afghanistan that previously were mostly part of the Northern Alliance and are Hazaras Tajiks and Uzbeks. Besides, the warlords that command support in their local areas will have to be taken into confidence. More importantly, the Taliban would have to ensure to the US that they would not allow any inimical groups like the ISIS to operate from Afghan soil. Assurance to deny the ISIS any space will not be difficult to implement, as it is as much in the Taliban interest. The most critical issue would be how the Taliban and the Afghan government and progressive Afghan forces agree to share power.In many ways the emergence of Taliban as the major player in determining the future of Afghanistan vindicates Pakistan’s policy. But the more pertinent question is whether the emergence of Taliban in a bigger role beneficial, especially while assessing it in terms of its impact on society and the region as a whole. The other regional countries—Iran, Russia, China and also India would be reassessing their positions in the changing scenario. Already we were seeing that these countries had developed contacts with the Taliban leadership. India, of course, would have to make a major shift and develop a working relationship with the Taliban. It may not be difficult as the Taliban leadership has been fairly pragmatic and flexible in changing positions if it suits their interest.The other significant event in the region is the Indian elections in April-May of this year. Indications are that the BJP would still secure the highest number of seats but with a lesser majority. A decisive victory for the BJP would make Prime Minister Narendra Modi more arrogant and dismissive toward Pakistan. It would turn India into essentially a Hindu state in which the security and freedom of minorities, especially Muslims, would be in danger. The situation in Kashmir would worsen which already is on the boiling point. What gives hope that the politics of hate and divisiveness is not paying back and PM Modi’s popularity and that of the BJP is on the decline. If the discontent is reflected in the coming elections chances are even if the BJP assumes power it would remain constrained and that may allow Modi to rethink his policy towards Pakistan. The BJP government has been using Afghanistan territory to destabilise Pakistan. Shrinking presence of the US in Afghanistan and a Taliban dominated government likely to emerge in Kabul would restrain India from indulging in anti-Pakistan pursuits.In addition, on several policy fronts—Afghanistan, Kashmir and dealings with its own Muslim community India would need to revisit its policies. No doubt, its economy is doing consistently well and it has broad support of the Western world and the international community but it cannot overlook indefinitely the negative side of its foreign and domestic policies.Meanwhile, as Prime Minister Imran Khan has indicated Pakistan will wait out until Indian forthcoming elections. The ball is in India’s court as far as its dealings with Pakistan are concerned. If still Modi or any other successor government moves forward Pakistan would reciprocate willingly.The relationship with Iran is far more complex. Being an important neighbour with close cultural and religious ties one would have expected far closer collaboration in the economic and political spheres. International and US specific sanctions have adversely affected trade with Iran and major communication and energy projects are on hold. Besides, Pakistan and Iran’s economy are going through a major crisis.Unfortunately, the Iranian and Pakistani Balochistan have remained restive that hinders smooth movement of people or trade to flourish. Pakistan has relied heavily on the armed forces to stabilise the region. Their efforts are commendable. They have focused on building schools, hospitals, and constructing roads. And now with Gwadar’s eminence due to CPEC and the connecting highway and other infrastructural projects, Balochistan has acquired greater importance. There is, however, need for addressing the genuine grievances of the Baloch youth who feel rightly or wrongly disfranchised. There has to be a serious attempt by the political government at resolving the injustices. A stable Balochistan would vastly contribute towards building bridges with Iran. Developing complementarity with Iranian port of Chabahar port in future would further serve the interest of both countries.The Saudi-Iranian conflict that has sectarian and political overtones places Pakistan in a difficult situation despite its earnest efforts at staying clear of it.Pakistan has always aspired to derive maximum strength from its geo-strategic location. The present regional situation though complex, presents once again an opportunity to maximise its potential.Published in The Express Tribune, February 6, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
President Donald Trump told Americans on Tuesday his administration had accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan, and would be able to reduce U.S. troops there as negotiations advance to end America’s longest war, Trend reports referring to Reuters. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” Trump said in his annual State of the Union address to Congress, in which he also said U.S. troops had nearly defeated Islamic State militants in Syria and it was time to bring them home. After 17 years of war in Afghanistan, Trump praised “the unmatched valor” of U.S. forces. “Thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict,” Trump said. He said his administration was holding constructive talks with a number of groups, including the Taliban. “As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. And we will indeed focus on counter-terrorism,” Trump said. Trump offered no specifics about when he would bring home the 14,000 U.S. troops now in Afghanistan. U.S.-led forces in 2001 toppled the hardline Taliban for harboring the al Qaeda militants responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. “We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement - but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace,” Trump said. In December, a U.S. official said Trump was planning to withdraw more than 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, triggering worries about whether a smaller force would be able to fulfill missions under way and stabilize the country. When he campaigned for president in 2016, Trump said he wanted to focus more on domestic issues than foreign conflicts. However, Trump’s sudden announcement in December that he would withdraw U.S. forces from Syria alarmed allies and many current and former U.S. officials, who worry that Islamic State militants remain a threat. After the speech, Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said Trump’s Syria plans did not seem well thought out, and could put U.S. allies like the Kurds and Israel at risk, while empowering Iran. “We’ll probably come back at a future date, with much more danger to our troops,” Engel told Reuters. Earlier on Tuesday, General Joseph Votel, head of the military’s Central Command, warned that Islamic State would pose an enduring threat. In his address, Trump said Islamic State controlled more than 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. “Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters,” he said.

However, Trump’s sudden announcement in December that he would withdraw U.S. forces from Syria alarmed allies and many current and former U.S. officials, who worry that Islamic State militants remain a threat. After the speech, Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said Trump’s Syria plans did not seem well thought out, and could put U.S. allies like the Kurds and Israel at risk, while empowering Iran. “We’ll probably come back at a future date, with much more danger to our troops,” Engel told Reuters. Earlier on Tuesday, General Joseph Votel, head of the military’s Central Command, warned that Islamic State would pose an enduring threat. In his address, Trump said Islamic State controlled more than 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. “Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters,” he said.

President Donald Trump told Americans on Tuesday his administration had accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan, and would be able to reduce U.S. troops there as negotiations advance to end America’s longest war, Trend reports referring to Reuters. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” Trump said in his annual State of the Union address to Congress, in which he also said U.S. troops had nearly defeated Islamic State militants in Syria and it was time to bring them home. After 17 years of war in Afghanistan, Trump praised “the unmatched valor” of U.S. forces. “Thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict,” Trump said. He said his administration was holding constructive talks with a number of groups, including the Taliban. “As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. And we will indeed focus on counter-terrorism,” Trump said. Trump offered no specifics about when he would bring home the 14,000 U.S. troops now in Afghanistan. U.S.-led forces in 2001 toppled the hardline Taliban for harboring the al Qaeda militants responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. “We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement - but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace,” Trump said.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Feb. 7 By Azer Ahmadbayli – Trend: The Americans seem to have realized that it is impossible either to exterminate the Taliban movement or to cripple it for long, so they finally decided to make a deal with the movement. However, the fact that the US may come to an agreement with Taliban - may turn to be bad news for Iran. A few days ago, the enemy of Iran – the United States, and Iranian malevolent – the Taliban, who fought for many years for control over the territory of Afghanistan, reached a preliminary agreement on a ceasefire, reconciliation and withdrawal of American troops from the country. The United States, with its 14,000-strong military contingent and especially Air Force bases in Afghanistan, poses a serious threat to Iran from its eastern border. It is quite understandable that Iran gets nervous when seeing Americans close to its borders. Therefore, the ousting of the US from Afghanistan has always been on the Iranian agenda and in this respect the interests of Iran and the Taliban coincide. Throughout the relationship between Iran and the Taliban on the problem of common enemy, both sides have demonstrated a pragmatic approach useful for their own interests. But, since the Americans are in no hurry to leave Afghanistan, it was important for Iran to at least maintain a high degree of tension between the US troops and the Taliban. To this end, Iran, as many sources say, encapsulatedly supplied the Taliban with weapons and money when it was necessary to maintain the status quo of the existing chaos, or if you prefer, a balance of forces in Afghanistan. In turn, despite the non-recognition of Iran as a truly Islamic state and treating with contempt for the Iranian "Shiite heretics", the Taliban, nevertheless, did not shun receiving Iranian assistance. In general, however, relations between Iran and the Taliban today are more hostile than constructive. Both sides have bills for each other to be paid. Despite the fact that, as many experts, who are well aware of the situation in Afghanistan, say, the withdrawal of US troops, if it takes place, is likely to last for several years, it would seem that this is a good news for Tehran. However, insuperability of religious antagonism between the Shiite theocracy of Iran and the Sunni fundamentalism of the Taliban still prevails over unofficial tactical ties between the parties, and by organizing a couple of dirty provocations, it won’t be hard to start the sectarian war. The agreement concluded in Doha also envisages that Taliban will suppress activities of the Islamic State troops against the United States and its allies. But not against its foes. But if, despite all the unpredictability and outright cruelty of the Taliban, Iran hypothetically can still find a common language with them, then it will have to wage a war to the death with the IS jihadists, if attacked. Syria and Iraq, anyone? In January, Iranian Tasnim news agency reported that the United States organized the escape of forty IS leaders from the Taliban prison in North-West Afghanistan. In late January, Deputy Minister of internal Affairs of Russia Igor Zubov said that unknown helicopters are moving IS militants en masse to the Afghan-Tajik border. Earlier, last autumn, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev warned that the "Islamic state" could repeat the Syrian scenario in Afghanistan. And on Tuesday, major-general Yahya Rahim Safavi, a top military adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that Iran has “precise information” that the US is transferring IS militants to Afghanistan, Iranian media outlets reported. “With the plots of Americans, Zionists and some Arab states, more than 100,000 ISIS insurgents invaded the Syrian and Iraqi nations and they intended to come for Iran after Syria and Iraq to claim caliphate in Khorasan, they had even determined an Amir for it. It was US, Israel and UK that established ISIS’ intelligence services. Now we have accurate information showing that US transfers ISIS’ terrorists to Afghanistan,” General Safavi said. Accumulation of the IS fighters in the neighboring country along with the financial support by Saudi billions can become a destructive factor for Iran's security. Iran should be on alert: the tactics used by Iranian proxies in the Middle East can be specularly applied against it from Afghanistan. So, what is better for Tehran – to coexist with the US troops deployed in Afghanistan or, probably, to stay face-to-face with IS (and maybe with Taliban) fighters – is a big question.

News article:
Happy Friday and welcome to Overnight Defense. We’re Rebecca Kheel and Ellen Mitchell, and here’s your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter. THE TOPLINE: The U.S. envoy negotiating peace the Taliban on Friday set a timeline for when the United States wants an agreement reached. Zalmay Khalilzad, U.S envoy for Afghanistan reconciliation, said he hopes to finish before the Afghan elections on July 20. Even if that doesn’t happen, though, he insisted Afghanistan’s elections will move forward. “It would be better for Afghanistan if we could get a peace agreement before the election,” Khalilzad said Friday at the U.S. Institute for Peace in his first public address since his appointment to the position. “If there is no progress on the peace track, elections will take place, and we are doing what we can to support the preparations for credible elections.” Khalilzad acknowledged the difficult timeframe but expressed hope negotiations can at least make significant progress by then. “I understand that peace processes are not a straight line. There could be setbacks,” he said. “Between now and July, there is sufficient time, I believe, where we could reach an agreement. But at least if we have significant progress, that will have a good impact with regard to the future and including the elections.” On a withdrawal: Khalilzad also stressed that, at the direction of President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the agreement he is seeking is not a “withdrawal agreement.” He added that the U.S. presence and possible withdrawal is “conditions based.” “A peace agreement can allow withdrawal, but it is not just a withdrawal agreement that we are seeking,” he said. While terrorism and the U.S. military withdrawal have been at the top of negotiations so far, the United States has a “long agenda” that needs to be addressed with the Taliban. Those include getting the Taliban to agree to a permanent ceasefire and to engage in direct negotiations with the Afghan government. “As I’ve said publicly in my tweets before, nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,” Khalilzad stressed. On women’s rights: Khalilzad said Taliban-Afghan government negotiations is the place where issues such a women’s rights have to be address. Women in Afghanistan are fearful of a backslide in their rights if the Taliban becomes part of the government. “We will speak loudly and clearly for the values that we have, the values of human rights, the value of freedom of the press, women’s rights, all that we stand for, and we’ll make sure that they understand that for having positive relations in the future with the United States those values must be respected,” he said. “I know that the Afghanistan of today is very different than the Afghanistan of 19 years ago,” he added. “It’s a different country. And it will take time perhaps for the Taliban to appreciate that, but the message that they have given me is that they understand they cannot go back.” Addressing critics who say the Trump administration had abandoned the long-held U.S. position that peace talks have to be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned, Khalilzad said he sees himself as a “catalyst” to get to the point where the talks do meet that criteria. On a ceasefire: Khalilzad said the Taliban is reluctant to agree to a permanent ceasefire because it believes it will lose its leverage to get concessions from the Afghan government. He also said those representatives he was negotiating with in Qatar were not authorized to engage on that issue. Given that all sides in the war have expressed support for a peace process, he said, “then why should the killing go on?” MEANWHILE IN SYRIA: There was also news on Friday about the other pending U.S. military withdrawal. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration plans to withdraw U.S. forces in Syria by the end of April, with most of them out of the country by mid-March. Why it’s surprising: As recently as Tuesday, the top. U.S. general overseeing the military in the Middle East denied that there was a timeline for the withdrawal. “I am not under pressure to be out by a specific date, and I have not had any specific conditions put upon me,” U.S. Central Command commander Gen. Joseph Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Of course, that was the same hearing where Votel revealed that Trump did not consult him prior to announcing the withdrawal in the first place in December. The Wall Street Journal also noted that there are still no plans to protect Kurdish partners against Turkey after the withdrawal, which has been a key concern of U.S. military officers and lawmakers.

News article:
Afghans don’t want to be another Iran Camelia Entekhabifard US Marines keep watch as unseen Afghan National Army soldiers participate in an IED (improvised explosive device) training exercise at the Shorab Military Camp in Lashkar Gah in the Afghan province of Helmand. (File photo/AFP) President Donald Trump decision in December to withdraw about half the remaining US troops in Afghanistan shocked many people in the country. Though he has still to provide further details, or set a timetable, there is concern that the pullout, combined with the peace talks between the Taliban and Trump’s special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, may embolden the Taliban and encourage its leaders to attempt to reestablish a fundamentalist Islamic government. The group has asked for the Afghan army to be dismantled, a transitional government to be formed and a new constitution to be written under their supervision. Do the Taliban really believe millions of Afghans would welcome a return to a dark age of torture and abuse? Women’s-rights activists were among the first to respond with alarm, but Khalilzad has failed to reveal any details of the negotiations with the Taliban, or whether any agreements have been reached. Parallel to the talks between the US and the Taliban, Moscow has opened a channel for talks between the Taliban and senior Afghan political leaders. This is a clear Russian attempt not only to compete with the US in the peace process, but also to engage influential Afghan leaders with other players such as Iran, India and China. In his State of the Union speech last week, Trump mentioned the peace talks with the Taliban and said that while there is still no plan in place for pulling out the troops, it would be a reduction in numbers rather than the complete withdrawal the Taliban wants. Therefore his strategy for Afghanistan, like his many of his strategies as he reaches the half-way point of his term in the Oval Office, remains uncertain and unpredictable. This young democracy is facing great challenges but hundred of thousands of Afghans also lost their lives during the 18-year conflict, and the freedoms they now enjoy are important to them. They do not want to become another Iran. Camelia Entekhabifard I see no great sympathy toward the Taliban within Trump’s administration. I expect the president to fulfill his campaign promises to the American people to bring US troops home, but that does not mean he will abandon American interests in the region to the Iranians or Russians after the deaths of more than 2,000 Americans in Afghanistan. The Afghan people appreciate all the international support and the sacrifices made to liberate them from the archaic rule of the Taliban, and do not believe that American efforts to support democracy will change. This young democracy is facing great challenges but hundred of thousands of Afghans also lost their lives during the 18-year conflict, and the freedoms they now enjoy are important to them. They do not want to become another Iran, with the Taliban ruling over them again with a strict, fundamentalist interpretation of Shariah. I believe Afghan politicians attended the Moscow talks not in an attempt to interfere with state affairs or bypass the government, but out of concern and curiosity about what is going on behind the scenes of the talks between Khalilzad and the Taliban. Afghanistan must not fall back into the hands of the mullahs, and Iran is a good example why.

Afghans don’t want to be another Iran Camelia Entekhabifard US Marines keep watch as unseen Afghan National Army soldiers participate in an IED (improvised explosive device) training exercise at the Shorab Military Camp in Lashkar Gah in the Afghan province of Helmand. (File photo/AFP) President Donald Trump decision in December to withdraw about half the remaining US troops in Afghanistan shocked many people in the country. Though he has still to provide further details, or set a timetable, there is concern that the pullout, combined with the peace talks between the Taliban and Trump’s special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, may embolden the Taliban and encourage its leaders to attempt to reestablish a fundamentalist Islamic government. The group has asked for the Afghan army to be dismantled, a transitional government to be formed and a new constitution to be written under their supervision. Do the Taliban really believe millions of Afghans would welcome a return to a dark age of torture and abuse? Women’s-rights activists were among the first to respond with alarm, but Khalilzad has failed to reveal any details of the negotiations with the Taliban, or whether any agreements have been reached. Parallel to the talks between the US and the Taliban, Moscow has opened a channel for talks between the Taliban and senior Afghan political leaders. This is a clear Russian attempt not only to compete with the US in the peace process, but also to engage influential Afghan leaders with other players such as Iran, India and China. In his State of the Union speech last week, Trump mentioned the peace talks with the Taliban and said that while there is still no plan in place for pulling out the troops, it would be a reduction in numbers rather than the complete withdrawal the Taliban wants. Therefore his strategy for Afghanistan, like his many of his strategies as he reaches the half-way point of his term in the Oval Office, remains uncertain and unpredictable. This young democracy is facing great challenges but hundred of thousands of Afghans also lost their lives during the 18-year conflict, and the freedoms they now enjoy are important to them. They do not want to become another Iran. Camelia Entekhabifard I see no great sympathy toward the Taliban within Trump’s administration. I expect the president to fulfill his campaign promises to the American people to bring US troops home, but that does not mean he will abandon American interests in the region to the Iranians or Russians after the deaths of more than 2,000 Americans in Afghanistan. The Afghan people appreciate all the international support and the sacrifices made to liberate them from the archaic rule of the Taliban, and do not believe that American efforts to support democracy will change. This young democracy is facing great challenges but hundred of thousands of Afghans also lost their lives during the 18-year conflict, and the freedoms they now enjoy are important to them. They do not want to become another Iran, with the Taliban ruling over them again with a strict, fundamentalist interpretation of Shariah. I believe Afghan politicians attended the Moscow talks not in an attempt to interfere with state affairs or bypass the government, but out of concern and curiosity about what is going on behind the scenes of the talks between Khalilzad and the Taliban. Afghanistan must not fall back into the hands of the mullahs, and Iran is a good example why.

News article:
Acting Pentagon chief visits Afghanistan, urges Kabul role in talks with Taliban Iran Press TV Mon Feb 11, 2019 09:03AM Acting US Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan has made an unannounced trip to Afghanistan to discuss the process of peace talks with the Taliban militant group and Washington's planned drawdown of its military forces in the war-torn country. Patrick Shanahan arrived in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Monday and is scheduled to sit down for talks with President Ashraf Ghani and visit the American troops deployed to the country. Ghani's government has so far been excluded from the ongoing talks between the US and the Taliban, which view the Kabul government as illegitimate. Upon arrival in Afghanistan, Shanahan said coordination with the Kabul government to end more than 17 years of militancy is vital. "It is important that the Afghan government is involved in discussions regarding Afghanistan," he added. "The Afghans have to decide what Afghanistan looks like in the future. It's not about the US, it is about Afghanistan," he said. "The US military has strong security interests in the region. (The) presence will evolve out of those discussions." Shanahan, however, said no direction has been given to him to reduce the number of US forces on Afghan soil. The acting Pentagon chief also said he was in Afghanistan to get an insight into the situation on the ground from American commanders. Shanahan took over from Jim Mattis, who stepped down in December 2018 amid differences with President Donald Trump. Mattis' resignation came after Trump ordered the Pentagon, against the defense chief's recommendation, to work out a plan to withdraw approximately half of the nearly 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan. Representatives of the US and the Taliban militant group have held several rounds of talks in Qatar in an attempt to end the war in Afghanistan. The latest round was held last month, and the next round is scheduled for February 25. Efforts to negotiate a peace deal have been beset by disagreement in recent weeks as leaders of the militant group reject the Kabul government's offer for direct talks. Earlier this week, the Taliban dismissed Ghani's offer to open a political office in Afghanistan, saying the offer was aimed at "harming the peace efforts." Washington's efforts to get out of the Afghan war come around 17 years after the US invaded Afghanistan together with a number of its allies. That invasion removed the Taliban from power, but has failed to contain the group's militancy campaign to this day. Currently, Kabul only controls 55 percent of the country's territory, while the militants have a grip on 12 percent of the Afghan soil, according to a report by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction published in October last year. About a third of the country remains contested. Daesh has also used the mayhem in Afghanistan to establish a foothold there.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Amir Taghati Several countries entered into negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear threat. It resulted in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), or 2015 Iran nuclear deal as it is known. However, it was far from able to neutralise the nuclear threat. In fact, it resulted in giving the Iranian regime the opportunity to work on an essential component – the delivery vehicle for a nuclear weapon. And despite the good faith offered by the signatories of the deal towards Iran, the regime continued to fire ballistic missiles – an issue that was not addressed in the nuclear deal. U.S. President Donald Trump decided that enough was enough and warned Iran that he would exit the nuclear deal. He did, and it didn’t stop there. He went on to announced crippling sanctions and his administration has not ruled out the possibility of imposing more. The Europeans, however, have not joined the U.S. President in treating the Iranian regime with the distrust that it deserves. They continue to mildly and gently denounce Iran’s behaviour while trying to preserve the nuclear deal. It claims to share the concerns that Trump has brought up, but nothing concrete has been laid out. Every time Europe speaks out about Iran’s belligerence, it is also quick to add that it is making sure the preservation of the deal is a priority. Europe should be concerned about the ballistic missile issue and it should be questioning whether they can deliver nuclear weapons. It should also be enquiring about payload and range. In short, the ballistic missile issue should be treated as separate to the nuclear deal. Because it is a separate issue. The EU has also remained relatively silent with regards to Iran’s belligerence in the region. For example, Iran’s use of the Houthi rebels in Yemen to fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Although the EU may have prioritised the nuclear issues and pushed the ballistic missile issues to the side, it would be much more prudent to take a stand now. If the EU continues to express no concern for Iran’s ballistic missile program, it is going to guarantee that it was a weaker negotiation standpoint. The Iranian regime is considered to be one of the most dangerous regimes in the entire world. It is focused on survival by any means and it is an untrustworthy and deceptive player. Countries are being destroyed by the regime, including Syria and Yemen. The people of Iran are suffering under the regime – they are brutally supressed, are denied freedom and the most basic of human rights, and they are punished for exercising their right to protest. The people of Iran welcome U.S. administration’s harsh rhetoric and sanctions because it is a start in holding the regime accountable for its actions. Although they are undoubtedly suffering because of the sanctions, the people know that pressure on their leadership will have a beneficial effect later. It is for this reason that the EU must hold the regime accountable for its actions.

Europe will not allow US to determine trade relations with Iran: Mogherini Iran Press TV Fri Jan 11, 2019 06:17PM The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, says the United States cannot impose its policies on the 28-nation bloc's "legitimate trade" relations with Iran. "We Europeans cannot accept that a foreign power – even our closest friend and ally – makes decisions over our legitimate trade with another country," Mogherini said in an interview with the European Council on Foreign Relations published on Friday. She added that the EU is working with the rest of the international community to keep alive the landmark nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite the US unilateral move to pull out from the deal. The Iran nuclear deal "has so far been implemented in full, as certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency in 13 consecutive reports," she said. US President Donald Trump withdrew his country in May from the historic Iran nuclear deal and decided to re-impose unilateral sanctions against Tehran. Under the deal, reached between Iran and six major powers - the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - Tehran agreed to put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of nuclear-related sanctions. The US administration hoped to get the other parties to the deal with Iran to likewise scrap the deal, but instead, they stressed that not only would they stick to the agreement, but they would also work to sustain it in the face of increased US pressure. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in November that Iran has continued to implement all its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal even as the United States re-imposed fresh sanctions against Tehran. The IAEA's report said Iran has been complying with the restrictions to its nuclear program laid down in the nuclear deal, adding, "There is nothing that indicates that Iranian cooperation or the Iranian attitude has changed since the 5th of November." Mogherini further rejected claims that Europe is motivated mainly by economic or trade considerations and said all efforts by the EU to preserve the JCPOA have been made "because of our collective security." "That is not the case: we do this to prevent a nuclear non-proliferation agreement that is working from being dismantled, and to prevent a major security crisis in the Middle East," the senior EU official pointed out. She emphasized that the EU should guarantee that firms seeking to do legitimate business with Iran are allowed to do so. "This is what we are working on right now: tools that will assist, protect, and reassure economic actors pursuing legitimate business with Iran. It is true that this situation has triggered a conversation on European economic sovereignty," Mogherini said. Iran and the 28-nation European Union have been discussing various ways to continue doing business with Iran and bypass US sanctions. On September 24, Iran and its five partners released a joint statement announcing the setting up of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate continued trade with Iran, bypass the US financial system, and avoid any impact of America's secondary sanctions. Late last month, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran will not stand by for Europeans to fulfill their commitments under the multilateral nuclear agreement, following the United States' move to pull out from the deal. "The Europeans are acting slowly in the fulfillment of their commitments under the nuclear agreement," Zarif said, adding, "We will not wait around for them unless they adopt practical steps." Zarif's remarks came after Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi warned that Tehran's patience is running out over the failure of the European Union's economic pledges to deliver any "tangible results." He said the EU's efforts were encouraging but added: "We have not yet seen any tangible results. So, they [Europeans] are promising us that they are doing their best to be able to translate all that they have said in political terms and to turn it into realization, in other words, to materialize what they have said."

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Amir Taghati In an interview with state run official news agency on January 5th, the Iranian regime’s foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Bahram Qassemi discussed the European Special Purpose Vehicle. “At the beginning, the European Union had good intentions and a positive political will about creating the financial mechanism, but gradually and during the negotiations over the past few months, this feeling became more serious that the European countries face some serious disabilities in implementing the SPV,” he said. His remarks have drawn criticism from the faction affiliated with Ali Khamenei. For example, an Iranian newspaper allied with the Supreme Leader, Vatan-e Emrouz, wrote, “[Bahram Qassemi] considered U.S. dollar’s hegemony and the ties between European and American economies among the major reasons why the SPV implementation is delayed and added: ‘The European Union and even the three European countries that are part of the JCPOA with Iran, are prisoners and hostages to the U.S. economy. Therefore, they have to make a decision for their independence and the continuation of their independent existence.” Vatan-e Emrouz also published the article, “2019/2020 budget gamble with SPV?!”, that challenged Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s budget on its 1.5-million-barrel-per-day oil-export estimation. The article explains that this estimate relies on the SPV and European imports of Iranian oil, but European support isn’t guaranteed. Regime’s MP Nasrollah Pejmanfar, told Vatan-e Emrouz newspaper, “The important issue is that the government can’t rely on the SPV at all for selling 1.5 million barrels of oil as it’s evident in the 2019/2020 budget bill. Because neither the solution is clear nor there is transparency about it.” Pejmanfar also said that oil is currently being sold “seven to ten dollars” below market price. As well, Sharq newspaper published an article on January 7th, entitled, “What should be done with the JCPOA?” It disparaged the SPV efforts, saying, “It’s likely that Europe will soon somehow create its promised financial mechanism, although it will be completely symbolic, useless, and ineffective,” and added, “This inefficiency is mostly rooted in Europe’s weak economy compared to the U.S. and also the legal structures of European markets, and not a desire by European governments to break their commitments.” After the U.S. exit from the JCPOA was announced in May 2018, Javad Zarif went to Brussels to seek help and support from the EU. Despite promises, nothing concrete has materialized. Zarif’s political deputy, Abbas Araghchi, has said, “We face a situation where Europeans either don’t want or can’t implement the financial mechanism. In some circles, it is said that the differences between Europe and the U.S. are just a game and they don’t have differences in reality. And we can’t dismiss this line of reasoning easily and we must consider it alongside other possibilities.” “You can say that this issue [FATF] has become sort of an excuse for the Europeans to delay the financial mechanism. If we want to do any amendments to this [FATF bills] and tell them that, it’s better to do it as soon as possible, so that they don’t have this excuse anymore and we can put more pressure on them to implement the mechanism,” states Abdolreza Faraji, the president of the Strategic Council for Iran’s Foreign Affairs. According to sources, the EU conditioned implementation of the SPV to Iran’s compliance with the world’s money laundering body, FATF. But, passing the four related bills necessary to do that has become one of the most controversial topics in Iran over the last several months. The laws that the Iranian regime must pass to bring it in line with international anti-money laundering and terrorism financing standards, will prevent it from supporting its many proxies in the region and around the world. This is unacceptable to the Islamic Republic.

News article:
Brussels/Paris - In Tehran on January 8 during a meeting with European envoys, Iranian officials abruptly stood up, walked out and slammed the door in an extraordinary break with protocol. The French, British, German, Danish, Dutch, and Belgian diplomats in the Iranian foreign ministry room had incensed the officials with a message that Europe could no longer tolerate ballistic missile tests in Iran and assassination plots on European soil, according to four EU diplomats. “There was a lot of drama, they didn’t like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns,” one of the diplomats said. “It shows the relationship is becoming more tense,” a second said. An Iranian official declined to comment on the meeting. The next day, the European Union imposed its first sanctions on Iran since world powers agreed the 2015 Vienna nuclear arms control deal with Tehran. The sanctions were largely symbolic but the stormy meeting encapsulated the unexpected shift in European diplomacy since the end of last year. Smaller, more dovish EU countries have joined France and Britain in a harder stance on Tehran, including considering new economic sanctions, diplomats say. Those could include asset freezes and travel bans on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Iranians developing the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile programme, three diplomats said. The new approach moves Europe closer to US President Donald Trump’s policy of isolating Iran with tough sanctions even though European governments still support the 2015 Vienna deal from which he withdrew in May. Although there are diverging views in Europe, the shift could have consequences for President Hassan Rouhani’s government as it looks to European capitals to salvage that deal. It could also strengthen anti-Western sentiment in Iran and lead to more aggressive Iranian moves around the Middle East, where the Islamic Republic is involved in proxy wars with its main regional rival Saudi Arabia. Iran’s firing of short-range ballistic missiles into Syria on September 30, missile tests and a satellite launch this month have niggled Western powers. For Europe, alleged assassination plots by Iran on French and Danish soil in 2018 were the last straw, diplomats say. Tehran denies the plots and says the missile tests are purely defensive. “The accusations against Iran over the past few months have awoken a few countries in Europe that were against a tougher line on Iran,” a European-based Middle East diplomat said. The same day as the meeting, the Netherlands publicly blamed Iran for killings on its soil in 2015 and 2017. Tehran denies any involvement. Then on January 9, the EU designated a unit of Iran’s intelligence ministry a terrorist organisation, froze its assets and those of two men. “Take the Dutch for example. They had kept very quiet until the Danish attack and now they are more hawkish than the French,” said the diplomat. Alarmed by Trump’s “America First” policy, Europe considered his May 8 decision to pull out of the Iran accord a severe setback but Iran’s international ambitions appear to offer Brussels and Washington a chance to work more closely. A US State Department official said there was now “a growing international consensus” on the range of Iranian threats. “The US welcomes Europe’s efforts to counter Iranian terrorism on European soil, its missile launches, human rights abuses, and other threats,” the official said. As the Trump administration accused Iran last year of harbouring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, the EU sought dialogue with Tehran. At meetings between European and Iranian diplomats last year, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, pressed for gestures on Iran’s role in Syria’s war and for help to end the conflict in Yemen. But multiple bilateral talks on the ballistic missile programme have yielded no results. The EU tried to show Iran that compliance with the nuclear accord would still mean economic benefits despite Trump’s decision to reimpose US sanctions and choke off Iranian oil exports by pressuring US allies. The European Union is set to officially launch a mechanism, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to trade with Iran later this month but it will not be operational for several months. It will be registered in France, run by a German and likely to include Britain as a shareholder. “There’s a feeling of frustration among Britain, France and Germany, and others, after the first phase of diplomacy with Iran,” another senior EU diplomat said. “We thought we could get some effort from the Iranians in several areas.” Iran says Europe may not be able to safeguard the nuclear deal anyway and accused European officials of dragging their feet. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister and senior nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi said last week “operational steps” were needed from Europe as political support not enough. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of Iran’s powerful Assembly of Experts said on Thursday Europe “would do nothing in our interest.” “The Europeans are worse than the Americans. If not, they are not any better,” he said, state TV reported. Last March, as part of efforts to convince Trump to stick to the nuclear deal, France, Britain and Germany proposed asset freezes and travel bans on the IRGC and Iranian companies and groups developing the missile programme, according to a document seen by Reuters. Now, a similar set of measures is being prepared, three diplomats say. “We’d prefer not to take these measures, but they need to stop trying to kill people on our territory and over the last three years they have beefed up their ballistic programme,” said one senior European diplomat. The diplomats say getting all 28 EU members to agree will take time. The EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini, who helped seal the 2015 deal, is wary of moving too fast for fear of provoking a complete collapse of the accord, four diplomats said. EU foreign ministers planned to issue a rare joint statement on Jan. 21 about what they say is Iran’s interference in the region and calling for an end to missile tests. Diplomats said Mogherini wants to see the SPV established first. An EU official denied any split in policy between Mogherini and EU governments, saying the statement will be published as soon as the SPV is launched. EU diplomats said eastern European governments could also go too far against Iran to please Trump in return for security guarantees against Russia. EU diplomats said there was a risk that a two-day conference in Poland in February focused on the Middle East, particularly Iran, convened by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could divide eastern and western Europe. Mogherini is unable to attend due to another official engagement, an EU official said, and it is not clear at what level France, Britain and Germany will be represented.

The new approach moves Europe closer to US President Donald Trump’s policy of isolating Iran with tough sanctions even though European governments still support the 2015 Vienna deal from which he withdrew in May. Although there are diverging views in Europe, the shift could have consequences for President Hassan Rouhani’s government as it looks to European capitals to salvage that deal. It could also strengthen anti-Western sentiment in Iran and lead to more aggressive Iranian moves around the Middle East, where the Islamic Republic is involved in proxy wars with its main regional rival Saudi Arabia. Iran’s firing of short-range ballistic missiles into Syria on September 30, missile tests and a satellite launch this month have niggled Western powers. For Europe, alleged assassination plots by Iran on French and Danish soil in 2018 were the last straw, diplomats say. Tehran denies the plots and says the missile tests are purely defensive. “The accusations against Iran over the past few months have awoken a few countries in Europe that were against a tougher line on Iran,” a European-based Middle East diplomat said. The same day as the meeting, the Netherlands publicly blamed Iran for killings on its soil in 2015 and 2017. Tehran denies any involvement. Then on January 9, the EU designated a unit of Iran’s intelligence ministry a terrorist organisation, froze its assets and those of two men. “Take the Dutch for example. They had kept very quiet until the Danish attack and now they are more hawkish than the French,” said the diplomat. Alarmed by Trump’s “America First” policy, Europe considered his May 8 decision to pull out of the Iran accord a severe setback but Iran’s international ambitions appear to offer Brussels and Washington a chance to work more closely. A US State Department official said there was now “a growing international consensus” on the range of Iranian threats. “The US welcomes Europe’s efforts to counter Iranian terrorism on European soil, its missile launches, human rights abuses, and other threats,” the official said. As the Trump administration accused Iran last year of harbouring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, the EU sought dialogue with Tehran. At meetings between European and Iranian diplomats last year, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, pressed for gestures on Iran’s role in Syria’s war and for help to end the conflict in Yemen. But multiple bilateral talks on the ballistic missile programme have yielded no results. The EU tried to show Iran that compliance with the nuclear accord would still mean economic benefits despite Trump’s decision to reimpose US sanctions and choke off Iranian oil exports by pressuring US allies. The European Union is set to officially launch a mechanism, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to trade with Iran later this month but it will not be operational for several months. It will be registered in France, run by a German and likely to include Britain as a shareholder. “There’s a feeling of frustration among Britain, France and Germany, and others, after the first phase of diplomacy with Iran,” another senior EU diplomat said. “We thought we could get some effort from the Iranians in several areas.” Iran says Europe may not be able to safeguard the nuclear deal anyway and accused European officials of dragging their feet. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister and senior nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi said last week “operational steps” were needed from Europe as political support not enough. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of Iran’s powerful Assembly of Experts said on Thursday Europe “would do nothing in our interest.” “The Europeans are worse than the Americans. If not, they are not any better,” he said, state TV reported. Last March, as part of efforts to convince Trump to stick to the nuclear deal, France, Britain and Germany proposed asset freezes and travel bans on the IRGC and Iranian companies and groups developing the missile programme, according to a document seen by Reuters. Now, a similar set of measures is being prepared, three diplomats say. “We’d prefer not to take these measures, but they need to stop trying to kill people on our territory and over the last three years they have beefed up their ballistic programme,” said one senior European diplomat. The diplomats say getting all 28 EU members to agree will take time. The EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini, who helped seal the 2015 deal, is wary of moving too fast for fear of provoking a complete collapse of the accord, four diplomats said. EU foreign ministers planned to issue a rare joint statement on Jan. 21 about what they say is Iran’s interference in the region and calling for an end to missile tests. Diplomats said Mogherini wants to see the SPV established first. An EU official denied any split in policy between Mogherini and EU governments, saying the statement will be published as soon as the SPV is launched. EU diplomats said eastern European governments could also go too far against Iran to please Trump in return for security guarantees against Russia. EU diplomats said there was a risk that a two-day conference in Poland in February focused on the Middle East, particularly Iran, convened by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could divide eastern and western Europe. Mogherini is unable to attend due to another official engagement, an EU official said, and it is not clear at what level France, Britain and Germany will be represented.

EU delay in implementing financial channel unacceptable: Kharrazi MNA – The head of Iran’s Foreign Policy Strategic Council Kamal Kharrazi said Sat. the European Union’s delay in implementing the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to continue trade with Iran despite US sanctions under the pretext of their incapability of convincing European companies is unacceptable. Kamal Kharrazi, head of Iran’s Foreign Policy Strategic Council Kamal Kharrazi, who has also served as the Iranian foreign minister, made the remarks in a meeting with a visiting delegation of researches from the Italian International Affairs Institute (IAI Instituto Affari Internaziobali). Kharrazi said that the pressures that US administration is inflicting on Iran would weaken and divide Europe, adding “the US action in holding anti-Iran conference in Poland is aimed at escalating divisions among the European countries.” The former Iranian foreign minister added that while Iran honestly adhered to the nuclear deal also known as the JCPOA, now the public opinion in Iran is turning against Europe for its lack of action in implementing the promised financial channel to (or the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)). He referred to the successive delays by the European countries in implementing the SPV, “the claim that the European countries are incapable of convincing and guiding the European countries to financially cooperate with Iran with Iran is condemned and unacceptable according to international law.” Kharrazi further made it clear that Iran will not give in to pressures on the way to preserve its independence. The Italian delegation, for their part, stressed that Iran’s expectation for the practical steps by Europe to benefit from the nuclear deal is understandable. The Italians further described the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal as in violation of the international law, while acknowledging that Europe hugely depends on the United States.

BRUSSELS/PARIS: In Tehran on Jan. 8 during a meeting with European envoys, Iranian officials abruptly stood up, walked out and slammed the door in an extraordinary break with protocol. The French, British, German, Danish, Dutch, and Belgian diplomats in the Iranian Foreign Ministry room had incensed the officials with a message that Europe could no longer tolerate ballistic missile tests in Iran and assassination plots on European soil, according to four EU diplomats. “There was a lot of drama, they didn’t like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns,” one of the diplomats said. “It shows the relationship is becoming more tense,” a second said. An Iranian official declined to comment on the meeting. The next day, the EU imposed its first sanctions on Iran since world powers agreed the 2015 Vienna nuclear arms control deal with Tehran. The sanctions were largely symbolic but the stormy meeting encapsulated the unexpected shift in European diplomacy since the end of last year.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer A veteran German diplomat has warned that Iranian regime’s officials are “shooting themselves in the foot” following the arrest of an Afghan-German man on espionage charges. Wolfgang Ischinger said that Iran regime’s actions in Germany and elsewhere were raising political concerns and could well threaten the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and five world powers the UK, Russia, France, China, and Germany.Ischinger, a former German ambassador in Washington, said on Thursday: “Iran should be smart enough to realise that is shooting itself in the foot because it is harming the political mood surrounding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA).” Germany, France, and the UK have all remained committed to the 2015 nuclear deal, which lifts sanctions on the Gulf state in exchange for supposed restrictions on its nuclear programme, even though the US pulled out last May and reimposed sanctions; sanctions that Europe has promised to help Iran evade. The US said that that agreement was “not a fair deal” and that Iran still posed a serious security threat, which seems like a fair assessment more than ever. While the deal only covers Iran’s nuclear programme and not other malign behaviour, which is one of the reasons that the US pulled out, if Iran keeps up this destabilising behaviour, then Europe, which has already this month imposed sanctions on Iran for terrorism, could well abandon the deal too. Spying Case It is believed that Germany has expressed grave concern about this suspected spying case, which involved a member of the German military who was arrested on Tuesday, to a senior Iranian diplomat earlier this week. A Germany foreign ministry source said: “The foreign ministry addressed the case [unmistakeably] with the manager of the Iranian embassy on January 15 and expressed our grave concern about the suspected intelligence activities.” Ischinger, chair of the Munich Security Conference, condemned Iran’s actions but does not believe that Iran would curb its spying activities even if there were a formal agreement about it. The Munich Security Conference Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif will be one of the over 100 heads of state and other senior world leaders attending the Munich Security Conference on February 15-17. Other attendees include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanual Macron, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Saudi State Minister Adel al-Jubeir, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, many of whom are concerned about Iran’s malign behaviour in the Middle East and across the world.

News article:
BRUSSELS/PARIS: In Tehran on Jan. 8 during a meeting with European envoys, Iranian officials abruptly stood up, walked out and slammed the door in an extraordinary break with protocol. The French, British, German, Danish, Dutch, and Belgian diplomats in the Iranian foreign ministry room had incensed the officials with a message that Europe could no longer tolerate ballistic missile tests in Iran and assassination plots on European soil, according to four EU diplomats. “There was a lot of drama, they didn’t like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns,” one of the diplomats said. “It shows the relationship is becoming more tense,” a second said. An Iranian official declined to comment on the meeting. The next day, the European Union imposed its first sanctions on Iran since world powers agreed the 2015 Vienna nuclear arms control deal with Tehran. The sanctions were largely symbolic but the stormy meeting encapsulated the unexpected shift in European diplomacy since the end of last year. Smaller, more dovish EU countries have joined France and Britain in a harder stance on Tehran, including considering new economic sanctions, diplomats say. Those could include asset freezes and travel bans on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Iranians developing the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program, three diplomats said. The new approach moves Europe closer to U.S. President Donald Trump’s policy of isolating Iran with tough sanctions even though European governments still support the 2015 Vienna deal from which he withdrew in May. Although there are diverging views in Europe, the shift could have consequences for President Hassan Rouhani’s government as it looks to European capitals to salvage that deal. It could also strengthen anti-Western sentiment in Iran and lead to more aggressive Iranian moves around the Middle East, where the Islamic Republic is involved in proxy wars with its main regional rival Saudi Arabia. Iran’s firing of short-range ballistic missiles into Syria on Sept. 30, missile tests and a satellite launch this month have niggled Western powers. For Europe, alleged assassination plots by Iran on French and Danish soil in 2018 were the last straw, diplomats say. Tehran denies the plots and says the missile tests are purely defensive. “The accusations against Iran over the past few months have awoken a few countries in Europe that were against a tougher line on Iran,” a European-based Middle East diplomat said. The same day as the meeting, the Netherlands publicly blamed Iran for killings on its soil in 2015 and 2017. Tehran denies any involvement. Then on Jan. 9, the EU designated a unit of Iran’s intelligence ministry a terrorist organization, froze its assets and those of two men. “Take the Dutch for example. They had kept very quiet until the Danish attack and now they are more hawkish than the French,” said the diplomat. Alarmed by Trump’s “America First” policy, Europe considered his May 8 decision to pull out of the Iran accord a severe setback but Iran’s international ambitions appear to offer Brussels and Washington a chance to work more closely. A U.S. State Department official said there was now “a growing international consensus” on the range of Iranian threats. “The U.S. welcomes Europe’s efforts to counter Iranian terrorism on European soil, its missile launches, human rights abuses, and other threats,” the official said. As the Trump administration accused Iran last year of harboring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, the EU sought dialogue with Tehran. At meetings between European and Iranian diplomats last year, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, pressed for gestures on Iran’s role in Syria’s war and for help to end the conflict in Yemen. But multiple bilateral talks on the ballistic missile program have yielded no results. The EU tried to show Iran that compliance with the nuclear accord would still mean economic benefits despite Trump’s decision to reimpose U.S. sanctions and choke off Iranian oil exports by pressuring U.S. allies. The European Union is set to officially launch a mechanism, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to trade with Iran later this month but it will not be operational for several months. It will be registered in France, run by a German and likely to include Britain as a shareholder. “There’s a feeling of frustration among Britain, France and Germany, and others, after the first phase of diplomacy with Iran,” another senior EU diplomat said. “We thought we could get some effort from the Iranians in several areas.” Iran says Europe may not be able to safeguard the nuclear deal anyway and accused European officials of dragging their feet. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister and senior nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi said last week “operational steps” were needed from Europe as political support not enough. Trump, Kim to meet at second nuclear summit Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of Iran’s powerful Assembly of Experts said on Thursday Europe “would do nothing in our interest.”

European Union officials confirmed plans to stay away from a US-organised regional summit on Iran next month as foreign ministers sought agreement on Monday for a new body to overcome US President Donald Trump’s sanctions on Iran. A meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday discussed the bloc’s plans to help European businesses trade with Iran despite American sanctions on trade and investment but officials said afterwards the talks did not reach a conclusion. However Monday's meeting came as European countries were preparing to impose their own punishments on Tehran for its foreign and security policies. Germany banned an Iranian airline from its airspace over accusations it took weapons and advisers to help support President Bashar Al Assad's forces in Syria's civil war. A senior German government source said Berlin revoked the landing rights of Mahan Air because of suspicions it was being used for military purposes by Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and also on safety grounds. Meanwhile asset freezes and travel bans were confirmed for five Syrians linked to strongman Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons programme. The EU also sanctioned the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, an organisation accused of playing a role in the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. The discussions also touched on EU representation to the coming Middle East summit in Poland, led by the US, on February 13-14. Ministers from several EU states have already said they would not attend. Ms Mogherini said she will not take part as her officials privately described the event as an anti-Iran conference. Speaking on her way into the meeting, Ms Mogherini said she would be attending an African Union gathering in Ethiopia during the Warsaw meeting. She also revealed that there would be a joint meeting with the Arab League at its February summit. Now we know why @FedericaMog is skipping #US-#Poland 'Middle East' summit in Warsaw on Feb 13-14. She'll be at an African Union summit, she says, in Addis. #Iran @SecPompeo — laurence norman (@laurnorman) January 21, 2019 France is also unlikely to send its foreign minister, according to European diplomats. Luxembourg’s foreign minister said he would miss the event because of a prior arrangement. The UK and Germany have not yet taken any official position but are unlikely to show up. The big decision facing the EU remains over the 2015 Iran nuclear deal as it seeks to create a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle to handle economic ties with Tehran despite the renewed American sanctions. The SPV is expected to launch later this month but officials warn it will not be operational until later in the year. It will be registered in France, run by Germany and is likely to include Britain as a shareholder. "There's a feeling of frustration among Britain, France and Germany, and others, after the first phase of diplomacy with Iran," a senior EU diplomat said.

Those could include asset freezes and travel bans on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Iranians developing the country's ballistic missile programme. The Brussels meeting also confirmed the two most senior officers in Russian military intelligence would face sanctions and formally identified the two agents accused by Britain of carrying out a chemical attack. The EU accused the Russians -- two agents and the head and the deputy head of the GRU -- of orchestrating the "possession, transport and use" of the nerve agent used in Salisbury, England last March, in a failed attempt to assassinate a defector. The agents are accused of travelling under the pseudonyms Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, but the sanctions order confirms reports that identify them as Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin, both 39 years old.

News article:
Mahan Air had previously come under sanctions from the US for allegedly helping the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to smuggle weapons and personnel. The absence of equivalent measures by the US government’s European allies was widely recognized as one of many indicators of diverging priorities for the US and Europe with respect to Iran policy. But Germany’s decision to ban Mahan from its airspace may be one of a growing number of signs that European governments are pivoting in the direction of the White House’s more assertive strategy. On the other hand, signs of this shift remain inconsistent and there is parallel evidence of the European Union digging in its heels with respect to the preservation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and the defiance of US sanctions that have been put into place since President Donald Trump withdrew from that agreement last May. As long European officials appear to be reaching out to their Iranian counterparts, Tehran may be justified in expecting that its public outcry over measures like the Mahan sanctions will have an effect. So far, there is little reason to believe that Germany will revise its decision regarding the heavily scrutinized commercial airline. But there is also relatively little reason to suppose that that move will spark similar measures across Europe. To the contrary, the government of France indicated on Wednesday that it and its fellow EU member states were pressing forward with plans to implement a payment mechanism to be used in evading US sanctions during transactions between Iranian and European entities. Reuters quoted French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian as saying that this Special Purpose Vehicle “should be implemented in the coming days.” Le Drian also went on to specifically state that the SPV was expected to give Iran the ability to benefit from the sale of “some of its oil resources” as well as buying goods from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom – all signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Until recently, the EU had provided very few details about the SPV while struggling to find a country that was willing to host its operations. It now appears that France will personally fill that role, while Germany will provide its leadership personnel and representatives of all three nations will serve as shareholders. This may be surprising to some observers, because despite their commitment to the JCPOA, the thee countries have also been more vocal than many of their fellow EU member states in criticizing Tehran’s regional activities, ballistic missile tests, and so on. Late last year, France and the UK joined in calling a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss Iran’s apparent violations of the body’s Resolution 2231, which calls upon the Islamic Republic to avoid all work on weapons that are designed to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. And earlier in 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron took the rare step of exceeding American commitments to anti-Iran policies when he criticized the US president’s suggestion that he might pull forces out of Syria, effectively leaving Iranian influence over the war-torn country unchecked. This goes to show that while most Western powers are notably anxious about Iran’s activities in the Middle East and throughout the globe, this has not translated into close alignment among their various policies. To the extent that this represents a problem for American and European policymakers, it may be addressed to some extent at a conference in the Polish capital of Warsaw, which was teased by its prospective host, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during his recent tour of the Middle East. Pompeo initially explained that the gathering would focus on Middle Eastern affairs but would give special attention to the issue of containing the Islamic Republic of Iran and convincing it to “behave like a normal country.” This also gave rise to predictable Iranian backlash, with some European officials joining in condemning Pompeo for overly narrow and antagonistic focus on one part of the region. Newsweek reported on Wednesday that this criticism had prompted the White House to change its approach to discussing the forthcoming conference. Iran has not been mentioned by name in recent communications, although Pompeo and other officials continue to call attention to issues like “missile development and proliferation” and “threats posed by proxy groups across the region” that are unmistakably associated with the Islamic Republic. Furthermore, the Newsweek report notes that Iran has still not been invited to take part in the conference, though its regional adversaries have been. Russia, a close ally of Iran, has declined to participate in spite of an invitation, and has questioned why Iran is not welcome at an event that is ostensibly focused on the Middle East in general. The conference’s Polish hosts reportedly responded with non-committal remarks about considering the extension of an invitation, but there is no indication that Warsaw is under pressure on this matter from parties other than Russia. This may suggest that the Europeans are generally satisfied with a change in the tone of the White House’s rhetoric, even if the ensuing conference remains effectively focused on confronting Iranian threats. It is also conceivable that this is part of a broader effort to allay some of Tehran’s concerns while actively pursuing consensus over more assertive policies, in line with those of the US. This may go some ways toward explaining apparent overstatements that the French Foreign Ministry made about the SPV, provided that these were made intentionally. The Reuters report on the SPV implementation noted that while EU diplomats confirmed Le Drian’s claim that the mechanism could launch in mere days, they also explained that there were serious barriers to its actual usage. Thus, the SPV may have little to no real effect until several months after its official launch. The same diplomats also indicated that current expectations for the SPV are considerably more subdued than they were when it was originally conceived. That is to say, it may only facilitate small-scale trade involving specific categories of products, like agricultural and humanitarian goods. This stands in contrast to French statements about “some oil resources,” which the EU reportedly considered dropping from SPV operations in the wake of widespread outcry against Iranian ballistic missile tests. Apart from such public statements, there is also substantive evidence that the international community is less eager to defy US sanctions than it once appeared to be. For instance, Reuters reported on Monday that Iran had failed to find any buyers after offering its oil on the stock exchange. According to the report, this tactic only led to the sale of 280,000 barrels in October, before US sanctions came back into force following withdrawal from the JCPOA. Afterward, Iran was only able to offload the rest of the one million barrels it had put on offer by reducing the price from 74 to 64 dollars per barrel. Now that the US sanctions are nearly back in full effect, Iran is compelled to look toward markets other than Europe in an effort to keep its oil-dependent economy afloat. Another Reuters report indicated on Monday that Tehran was boasting about new Japanese loadings of Iranian oil, following other such loadings from China, India, and South Korea. These four countries are the largest Asian buyers of Iranian oil and have consequently received waivers for US sanctions. However, these waivers are contingent upon the recipients taking measures to reduce their dependence on Iranian oil, and South Korea went as far as halting its Iranian oil purchases altogether for four months, before resuming them last weekend. The latest increase in purchasing activity is expected to be temporary for all parties involved, provided that Western pressure continues to escalate. The buyers responsible for the latest Japanese loadings have indicated that they may not be able to secure insurance for their transportation of Iranian oil after March, in which case they would cease imports. As long as Western pressure does remain a factor, Iran may find itself increasingly dependent upon illicit exports. But this would almost certainly add to Western scrutiny of Iran’s behavior, and thus to further efforts to confront that behavior. Last week, the UN Security Council released an 85-page report on the situation in Yemen, which pointed out that Iran is illegally shipping fuel to the Houthi rebels to help finance their war, thereby contributing further to a humanitarian crisis that is drawing ever louder demands for international action.

News article:
Ahead of next month’s international meeting in Poland to discuss threats to the stability of the Middle East, The Financial Times is reporting that Germany, France, and the UK are seeking to shore up support for the 2015 nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran. And yet, according to a recent Reuters report, Iran appears to be doing all it can to alienate these champions of the deal. French, British, German, Danish, Dutch, and Belgian diplomats conveyed a message to Iranian foreign ministry officials that the EU would no longer tolerate Iran’s ballistic missile tests or terror plots on European soil. The Iranians, according to Reuters, “abruptly stood up, walked out and slammed the door in an extraordinary break with protocol.” No Iranians commented on the incident, but one European diplomat said, “There was a lot of drama, they didn’t like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns.” A second diplomat added, “It shows the relationship is becoming more tense.” Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... The context for the Iranian blow-up is important. In November 2017, an Iranian dissident was gunned down in Amsterdam. Only recently has the Dutch government become vocal about Iran’s involvement in the killing. In June of last year, France, Germany, and Belgium foiled a planned attack against a meeting of thousands of Iranian opposition supporters just north of Paris, which was also attended by leading US figures. An Iranian diplomat, accredited to Tehran’s mission in Austria, was implicated in the plot. In October, Denmark pushed for Europe to impose sanctions on Iran, after foiling an Iranian plot to kill dissidents in the Scandinavian nation. Earlier this month, the Dutch government accused Tehran of hiring criminals linked to Hezbollah’s global drug empire to assassinate dissidents living in the Netherlands, and the EU imposed sanctions on Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence for a widespread campaign of assassination plots across Europe. Instead of trying to answer the European envoys and assure them (even falsely) that these attacks on their soil were aberrations that would not happen again, the Iranians stormed out of the meeting. This hardly seems to be the ideal way for Iran to influence nations that will be deciding the fate of the nuclear deal, which Iran views to be to its benefit. Already in October, The Washington Post reported that the attempted Paris attack had “sparked growing anxiety” among Europeans, the United States, and Israel that Iran is increasing its intelligence activities abroad in preparation for more “audacious” terror attacks. Citing American, European, and Middle Eastern experts familiar with the intelligence, Iran is “making contingency plans to strike at the country’s adversaries in the event of open conflict,” the Post said. The Iranian preparations for possible attacks include deploying surveillance units to track opponents of the regime, as well as Jewish and Israeli organizations in both Europe and the US. A Middle Eastern intelligence official told the Post that there has been a “definite uptick” in activities by Iranian agents recently. The official added that Iran is preparing “for the possibility of conflict.” The Post also noted that in August, the US Department of Justice charged two Iranian men with espionage. They were accused of gathering information on Jewish and Israeli sites, as well as individuals associated with the rebel group MEK, and passing the information on to Iran. Perhaps most ominously for Iran, Germany just decided to ban its second-largest carrier, Mahan Air, from operating in Germany. The German government, which has been pushing normalization with Iran more enthusiastically than most nations, decided that allowing an airline that ferries military personnel and equipment to Syria might present a security risk for its own people. “The German decision is based on considerations of our security needs,” Steffen Seibert, a German government spokesman, said. “It cannot be ruled out that this airline could also transport cargo to Germany that threatens our security. This is based on knowledge of past terrorist activities by Iran in Europe.” Despite the risks of alienating the Europeans, Iran has refused to address the threats it presents to Europe. Iran is even acting as the injured party. Iran appears to value the nuclear deal for the respite that it gives Tehran from sanctions, but doesn’t appear willing to change its aggressive behavior to assuage European fears. This begs the question: With Iran’s aggression and deceit in full view, why does Europe cling to the illusion that the nuclear deal will in any way constrain Iran or change its behavior?

News article:
Iran vows to reconsider cooperation with Europe in case of new sanctions Iran Press TV Sat Jan 26, 2019 02:06AM Iran has strongly censured France for threatening to impose new sanctions against the Islamic Republic over its missile program, vowing to reconsider its relations with European countries in case such bans are imposed. The remarks were made by Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi in reaction to earlier comments by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. "Iran's military capabilities are part of the country's legitimate defense power and a guarantor of the Islamic Republic's national security, which is based on the doctrine of deterrence," Qassemi said Friday. "The Islamic Republic has designed its defense capabilities based on a realistic assessment of the existing threats," he said, vowing that the country would strengthen such capabilities to the extent it deems necessary. "Iran's missile capability is not negotiable, and this has been brought to the attention of the French side during the ongoing political dialogue between Iran and France," he said. Qassemi further noted that Le Drian's threat to impose new missile sanctions is against the spirit of political talks and cooperation between the two countries. He also vowed that Iran will reconsider its interaction with European countries in case these states impose any new sanctions against Tehran. "Iran has always sought to consolidate peace and stability in the region, and believes the mass sale of sophisticated and assault weapons by the US and some European countries, including France, has undermined regional stability and balance," he said. Qassemi's remarks came after the top French diplomat said his country is ready to impose further sanctions on Iran if no progress is made in talks over Tehran's ballistic missile program. "We are ready, if the talks don't yield results, to apply sanctions firmly, and they know it," Le Drian told reporters. Diplomats previously told Reuters that new sanctions being considered by EU countries over the missile issue could include asset freezes and travel bans on the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRCG) and people involved in Iran's ballistic missile program. Le Drian's threatening remarks come as the European Union is expected to launch its exclusive payment mechanism, known as Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), for facilitating non-dollar trade with Iran in a bid to circumvent the US sanctions against the Islamic Republic. The SPV "should be implemented in the coming days," Le Drian told the French parliament's foreign affairs committee on Wednesday. "It will work as a sort of clearing house that will allow in euros for Iran to benefit from some of its oil resources and at the same time buy essential products from the main three main (European) partners," he added. In May 2018, US President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, under which Tehran agreed to put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of nuclear-related sanctions, and decided to re-impose unilateral sanctions against Tehran.

The Trump administration is closely eyeing efforts in Europe to set up an alternative money payment channel to ease doing business with Iran and avoid running afoul of sanctions the US has levied on the Islamic Republic. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter The White House is putting the Europeans on notice, saying that if they try to do an end-run around US sanctions on Iran, they will be subject to stiff fines and penalties. Unfazed, the European Union is marching forward with the plan, which, if implemented, could further strain trans-Atlantic relations. Donald Trump (Photo: AP) A spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said preparations for the alternative system were "at an advanced stage." "I hope that we can announce the launch very soon," Maja Kocijancic told reporters late last week in Brussels. Getting out ahead of a possible announcement, a senior administration official said on Friday that the US will fully enforce its sanctions and hold individuals and entities accountable for undermining them. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue. "The choice is whether to do business with Iran or the United States," Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told the AP. "I hope our European allies choose wisely." The US joined China, France, Germany, Russia and Britain in signing a pact with Iran in 2015 that offered to lift economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran's pledge to rein in its nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump called it a "horrible, one-sided deal." He pulled out of the pact last year and restored punishing US sanctions on Iran. Tehran, which denies wanting nuclear weapons, continues to abide by the agreement, and the remaining five nations in the pact are trying to keep it intact. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (Photo: EPA) Restoring the sanctions regime is part of the Trump administration's "maximum pressure campaign" on the Iranians to force them to radically alter their policies on developing ballistic missiles, supporting regional militant groups and violating human rights. The US has many concerns about the alternative payment system, according to an outside Trump administration adviser. The adviser spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the key US worries. Long-term, the US worries that the alternative money payment system could become successful enough to compete with the international bank transfer system known as SWIFT. The fear is that it could eventually supplant SWIFT as the leading global institution for financial institutions to send and receive information about banking transactions. Secondly, the US is concerned that other countries might try to route transactions through the European system just to circumvent US sanctions, the adviser said. Thirdly, while the Europeans have signaled that the alternative money transfer system would be used only for humanitarian transactions, the US is suspicious that it could be used for non-humanitarian transactions to evade US sanctions, the adviser said. "We should oppose efforts to create foreign financial channels that Iran could use to circumvent America's maximum pressure campaign against it, especially when humanitarian exceptions are already in US sanctions laws," Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told the AP. As the administration prepares for the potential fallout from the possible the European move, it is pressing ahead with its sanctions campaign against Iran and preparing to co-host with Poland next month a conference that will focus on combatting Iranian threats. Iran's nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi (Photo: AP) On Thursday, Treasury imposed sanctions on two Iran-backed militias in Syria and on Qeshm Fars Air, an Iranian civilian airline it accuses of ferrying weapons and personnel to Syria to support President Bashar Assad's government. The sanctions block any assets those targeted might have in US jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them. At the same time, the State Department told Congress earlier this month that it would waive some Iranian sanctions to allow US companies to sell spare parts to Iranian airlines, which need them to operate aging, American-built Boeing jets. The waivers raised questions on Capitol Hill because some lawmakers are weighing legislation to specifically target Iran's civilian aviation sector. And Iran hawks outside the administration have expressed concern too. Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said Iran's aviation sector is being used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian military that has ties to militant networks, which Iran uses to expand its influence in the region and abroad. "What effective controls does the administration have in place to ensure that the aircraft receiving these licensed services are not facilitating Iran's support for these destructive activities?" he asked.

The United States has put the European Union on notice to not evade sanctions on Iran. “The choice is whether to do business with Iran or the United States,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), told the Associated Press. “I hope our European allies choose wisely.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Monday that the E.U. was about to create an alternative mechanism to send funds to Iran that would circumvent U.S. sanctions on the regime. He said Germany had been working on it with France, the United Kingdom and other E.U. members. “This has always been our goal and we will implement it,” said Maas. The E.U. has repeatedly expressed opposition to the U.S. withdrawing last May from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in addition to reimposing sanctions along with slapping on fresh economic penalties, and therefore has sought to help Iran cope with U.S. sanctions. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories The Brussels-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, blocked Iranian access to the international financial transaction system shortly after America reimposed its second round of sanctions in November. Iran will still be able to access SWIFT for solely humanitarian purposes.

The waivers raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill as some lawmakers are considering legislation to specifically target Iran’s civilian aviation sector. Iran hawks outside the administration have expressed concern as well. Finally, the United States issued temporary waivers in November to several countries over importing Iranian oil.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer The EU appears to be stalling on its implementation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to maintain trade with Iran and evade US sanctions, according to reports from Brussels on Monday, January 28, mainly because there are differences between EU member states over one of its ten articles. One EU diplomat stated: that Spain is opposing an article referring to Europe’s talks with Iran about its presence in Yemen because the southern European country was not present at the talks. On Friday, when it was expected that the EU would be announcing its SPV imminently, the US, which is adamant about “fully” enforcing its sanctions against Iran, was reported to be closely watching the EU’s efforts. According to the Associated Press, the White House is putting Europe “on notice” and saying that there will be “stiff fines and penalties” if Europe does try to subvert US sanctions. Senator Tom Cotton said: “The choice is whether to do business with Iran or the United States… I hope our European allies choose wisely.” Earlier that day, Maja Kocijancic, the representative for the EU Foreign Policy Chief, said that preparations for the SPV were at an “advanced stage” and that the system could launch “very soon”, while an informed EU source said that the SPV would be registered on Monday, January 28. However, at the same time, the European Council would release a statement to express concern over Iran’s regional military ambitions, ballistic missile program, hostile acts in EU, and violation of human rights. Of course, even if the SPV has fallen through in the EU, as it should because it not only violates US sanctions but also props up a despotic Regime, the EU’s economic support of the Iranian Regime is nothing compared to the political support it offers by remaining a part of the 2015 nuclear deal and legitimising the mullahs. The Iranian people have made their view clear. They want the Iranian Regime removed from power and they are determined to do it with the help of their Resistance forces, but all the while that Western governments continue to treat the Iranian Regime like it is a “normal” government that they can have a meaningful dialogue with, they spit on the wishes of the Iranian people for freedom. The US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in May 2018, citing Iran’s cheating, which has only become more obvious as time has gone on and increased support of the Iranian people. The EU should do the same.

Preparations for the alternative system are “at an advanced stage” according to Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. “I hope that we can announce the launch very soon,” she told reporters last week in Brussels. A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that the US will fully enforce its sanctions and hold individuals and entities accountable for undermining them. “The choice is whether to do business with Iran or the United States,” Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told the AP. “I hope our European allies choose wisely.” Trump called the Iran nuclear agreement a “horrible, one-sided deal.” He pulled out of the pact last year and restored US sanctions on Iran. Tehran continues to abide by the agreement, and the remaining nations in the pact are working hard to keep it intact. The Trump administration’s “maximum pressure campaign” is meant to force Iran to radically alter their policies on developing ballistic missiles, supporting regional militant groups, and violating human rights. As well, the US worries that an alternative money payment system could become successful enough to compete with the international bank transfer system known as SWIFT, and eventually supplant SWIFT as the leading global institution for financial institutions to send and receive information about banking transactions. The Europeans claim that the alternative money transfer system would be used only for humanitarian transactions, but the US is suspicious. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told the AP, “We should oppose efforts to create foreign financial channels that Iran could use to circumvent America’s maximum pressure campaign against it, especially when humanitarian exceptions are already in US sanctions laws.” Meanwhile, the US is preparing to co-host a conference with Poland next month that will focus on combatting Iranian threats. Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi called the Warsaw Summit, “an American move with clear goals. It is not necessarily about Iran, but pursues specific goals… I think one of the major goals of this conference is to create division among European countries.” The EU is still deciding on whether or not to take part in this conference.

News article:
By Kaveh L. Afrasiabi After months of debate and foot dragging, Europe has finally delivered a stunning blow to Trump administration’s unilateral Iran sanctions, by setting up a special financial mechanism to maintain trade with Iran and bypass US sanctions. This mechanism, labeled as Instrument In Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), is a brainchild of France, Germany, and England, banding together to neutralize any US opposition, reflecting strength in numbers. Initially announced in September, 2018 on the sideline of UN General Assembly’s meeting, this initiative represents an important step toward salvaging the Iran nuclear deal, which has been hanging by a thread as a result of US’s unilateral exit last August. Although the nuclear deal may still collapse for one reason or another, such as Iran’s unhappiness with the other signatories failure to normalize trade with Iran as called by the agreement, nonetheless the new European announcement on INSTEX has breathed a new life in the deal and increased its chance of survival. This is much to the chagrin of Trump administration, which opposes Europe’s initiative and has an uphill battle convincing the rest of the world that its actions on the nuclear deal and sanctions are justified. Concerning the latter, a new worldwide threat assessment by US intelligence community has directly contradicted the administration’s claim that Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons. Trump has criticized the report’s finding on Iran as “naïve” but there is no doubt that his Iran policy has been delivered two major blows almost simultaneously, by Europe and US’s own intelligence. A potential third blow is more indirect, as a result of Trump’s fateful decision to impose oil sanctions on Venezuela, which exports some half a million barrels a day to US, thus tightening the oil market, already jolted by US oil embargo on Iran. Unless the oil exemptions granted to 8 nations, which are due for renewal in May, 2019, are sustained, there is a likelihood of skyrocketing oil prices, hurting the US economy. Brian Hook, the head of State Department’s Iran Action Group, has hinted that the US will not renew those exemptions, yet most analysts predict otherwise. From Trump administration’s point of view, what is particularly troubling about the timing of EU-3’s announcement aforementioned is that it comes ahead of a US-Poland conference in Warsaw on the Middle East, which has been widely viewed as an anti-Iran forum seeking to build an international alliance against Iran. Both the INSTEX and the West European cold shoulder to this conference bode ill for Washington’s anti-Iran agenda — that has so far failed to generate much global sympathy, save Israel and Saudi Arabia. By asserting its independence, Europe has now demonstrated the futility of Trump advisers’ attacks on their Iran policy, reflecting a new transatlantic fissure bound to grow worse as a result of INSTEX. INSTEX has been welcomed by China, which seeks to join it in the future in order to maintain its lucrative trade with Iran, even though at the moment the emphasis is on ‘humanitarian goods’ yet chances are good to excellent that over time this mechanism will cover “sanctioned” trade as well and thus undermine the viability of US sanctions on Iran. Without doubt, the political significance of INSTEX, asserting Europe’s independent foreign policy, outweighs the economic benefits, and the greater credibility problem of Trump’s Iran policy is now irrefutable. In conclusion, US’s Iran policy is in a word in tatters, turned even more problematic by the ripple effects of the Venezuela crisis, all the more reason for Trump administration to review its policy and chart a new course of action based on diplomacy.

News article:
By Reza Shafiee The past few months have been rough in EU-Iran relationship. After the US President’s departure from the nuclear deal with Iran, EU has tried to salvage the deal on its own. But outlawed Iranian politicians have left very little room for the likes of enthusiastic EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini to maneuver in favor of the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran hits a raw nerve each time it stunts even its most optimistic backers with an announcement for testing a new ballistic missile. Only last week Iranian regime tested a new ballistic missile and told the world it was just a failed attempt to launch a new satellite in orbit. It is of course in direct violation of the Iranian regime’s obligation to adhere to UN Resolution 2231. But that is not the only issue the EU bloc has with Iran. Since 2015, starting with the Netherlands, Iran has been involved in a series of terrorist activities on European soil. Actions that the EU cannot afford to ignore. The bloc hit Iran with the first round of sanctions since 2015 Iran deal a few days ago. Although they are relatively mild they certainly send a strong message to Tehran that at the time the EU is trying to save the nuclear deal in the face of strong temptation from the US to leave Iran and instead impose crushing sanctions it expects the mullahs’ regime to behave. What happened on EU soil? Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his cronies in the regime planned revenge for their main opposition in response to what had happened in late 2017 and throughout 2018 in Iran. Widespread protests in the country were not something that the Iranian regime could take lightly. Khamenei has not missed a single opportunity to remind its base support in Iran, paramilitary Basij Force and Revolutionary Guards, of the existential threat the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), poses to the regime. Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) with its partner in crime, the Intelligence Unit of the Revolutionary Guards, and their sister, the Quds Force, are accomplices in cynical plans against the regime’s opposition. A section of the MOIS is the target of the January 8 sanctions imposed by the EU bloc. It all began by a failed MOIS plan to hit the Persian New Year Celebration of MEK in their new residence in Albania in March. Tehran has changed its pattern of dealing with its dissidents abroad and has removed the “moderation” mask altogether. In the 80s and early 90s, the nascent theocratic regime — not caring about the consequences of its actions — hunted down opposition figures in European capitals such as Paris, Berlin, and Rome. Now it seems that the ruling regime is revisiting the old terror tactics in Western cities again. The second stop in the renewed terror campaign — this time using Iranian trained spies turned diplomats instead of using proxies like Lebanese Hezbollah to do the dirty work — was where a large gathering of Iran’s main opposition the National Council of Resistance (NCRI) took place in Paris on June 30. Even as the rally unfolded, security forces in France, with the help of their German and Belgian partners, foiled a terrorist plot intending to target it. The timing of the plot was significant because Hassan Rouhani was scheduled to visit Austria the next day. Assadollah Assadi, with MOIS nickname, Daniel, masterminded the plot while under diplomatic immunity from the Austrian government. He was stationed in Vienna. Assadi was caught red-handed when he was giving the explosives and detonator to a sleeper cell, an Iranian born Belgian couple to carry out the attack. Later Assadi was extradited to Belgium where he is imprisoned waiting for his trial on terror charges. Assadi is one of two individuals named in the European Union’s first imposed sanctions against the Iranian regime since the nuclear accord was implemented three years ago. According to diplomatic and security sources last fall, France expelled an Iranian diplomat in response to the failed plot. France’s foreign ministry said on October 2, there was no doubt the Iranian intelligence ministry had been behind the plot against the June 30 rally in Paris. It subsequently froze assets belonging to Tehran’s intelligence services and two Iranian nationals. In July 2018, Dutch authorities said they had expelled two Iranian diplomats, who foreign officials say were linked to the assassinations of two Iranian dissidents. US officials believed Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security was involved. A Strong message from EU A strong message from EU was delivered on January 8th when French, British, German, Danish, Dutch, and Belgian diplomats arrived in the Iranian regime’s foreign ministry unexpected. The four EU diplomats were there to make sure Iran receives the message that the bloc will no longer tolerate Iranian regime’s missile tests and assassination plots on its soil. “There was a lot of drama, they didn’t like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns,” one of the diplomats said. “It shows the relationship is becoming more tense,” a second diplomat said. The next day the EU imposed its first sanctions on Tehran since the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. On issues, missile proliferation and terrorism-the clerical regime’s officials with no exception- Khamenei, Hassan Rouhani and Revolutionary Guards close ranks. With a strong and growing grass root opposition to the Iranian regime at home, it is only wise for the EU officials to cut their losses and leave behind a failed policy of appeasing mullahs. It has only harmed the Iranian people and Europe alike. This article was also published at https://medium.com/intpolicydigest/eu-at-a-turning-point-with-iran-47db5e937e65

The four EU diplomats were there to make sure Iran receives the message that the bloc will no longer tolerate Iranian regime’s missile tests and assassination plots on its soil. “There was a lot of drama, they didn’t like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns,” one of the diplomats said. “It shows the relationship is becoming more tense,” a second diplomat said. The next day the EU imposed its first sanctions on Tehran since the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. On issues, missile proliferation and terrorism-the clerical regime’s officials with no exception- Khamenei, Hassan Rouhani and Revolutionary Guards close ranks. With a strong and growing grass root opposition to the Iranian regime at home, it is only wise for the EU officials to cut their losses and leave behind a failed policy of appeasing mullahs. It has only harmed the Iranian people and Europe alike. This article was also published at https://medium.com/intpolicydigest/eu-at-a-turning-point-with-iran-47db5e937e65

News article:
The European Union has struck out at Iran over its missile program and "unacceptable behavior" in Europe and the Middle East. Tehran has rejected the concerns as "baseless" and "non-constructive." The European Union on Monday urged Iran to put an "immediate end" to "unacceptable behavior," including refraining from any further ballistic missiles tests or attempts to assassinate Iranian dissidents on European soil. The warning, which prompted a terse response from Tehran, has come amid pressure from the United States to counter growing Iranian influence in Europe and the Middle East. What the EU said: The EU is "gravely concerned by Iran's ballistic missile activity" and calls on Iran to refrain from any further launches that violate United Nations Security Council orders. The bloc is "deeply concerned by the hostile activities that Iran has conducted on the territory of several Member States." Brussels has "serious concerns regarding Iran's military involvement and continuous presence of Iranian forces in Syria." The EU nevertheless continues to support a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that lifted Western sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. The bloc regrets President Donald Trump's decision last year to withdraw the US from the deal. How Iran responded: In a statement carried by the Tasnim news agency, Iran's foreign ministry said "raising such baseless and hollow accusations while known terrorist and criminal groups are free in Europe, is non-constructive at this stage, and is in line with the goals of enemies who seek to undermine Iran's relations with Europe."

Last month, the US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said US pressure had convinced Germany to ban Iran's Mahan Air over the airline's suspected links to Iran's elite force, the Revolutionary Guard. The German government denied the move was a result of US pressure. New missiles, old suspicions: The EU statement came days after Iran unveiled the new Hoveizeh cruise missile with a range of more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles). Tehran claims their missiles comply with a UN order because they cannot carry nuclear warheads and have limited range. EU sanctions Iranian intelligence: The EU has accused Iran of involvement in attempts to assassinate Iranian dissidents in France, Denmark and the Netherlands. The bloc sanctioned Iran's Ministry for Intelligence and Security in January for its alleged involvement in the attacks. Iran's involvement in Syria: For years, Iran has provided training, weapons and intelligence to troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad. Iranian-backed Hezbollah and other Shiite militias are also fighting alongside regime forces. Brussels tries to sidestep US sanctions: The EU has tried to circumvent sanctions the US reapplied on Iran following its withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal.

FM spokesman censures slow progress of INSTEX IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Feb 18, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman here on Monday criticized the slow progress of implementing the Instrument for Supporting Trade Exchanges between Iran and Europe (INSTEX) between Iran and Europe. Speaking in his weekly press briefing, Bahram Qasemi said INSTEX is still in its early stages and urged the European side to implement it as soon as possible. On January 31, Germany, France and the UK set up a payment channel with Iran called INSTEX, to help continue trade with Tehran and circumvent the US sanctions. The Paris-based transactions channel, named INSTEX - Instrument In Support Of Trade Exchanges, is run by a German national, and the three countries are shareholders in it. The US is not happy with improving Iran-Europe relations, he said, adding that Washington is continuing its pressures and acts of sabotage against Tehran. He added an expert meeting, attended by European officials and the Iranian foreign ministry and economic apparatus, would be held to review the INSTEX within days. Qasemi pointed out that Iran has made it clear to Europe that the patience of the Iranian nation and government "is not limitless" so the Europeans should implement it very fast. Elsewhere in his remarks, he noted that Europe's financial mechanism for trade with Iran and the four Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) bills in the country are not interrelated. Qasemi underlined that the Islamic Republic of Iran is not a county which would yield to terms and conditions. 9060**1424 NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
The Diplomatic-Security Cabinet is expected within two weeks to approve a major cut to the tax revenues that Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, with the amount the P.A. pays to terrorists and their families to be deducted from the money Israel hands over to the P.A. The reduction will be enacted under a law passed this past summer by Knesset members Elazar Stern (Yesh Atid) and Avi Dichter (Likud), which requires the Defense Ministry to provide the cabinet with data on the amount the P.A. pays terrorists and their families. The Finance Ministry will then withhold that amount from the tax funds. For some weeks, the Defense Ministry has been assiduously collecting figures to determine the exact amount that the P.A. pays out in “terror salaries.” According to the mechanism stipulated by the law, after a report on the salaries is presented, the Finance Ministry will carry out the deduction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said in closed-door talks that the deduction will go ahead, although he expressed concern that the reduced tax funds would hurt the stability of the P.A. He also said he would look for a way to carry out the demands of the law while ensuring that the P.A. remains stable. Dichter, who serves as chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said in response to recent reports on the amount of the P.A. terror salaries that “every shekel the Palestinian Authority pays to terrorists will be deducted [from the tax funds.] That is how we create deterrence against terrorism.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Israel Hayom recently reported that in 2018, the P.A. paid out 502 million shekels ($138 million) to living terrorists. A probe by the Palestinian Media Watch group showed that at least 230 million shekels ($63 million) had been paid to terrorists currently in prison. The government ministries involved in the deduction have not yet specified the amount to be withheld from the tax revenues Israel will hand over to the Palestinian Authority.

Source: Xinhua| 2019-02-05 23:07:32|Editor: Mu Xuequan Video Player Close RAMALLAH, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA) government on Tuesday slammed the Israeli moves to cut off the financial aid allocated for prisoners in Israeli jails. The government said in a statement following its weekly cabinet meeting in the West bank city of Ramallah that "the PA's tax money ... belongs to the Palestinian treasury and the Palestinian people." The statement described the Israeli moves as an "act of piracy and a breach of the agreements" signed between the PA and Israel. It blamed the Israeli government of coordinating with the U.S. administration "to pressure Palestinians and force the Palestinian leadership to accept the century deal." The government urged the U.S. administration to "stop its incitement and pressure policy, as it continues to pay billions of U.S. dollars to Israel and cover it's crimes against the Palestinian people." Israeli public radio said on Monday that the Israeli government is going to approve the deduction of financial allocations paid by the PA to families of the prisoners in Israeli jails. Last July, the Israeli Knesset (parliament) passed a new bill, allowing Israeli authorities to deduct millions of dollars from the Palestinian tax revenues it collects on behalf of the PA. According to the bill, a special committee will put away the money into a fund and can only approve to pay it back if the PA stops its financial aid to the prisoners' families. Palestinian officials described the law as "theft" and accused Israel of using it for political pressure and collective punishment.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told cabinet ministers on Sunday he would, in a week’s time, begin cutting funds to the Palestinian Authority over its payments to terrorists and their families. “By the end of the week, the staff work required for implementing the law on deducting terrorists’ salaries will be completed,” the prime minister said at the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. “Next Sunday I will convene the security cabinet and we will approve the decision needed to withhold the funds. The funds will be deducted. No one should doubt that. And next week,” he vowed. The comments come amid pressure on Netanyahu to act after the arrest of a Palestinian man, Arafat Irfayia, 29, on Friday following the brutal murder of 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher in a southern Jerusalem wood a day earlier. The case has sparked outrage across the country. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Shin Bet security service, Israel Police and IDF are still investigating the murder, but increasingly suspect that Irfayia had a nationalistic motive. The prime minister has not directly referred to the murder as a terror attack. The Knesset passed a law in July slashing Palestinian tax funds Israel transfers to the PA by the amount Ramallah pays to convicted terrorists and the families of Palestinians killed while carrying out attacks. The law was opposed by Israeli security officials who fear further cuts to the Palestinian Authority’s budget could hurt security cooperation or destabilize the West Bank and lead to new terror attacks against Israelis. Advertisement The government has refused to implement the power given to it by the law to freeze the fund transfers. But politicians have faced public pressure to crack down on the PA’s payments, which are viewed as incentivizing terror attacks. The Yesh Atid party slammed Netanyahu’s statement Sunday, calling it too little too late. “It’s a shame it took [Netanyahu] ‘only’ 40 days [since the law came into force] and the despicable murder of Ori Ansbacher to decide to act,” the party’s statement said. “If the prime minister… was focused on the lives of the public and not just on his own investigations, the law for the deduction of terrorists’ salaries, which we passed together with [Likud MK] Avi Dichter, would already have been implemented, and the motivation of potential terrorists would have been lessened. We hope this time Netanyahu will actually act, and not suffice with pronouncements,” the statement concluded. Education Minister Naftali Bennett welcomed the move, but also noted the delay in implementation since the law came into effect. “This promise must be fulfilled as soon as possible,” Bennett tweeted. “But it should be noted that the law has been valid for more than a month and has not yet been implemented.” Advertisement A PA law legislated in 2004 says any Palestinian prisoner and his or her family are entitled to a variety of payments. The law defines a prisoner as “anyone who is sitting in the occupation’s prisons for participating in the struggle against the occupation” and calls such a person “part and parcel of the Palestinian Arab community’s fabric.” Palestinian officials have argued payments to security prisoners seek to mitigate what they call an unfair Israeli military court system. The conviction rate in Israel’s military courts stands at almost 100 percent, B’tselem, an Israeli rights group said in a March 2018 report. The PA allocated NIS 691 million ($183 million) for the families of so-called “martyrs” and wounded persons in its 2018 budget, a report by the Jerusalem-based think tank JCPA said last week. “Martyrs” include Palestinians killed while carrying out terror attacks against Israelis, as well as those killed in clashes with security forces, violent acts undertaken by settlers and other cases. It is not clear exactly how many “martyrs” were killed while carrying out attacks. Last March, US President Donald Trump signed into law legislation that requires the American government to cut some aid to the Palestinians until they end payments to terrorists and slain attackers. Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians. Abbas has said the PA will continue to pay stipends to the families of Palestinian security prisoners and “martyrs” even if it has to spend its last penny to do so. Advertisement “We will not accept a cut or cancellation of salaries to the families of martyrs and prisoners, as some are trying to bring about,” he told representatives of a Palestinian prisoners advocacy group in July. “Even if we have only a penny left, we will give it to the martyrs, the prisoners and their families.” On Sunday morning the IDF entered Irfayia’s home in the West Bank city of Hebron in order to measure the structure “to evaluate ways to demolish it,” the army said. Right-wing politicians over the weekend called for the instituting of a death penalty for terrorists in Israeli law. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked told Channel 13 news Saturday that “the military prosecution needs to ask for the death penalty.” “We should not hide the truth,” she told the news channel. “He killed Ori because she was a Jewish girl.” Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan told the Kan public broadcaster on Sunday that the death penalty should be used in certain circumstances. “If the murderer abused his victim and if we understand that there is no way to rehabilitate him, and in cases of the murder of a family, the death penalty should be used,” Erdan said. Ansbacher, from the settlement of Tekoa in the West Bank south of Jerusalem, was found dead in the woods at the Ein Yael nature reserve in south Jerusalem late Thursday with what police said were “signs of violence” on her body after she was reported missing earlier in the day.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told cabinet ministers on Sunday he would, in a week’s time, begin cutting funds to the Palestinian Authority over its payments to terrorists and their families. “By the end of the week, the staff work required for implementing the law on deducting terrorists’ salaries will be completed,” the prime minister said at the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. “Next Sunday I will convene the security cabinet and we will approve the decision needed to withhold the funds. The funds will be deducted. No one should doubt that. And next week,” he vowed. The comments come amid pressure on Netanyahu to act after the arrest of a Palestinian man, Arafat Irfayia, 29, on Friday following the brutal murder of 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher in a southern Jerusalem wood a day earlier. The case has sparked outrage across the country. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Shin Bet security service, Israel Police and IDF are still investigating the murder, but increasingly suspect that Irfayia had a nationalistic motive. The prime minister has not directly referred to the murder as a terror attack. The Knesset passed a law in July slashing Palestinian tax funds Israel transfers to the PA by the amount Ramallah pays to convicted terrorists and the families of Palestinians killed while carrying out attacks. The law was opposed by Israeli security officials who fear further cuts to the Palestinian Authority’s budget could hurt security cooperation or destabilize the West Bank and lead to new terror attacks against Israelis. Advertisement The government has refused to implement the power given to it by the law to freeze the fund transfers. But politicians have faced public pressure to crack down on the PA’s payments, which are viewed as incentivizing terror attacks. The Yesh Atid party slammed Netanyahu’s statement Sunday, calling it too little too late. “It’s a shame it took [Netanyahu] ‘only’ 40 days [since the law came into force] and the despicable murder of Ori Ansbacher to decide to act,” the party’s statement said. “If the prime minister… was focused on the lives of the public and not just on his own investigations, the law for the deduction of terrorists’ salaries, which we passed together with [Likud MK] Avi Dichter, would already have been implemented, and the motivation of potential terrorists would have been lessened. We hope this time Netanyahu will actually act, and not suffice with pronouncements,” the statement concluded. Education Minister Naftali Bennett welcomed the move, but also noted the delay in implementation since the law came into effect. “This promise must be fulfilled as soon as possible,” Bennett tweeted. “But it should be noted that the law has been valid for more than a month and has not yet been implemented.” Advertisement A PA law legislated in 2004 says any Palestinian prisoner and his or her family are entitled to a variety of payments. The law defines a prisoner as “anyone who is sitting in the occupation’s prisons for participating in the struggle against the occupation” and calls such a person “part and parcel of the Palestinian Arab community’s fabric.” Palestinian officials have argued payments to security prisoners seek to mitigate what they call an unfair Israeli military court system. The conviction rate in Israel’s military courts stands at almost 100 percent, B’tselem, an Israeli rights group said in a March 2018 report. The PA allocated NIS 691 million ($183 million) for the families of so-called “martyrs” and wounded persons in its 2018 budget, a report by the Jerusalem-based think tank JCPA said last week. “Martyrs” include Palestinians killed while carrying out terror attacks against Israelis, as well as those killed in clashes with security forces, violent acts undertaken by settlers and other cases. It is not clear exactly how many “martyrs” were killed while carrying out attacks. Last March, US President Donald Trump signed into law legislation that requires the American government to cut some aid to the Palestinians until they end payments to terrorists and slain attackers.

The Israeli government will approve a law to confiscate funds allocated by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to Palestinians it claims are involved in attacks against Israeli targets, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. Israel collects tariffs and duties on behalf of the Ramallah-based PA under 1994 Oslo Accords "Next Sunday, I will convene the security cabinet and we will make the necessary decision to offset the funds," Netanyahu said during the weekly cabinet meeting.

Senior Palestinian officials are harshly criticizing the decision by the Israeli security cabinet to implement a law deducting tax revenues otherwise sent to the Palestinian Authority, over its payments to terrorists and their families. “Deducting funds from the Palestinian treasury is a form of collective punishment imposed by Israel,” he says according to the Kan public broadcaster. “This could jeopardize the Palestinian economy and undermine the PA’s ability to pay its salaries on time.” Senior Palestine Liberation Organization official Ahmed Majdalani accuses Israel and the US, which has cut hundreds of millions of dollars in Palestinian aid, of an attempt at blackmail. “The occupation government is seeking to destroy the national authority in partnership with the US administration of Donald Trump,” Majdalani says in a statement. Other PA officials tell Channel 13 that PA President Mahmoud Abbas may refuse to accept all of the tax revenue to protest the Israeli move. The officials say the move is likely to damage Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation.

A spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas denounced Israel’s decision to cut half a billion shekels in funds over its payments to security prisoners and their families Sunday. Nabil Abu Rudeineh called the decision to implement the law “piracy of the Palestinian people’s money.” Abu Rudeinah warned that the decision would have serious repercussions and would be placed at the top of the agenda when the PA leadership meets in the coming days. “We consider this arbitrary Israeli decision to be a one-sided blow to the signed agreements, including the Paris Protocols,” he said, referring to an annex of the Oslo Accords that defines Israel and the PA’s economic relations.

Some analysts have predicted that it may also lead to a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip should Abbas cut funds to the coastal enclave in order to continue paying security prisoners. Abu Rudeineh said the move would not keep the Palestinians from supporting “imprisoned heroes” or the families of those killed while carrying out attacks. Acting PA Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said Israel’s cutting of PA funds is “a part of a plan to destroy the National Authority and deny it the ability to continue to provide services and fulfill its commitments to its citizens.” Advertisement “Cutting the maqasa funds puts the Palestinian economy in danger and threatens our ability to pay employees’ salaries on time,” he added, using the Arabic term that refers to the taxes that Israel collects on behalf of the PA and then transfers back to Ramallah. “We are ready for all the scenarios if the Israeli government actually implements its threats,” Hamdallah said. Israel collects around $127 million a month in customs duties levied on goods destined for Palestinian markets that transit through Israeli ports, and then transfers the money to the PA. The $138 million will likely be deducted incrementally over a 12-month period, according to local media reports. The law withholding the tax revenues, passed by the Knesset last year, is opposed by Israeli security officials who say further cuts to the PA budget could hurt security cooperation and destabilize the West Bank. The government has refused to implement the measure, though politicians have faced public pressure to crack down on the PA’s payments, which are viewed as incentivizing terror attacks.

News article:
A spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas denounced Israel’s decision to cut half a billion shekels in funds over its payments to security prisoners and their families Sunday. Nabil Abu Rudeineh called the decision to implement the law “piracy of the Palestinian people’s money.” Abu Rudeinah warned that the decision would have serious repercussions and would be placed at the top of the agenda when the PA leadership meets in the coming days. “We consider this arbitrary Israeli decision to be a one-sided blow to the signed agreements, including the Paris Protocols,” he said, referring to an annex of the Oslo Accords that defines Israel and the PA’s economic relations. Earlier Sunday, the security cabinet approved the implementation of a law to cut NIS 502,697,000 ($138 million) from the PA, over its payments to terrorists and their families. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Applying the law has faced opposition from the security establishment, who worry it could destabilize the situation in the West Bank. Some analysts have predicted that it may also lead to a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip should Abbas cut funds to the coastal enclave in order to continue paying security prisoners. Abu Rudeineh said the move would not keep the Palestinians from supporting “imprisoned heroes” or the families of those killed while carrying out attacks. Acting PA Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said Israel’s cutting of PA funds is “a part of a plan to destroy the National Authority and deny it the ability to continue to provide services and fulfill its commitments to its citizens.” Advertisement “Cutting the maqasa funds puts the Palestinian economy in danger and threatens our ability to pay employees’ salaries on time,” he added, using the Arabic term that refers to the taxes that Israel collects on behalf of the PA and then transfers back to Ramallah. “We are ready for all the scenarios if the Israeli government actually implements its threats,” Hamdallah said. Israel collects around $127 million a month in customs duties levied on goods destined for Palestinian markets that transit through Israeli ports, and then transfers the money to the PA. The $138 million will likely be deducted incrementally over a 12-month period, according to local media reports. The law withholding the tax revenues, passed by the Knesset last year, is opposed by Israeli security officials who say further cuts to the PA budget could hurt security cooperation and destabilize the West Bank. The government has refused to implement the measure, though politicians have faced public pressure to crack down on the PA’s payments, which are viewed as incentivizing terror attacks. Advertisement Netanyahu, who is seeking reelection this April, has come under increasing pressure to act in the wake of the brutal murder of an Israeli teen in a terrorist attack earlier this month. Last week, he told ministers that he would deduct the payments immediately after he received permission from the security cabinet. A West Bank-based Palestinian man, Arafat Irfayia, 29, was arrested the day after the body of 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher was found in a southern Jerusalem wood on February 7. The case has sparked outrage across the country. Irfayia, who reenacted the events for investigators, claimed he murdered Ansbacher for Palestinian nationalistic reasons; however, Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said that during interrogation he admitted also raping Ansbacher. Agencies and Adam Rasgon contributed to this report.

News article:
Israel’s Security Cabinet approved the implementation of a law on Sunday to deduct funds from tax revenue withheld from the Palestinian Authority over its payments to terrorists and their families. The move would deduct funds equal to the amount the P.A. spent to support terrorists and their families in 2018. The Israeli decision did not, however, include deducting funds equal to the amount the P.A. spends on so-called “martyrs,” experts noted. Member of Knesset Elazar Stern, one of the sponsors of the bill passed in July requiring the government to deduct such payments, told JNS that he supported the Security Cabinet’s decision. “I commend the Cabinet on its decision to finally approve the law that I initiated and led together with MK Avi Dichter and deduct terror salaries. I have no doubt that, ultimately, the implementation of the law will drastically reduce the incentive for terrorism and the number of terror attacks.” The decision by the Security Cabinet comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had come under increasing pressure to implement the law following the brutal murder of Israeli teen Ori Ansbacher by a Palestinian terrorist earlier this month. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories According to reports, the $138 million is likely be deducted over a 12-month period. Ahmed Majdalani, a senior official in the Palestine Liberation Organization, accused Israel as well as the United States, which passed a similar law earlier in 2018 known as the Taylor Force Act, of blackmail. “The occupation government is seeking to destroy the national authority in partnership with the U.S. administration of Donald Trump,” Majdalani said in a statement. Decision does not include deductions for Palestinian martyr payments According to Maurice Hirsch, head of legal strategies for Palestinian Media Watch (PMW), “We welcome the decision of the government as a great start.” However, Hirsch emphasized that the government only deducted the payments to terrorist prisoners and released prisoners. The government “did not touch at this point the P.A. payments to the families of dead or wounded terrorists,” he noted. “Our (PMW) estimate is that the sum paid to the dead terrorists alone, without the wounded, is over $63 million.” Hirsch added, “It is just a shame that the Ministry of Defense didn’t use the last six months since the law passed in order to calculate the amount the P.A. pays to the families of the dead and wounded terrorists.” According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Netanyahu “instructed security officials to step up checks on additional Palestinian Authority payments linked to terrorism, including those to terrorists and their families. The amount frozen will be updated as per the information received.” Sander Gerber, CEO of Hudson Bay Capital Management who has been raising awareness about the Palestinian Authority’s “pay to slay” policy for a number of years now, told JNS that “as the P.A. struggles with the moral dilemma to pay a prisoner who is both a killer and a rapist, it is an achievement that the State of Israel has the clarity to implement a law passed eight months ago to reduce money transfers equivalent to the amount the P.A. pays prisoners. We can only hope that the martyr program will not be overlooked by the government.” Shai Maimon, a victim of terror and heavily involved in advancing this law against terror funding, told JNS, “I am very happy that the government has come to terms with the law that it passed in the last Knesset. We are witnessing history in the making.” He, too, was disappointed that the Security Cabinet did not approve offsetting the complete amount of funding. “This is only half of the amount that the P.A. transfers to terrorists and their families, and therefore the government must continue to demand that the entire amount be offset in the future.”

News article:
Israel’s Security Cabinet finally implemented a law freezing Palestinian Authority funds and originally approved in the Knesset in July 2018. Israel decided to deduct NIS 502,697,000 (US $138,000,000) from the funds designated for transfer to the Palestinian Authority. At the Security Cabinet officials presented data to the effect that in 2018, the Palestinian Authority transferred the aforesaid amount to terrorists imprisoned in Israel and their families and to released prisoners. Therefore, it was decided to freeze the same amount of funds from the tax revenues that Israel collects for the Palestinian Authority. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure to implement the tax freeze following 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher’s brutal rape and murder earlier in the month. The Palestinian suspect reportedly admitted that the killing was “nationalistically-motivated.” Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said of the move, “No country in the world should pay the vile terrorists that murder its people. The blood money the PA gives to terrorists reflects its culture of terror and incitement,” according to The Algemeiner. “We will continue to work with the international community against the financial industry that funds murderers and encourages further attacks,” he added. Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said the move amounted to a “theft of Palestinian public money” and showed “Israel’s enactment of racist laws in support of the occupation” which “undermined the two-state solution,” according to a report on i24 News. Speaking to Kan public broadcaster, a PA official warned that “this could jeopardize the Palestinian economy and undermine the PA’s ability to pay its salaries on time.” Israel views the Palestinian payments as incitement to murder or pay-to-slay as they are euphemistically known. The Palestinian Authority counter claims that the payments are a source of welfare for families who have lost their main breadwinner. The freeze comes as the Palestinians face major budget cuts made last year after the United States slashed funding for the UN’s Palestinian refugee program UNRWA and for development programs in the Palestinian territories. The UN’s World Food Program also cut back services due to funding shortages.

OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — Israel will cut around 5 per cent of the tax handovers to the Palestinian Authority over its financial support for jailed Palestinians, the Israeli cabinet said on Sunday, following similar US legislation last year. Under interim peace deals, Israel collects taxes on behalf of the Palestinians, who put the current sums at $222 million a month. With negotiations stalled since 2014, Israel has at times withheld money as a measure of protest or pressure. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, though facing steep aid cuts by Donald Trump's administration that he has boycotted over perceived bias, has held to paying stipends to the families of Palestinians jailed as security offenders or killed by Israel. Israel and the United States say the policy, which is scaled to give greater monthly payouts for prisoners serving longer sentences, fans Palestinian violence. Abbas describes the slain and jailed Palestinians as "heroes" of a national struggle. Citing the around $138 million that Abbas' administration reported paying in prisoner stipends in 2018, the Israeli Cabinet said the same amount would be "frozen" from within the taxes collected for the Palestinian Authority. "Abu Mazen [Abbas] continues each month to transfer fat salaries to murderers who are in prison," Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked told Israel's Reshet 13 TV. "We must find a way of stopping this money." The Palestinians condemned the Israeli decision as "piracy". "It is an attempt to pressure us and blackmail us," Wasel Abu Youssef, a senior official with the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), told Reuters. "Even if left with just one dollar, we will pay it to the families of the martyrs, of the prisoners and of the wounded." The United States passed legislation last year to sharply reduce aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it stopped the stipends. The measure, known as the Taylor Force Act, was named after a 29-year-old American military veteran fatally stabbed by a Palestinian while visiting Israel in 2016. The Palestinians last month declined some $60 million in US annual funding for their security forces, worried about exposure to lawsuits under new US anti-terror laws. The Trump administration has further slashed hundreds of millions of dollars to humanitarian organisations and UN agencies which aid the Palestinians as it seeks to pressure Abbas to come back to the negotiating table. Some security experts voiced concern that the fiscal blows could destabilise the Palestinian Authority, an interim self-government body set up following the 1993 Oslo peace accords and which helps Israel keep order in the occupied West Bank in the face of Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist rival.

News article:
Israel will cut around five percent of the tax handovers to the Palestinian Authority over its financial support for jailed Palestinian militants, the Israeli security cabinet said on Sunday, following similar US legislation last year. Under interim peace deals, Israel collects taxes on behalf of the Palestinians, who put the current sums at $222 million a month. With negotiations stalled since 2014, Israel has at times withheld money as a measure of protest or pressure. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, though facing steep aid cuts by Donald Trump’s administration that he has boycotted over perceived bias, has held to paying stipends to the families of Palestinians jailed as security offenders or killed by Israel. Israel and the United States say the policy, which is scaled to give greater monthly payouts for prisoners serving longer sentences, fans Palestinian violence. Abbas describes the slain and jailed Palestinians as “heroes” of a national struggle. Citing the around $138 million that Abbas’ administration reported paying in prisoner stipends in 2018, the Israeli security cabinet said the same amount would be “frozen” from within the taxes collected for the Palestinian Authority. “Abu Mazen (Abbas) continues each month to transfer fat salaries to murderers who are in prison,” Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked told Israel’s Reshet 13 TV. “We must find a way of stopping this money.” The Palestinians condemned the Israeli decision as “piracy”. “It is an attempt to pressure us and blackmail us,” Wasel Abu Youssef, a senior official with the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), told Reuters. “Even if left with just one dollar, we will pay it to the families of the martyrs, of the prisoners and of the wounded.” The United States passed legislation last year to sharply reduce aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it stopped the stipends. The measure, known as the Taylor Force Act, was named after a 29-year-old American military veteran fatally stabbed by a Palestinian while visiting Israel in 2016. The Palestinians last month declined some $60 million in US annual funding for their security forces, worried about exposure to lawsuits under new US anti-terror laws. The Trump administration has further slashed hundreds of millions of dollars to humanitarian organizations and UN agencies, which aid the Palestinians as it seeks to pressure Abbas to come back to the negotiating table. Some security experts voiced concern that the fiscal blows could destabilize the Palestinian Authority, an interim self-government body set up following the 1993 Oslo peace accords and which helps Israel keep order in the occupied West Bank in the face of Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist rival. “If he (Abbas) chooses to collapse by keeping up payments to the murderers, then let him collapse,” said Shaked, a far-rightist in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conservative coalition government.

News article:
The decision by the security cabinet on Sunday to freeze the transfer of 500 million shekels ($138 million) of Palestinian Authority taxes as a sanction for its support of security prisoners was the result of political constraints. The law allowing the funds to be frozen was passed in July, but no politician seemed in any hurry to implement it. The murder of Ori Ansbacher in Jerusalem earlier this month led to renewed discussion of the assistance the PA gives to terrorists and their families; the overcrowding on the right side of the political spectrum did the rest. When Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman are circumventing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the right on the question of relations with the Palestinians, and the prime minister is busy branding himself as the strong right against Benny Gantz’s weak left, Netanyahu saw no choice but to start implementing the law. >> Read more: Israel looks ahead to new Hamas war, but doesn't look back at old lessons | Analysis ■ Palestinians have no confidence in the Palestinian president | Opinion Haaretz Weekly Episode 16 Credit: Haaretz Between July and February nothing was done about deducting any taxes, and even during Sunday’s security cabinet meeting Shin Bet security service head Nadav Argaman delayed presenting the full data on the PA’s support of security prisoners – and got an earful directly from Bennett (which somehow leaked at the speed of light to Channel 12). But even now, the funds freeze relates only to the imprisoned terrorists, not to the annual assistance, slightly greater in scope, that the PA gives to the families of Palestinians who were killed in confrontations with Israel. This second clause includes help given to relatives of suicide terrorists. And even after the security cabinet decision and the festive announcement that followed, it still isn’t clear when the tax refunds to the PA will actually be withheld. There is some logic to the Israeli argument, which is supported by the U.S. administration, that the PA’s continued financial assistance to prisoners and families of terrorists indirectly encourages terrorism and contradicts its public statements regarding the need for peace. But in Israel they are also well aware of the ethos of the Palestinian struggle and the fact that any move PA President Mahmoud Abbas makes to reduce the prisoners’ payments will cause a huge domestic crisis for him. That’s why defense establishment heads objected to the tax freeze and sought to delay it as long as they could. Meanwhile, one cannot ignore a certain contradiction in the claims being made by Netanyahu and the ministers. On the one hand, they pride themselves on curbing aid to terror by stopping money transfers to the PA, which is still thwarting terror in the West Bank in coordination with Israel. On the other hand, Israel is approving the transfer of money from Qatar and other sources to the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip, which openly continues to confront Israel and use violence against it. The Israeli decision to stop the tax transfers puts more pressure on the PA leaders than the steps the American administration has taken to reduce the financial aid to the territories. The PA is threatening to completely halt the cooperation between it and Israel. Abbas has already been quoted as saying he will transfer the PA’s last penny to the prisoners if necessary, making this his highest priority. Security coordination with Israel will not be halted because it is also a Palestinian interest, but the PA could take other measures, such as stopping all meetings in non-security channels. The primary danger here is the slippery slope. Abbas’ highest priority is the transfer of aid to Fatah prisoners from the West Bank imprisoned in Israel. To be able to continue this he might decide, as he has already hinted, to further reduce the funds transferred to the Gaza Strip. So by freezing the tax transfers, Israel might indirectly assist in exacerbating the situation in Gaza and hastening further escalation there, contrary to its objective. Hamas isn’t prepared to make do with what it has achieved in recent months – a boost in electricity supply and money deliveries from Qatar, along with an Egyptian decision to lengthen the hours the Rafah crossing stays open. It seems that the organization’s leaders believe that Netanyahu is more vulnerable to blackmail now, given his desire to avoid violent confrontations in the Strip before the election. This is a volatile situation and the sanctions Israel is imposing now, against the PA and indirectly against Hamas, could help spark a conflagration. Foreign diplomats involved in contacts with the Palestinians hope that the prime minister will find a way to delay implementation of the cuts, despite the security cabinet’s decision. Meanwhile, the situation along the Gaza border fence does not bode well. Last Friday’s demonstrations passed with no deaths, but Hamas continues to play with fire. The nighttime demonstrations in the Gaza Strip have resumed and are now taking place almost daily. These demonstrations are more violent than the Friday ones and, under the cover of the darkness, many explosives and Molotov cocktails are thrown at soldiers. The explosions along the fence are heard clearly in the Gaza border communities and are restoring the tense atmosphere, as the incendiary balloons and kites did during the summer months. Gaza, as the General Staff Intelligence Branch warned only last week, could quickly devolve into a broader escalation.

News article:
The Kerem Shalom crossing, Gaza’s most important entry point for commercial goods, was operating normally on Monday. That may not seem like dramatic news, but given the circumstances, it was an unusual and unexpected development. As of Sunday, the crossing’s Gazan side is run by officials unaffiliated with the Palestinian Authority — in other words, the terror group Hamas. How is that possible? Since when do Hamas and Israel, which operates the Israeli side of the crossing, cooperate in this way? This isn’t the first time — and won’t be the last — the two warring sides have cooperated in order to avert a deterioration in Gaza’s humanitarian situation or preserve a status quo. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms This time, however, credit for the cooperation is due not to Israel or Hamas, but to Hamas’s bitter enemies in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority. Between 2007, when Hamas took control of Gaza from the PA in a violent coup, and November 2017, the Strip’s various crossings with Israel, including Kerem Shalom, were run by Gazan workers unaffiliated with the PA, meaning they received their salaries from Hamas. After the partial and temporary reconciliation agreement between the Fatah-led PA and Hamas that month, PA officials returned to the crossings to manage the Gazan side. Advertisement On Sunday, for reasons that are not yet fully clear, the PA officials walked out of the Kerem Shalom crossing and have yet to return. Hamas claims the move was part of the PA’s efforts to punish the group and was intended to shutter the vital crossing. PA officials, meanwhile, complain that their clerks were “expelled” by Hamas officials who took over the administration of the crossing. Either way, the crossing has continued operating normally, without the PA as mediator between Israel and Hamas. A great deal of speculation has emerged over the PA’s reasons for what most observers believe is its own decision (not Hamas’s) to remove its clerks from Kerem Shalom. One theory argues that the move follows the Israeli cabinet’s decision on Sunday to implement a July 2018 law cutting tax fund transfers to the PA by the amount spent by the PA on salaries and stipends for convicted Palestinian attackers and their families, including terrorists. Israel views such a move, long stalled by concerns over the PA’s stability, as morally just. These funds, after all, effectively serve as direct financial compensation for terror attacks. But it’s not clear how this view squares with the current government’s policy of allowing transfers of $15 million in cash from Qatar to Hamas each month in order to stave off the rising violence and rocket attacks emanating from Gaza – a policy defended by officials as intended to preserve stability in Gaza. Isn’t that also a de facto financial reward for terror attacks? Or more to the point, even if the transfer cuts are a just policy, are they necessarily a wise one? The Palestinian Authority’s annual budget is roughly NIS 18 billion (some $5 billion). Its tax income is less, under NIS 14 billion ($3.8 billion). The PA’s stipends to prisoners come to some NIS 500 million ($138 million) each year, or roughly 3-4 percent of annual tax income. Cutting that amount from the PA’s tax income, which Israel transfers in monthly installments, will have a significant effect on the economy of the West Bank and on the Palestinian Authority, which has become over the years a vital part of Israel’s efforts to maintain a stable status quo in the West Bank. Advertisement Leading Fatah and PA officials have already warned that the authority could decide to simply refuse to receive all money from Israel, including taxes collected by Israel from Palestinians under PA rule. That could mean a PA forfeiture of hundreds of millions of shekels each month – several billion a year, and perhaps as much as a third of the PA’s total budget. It could mean, in other words, the de facto collapse of the PA. When the PA threatened to do so in the past, Israel caved each time, fearing a spike in violence that could ensue after the PA’s disappearance. But Israel is now in the middle of an election, in which a right-wing incumbent government could find itself politically unable to appear to cave to the Palestinian threat. What, then, does the Hamas takeover at Kerem Shalom signal? How will the cuts to the PA’s finances being advanced by Israel’s cabinet affect other functions currently carried out by the PA’s security services, including cooperation with Israeli security agencies? And what effect would the budget cut have on the security situation in the West Bank? The answers to these questions are not yet clear. Whether the PA follows through on its threat or limps along seeking other sources of income, whether Israel reverses its decision either before or immediately after the April 9 elections, or decides to take its chances with a hobbled PA, and where the new arrangement might lead in terms of the security situation, all remain to be seen. One thing is certain: Trouble is brewing. On Sunday, as the PA’s clerks abandoned Kerem Shalom, Hamas turned its ire on Israel, renewing nightly (as opposed to weekly Friday) protests and sabotage operations led by its “night units” along the Israel-Gaza border. At a protest on the border, an explosive device was tossed at IDF troops, leaving one soldier moderately wounded, while 19 Palestinians were injured in IDF return fire. The triangular Israel-PA-Hamas relationship is more fragile than before, and likely to grow more so in the coming weeks.

But it’s not clear how this view squares with the current government’s policy of allowing transfers of $15 million in cash from Qatar to Hamas each month in order to stave off the rising violence and rocket attacks emanating from Gaza – a policy defended by officials as intended to preserve stability in Gaza. Isn’t that also a de facto financial reward for terror attacks? Or more to the point, even if the transfer cuts are a just policy, are they necessarily a wise one? The Palestinian Authority’s annual budget is roughly NIS 18 billion (some $5 billion). Its tax income is less, under NIS 14 billion ($3.8 billion). The PA’s stipends to prisoners come to some NIS 500 million ($138 million) each year, or roughly 3-4 percent of annual tax income. Cutting that amount from the PA’s tax income, which Israel transfers in monthly installments, will have a significant effect on the economy of the West Bank and on the Palestinian Authority, which has become over the years a vital part of Israel’s efforts to maintain a stable status quo in the West Bank. Advertisement Leading Fatah and PA officials have already warned that the authority could decide to simply refuse to receive all money from Israel, including taxes collected by Israel from Palestinians under PA rule. That could mean a PA forfeiture of hundreds of millions of shekels each month – several billion a year, and perhaps as much as a third of the PA’s total budget. It could mean, in other words, the de facto collapse of the PA. When the PA threatened to do so in the past, Israel caved each time, fearing a spike in violence that could ensue after the PA’s disappearance. But Israel is now in the middle of an election, in which a right-wing incumbent government could find itself politically unable to appear to cave to the Palestinian threat. What, then, does the Hamas takeover at Kerem Shalom signal? How will the cuts to the PA’s finances being advanced by Israel’s cabinet affect other functions currently carried out by the PA’s security services, including cooperation with Israeli security agencies? And what effect would the budget cut have on the security situation in the West Bank? The answers to these questions are not yet clear. Whether the PA follows through on its threat or limps along seeking other sources of income, whether Israel reverses its decision either before or immediately after the April 9 elections, or decides to take its chances with a hobbled PA, and where the new arrangement might lead in terms of the security situation, all remain to be seen. One thing is certain: Trouble is brewing. On Sunday, as the PA’s clerks abandoned Kerem Shalom, Hamas turned its ire on Israel, renewing nightly (as opposed to weekly Friday) protests and sabotage operations led by its “night units” along the Israel-Gaza border. At a protest on the border, an explosive device was tossed at IDF troops, leaving one soldier moderately wounded, while 19 Palestinians were injured in IDF return fire. The triangular Israel-PA-Hamas relationship is more fragile than before, and likely to grow more so in the coming weeks.

The Kerem Shalom crossing, Gaza’s most important entry point for commercial goods, was operating normally on Monday. That may not seem like dramatic news, but given the circumstances, it was an unusual and unexpected development. As of Sunday, the crossing’s Gazan side is run by officials unaffiliated with the Palestinian Authority — in other words, the terror group Hamas. How is that possible? Since when do Hamas and Israel, which operates the Israeli side of the crossing, cooperate in this way? This isn’t the first time — and won’t be the last — the two warring sides have cooperated in order to avert a deterioration in Gaza’s humanitarian situation or preserve a status quo. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms This time, however, credit for the cooperation is due not to Israel or Hamas, but to Hamas’s bitter enemies in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority. Between 2007, when Hamas took control of Gaza from the PA in a violent coup, and November 2017, the Strip’s various crossings with Israel, including Kerem Shalom, were run by Gazan workers unaffiliated with the PA, meaning they received their salaries from Hamas. After the partial and temporary reconciliation agreement between the Fatah-led PA and Hamas that month, PA officials returned to the crossings to manage the Gazan side. Advertisement On Sunday, for reasons that are not yet fully clear, the PA officials walked out of the Kerem Shalom crossing and have yet to return. Hamas claims the move was part of the PA’s efforts to punish the group and was intended to shutter the vital crossing. PA officials, meanwhile, complain that their clerks were “expelled” by Hamas officials who took over the administration of the crossing. Either way, the crossing has continued operating normally, without the PA as mediator between Israel and Hamas. A great deal of speculation has emerged over the PA’s reasons for what most observers believe is its own decision (not Hamas’s) to remove its clerks from Kerem Shalom. One theory argues that the move follows the Israeli cabinet’s decision on Sunday to implement a July 2018 law cutting tax fund transfers to the PA by the amount spent by the PA on salaries and stipends for convicted Palestinian attackers and their families, including terrorists.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is running for re-election in polls due in April Israel said its security cabinet on Sunday decided to withhold $138 million (122 million euros) in tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority over its payments to prisoners jailed for attacks on Israelis. A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the withheld cash would be equal to that paid by the PA last year to "terrorists imprisoned in Israel, to their families and to released prisoners". Israel alleges the payments encourage further violence. The PA says the payments are a form of welfare to the families who have lost their main breadwinner and denies it is seeking to encourage violence. Many Palestinians view prisoners and those killed while carrying out attacks as heroes in their conflict with Israel. Palestinian leaders often venerate them as martyrs. Senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official Ahmed Majdalani accused Israel and the United States, which has cut hundreds of millions of dollars in Palestinian aid, of an attempt at blackmail. US President Donald Trump's White House is expected to release its long-awaited peace plan later this year that the Palestinians believe will be blatantly biased in favour of Israel. The Palestinians cut off contact with the White House after Trump's 2017 declaration of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. "The occupation government is seeking to destroy the national authority in partnership with the US administration of Donald Trump," Majdalani said in a statement. - US aid cuts - The move to withhold the money comes in response to an Israeli law passed last year allowing it to do so. Israel collects around $127 million a month in customs duties levied on goods destined for Palestinian markets that transit through Israeli ports, and then transfers the money to the PA. Earlier this month, Netanyahu pledged to implement the law after a deadly Palestinian attack on a young woman. He is running in an election scheduled for April 9, and has been seeking to shore up his security credentials in the eyes of voters ahead of polling day. Earlier Sunday, Netanyahu said "today I will submit for cabinet approval the (legislation on) deducting of the terrorists' salaries from the Palestinian Authority funds." "Security officials will brief the cabinet on the scope of the funds. This is an important law which we have advanced, and today we will pass it exactly as I promised." The $138 million will likely be deducted incrementally over a 12-month period, according to local media reports. Sponsors of the July law on Palestinian funds wrote at the time that the PA paid around $330 million a year to prisoners and their families, or seven percent of its budget. It was not clear what caused the reduction in the amount. The Palestinians have already facing a cut of more than $500 million in annual aid by Trump's administration, mostly to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. The Palestinian Authority also said in January it will refuse all further US government aid for fear of lawsuits over alleged support for terrorism due to a recently passed US law. Israel has withheld payments in the past, notably in response to the Palestinians' 2011 admission to the UN cultural agency UNESCO as a full member. The PA, which has limited sovereignty in parts of the occupied West Bank, relies heavily on outside financial aid. mib-he-cmr-mjs/dv

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority (PA) will no longer accept tax revenues collected on its behalf by Israel following its decision to trim the sum over the PA’s financial support of militants’ families, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said. FILE PHOTO: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas gestures during a meeting of Fatah Revolutionary Council, in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank February 6, 2019. REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority, an interim self-government body set up following the 1993 Oslo peace accords, has suffered a series of financial blows in the past year. Under interim peace deals, Israel collects taxes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip and makes monthly payments to the PA, which says it receives around $222 million each month. The Israeli Finance Ministry said on Wednesday it collects about 700 million shekels ($193 million) in Palestinian taxes and transfers around 600 million shekels of that to the Palestinian Authority after deducting payments for electricity, water, sewage and medical treatment services. On Sunday Israel said it would freeze about 5 percent of that against stipends the Palestinian Authority pays to families of Palestinians killed or jailed by Israel. In remarks made late on Tuesday and broadcast on Palestinian radio on Wednesday, Abbas said the PA would continue to pay out these stipends rather than accept a partial transfer of the tax revenues from Israel. “We reject the tax, we don’t want it,” Abbas told visiting U.S. congressmen. “Frankly, if we are left with only 20 or 30 million shekels, which is the sum paid to families of martyrs, then we will pay them to the families of martyrs,” he said. Israel and the United States say the stipend policy fans Palestinian violence while the Palestinians see the slain and jailed Palestinians as heroes of a national struggle. The United States last year passed legislation to sharply reduce aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it stopped the pay-outs. The measure, known as the Taylor Force Act, was named after a 29-year-old American military veteran fatally stabbed by a Palestinian while visiting Israel in 2016. Last month the Palestinians declined some $60 million in U.S. annual funding for their security forces, worried about exposure to lawsuits under new U.S. anti-terror laws. Washington has further slashed hundreds of millions of dollars to humanitarian organizations and U.N. agencies which aid the Palestinians as it seeks to pressure Abbas to enter peace negotiations with Israel. Peace talks have been frozen since 2014. The Palestinians suspended ties with Washington after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 and opened the new U.S. Embassy in the city in May. Israel has at times withheld the tax money over other matters.

In remarks made late on Tuesday and broadcast on Palestinian radio on Wednesday, Abbas said the PA would continue to pay out these stipends rather than accept a partial transfer of the tax revenues from Israel. “We reject the tax, we don’t want it,” Abbas told visiting U.S. congressmen. “Frankly, if we are left with only 20 or 30 million shekels, which is the sum paid to families of martyrs, then we will pay them to the families of martyrs,” he said. Israel and the United States say the stipend policy fans Palestinian violence while the Palestinians see the slain and jailed Palestinians as heroes of a national struggle. The United States last year passed legislation to sharply reduce aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it stopped the pay-outs. The measure, known as the Taylor Force Act, was named after a 29-year-old American military veteran fatally stabbed by a Palestinian while visiting Israel in 2016. Last month the Palestinians declined some $60 million in U.S. annual funding for their security forces, worried about exposure to lawsuits under new U.S. anti-terror laws. Washington has further slashed hundreds of millions of dollars to humanitarian organizations and U.N. agencies which aid the Palestinians as it seeks to pressure Abbas to enter peace negotiations with Israel. Peace talks have been frozen since 2014. The Palestinians suspended ties with Washington after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 and opened the new U.S. Embassy in the city in May. Israel has at times withheld the tax money over other matters.

News article:
Israel said that its security cabinet, on Sunday, decided to withhold $138 million (€122 million) in tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority, over its payments to prisoners jailed for attacks on Israelis. A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the withheld cash would be equal to that paid by the PA last year to “terrorists imprisoned in Israel, to their families and to released prisoners.” Israel alleges the payments encourage further violence, AFP/Al Ray reports. The PA says the payments are a form of welfare to the families who have lost their main breadwinner and denies it is seeking to encourage violence. Many Palestinians view prisoners, and those killed while carrying out attacks, as heroes in their conflict with Israel. Palestinian leaders often venerate them as martyrs. Senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official Ahmed Majdalani accused Israel and the United States, which has cut hundreds of millions of dollars in Palestinian aid, of an attempt at blackmail. US President Donald Trump’s White House is expected to release its long-awaited peace plan, later this year, and that the Palestinians believe will be blatantly biased in favor of Israel. The Palestinians cut off contact with the White House after Trump’s 2017 declaration of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. “The occupation government is seeking to destroy the national authority in partnership with the US administration of Donald Trump,” Majdalani said, in a statement. US AID CUTS The move to withhold the money comes in response to an Israeli law passed last year allowing it to do so. Israel collects around US$127 million a month in customs duties levied on goods destined for Palestinian markets that transit through Israeli ports, and then transfers the money to the PA. Earlier this month, Netanyahu pledged to implement the law after a deadly Palestinian attack on a young woman. He is running in an election scheduled for Apr 9, and has been seeking to shore up his security credentials in the eyes of voters, ahead of polling day. Earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu said, “Today, I will submit for cabinet approval the (legislation on) deducting of the terrorists’ salaries from the Palestinian Authority funds. “Security officials will brief the cabinet on the scope of the funds. This is an important law which we have advanced, and today we will pass it exactly as I promised.” The US$138 million will likely be deducted incrementally over a 12-month period, according to local media reports. Sponsors of the July law on Palestinian funds wrote, at the time, that the PA paid around US$330 million a year to prisoners and their families, or seven percent of its budget. It was not clear what caused the reduction in the amount. The Palestinians have already been facing a cut of more than US$500 million in annual aid, by Trump’s administration, mostly to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. The Palestinian Authority also said, in January, that it will refuse all further US government aid for fear of lawsuits over alleged support for terrorism, due to a recently passed US law. Israel has withheld payments in the past, notably in response to the Palestinians’ 2011 admission to the UN cultural agency UNESCO as a full member. The PA, which has limited sovereignty in parts of the occupied West Bank, relies heavily on outside financial aid.

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — If Israel indeed does not transfer to the Palestinian Authority all the money it collects in taxes on its behalf and holds back hundreds of millions of shekels because of the payments of the PA to terrorists and their families, the PA will stop paying salaries to employees – including to security personnel, PA police equipped with weapons, beginning next month, a Lebanese report said. The move is designed to pressure Israel not to cut the payments, and to incite opposition to the impending Washington-based “deal of the century” peace plan that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump will present after the Israeli elections. The report in the Lebanese Al-Ahabar newspaper, Thursday, reflected comments by PA chief Mahmoud Abbas, Wednesday. At a meeting of top PA leadership, Abbas said that if Israel withheld any money, the PA would refuse to accept all of it – and it would also cancel economic agreements with Israel. The move by Israel “is the final nail in the coffin of the Paris Accords,” Yisrael Hayom quoted Abbas as telling top PA terrorists. “Israel is violating these agreements and the implications will be very serious. This is another siege of the Palestinians, who are already collapsing because of the evils of the occupation. All of these moves against us are part of the Trump plan. We will not allow this to happen,” Abbas said. On Tuesday, Abbas met with a delegation from the far-left J Street group, and told them that if Israel deducted any money from the transfer payments, the PA would turn down the rest. “It’s all or nothing,” he told the group. “Even if we had just a small amount of money, NIS 20 or 30 million, our priority would be paying” the terrorists and their families. “We don’t need Israel’s money,” the newspaper quoted Abbas as telling the group. There have been varying estimates of just how much the PA lays out for salaries for terrorists in Israeli prisons – paid directly to them or their families – and as pension payments for terrorists killed in the act of murdering Israelis. The Cabinet earlier this week said it would withhold about NIS 580 million in payments to the PA. Abbas’s office reacted angrily to the decision. “This is an outrageous decision that will completely destroy our agreements with Israel. This decision will harm the economic development of the PA,” Abbas’s office said in a statement. With that, the PA will not stop its payments to terrorists. “We will not do business with our rights,” it said. “The deduction of money is robbery of money that belongs to the Palestinian people. We will not allow any harm to the income of our heroes and the families of the martyrs and the injured. This decision will have implications on many levels. We will consider it in the next meeting of the Palestinian leadership in the coming days,” it added. The decision came on the same day that the Cabinet approved that a mechanism should be in place to deduct money transferred to the PA in the amount of payouts to terrorists, as required by Knesset legislation passed last July that came into effect on January 1. The deductions come from customs payments Israel collects on behalf of the PA, in accordance with the Paris Accords, which regulate economic relations between Israel and the PA.

The Palestinian finance minister on Thursday announced salary cuts for civil servants, days after Israel said it would withhold tens of millions of dollars in tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority. Israel's security cabinet on Sunday approved the freezing of $138 million (122 million euros) over the PA's payments to the families of prisoners, or prisoners themselves, jailed for attacks on Israelis. Israel, which collects taxes on behalf of the PA, says the payments encourage further violence. The PA claims they are a form of welfare to families who have lost their main breadwinner. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said Wednesday he would not accept anything but full payment of the tax transfers owed by Israel. The PA, which is already running a deficit, will "pay the salaries of civil servants in time, but they will be reduced", said PA finance minister Shukri Bishara after a meeting with EU representatives in Ramallah. The cuts will not apply to salaries "paid to pensioners and families of martyrs, wounded or prisoners", he added, adding that wages below 2,000 shekels ($550) would also not be affected. Many Palestinians view prisoners and those killed while carrying out attacks as heroes in their conflict with Israel. Palestinian leaders often venerate them as martyrs. Under a 1994 agreement, Israel collects around $190 million each month in customs duties levied on goods destined for Palestinian markets that transit through Israeli ports. The money it then transfers to the PA is the authority's most important source of revenue. The Palestinians want EU countries to pressure the Israeli government to rescind its decision, said Mahmoud al-Aloul, deputy of Abbas's Fatah party. Palestinian leaders will take steps to "boycott Israeli goods", he said, adding they had already prepared "a list of Israeli products that have local (Palestinian) equivalents".

Here is a series of questions and answers on what it means: What taxes? In 1994, Israel and the Palestinians signed the Paris Protocol, which would become part of the landmark Oslo peace accords. It governs economic relations and established a customs union between Israel and the Palestinian territories, with Israel controlling the borders. Israel levies VAT and tariffs on products imported into the Palestinian territories and transfers them to the Palestinian Authority. The transfers make up around 70 per cent of the PA's revenue, according to Palestinian political scientist Jihad Harb. Israel's finance ministry says it collects around 700 million shekels ($190 million, 170 million euros) in taxes each month on Palestinian imports. From that, it deducts 100 million shekels to cover various services delivered to Palestinians. The arrangement was meant to be temporary as the two sides worked towards a final agreement, but it remains in place with peace efforts stalled and the Palestinian economy remains heavily dependent on Israel. What did Israel decide? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government decided Sunday to withhold $138 million in tax transfers to the PA over its payments to the families of prisoners, or the prisoners themselves, jailed for attacks on Israelis. The amount is to be deducted incrementally over 12 months. Israel says it is equal to that paid by the PA last year to those "imprisoned in Israel, to their families and to released prisoners". A law passed in July allowed the government to take the step, and Netanyahu vowed to implement it after a recent deadly attack on a young Israeli woman. Israel has also used the measure in the past to sanction the Palestinian Authority (PA). What are prisoner payments? Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas’ administration provides money to families of Palestinians killed or jailed as part of the conflict with Israel, with the amount depending on their sentences. Israel as well as the United States allege the payments to those who have carried out attacks encourage further violence and undermine Abbas’ argument that he is committed to peace. The PA has never divulged the amount it pays out. An Israeli lawmaker behind the 2018 law alleged it was 1.2 billion shekels last year. The PA says the payments are a form of welfare to the families who have lost their main breadwinner and denies it is seeking to encourage violence. Sahar Francis, head of Palestinian prisoners NGO Addameer, said the money constitutes “social insurance”. More than 5,000 Palestinians are detained in Israel, Addameer says. What are the financial consequences? “Even without this decision, the PA was already facing large budget deficits,” said Robert Tchaidze, IMF representative for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The IMF in September forecast a deficit of $620 million in 2018. For 2019, anticipating a freeze in transfers larger than what was announced on Sunday, the IMF predicted a deficit of around $1 billion. The freeze comes on top of a dramatic drop in direct foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority budget, which has gone from 10 per cent of GDP five years ago to 3.5 per cent last year. In 2018, the United States cut hundreds of millions of dollars in Palestinian aid. The financial crisis could worsen further if Abbas sticks to his ultimatum announced on Wednesday, when he said the PA will refuse to accept a partial transfer from Israel. Palestinian economist Nasser Abdelkarim spoke of “the start of an enormous financial and economic crisis”. What are the security implications? Security officials in Israel, which is in the midst of an electoral campaign, worry over the impact that the freeze could have on the stability of the West Bank and the blockaded Gaza Strip. UN Envoy for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov said on Wednesday that the freeze and other financial pressures “put at risk the financial stability of the Palestinian Authority and ultimately the security of both Israelis and Palestinians alike”. According to Harb, even if Arab countries extend financial help, the crisis threatens to affect the PA’s ability to contain “violence or protests against the Israeli occupation”.

Palestine will not receive tax money Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority (PA), President Mahmoud Abbas said Wednesday. Palestine “will not take any deducted funds” from Israel, Abbas said, while addressing a delegation of J Street advocacy group and U.S. Congressmen in Ramallah. The move came after the Israeli government decided, on Sunday, to deduct NIS 502 million (US $138 million) from the tax money it collects on behalf of the PA. Israel argues that the amount is being paid by the PA to families of Palestinians involved in attacks against Israeli targets. Abbas stressed that the PA will continue to pay welfare money to families of prisoners and martyrs. “We will go everywhere to bring Israel to accountability,” he stressed, according to Al Ray. Israel collects around $175 million every month in taxes on Palestinian imports and exports on behalf the PA. Tax revenue represents the PA’s main source of income.

Not long after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel would begin deducting $138 million of terror funding from the tax money that it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority each month, Mahmoud Abbas announced that the P.A. would refuse all of the tax money it was owed. “This wasn’t the first time that claim was made,” said Palestinian Media Watch’s Maurice Hirsch. Indeed, P.A. chief Abbas has been threatening to do so for several weeks. And again on Wednesday, while addressing a delegation of J Street advocacy group and U.S. Congressmen in Ramallah, Abbas again announced that he “will not take any deducted funds” from Israel. According to Eugene Kontorovich, director of International Law at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum and professor of International Law at George Mason University in Washington, D.C., “Abbas’s refusal to accept transfers of customs funds from Israel reveals the priorities of the Palestinian Authority: It values funding terrorism above all else, and engineers suffering for its own people as a diplomatic weapon against Israel.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories He continued, saying “Israel’s withholding of tax revenues that the P.A. uses to pay terrorists is entirely reasonable, and the P.A.’s response is to honestly admit that the pay-to-slay program is its raison d’être.” So far, Israel has only decided to deduct funds that go to Palestinian terrorists incarcerated in jail. It has yet to deduct funds that go to “martyrs” and their families.

News article:
Israel's decision to withhold part of the taxes it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and plunge it deeper into crisis starkly illustrates the hypocrisies and deceptions at the core of the two governments' relationship. Under the terms of what are now the quarter century-old Oslo accords, Israel is responsible for collecting about $200 million each month in taxes, which it is supposed to pass on to the PA, the Palestinian government-in-waiting in the West Bank. The money belongs to the Palestinians but Israel has temporarily withheld it on several occasions in the past as a stick with which to beat the Palestinian leadership into line. On this occasion, however, the stakes are far higher. Last week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu belatedly implemented a law passed last summer that requires his officials to retain part of the taxes owed to the Palestinians – those that the PA transfers to political prisoners’ families as a monthly stipend. It echoes the Taylor Force Act, a law passed by the US Congress in 2016, that denies American economic aid to the PA until it stops sending those same stipends to some 35,000 families of prisoners and those killed and maimed by the Israeli army. The PA has tried to avert that threat by channelling the payments through a separate body, the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Israel and Washington regard the prisoners simply as terrorists. But most Palestinians view them as heroes, those who have paid the highest price in the struggle for national liberation. The Palestinian public no more believes the families should be abandoned for their sacrifices than Irish republicans turned their backs on those who fought British rule or black South Africans forsook those who battled apartheid. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas called Israel’s actions “robbery” and said he would rather cut funding for health and education than for the prisoners and their families. “They are the most respected and appreciated part of the Palestinian people,” he declared. Then he played his ace card. He said he would refuse all tax money from Israel until the full sum was reinstated. That risks plunging the PA into financial meltdown and – most importantly for Israel – might ultimately lead to the disbanding of the Palestinian security services. Their job has long been to act as a security contractor, keeping order on Israel’s behalf in the West Bank. The security forces hoovered up a massive 20 per cent of the PA’s $5.8 billion state budget last year. The PA is already reeling from a series of hammer blows to the Palestinian economy. They include Donald Trump’s decision to cut all funding to UNRWA, the refugee agency for Palestinians, and to hospitals in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem. In addition, Mr Abbas reportedly declined $60m in annual US aid for his security services last month for fear of exposing the PA to legal action. A new congressional measure makes aid recipients like the PA subject to American anti-terrorism laws. But the current stand-off between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas lays bare the duplicity of the situation for all to see. The PA leader may say the prisoners are the most cherished Palestinian constituency but he also describes his security services’ co-ordination with Israel as “sacred”. The security services’ role is to assist the Israeli army in foiling Palestinian attacks and in arresting the very Palestinians he extols. Mr Abbas cannot realistically hold true to both positions at the same time. Mr Netanyahu, on the other hand, has nothing to gain from harming the Palestinian security services, which the Israeli army relies on. Quote There is something richly ironic about Mr Netanyahu rebuking the PA for rewarding Palestinian "terrorists" in the same week he negotiated a deal to assist bringing the Otzma Yehudit, or Jewish Power party, into the Israeli parliament The decision to withhold taxes was taken chiefly to boost his popularity as rival right-wing parties compete for who appears the most hawkish before April’s general election. Paradoxically, in withholding the PA’s tax money, Mr Netanyahu is punishing Mr Abbas, his supposed peace partner, while showing a preference for Hamas, Mr Abbas’s arch rival in Gaza. Although Israel categorises Hamas as a terror organisation, Mr Netanyahu has been allowing extra funds into Gaza from Qatar to alleviate the enclave's dire conditions. Further, there is something richly ironic about Mr Netanyahu rebuking the PA for rewarding Palestinian “terrorists” in the same week he negotiated a deal to assist bringing the Otzma Yehudit, or Jewish Power party, into the Israeli parliament. The party is Israel’s version of the Ku Klux Klan, disciples of the late rabbi Meir Kahane, whose virulently anti-Arab Kach party was outlawed 25 years ago as a terror organisation. So appalling is the prospect of this unholy alliance that even pro-Israel lobbies like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) and the American Jewish Committee have been compelled to issue statements condemning Jewish Power as “racist and reprehensible”. Mr Netanyahu believes the extra votes Jewish Power will attract to the right in the election will ensure he has the support necessary to build a coalition that can keep him in power. But there is another glaring flaw in Mr Netanyahu’s tax grab. If Mr Abbas’s coffers run low, he will simply send even less money to Gaza, which is already being choked by Israel’s lengthy blockade. That would intensify the unrest in Gaza, which could lead to rocket attacks into Israel and even larger mass protests by Palestinians at the perimeter fence encaging them. At the same time, if things remain unresolved, an already fragile PA will move closer to collapse and Hamas might then be poised to fill the void left in the West Bank. Loss of power for Mr Abbas, combined with loss of a security contractor for Mr Netanyahu, appear to make this confrontation mutually self-destructive – unless Mr Netanyahu and the right have another card up their sleeve. Hani Al Masri, a Palestinian policy analyst, has wondered whether Mr Netanyahu is setting the stage for US President Donald Trump to introduce his long-awaited "peace deal" after the election. Much of Mr Netanyahu’s coalition is keen to annex Palestinian areas outside the main West Bank cities, destroying any hope of a Palestinian state ever emerging. Mr Trump might be amenable. In this scenario, argues Mr Al Masri, Israel would aim to “end what remains of the PA’s political role, preserving only its administrative and security role”. It would be reduced to bin collections and law enforcement. Should the PA reject the process of being hollowed out, Israel and the US would then look for an alternative, such as rule by local warlords in each Palestinian city and greater powers for Israeli military rulers in the West Bank. The denial of taxes to the PA may not yet presage its demise. But it points to a future in which Palestinian self-rule is likely to become an ever-more distant prospect.

That would intensify the unrest in Gaza, which could lead to rocket attacks into Israel and even larger mass protests by Palestinians at the perimeter fence encaging them. At the same time, if things remain unresolved, an already fragile PA will move closer to collapse and Hamas might then be poised to fill the void left in the West Bank. Loss of power for Mr Abbas, combined with loss of a security contractor for Mr Netanyahu, appear to make this confrontation mutually self-destructive – unless Mr Netanyahu and the right have another card up their sleeve. Hani Al Masri, a Palestinian policy analyst, has wondered whether Mr Netanyahu is setting the stage for US President Donald Trump to introduce his long-awaited "peace deal" after the election. Much of Mr Netanyahu’s coalition is keen to annex Palestinian areas outside the main West Bank cities, destroying any hope of a Palestinian state ever emerging. Mr Trump might be amenable. In this scenario, argues Mr Al Masri, Israel would aim to “end what remains of the PA’s political role, preserving only its administrative and security role”. It would be reduced to bin collections and law enforcement. Should the PA reject the process of being hollowed out, Israel and the US would then look for an alternative, such as rule by local warlords in each Palestinian city and greater powers for Israeli military rulers in the West Bank. The denial of taxes to the PA may not yet presage its demise. But it points to a future in which Palestinian self-rule is likely to become an ever-more distant prospect.

News article:
Israel's decision to withhold part of the taxes it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and plunge it deeper into crisis starkly illustrates the hypocrisies and deceptions at the core of the two governments' relationship. Under the terms of what are now the quarter century-old Oslo accords, Israel is responsible for collecting about $200 million each month in taxes, which it is supposed to pass on to the PA, the Palestinian government-in-waiting in the West Bank. The money belongs to the Palestinians but Israel has temporarily withheld it on several occasions in the past as a stick with which to beat the Palestinian leadership into line. On this occasion, however, the stakes are far higher. Last week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu belatedly implemented a law passed last summer that requires his officials to retain part of the taxes owed to the Palestinians – those that the PA transfers to political prisoners’ families as a monthly stipend. It echoes the Taylor Force Act, a law passed by the US Congress in 2016, that denies American economic aid to the PA until it stops sending those same stipends to some 35,000 families of prisoners and those killed and maimed by the Israeli army. The PA has tried to avert that threat by channelling the payments through a separate body, the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Israel and Washington regard the prisoners simply as terrorists. But most Palestinians view them as heroes, those who have paid the highest price in the struggle for national liberation. The Palestinian public no more believes the families should be abandoned for their sacrifices than Irish republicans turned their backs on those who fought British rule or black South Africans forsook those who battled apartheid. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas called Israel’s actions “robbery” and said he would rather cut funding for health and education than for the prisoners and their families. “They are the most respected and appreciated part of the Palestinian people,” he declared. Then he played his ace card. He said he would refuse all tax money from Israel until the full sum was reinstated. That risks plunging the PA into financial meltdown and – most importantly for Israel – might ultimately lead to the disbanding of the Palestinian security services. Their job has long been to act as a security contractor, keeping order on Israel’s behalf in the West Bank. The security forces hoovered up a massive 20 per cent of the PA’s $5.8 billion state budget last year. The PA is already reeling from a series of hammer blows to the Palestinian economy. They include Donald Trump’s decision to cut all funding to UNRWA, the refugee agency for Palestinians, and to hospitals in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem. In addition, Mr Abbas reportedly declined $60m in annual US aid for his security services last month for fear of exposing the PA to legal action. A new congressional measure makes aid recipients like the PA subject to American anti-terrorism laws. But the current stand-off between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas lays bare the duplicity of the situation for all to see. The PA leader may say the prisoners are the most cherished Palestinian constituency but he also describes his security services’ co-ordination with Israel as “sacred”. The security services’ role is to assist the Israeli army in foiling Palestinian attacks and in arresting the very Palestinians he extols. Mr Abbas cannot realistically hold true to both positions at the same time. Mr Netanyahu, on the other hand, has nothing to gain from harming the Palestinian security services, which the Israeli army relies on. Quote There is something richly ironic about Mr Netanyahu rebuking the PA for rewarding Palestinian "terrorists" in the same week he negotiated a deal to assist bringing the Otzma Yehudit, or Jewish Power party, into the Israeli parliament The decision to withhold taxes was taken chiefly to boost his popularity as rival right-wing parties compete for who appears the most hawkish before April’s general election. Paradoxically, in withholding the PA’s tax money, Mr Netanyahu is punishing Mr Abbas, his supposed peace partner, while showing a preference for Hamas, Mr Abbas’s arch rival in Gaza. Although Israel categorises Hamas as a terror organisation, Mr Netanyahu has been allowing extra funds into Gaza from Qatar to alleviate the enclave's dire conditions. Further, there is something richly ironic about Mr Netanyahu rebuking the PA for rewarding Palestinian “terrorists” in the same week he negotiated a deal to assist bringing the Otzma Yehudit, or Jewish Power party, into the Israeli parliament. The party is Israel’s version of the Ku Klux Klan, disciples of the late rabbi Meir Kahane, whose virulently anti-Arab Kach party was outlawed 25 years ago as a terror organisation. So appalling is the prospect of this unholy alliance that even pro-Israel lobbies like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) and the American Jewish Committee have been compelled to issue statements condemning Jewish Power as “racist and reprehensible”. Mr Netanyahu believes the extra votes Jewish Power will attract to the right in the election will ensure he has the support necessary to build a coalition that can keep him in power. But there is another glaring flaw in Mr Netanyahu’s tax grab. If Mr Abbas’s coffers run low, he will simply send even less money to Gaza, which is already being choked by Israel’s lengthy blockade. That would intensify the unrest in Gaza, which could lead to rocket attacks into Israel and even larger mass protests by Palestinians at the perimeter fence encaging them.

News article:
West Bank – The Palestinian Authority has rejected the first 2019 monthly tax transfer from Israel because it slashed the portion designated for financial support to families of militants who are jailed in Israel, a PA minister said. The decision came despite increasing cash flow troubles, caused in part by U.S. aid cuts, that could destabilize the PA, an interim self-government body set up following the 1993 Oslo accords between the Palestinians and Israel. Under the interim accords, Israel collects taxes on imports into the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, an enclave under Palestinian Islamist rule since 2007, and makes monthly transfers of the proceeds to the PA. The tax transfers make up about half of the PA’s budget, according to Palestinian Finance Ministry data. On Feb. 17, Israel announced a freeze on about 5 percent of that money affecting stipends the PA pays to families of Palestinian militants killed or jailed by Israel. In response, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the PA itself would keep paying the stipends rather than accept a partial tax transfer. “We have refused to receive the 700 million shekel ($194 million) transfer after Israel deducted 42 million shekels from it,” Hussein al-Sheikh, the PA minister of civil affairs, told Reuters regarding the monthly transfer. The Israeli finance ministry declined to comment. Some analysts see potential danger if PA financial troubles mount in the West Bank, where the Authority maintains security cooperation with Israel even as Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for years. “Coupled with other de-funding measures, stability in the West Bank is being compromised in worrying ways,” said Tareq Baconi of the International Crisis Group think tank. But he said Israel may reverse its decision rather than risk a PA collapse. Palestinian Finance Minister Shukri Bishara said last week the PA faced “difficult days” in the coming weeks, hinting it might have to cut the salaries of some civil servants. Israel and the United States say the PA’s stipend policy fans Palestinian violence while the Palestinians see the slain and jailed Palestinians as heroes of a national struggle to end Israeli occupation and create an independent state. The United States passed legislation last year to sharply reduce aid to the PA unless it stopped the pay-outs. Washington has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars of funding to humanitarian organizations and U.N. agencies which aid the Palestinians as it seeks to pressure Abbas to enter peace negotiations with Israel.

News article:
The Palestinian Authority on Wednesday said it rejected its regular monthly tax transfer from Israel to protest an Israeli decision to deduct sums of money that Palestine pay to the families of people killed, injured or imprisoned for attacks on Israel. Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian official who coordinates the Palestinian Authority's communication with Israel, announced the rejection of the tax transfers. Israel announced last week that it would withhold over $138 million in revenues to penalize the Palestinian leadership for paying stipends to Palestinian attackers and their families. Under interim peace deals, Israel collects customs duties and other taxes on behalf of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, and transfers the funds to Palestine each month. These transfers cover roughly two-thirds of the Palestinian government budget. The freeze of these funds will deal a dire financial blow to the cash-strapped Palestinian leadership, already weakened by the recent U.S. cuts of more than $200 million in bilateral aid. The authority expects it won't be able to pay its employees' full salaries. Israel says the stipends to prisoners' families encourage violence. Palestine describes the payments as an important form of social welfare and say they are responsible to all of their citizens. Although the rejection of the funds is likely to hurt them, the Palestinians are hoping that the move will put pressure on Israel to reverse course. A collapse of the Palestinian Authority could lead to the end of security cooperation with Israel, and theoretically force Israel to assume responsibility over the more than 2 million Palestinians in the West Bank. In other developments, Israel separately arrested two high-profile Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank. In Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, Israel's Shin Bet security service arrested a well-known Palestinian for "severe and current terrorist activity." Zakaria Zubeidi rose to fame during the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, and later ran the militia affiliated with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party. For years, Zubeidi was on Israel's "most wanted" list before being granted amnesty. But a decade later, Zubeidi leads a very different life as manager of prisoner affairs for the Palestinian Authority, founder of a local theater company and student of political science at Birzeit University. His relatives contend he has long abstained from militant activity. The sudden arrest baffled Palestinian analysts, prompting suspicions that Israel was leveraging Zubeidi's past infamy to score political points as national elections approach. Meanwhile in Jerusalem, Israeli authorities released Adnan Ghaith, Jerusalem's Palestinian governor, after holding him for several hours, according to local media reports. A Jerusalem court has ruled to release Ghaith, who was detained earlier Wednesday alongside 20 other Palestinians, including prominent lawyer Medhat Dibeh. The reason for the raft of detentions remains unclear. According to one source who attended the court session, implementation of the release order was briefly suspended "to give Israeli intelligence a chance to appeal the decision." "If the intelligence apparatus doesn't challenge the ruling, he'll be released," said the source, who spoke anonymously due to restrictions on talking to media. The arrests come at a time of escalating tension in Jerusalem and the West Bank. Unrest between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police erupted last week around Al-Aqsa Mosque, long a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinian worshippers re-opened a building in the sacred compound that has been closed by Israeli court order for over a decade, staging prayer-protests inside several times over the past week. In response, Israel arrested dozens of east Jerusalem residents and briefly detained the head of the Islamic authority that oversees Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. Kobi Michael, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, said there is "no doubt" that the timing of the upcoming Israeli elections in April plays a role in the apparent mounting troubles between Israel and Palestine. "The situation is very sensitive and very fragile right now," said Michael. "It looks like the tension that has been building up here might explode."

The Palestinian Authority has announced that it will continue to pay salaries to imprisoned terrorists and their families. The payments will come at the expense of Palestinian workers, who will only receive part of their salary. The move comes in response to Israel’s deduction of $138 million, equal to the amount the P.A. pays terrorists incarcerated in Israeli jails. P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas has also followed through on his threat to reject the tax money Israel transfers each month, anounting to approximately $184 million per month. Speaking on official P.A. TV, Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs Riyad Al-Malki said, “We will not agree to accept any partial amount of the tax money.” Palestinian Minister of Finance Shukri Bishara also emphasized that the P.A. would be paying full salaries to terrorists at the expense of the general population.

The reduced salaries that Palestinian Authority employees in the West Bank will receive this week is yet another opportunity to point out how our journalistic terminology is heavily contaminated by terms that distort reality, and how vital a collaborator the Israeli press is in the mechanism of control over the Palestinians and in promoting the ignorance of Israelis. Those whose salary is 2,000 shekels ($550) or less will probably continue to receive their paltry wages in full. Others will that only about half of what they should be getting has been deposited in their bank account. And then, after their regular payments to the bank for various loans, many public sector workers will be left with just a few hundred shekels in their accounts at best, to feed their kids, drive to work and school, pay for electricity and cover other bills. It should be noted that the prices of water, fuel and electricity in the West Bank are comparable to those in Israel, while the Palestinian minimum wage is a little more than a third of that in Israel. >>Read more:There's a different kind of escalation brewing in the West Bank | Analysis ■ Palestinians have no confidence in the Palestinian president | Opinion These Palestinian civil servants will join in financial hardship the hundreds of people who worked on projects funded by American aid agency USAID, which were halted after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an end to funding. Several dozen of the newly unemployed are now competing for every new job opening, in both the public and private sector. Public sector wages are trimmed because of the PA's worsening budget deficit, which is the result of what the Israeli media reports as "a cutback," "deduction" or simply "cut" in the money Israel transfers to the PA, equivalent to Palestinians prisoners' stipends paid by the PA. Well, this shouldn't be called a deduction. It's robbery; theft in broad daylight committed by Israel with money that doesn't belong to it, money that Palestinian importers pay for products destined for Palestinian enclaves. Because Israel controls all borders and ports, it is the one to collect taxes from the merchants. These account for at least half of the Palestinian Finance Ministry's revenue. The cutback amounts to theft. Those who decided on it – the Israeli prime minister, defense minister and finance minister – are thieves. Finance Ministry officials carrying out the order are accomplices, and the press is co-conspirator in deception by calling it a cutback. In an act of civil disobedience, or costly pride, or false expectations that it would lead the world to pressure Israel, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas decided to refuse to accept the entire sum that Israel was supposed to deposit with the Palestinian treasury this month. Abbas decides everything, believe me, a senior Palestinian official told me. This isn't news, of course, but he implies that there were others in government who felt that this show of rebellious pride was not the right move. For the zillionth time: The main reason that such a high proportion of the PA's revenue comes from customs fees and not from production is Israeli control of the West Bank's Area C, coupled with restrictions on construction, agriculture and movement. So it is Israel that is robbing the Palestinian treasury, because it prevents Palestinians from developing other sources of income. Last week's popular deceptive term was "escalation," to refer to potentially violent protests by Palestinians. The one who controls the amount of water that the Palestinians get naturally controls language, too. Still, it's maddening to see how readily Israeli media refers to the bureaucratic violence of demolition orders as "law and order" and not "escalation." Now, as for the distorted language concerning the "activity" of the Israel Defense Forces or the Police Special Anti-Terror Unit: Spokespeople use this term, and mass media automatically adopts it, as usual. In joint "activity" by the IDF, police and Shin Bet, former militant Zakariya Zubeidi was arrested in the heart of Ramallah. "Activity" doesn’t begin to describe what actually happened: Invasion by armed forces, assault and intimidation. Zubeidi needs no introduction to the Israeli public. This son of refugees, whose mother was killed by an IDF sniper in the Jenin refugee camp, knew just how Israeli journalists to interview armed Palestinians, because it gives them a professional boost. It's always sexier than searching for soldiers who beat a blind disabled man in his bed. Does the number of interviews Zubeidi gave have anything to do with his skills as a fighter against the Israeli occupation? This isn't the issue right now, nor is the influence of the interviews of Zubeidi's public profile, or the way the Israeli media has already convicted him and lawyer Tarek Barghout of everything the Shin Bet accuses them of; the issue here are the positive, graceful euphemisms used to describe frightening raids by armed military forces in urban centers. Where Zubeidi was arrested in Ramallah, there is the Aziz Shaheen Secondary School for Girls and a kindergarten. The children won't forget the tear gas and explosions, the armed troops that wouldn't let their worried parents come take them home. And then we'll see Israeli diplomats in suits and ties, complaining in a South African or Oxfordian accent that the Palestinian school system teaches children to hate.

The reduced salaries that Palestinian Authority employees in the West Bank will receive this week is yet another opportunity to point out how our journalistic terminology is heavily contaminated by terms that distort reality, and how vital a collaborator the Israeli press is in the mechanism of control over the Palestinians and in promoting the ignorance of Israelis. Those whose salary is 2,000 shekels ($550) or less will probably continue to receive their paltry wages in full. Others will that only about half of what they should be getting has been deposited in their bank account. And then, after their regular payments to the bank for various loans, many public sector workers will be left with just a few hundred shekels in their accounts at best, to feed their kids, drive to work and school, pay for electricity and cover other bills. It should be noted that the prices of water, fuel and electricity in the West Bank are comparable to those in Israel, while the Palestinian minimum wage is a little more than a third of that in Israel. >>Read more:There's a different kind of escalation brewing in the West Bank | Analysis ■ Palestinians have no confidence in the Palestinian president | Opinion These Palestinian civil servants will join in financial hardship the hundreds of people who worked on projects funded by American aid agency USAID, which were halted after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an end to funding. Several dozen of the newly unemployed are now competing for every new job opening, in both the public and private sector. Public sector wages are trimmed because of the PA's worsening budget deficit, which is the result of what the Israeli media reports as "a cutback," "deduction" or simply "cut" in the money Israel transfers to the PA, equivalent to Palestinians prisoners' stipends paid by the PA. Well, this shouldn't be called a deduction. It's robbery; theft in broad daylight committed by Israel with money that doesn't belong to it, money that Palestinian importers pay for products destined for Palestinian enclaves. Because Israel controls all borders and ports, it is the one to collect taxes from the merchants. These account for at least half of the Palestinian Finance Ministry's revenue. The cutback amounts to theft. Those who decided on it – the Israeli prime minister, defense minister and finance minister – are thieves. Finance Ministry officials carrying out the order are accomplices, and the press is co-conspirator in deception by calling it a cutback. In an act of civil disobedience, or costly pride, or false expectations that it would lead the world to pressure Israel, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas decided to refuse to accept the entire sum that Israel was supposed to deposit with the Palestinian treasury this month. Abbas decides everything, believe me, a senior Palestinian official told me. This isn't news, of course, but he implies that there were others in government who felt that this show of rebellious pride was not the right move. For the zillionth time: The main reason that such a high proportion of the PA's revenue comes from customs fees and not from production is Israeli control of the West Bank's Area C, coupled with restrictions on construction, agriculture and movement.

News article:
The Palestinian government will pay civil servants half of their salaries after Israel withheld tax money collected on its behalf, according to the Palestinian finance minister. "The government will pay 50 per cent of the salaries," Shukri Bishara told a press conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Sunday. He said the government has also applied a host of austerity measures, including halting the appointment of new civil servants, promotions and additional allowances. "The government needs to borrow around $50-60 million a month from the local market to meet its obligations towards its employees and state institutions," he said. Last month, the Ramallah-based government refused to accept deducted tax revenues collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The move came after the Israeli government decided to deduct some 502 million Israeli shekels (roughly $138 million) from the Palestinian tax money, citing that the amount was being paid by Ramallah to the families of Palestinians involved in attacks against Israeli targets. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has decried by the Israeli measure, saying his government would continue to pay monthly stipends to the families of Palestinian prisoners and martyrs. Israel collects around $175 million each month in taxes on Palestinian imports and exports on behalf of the PA, for which tax revenue represents the main source of income.

News article:
The Polish government marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday, but completely ignored the complicity of Poles who actively participated in crimes against Jews during World War II. Rather, Warsaw seemed to stress Polish suffering and Polish efforts to rescue Jews, leading an Israeli Holocaust historian to charge that Poland is trying to make the Nazi genocide look like a “Polish rescue project.” Historians debate how many Poles aided the Nazi death machine during World War II, with estimates ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. But Poland has never admitted to complicity on any large scale and last year Warsaw passed a law prohibiting people from blaming the Polish nation for Holocaust atrocities. Indeed, a new study on Holocaust remembrance in Europe argues that the Poles are among the “worst offenders” when it comes to efforts to rehabilitate Nazi collaborators and war criminals and “minimizing their own guilt in the attempted extermination of Jews.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms According to the study, conducted by researchers from Yale and Grinnell colleges and published last week, the right-wing government in Warsaw has “engaged in competitive victimization, emphasising the experience of Polish victims over that of Jewish victims. “The government spends considerable effort on rewriting history rather than acknowledging and learning from it,” the study found. On Sunday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is due in Israel next month, said the truth about the Holocaust “cannot be relativized in any manner.” In his speech, he did not mention Polish complicity, but rather appeared to stress that the German people, rather than the state’s leadership, bear responsibility for the Holocaust. Advertisement “The Holocaust was not carried out by Nazis, but by Hitler’s Germany,” he said at a memorial ceremony held in the building of the central “sauna” in the former Auschwitz II-Birkenau death camp. Hitler Germany was consumed with fascist ideology, which was the source of “all the evil,” Morawiecki said, according to a readout posted on his website. In a statement issued Sunday, Poland’s Foreign Ministry noted that six million Jews were killed in the areas occupied by Hitler’s Germany, while emphasizing Polish suffering at the hands of the Nazis, and Polish efforts to save Jews. “The first transport arrived at Auschwitz on 14 June 1940. It was made up of Polish political prisoners. The decision to transfer them to Auschwitz was dictated by mass arrests of Poles and the resultant overcrowding of prisons in German-occupied Poland,” the statement read. “The Auschwitz-Birkenau camp was where 1–1.5m people were murdered, a million of them Jewish,” the statement said. “Many were citizens of the Republic of Poland.” While the death of millions of Jews in the Holocaust “will always be a shame for humankind,” it went on, “our faith in humanity is restored by the stories of men and women, Poles among them, who saved Jews from the Holocaust. Advertisement “Guided by their sense of shared human solidarity, the Polish Government-in-Exile and thousands of our fellow citizens were involved in helping Jews during the Second World War.” The Foreign Ministry’s statement stressed that the punishment for doing so in German-occupied Poland was the death penalty, and that Poles account for the largest group of gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews. The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center recognizes 6,863 Poles as Righteous Among the Nations, the highest number of any nation. “Operating under the auspices of the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Council to Aid Jews ‘Żegota’ was the only state organization in occupied Europe established specifically to save Jews,” the Polish Foreign Ministry statement noted. Polish diplomats helped save “several hundred Jews” from various European countries, it went on. The statement does not mention the actions of Poles who actively participated in the murder of Jews, even though historians argue that the number of Polish anti-Jewish acts vastly outweigh — in number and significance — those of Poles who helped Jews. Poland’s Ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski‏, on Sunday also issued a statement marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day that appeared to imply that only Germans were involved in killing Jews. “Surely, we in Poland remember very well what happened in that period of time, we remember the Jewish victims of World War II, murdered by Nazi Germans, but we also know that we hold enormous responsibility to preserve the material legacy of the greatest genocide in the history of mankind,” he said. The statement, which Magierowski‏ tweeted in Hebrew, English and Polish, did not mention anti-Jewish atrocities committed by Poles. Havi Dreifuss, who heads the Institute for the History of Polish Jewry and Israel-Poland Relations at Tel Aviv University, said she was saddened but not surprised by these comments. “Reading those statements, one could think the Holocaust was not an unprecedented genocide of Jews, but an impressive Polish rescue project,” she told The Times of Israel on Monday. “These are just additional expressions of the historical distortion the current Polish government creates in relation to the memory of the Holocaust in Poland.” Unlike the claims made Sunday, “hundreds of thousands of Poles took part in the Jewish tragedy — by handing Jews to the Polish Blue Police or to the Germans, and by murdering them in immense cruelty,” said Dreifuss, whose research focuses on the relationship between Jews and Poles during the Holocaust. Advertisement Those Poles who did risk their lives to rescue Jews feared reprisals from their compatriots, “and usually concealed their courageous acts during – and many times even after – the Holocaust.” On June 27, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Morawiecki agreed to end the spat between the two countries over a controversial Polish law that criminalized any accusation of the Polish nation of being “responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes committed by the Third Reich.” Part of their agreement was the issuance of a joint statement that declared that the term “Polish death camps” was “blatantly erroneous” and that the wartime Polish government-in-exile “attempted to stop this Nazi activity by trying to raise awareness among the Western allies to the systematic murder of the Polish Jews.” Controversially, the joint declaration condemned “every single case of cruelty against Jews perpetrated by Poles during…World War II” but noted “heroic acts of numerous Poles, especially the Righteous Among the Nations, who risked their lives to save Jewish people.” In exchange for Israel agreeing to issue the statement, the Polish government canceled the section of the controversial Polish law that stipulated criminal sanctions for people accusing the Polish nation of complicity in Nazi crimes. The agreement, which Netanyahu initially hailed as safeguarding “the historic truth about the Holocaust,” was harshly criticized by Israeli academics and politicians. The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center issued a statement saying the joint declaration “contains highly problematic wording that contradicts existing and accepted historical knowledge in this field.” Historians at the state-funded Holocaust research center said assertions in the statement “contains grave errors and deceptions,” and supports the disproved narrative that the Polish Government-in-Exile was committed to saving Europe’s Jews. “At least tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Polish Jews perished during the war due to actions of their Polish neighbors. Accordingly, Poles’ involvement in persecuting Jews was in no way marginal,” Yad Vashem researchers said in a statement. Yad Vashem acknowledged the important work of Żegota (the Council for Aid to Jews), saying it helped “thousands of Jews, including hundreds of children,” survive the war. However, its members “were susceptible to extortion and had to hide their actions from Polish society, which turned a jaundiced eye on helping Jews,” the scholars added. Netanyahu later acknowledged the criticism and vowed to take it into consideration on July 8, but has not addressed the issue publicly since. “This doesn’t interest him at all; what he cares about are defense, economic and diplomatic relations with Poland. The rest doesn’t interest him,” leading Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer told The Times of Israel on Monday. Also on Monday, the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem announced that the Polish prime minister was due in Israel next month for a conference. “The two governments want to increase cooperation,” Bauer said, “and the Holocaust interferes [with that goal], so they’re putting it aside.”

Poland’s Ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski‏, on Sunday also issued a statement marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day that appeared to imply that only Germans were involved in killing Jews. “Surely, we in Poland remember very well what happened in that period of time, we remember the Jewish victims of World War II, murdered by Nazi Germans, but we also know that we hold enormous responsibility to preserve the material legacy of the greatest genocide in the history of mankind,” he said. The statement, which Magierowski‏ tweeted in Hebrew, English and Polish, did not mention anti-Jewish atrocities committed by Poles. Havi Dreifuss, who heads the Institute for the History of Polish Jewry and Israel-Poland Relations at Tel Aviv University, said she was saddened but not surprised by these comments. “Reading those statements, one could think the Holocaust was not an unprecedented genocide of Jews, but an impressive Polish rescue project,” she told The Times of Israel on Monday. “These are just additional expressions of the historical distortion the current Polish government creates in relation to the memory of the Holocaust in Poland.” Unlike the claims made Sunday, “hundreds of thousands of Poles took part in the Jewish tragedy — by handing Jews to the Polish Blue Police or to the Germans, and by murdering them in immense cruelty,” said Dreifuss, whose research focuses on the relationship between Jews and Poles during the Holocaust. Advertisement Those Poles who did risk their lives to rescue Jews feared reprisals from their compatriots, “and usually concealed their courageous acts during – and many times even after – the Holocaust.” On June 27, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Morawiecki agreed to end the spat between the two countries over a controversial Polish law that criminalized any accusation of the Polish nation of being “responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes committed by the Third Reich.” Part of their agreement was the issuance of a joint statement that declared that the term “Polish death camps” was “blatantly erroneous” and that the wartime Polish government-in-exile “attempted to stop this Nazi activity by trying to raise awareness among the Western allies to the systematic murder of the Polish Jews.” Controversially, the joint declaration condemned “every single case of cruelty against Jews perpetrated by Poles during…World War II” but noted “heroic acts of numerous Poles, especially the Righteous Among the Nations, who risked their lives to save Jewish people.” In exchange for Israel agreeing to issue the statement, the Polish government canceled the section of the controversial Polish law that stipulated criminal sanctions for people accusing the Polish nation of complicity in Nazi crimes. The agreement, which Netanyahu initially hailed as safeguarding “the historic truth about the Holocaust,” was harshly criticized by Israeli academics and politicians. The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center issued a statement saying the joint declaration “contains highly problematic wording that contradicts existing and accepted historical knowledge in this field.” Historians at the state-funded Holocaust research center said assertions in the statement “contains grave errors and deceptions,” and supports the disproved narrative that the Polish Government-in-Exile was committed to saving Europe’s Jews. “At least tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Polish Jews perished during the war due to actions of their Polish neighbors. Accordingly, Poles’ involvement in persecuting Jews was in no way marginal,” Yad Vashem researchers said in a statement. Yad Vashem acknowledged the important work of Żegota (the Council for Aid to Jews), saying it helped “thousands of Jews, including hundreds of children,” survive the war. However, its members “were susceptible to extortion and had to hide their actions from Polish society, which turned a jaundiced eye on helping Jews,” the scholars added. Netanyahu later acknowledged the criticism and vowed to take it into consideration on July 8, but has not addressed the issue publicly since. “This doesn’t interest him at all; what he cares about are defense, economic and diplomatic relations with Poland. The rest doesn’t interest him,” leading Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer told The Times of Israel on Monday. Also on Monday, the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem announced that the Polish prime minister was due in Israel next month for a conference. “The two governments want to increase cooperation,” Bauer said, “and the Holocaust interferes [with that goal], so they’re putting it aside.”

The Polish government marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday, but completely ignored the complicity of Poles who actively participated in crimes against Jews during World War II. Rather, Warsaw seemed to stress Polish suffering and Polish efforts to rescue Jews, leading an Israeli Holocaust historian to charge that Poland is trying to make the Nazi genocide look like a “Polish rescue project.” Historians debate how many Poles aided the Nazi death machine during World War II, with estimates ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. But Poland has never admitted to complicity on any large scale and last year Warsaw passed a law prohibiting people from blaming the Polish nation for Holocaust atrocities. Indeed, a new study on Holocaust remembrance in Europe argues that the Poles are among the “worst offenders” when it comes to efforts to rehabilitate Nazi collaborators and war criminals and “minimizing their own guilt in the attempted extermination of Jews.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms According to the study, conducted by researchers from Yale and Grinnell colleges and published last week, the right-wing government in Warsaw has “engaged in competitive victimization, emphasising the experience of Polish victims over that of Jewish victims. “The government spends considerable effort on rewriting history rather than acknowledging and learning from it,” the study found. On Sunday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is due in Israel next month, said the truth about the Holocaust “cannot be relativized in any manner.” In his speech, he did not mention Polish complicity, but rather appeared to stress that the German people, rather than the state’s leadership, bear responsibility for the Holocaust. Advertisement “The Holocaust was not carried out by Nazis, but by Hitler’s Germany,” he said at a memorial ceremony held in the building of the central “sauna” in the former Auschwitz II-Birkenau death camp. Hitler Germany was consumed with fascist ideology, which was the source of “all the evil,” Morawiecki said, according to a readout posted on his website. In a statement issued Sunday, Poland’s Foreign Ministry noted that six million Jews were killed in the areas occupied by Hitler’s Germany, while emphasizing Polish suffering at the hands of the Nazis, and Polish efforts to save Jews. “The first transport arrived at Auschwitz on 14 June 1940. It was made up of Polish political prisoners. The decision to transfer them to Auschwitz was dictated by mass arrests of Poles and the resultant overcrowding of prisons in German-occupied Poland,” the statement read. “The Auschwitz-Birkenau camp was where 1–1.5m people were murdered, a million of them Jewish,” the statement said. “Many were citizens of the Republic of Poland.” While the death of millions of Jews in the Holocaust “will always be a shame for humankind,” it went on, “our faith in humanity is restored by the stories of men and women, Poles among them, who saved Jews from the Holocaust. Advertisement “Guided by their sense of shared human solidarity, the Polish Government-in-Exile and thousands of our fellow citizens were involved in helping Jews during the Second World War.” The Foreign Ministry’s statement stressed that the punishment for doing so in German-occupied Poland was the death penalty, and that Poles account for the largest group of gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews. The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center recognizes 6,863 Poles as Righteous Among the Nations, the highest number of any nation. “Operating under the auspices of the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Council to Aid Jews ‘Żegota’ was the only state organization in occupied Europe established specifically to save Jews,” the Polish Foreign Ministry statement noted. Polish diplomats helped save “several hundred Jews” from various European countries, it went on. The statement does not mention the actions of Poles who actively participated in the murder of Jews, even though historians argue that the number of Polish anti-Jewish acts vastly outweigh — in number and significance — those of Poles who helped Jews.

YERUSHALAYIM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s warm welcome to Lithuania’s prime minister marks his latest embrace of an eastern European leader who has offered strong political support while promoting a distorted image of the Holocaust. Lithuania is among a slew of former communist nations swept up in a wave of World War II-era revisionism that seeks to diminish their culpability in the Holocaust while making heroes out of anti-Soviet nationalists involved in the mass killing of Jews. In Israel, established in the wake of the Nazi genocide of 6 million Jews, some say Netanyahu is cynically betraying the victims’ memory. Lithuania, for instance, has been a leading force behind creating a joint memorial day for all victims of totalitarianism, blurring the distinction between the crimes of the Nazis and the communists who fought them. It also has pushed for legislation to prohibit the sale of books that “distort Lithuanian history” by citing the rampant, documented collaboration of the local population with Nazis. Most recently it has resisted calls to remove the various plaques commemorating anti-Soviet fighter Jonas Noreika, despite recent revelations by his own granddaughter, Silvia Foti, that he was a virulent anti-Semite who had a role in the murder of thousands of Jews. Nearly all of Lithuania’s 200,000 Jews were killed in the Holocaust. When Netanyahu, who has Lithuanian roots, visited Vilnius last year, he praised Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis for taking “great steps to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust” and for fighting modern-day anti-Semitism. “It’s unforgivable. Netanyahu is giving them a green light,” said Efraim Zuroff, the chief Nazi-hunter of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. “It’s like praising the Ku Klux Klan for improving racial relations in the South.” “We have to say the truth. We owe it to the victims,” he added. In a meeting with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Tuesday, Skvernelis said “Lithuania has been learning the lessons of the past” and was “improving the life of the Jewish community and restoring historical sites.” At Tuesday’s meeting, Netanyahu treaded cautiously. He referred to the “tragedies of the past” but steered clear of any criticism of modern Lithuania, praising the “spirit of friendship” and “a bridge from the past to a future.” Skvernelis’ visit comes a week after Netanyahu similarly rolled out the red carpet for President Petro Porochenko of Ukraine, whose parliament just designated the birthday of Ukrainian wartime collaborator Stepan Bandera a national holiday. A regional legislature declared 2019 “the year of Stepan Bandera.” Bandera’s forces fought alongside the Nazis and were implicated in the murder of thousands of Jews. As Porochenko was visiting Israel, another memorial was being erected in Kiev for Symon Petliura, whose troops are linked to pogroms that killed as many as 50,000 Jews after World War I. Netanyahu’s outreach in eastern Europe is part of his larger strategy of forging alliances to counter the criticism Israel faces in the United Nations and other international forums over its treatment of the Palestinians. “It’s a specific maneuver that legitimizes anti-Semitism and borders on Holocaust denial,” charged Tamar Zandberg, leader of the left-wing Meretz party. The prime minister’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Under communist rule, the Holocaust was not seriously dealt with and, upon independence, the newfound eastern and central European nations sought to canonize nationalist icons who resisted the Soviets, while largely ignoring their crimes alongside the Nazis. Domestic academics who have challenged the false narrative have been shamed, and external criticism has often been met with new anti-Semitic outbursts. For countries like Lithuania and Ukraine, the warm embrace of the Israeli leader provides a strong defense against accusation of anti-Semitism while also strengthening ties with a close U.S. ally. Netanyahu has also formed a close alliance with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has lavished praise on Miklos Horthy, Hungary’s World War II-era ruler, who introduced anti-Semitic laws and collaborated with the Nazis. Orban has also employed anti-Semitic tropes against the Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist George Soros and backed a state-funded museum that experts say plays down the role of Hungarian collaborators. Netanyahu also struck a deal with Polish leaders over their country’s controversial Holocaust speech law, which would have criminalized blaming the Polish nation for crimes committed against Jews during World War II. Israeli Holocaust historians slammed the agreement, which seemed to accept a Polish narrative that they were only victims of the Nazis. Scholars say anti-Semitism was deeply rooted in pre-war Poland, and Poles might have either killed or helped Germans kill up to 200,000 Jews. Still, Netanyahu has invited Orban and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki — who last year equated Polish perpetrators in the Holocaust to supposed “Jewish perpetrators” — to Israel in February for a summit with the leaders of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party and the son of a Holocaust survivor, called on Netanyahu to cancel the meeting, saying one prime minister has “published anti-Semitic content” and another “passed a law desecrating the memory of Holocaust victims.” In an annual report Sunday, Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs said 2018 saw a record number of worldwide anti-Semitic attacks, with most carried out by neo-Nazis in Europe and white supremacists. But at his Cabinet meeting later in the day, Netanyahu singled out “Islamic anti-Semitism and the anti-Semitism of the extreme left, which includes anti-Zionism,” while saying that anti-Semitism on the right is nothing new. Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, which hosts all visiting foreign dignitaries, has been thrust into the controversy. While it says it will never disqualify anyone wishing to visit, Yad Vashem insists it will “forcefully” address any denial or distortion. Yad Vashem said the Lithuanian leader received a comprehensive explanation of the Holocaust, including details about “the murder of Jews of Lithuania by the Nazis and their Lithuanian collaborators.”

News article:
Lithuania said Friday it has rejected a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to move the remains of Vilna Gaon, a famed 18th-century rabbi, from Vilnius to Israel for reburial, Trend reports referring to The Times of Israel. The issue was raised during talks between Netanyahu and his Lithuanian counterpart Saulius Skvernelis in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Skvernelis’ national security advisor Arnoldas Pikzirnis told AFP. “We received a kind request to consider whether the remains of Vilna Gaon could be relocated to Israel,” Pikzirnis said. The request was denied, he said, because “Vilna Gaon is an inseparable part of Lithuania’s Jewish community and Lithuania history.” Jewish community leader Faina Kukliansky, who also attended the Jerusalem talks, told AFP that removing the rabbi’s remains from Vilnius was “out of the question.” Kukliansky said the legacy of rabbi and scholar Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman, known as Vilna Gaon, was a crucial part of the history of Lithuania’s once thriving Jewish community. Netanyahu first privately raised the idea when he visited Vilnius in August, a government source and a Jewish community source who met him during the trip told AFP. A spokesman for Netanyahu in Jerusalem did not immediately comment. Amir Maimon, Israel’s ambassador to Vilnius, also declined to comment but did not explicitly deny that Netanyahu made the request. Vilna Gaon spent most of his life in Vilnius, then a hub of Yiddish intellectual life known as the “Jerusalem of the North.” He died in 1797 at the age of 77, and was buried in the Snipiskes cemetery in Vilnius. His remains were moved to a new cemetery on the capital’s outskirts in the 1950s. Before World War II, Lithuania’s vibrant Jewish community numbered around 200,000 people. Over 90 percent of them perished between 1941-1944 during the Holocaust at the hands of the Nazis and their local collaborators.

News article:
The government of Cameroon has apologized to Israel for an incendiary remark made by one of its officials describing the Nazi Holocaust as having been brought on by Jewish “arrogance.” Deputy Justice Minister Jean de Dieu Momo made the comment during an interview on state television on Sunday in the context of the African country’s current political woes. Asked why he thought the detained opposition leader Maurice Kamto had refused to accept defeat following the Oct. 7 presidential election, Momo invoked the Nazi persecution of the Jews. “In Germany, there was a race of very rich people. They had enormous economic power,” the deputy minister said. “And they were so arrogant that the German people felt a little nervous. Then one day, a certain Hitler came to power and put these populations in gas chambers.” The remark was understood as a warning to the Bamiléké ethnic group which Kamto belongs to, who have a “reputation for being successful businessmen,” according to the BBC‘s “Africa Live” program. Momo, who is also an ethnic Bamiléké, said it would be wrong for the group to seek political power alongside its economic influence, and suggested that trying to do so could be dangerous for the entire community. In a statement on Monday, the Israeli embassy in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, “strongly” condemned Momo’s comment, which it said “makes a tacit justification of the Holocaust by Nazi Germany.” Shortly after Israel voiced its criticism of Momo, the Cameroon government distanced itself from the deputy minister’s remarks. “The government of the Republic of Cameroon would like to stress that the minister concerned was speaking in a personal capacity,” Communications Minister René Emmanuel Sadi said in a statement to the AFP news agency on Tuesday. Sadi added that the government “deplores” the Momo’s comment, but did not elaborate on whether he would face further censure. Watch Cameroon government minister’s comment about the Holocaust below:

News article:
It is up to the Israeli government to decide how to deal with the Austrian far-right Freedom Party, the head of the country’s Jewish community said this week, indicating his support for Jerusalem’s boycott of the FPOe. He stressed that many of the party’s members still harbor deeply anti-Semitic sentiments, and that the leadership is not doing enough to act against them. Asked if the FPOe is truly anti-Semitic or merely far-right, Oskar Deutsch replied: “There have been 50 anti-Semitic incidents and neo-Nazi incidents [involving party members] in about 14 months. There were so many anti-Semitic incidents, that this question is entirely superfluous. It’s totally obvious.” Interviewed on the sidelines of Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen’s first state visit to Israel this week, Deutsch hailed the increasingly warm ties between Vienna and Jerusalem. His country has a rich Jewish life, he stressed, and should not be reduced to the Freedom Party, known by its German acronym FPOe, despite FPOe being a part of Austria’s ruling coalition. “It’s Israel’s decision how to deal with the FPOe. We in the Austrian Jewish community have a democratically elected board with seven different parties and a total of 24 members. This board has unanimously decided not to have any contact with the FPOe, not because of the party’s past, but because of the incidents in the present,” he told The Times of Israel on Tuesday. Both the Austrian Jewish community and the Israeli government currently have a policy not to meet with party officials, including Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, who was appointed by the party, though she is not a member. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms But the Austrian government, including Van der Bellen, has repeatedly asked Israel to ease its no-contact policy, if not with regard to the entire party, then at least for Kneissl, which has led to speculation that Jerusalem may at some point establish a channel of contact with her. “I believe the Israeli government is following the situation closely, and its policy is very reasonable. But it’s up to them,” Deutsch said. “I speak on behalf of my community — we have so far no reason to change our decision.” Kneissl attends all major FPOe events and has so far failed to condemn FPOe-led attacks on shechita, or kosher ritual slaughter, and the many Nazi scandals party members are involved in, Deutsch lamented. Advertisement Would Austrian Jews be unhappy if Israel established contact with FPOe or Kneissl? “Austrian Jews are very happy with many of the decisions the Israeli government makes, and less happy with some others. Not everyone agrees with everything,” Deutsch replied diplomatically. “Of course, I am satisfied with the Israeli government’s course until now. But if they change course at some point, I will take note of that decision. What else could I do? I don’t see a reason why the government should change its position now,” he said. It is one aspect of the Jewish character of this wonderful democracy to not give a hechsher [kosher stamp] to a party like the FPOe Noting that it is a hypothetical question, Deutsch indicated that he may not publicly criticize Jerusalem if it indeed changes its policy on the FPOe or Kneissl. “There are enough people in the world attacking Israel. I do not want to publicly attack the Israeli government,” he said, adding that Jerusalem’s current position “makes its foreign policy a truly Jewish position. Why should Jerusalem give up a Jewish foreign policy?” he asked rhetorically. Advertisement The Israeli government has “good reasons” for its policies vis-à-vis ministers running on an FPOe ticket, he went on, referring to Kneissl. “It is one aspect of the Jewish character of this wonderful democracy to not give a hechsher [kosher stamp] to a party like the FPOe.” The Freedom Party has not improved since it entered the coalition of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz a little over a year ago, Deutsch lamented. “There have been more than 50 anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi incidents, and perpetrators usually don’t face consequences.” Noting that the FPOe is the political home of Austria’s German-nationalist fraternities, Deutsch added that earlier this week one such fraternity referred to Austria as “Ostmark” — a term used by the Nazis after the Anschluss of Austria to Germany in 1938. Last year, police found Nazi song books in two fraternities led by FPOe officials, Deutsch recalled. The men were suspended temporarily but soon returned to their old positions. FPOe head and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache recently distanced himself from anti-Semitism, Deutsch noted. “But no action followed,” he added quickly. “Quite the opposite: the 50-plus anti-Semitic incidents had no consequences.” Ankunft in Israel. Jetzt sind wir schon in Jerusalem, gleich geht‘s zur Klagemauer. Es ist ein besonderer Tag!

Advertisement In Jerusalem, Van der Bellen also visited the Western Wall and the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center. Austria is not the FPOe. You shouldn’t reduce Austria to this party Nearly everywhere he went, the Austrian head of state mentioned his country’s complicity in the Holocaust, condemned modern anti-Semitism, and stressed Israel’s right to live in peace and security. But during his entire stay, he avoided publicly mentioning the FPOe, though he did bring it up in his Monday meeting with Rivlin, which took place behind closed doors. Rivlin, who is known as an outspoken opponent of European far-right parties — in November he refused to meet Italian Deputy Prime Minister and far-right party leader Matteo Salvini — did not raise the issue of the FPOe being a part of the government in Austria during two joint public appearances with Van der Bellen.

Van der Bellen (@vanderbellen) February 4, 2019 On Tuesday, Van der Bellen said, in an interview [German link], that he brought up the issue, urging Israel to give Kneissl “free access, for pragmatic reasons. He added that, if Jerusalem insists on its boycott of the foreign minister, “we will know how to deal with it.” Advertisement Speaking to The Times of Israel in the lobby of the King David Hotel, where the Austrian delegation was staying, Deutsch said there was no reason for Van der Bellen or his Israeli interlocutors to bring up the issue. “Austria is not the FPOe. You shouldn’t reduce Austria to this party,” he said. “President Rivlin’s opinion is known everywhere; he is one of the strongest opponents of extremist parties, not only of the FPOe but also of the Alternative for Germany or the French National Front. It is not necessary to repeat one’s opinion when one hasn’t changed it.” Van der Bellen, who has long had good relations with Austria’s Jewish community, came to Israel this week — it is his third time in the country — to further improve bilateral ties. That alone should be the focus of the visit, Deutsch said. “Let’s focus on the positive aspects. There are record numbers of Israeli tourists in Austria, our synagogue in Vienna is, on Friday evenings and Saturdays, packed with tourists from Israel. We have Jewish schools, kosher restaurants. Secular and religious life is possible,” he said. “Good things are happening. And when we have our president here, we should focus on these issues.”

I had very good talks with President @PresidentRuvi today. And I am sure: #Israel and #Austria and are two states who have many plans for the future. (vdb) pic.twitter.com/i4gUWVzEl3 — A. Van der Bellen (@vanderbellen) February 4, 2019 On Tuesday, Van der Bellen said, in an interview [German link], that he brought up the issue, urging Israel to give Kneissl “free access, for pragmatic reasons. He added that, if Jerusalem insists on its boycott of the foreign minister, “we will know how to deal with it.” Advertisement Speaking to The Times of Israel in the lobby of the King David Hotel, where the Austrian delegation was staying, Deutsch said there was no reason for Van der Bellen or his Israeli interlocutors to bring up the issue. “Austria is not the FPOe. You shouldn’t reduce Austria to this party,” he said. “President Rivlin’s opinion is known everywhere; he is one of the strongest opponents of extremist parties, not only of the FPOe but also of the Alternative for Germany or the French National Front. It is not necessary to repeat one’s opinion when one hasn’t changed it.” Van der Bellen, who has long had good relations with Austria’s Jewish community, came to Israel this week — it is his third time in the country — to further improve bilateral ties. That alone should be the focus of the visit, Deutsch said. “Let’s focus on the positive aspects. There are record numbers of Israeli tourists in Austria, our synagogue in Vienna is, on Friday evenings and Saturdays, packed with tourists from Israel. We have Jewish schools, kosher restaurants. Secular and religious life is possible,” he said. “Good things are happening. And when we have our president here, we should focus on these issues.”

News article:
Israel’s Ambassador to Germany, Jeremy Issacharoff, on Tuesday called on the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel “to change its voting behaviour” at the United Nations and to push for an end to anti-Israel bias at the international body. Issacharoff was quoted in BILD, the country’s largest circulating paper, saying that “Germany, of all places, regularly sides with the enemies of Israel. In November, Germany voted 16 times in 21 resolutions against Israel. It abstained in four resolutions.” Asked by The Jerusalem Post’s Benjamin Weinthal about his statement, the ambassador responded by writing on his Twitter feed, “[I] fully agree with Antje Schippmann’s article in Bild that it’s ‘urgently necessary’ to change German voting behavior in the UNGA on Israel and that Germany should adopt an ‘active leadership role in refocusing the common voting behavior of European partners.’” The report published in BILD on Monday was titled “Germany in the UN: FDP wants to stop anti-Israel insanity. We can no longer be followers.” The paper reported that at a Free Democratic Party (FDP) session in the Bundestag, the party passed a resolution calling for a change in Germany’s voting pattern at the UN. The foreign policy spokesman of the FDP, Bijan Djir-Sarai, and a fellow MP, Frank Müller-Rosentritt, introduced the pro-Israel resolution. According to the Post, the resolution calls on the federal government to “clearly distance itself from one-sided, politically motivated initiatives and alliances,” and to counteract the “political forces in the near and Middle East” which “openly threaten” the Jewish state. “We must no longer abandon Israel to the UN. It is madness that we are constantly on the side of countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran or Yemen against Israel,” Müller-Rosentritt told BILD. Issacharoff in the past has declined to comment on discussions he had with German officials about the country’s largely pro-Iran regime trade policy. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany said last month that they will soon launch the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), an arrangement that will allow them to trade with Iran and protect European companies from the effects of United States sanctions.

News article:
Warsaw, Poland – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday denied suggestions of going along with Holocaust historical revisionism in Poland. Netanyahu was asked Thursday in Warsaw about the issue by a reporter and replied: “Here I am saying Poles cooperated with the Nazis. I know the history and I don’t whitewash it. I bring it up.” Last year, Poland and Israel were embroiled in a bitter dispute over a Polish law that made it a crime to blame the Polish nation for Holocaust crimes. Israel saw it as an attempt by Poland to suppress discussion of the killing of Jews by Poles during the wartime German occupation. The dispute was resolved when Poland softened the law and Netanyahu and his Polish counterpart agreed on a joint declaration stressing the involvement of the Polish resistance in helping Jews. It was seen as a diplomatic coup for Poland but Netanyahu faced criticism from historians in Israel, including at Yad Vashem, for agreeing to a statement that they said distorted history. “The idea that we distort history or hide it is nonsense,” Netanyahu said. He was in Warsaw for a conference on the Middle East.

WARSAW, Poland — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu potentially sparked a fresh quarrel with Poland Thursday when he appeared to point at Polish collaboration with the Nazi regime. Asked by The Times of Israel about an agreement between Israel and Poland to end a bitter dispute over a law passed by Warsaw that criminalizes blaming the Polish nation for Holocaust crimes, Netanyahu denied suggestions of going along with historical revisionism. “Here I am saying Poles cooperated with the Nazis. I know the history and I don’t whitewash it. I bring it up,” he said. In some news reports, Netanyahu was quoted as saying “The Poles cooperated with the Nazis,” though Netanyahu’s office clarified that he did not say “the” and played a tape recording of the comments to reporters to confirm this.

Netanyahu has been courting closer ties with Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe as part of a bid to build up a bloc of support within the EU. Israel is supposedly slated to host an upcoming meeting of the Visegrad group within the EU, which Includes Poland, Hungary and other European countries friendly to Israel, but a new tiff with Warsaw could endanger those plans.

It was seen as a diplomatic coup for Poland but Netanyahu faced criticism from historians in Israel, including at Yad Vashem, for agreeing to a statement that they said distorted history. “The idea that we distort history or hide it is nonsense,” Netanyahu said Thursday. He said the law came up in a meeting earlier on Thursday with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Leading Israeli historians have harshly criticized the joint statement, arguing it inaccurately adopts the Polish narrative of the Holocaust, overstating Polish efforts to rescue Jews and understating anti-Jewish atrocities committed by Poles. Last July, Netanyahu said he had taken note of the criticism and would address it at a later time, but he has not done so. “Since then I heard that some of the historians have changed their mind,” he said, refusing to elaborate.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks at the Warsaw summit earlier this week sparked a diplomatic crisis with his host after reported comments appeared to show him accuse Poland of complicity in the Nazi Holocaust. The Israeli PM was in the Polish capital to attend a conference on the Middle East. Israel's Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as saying: "The Poles collaborated with the Nazis, and I don't know anyone who was ever sued for such a statement." Yaakov Katz, the Jerusalem Post's editor, told Reuters the account in his newspaper had used the term "Polish nation", although not in a direct quote from Netanyahu, and the story was swiftly amended to reflect what he really said. The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador for an explanation. But a deputy foreign minister, Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek, said the explanations given by Israel so far are "unclear" and that Warsaw is still awaiting a clarification that would leave it without any doubts. Poland has expressed an "expectation that the Israeli side will say in a clear way what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meant when he said the words that were quoted by the Israeli media," Szynkowski vel Sek said. He added, though, that this did not impact on the leaders' upcoming meeting slated to start Monday in Jerusalem. Commenting on Netanyahu's remarks, Polish President Andrzej Duda raised a question mark over a two-day summit in Jerusalem next week of the four central European nations - Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Duda said that if Netanyahu had said what was originally reported, "Israel would not be a good place to meet in spite of the previous arrangements". He offered his own presidential residence as an alternative venue. Later, Netanyahu's office weighed in with another statement, saying: "Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland. This was misquoted and misrepresented in press reports and was subsequently corrected by the journalist who issued the initial misstatement." Netanyahu has sought to use the so-called Visegrad group as a counterweight to western European Union criticism of Israel's policies towards the Palestinians. The Holocaust is still an extremely sensitive subject in Poland, even nearly 80 years after World War II.

The Israeli PM was in the Polish capital to attend a conference on the Middle East. Israel's Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as saying: "The Poles collaborated with the Nazis, and I don't know anyone who was ever sued for such a statement." Yaakov Katz, the Jerusalem Post's editor, told Reuters the account in his newspaper had used the term "Polish nation", although not in a direct quote from Netanyahu, and the story was swiftly amended to reflect what he really said. The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador for an explanation. But a deputy foreign minister, Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek, said the explanations given by Israel so far are "unclear" and that Warsaw is still awaiting a clarification that would leave it without any doubts. Poland has expressed an "expectation that the Israeli side will say in a clear way what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meant when he said the words that were quoted by the Israeli media," Szynkowski vel Sek said. He added, though, that this did not impact on the leaders' upcoming meeting slated to start Monday in Jerusalem. Commenting on Netanyahu's remarks, Polish President Andrzej Duda raised a question mark over a two-day summit in Jerusalem next week of the four central European nations - Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Duda said that if Netanyahu had said what was originally reported, "Israel would not be a good place to meet in spite of the previous arrangements". He offered his own presidential residence as an alternative venue. Later, Netanyahu's office weighed in with another statement, saying: "Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland. This was misquoted and misrepresented in press reports and was subsequently corrected by the journalist who issued the initial misstatement." Netanyahu has sought to use the so-called Visegrad group as a counterweight to western European Union criticism of Israel's policies towards the Palestinians. The Holocaust is still an extremely sensitive subject in Poland, even nearly 80 years after World War II.

(Adds new Israeli statement) WARSAW, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Poland summoned Israel's ambassador on Friday and threatened to scupper a summit in Jerusalem after reported comments in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to accuse the Polish nation of complicity in the Nazi Holocaust. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the prime minister, who was in Warsaw for a U.S.-sponsored Middle East conference, had been misquoted by The Jerusalem Post, which issued a corrected story. In a later statement, Netanyahu's office said that in his remarks on the question of Polish collaboration with Nazi occupiers, he had not cast any blanket blame. Poland, where sensitivities over the issue of its actions during the Holocaust are high, called in Israeli envoy Anna Azari. The matter of Poland's conduct during the Holocaust - in which many of the six million Jewish dead were killed in Nazi camps on Polish soil - was at the centre of an Israeli-Polish diplomatic dispute last year. After an outcry in Israel and the United States, Poland's conservative Law and Justice government backed out of legislation mandating jail terms for anyone suggesting the country had collaborated with the Nazis. Sensitivities were tested again late on Thursday after Netanyahu answered a question about that law posed by one of the Israeli reporters who had travelled with him to Poland. Israel's Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as saying: "The Poles collaborated with the Nazis, and I don't know anyone who was ever sued for such a statement." Yaakov Katz, the Jerusalem Post's editor, told Reuters the account in his newspaper had used the term "Polish nation", although not in a direct quote from Netanyahu, and the story was swiftly amended to reflect what he really said. But Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek said Warsaw wanted the matter "to be clarified unequivocally". Hours later, Netanyahu's office issued a second statement. "In a briefing, PM Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland," the statement said. Many Poles still refuse to accept research showing thousands participated in the Holocaust in addition to the thousands who risked their lives to help the Jews. Commenting on Netanyahu's remarks, Polish President Andrzej Duda raised a question mark over a two-day summit in Jerusalem next week of the four central European nations - Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

Poland's prime minister has canceled plans to send a delegation to meeting in Jerusalem after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Poles 'collaborated with the Nazis'. This was later followed by the acting Israeli foreign minister repeating Netanyahu's words, and adding that Poles 'sucked anti-Semitism from their mothers' milk.' The developments mark a new low in a bitter conflict over how to remember and characterize Polish actions toward Jews during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, left, canceled plans to send a delegation to Jerusalem after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pictured right, said Poles 'collaborated with the Nazis' Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki had already announced Sunday that he was pulling out of the meeting with Netanyahu and leaders of four central European nations. That had followed a comment by Netanyahu last week about Polish cooperation with Nazis. Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz had been tapped to attend in his place. But Morawiecki said he was canceling the Polish participation altogether because he considered Katz's comments 'racist' and 'absolutely unacceptable.' The Foreign Ministry also summoned the Israeli ambassador, Anna Azari, to demand a second set of clarifications in recent days. Monday's development marks a deterioration of a spat that began last Thursday when Netanyahu said: 'Poles cooperated with the Nazis.' Morawiecki, centre, attends a a commemoration event at the Nazi German concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, during the ceremonies marking the 74th anniversary of the liberation of the camp and International Holocaust Victims Remembrance Day last month Netanyahu's office said he was misquoted. The Polish government first summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday but said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly. Israel's acting foreign minister, Israel Katz, made his remarks Sunday in an interview on Reshet 13 TV. 'I am the son of Holocaust survivors,' he said, in his first day in the new job. 'The memory of the Holocaust is not something to compromise about. It is obvious. We will not forget, and we will not forgive.' He then vowed that no one would change the historical truth of what happened. 'Poles collaborated with the Nazis, definitely. Collaborated with the Nazis. As (former Israeli Prime Minister) Yitzhak Shamir said - his father was murdered by Poles - he said that from his point of view they sucked anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk. You can't sugarcoat this history,' he said. Poland was the first occupation of Adolf Hitler's regime and never had a collaborationist government. Members of Poland's resistance and government-in-exile struggled to warn the world about the mass killing of Jews, and thousands of Poles risked their lives to help Jews. However, Holocaust researchers have collected ample evidence of Polish villagers who murdered Jews fleeing the Nazis, or Polish blackmailers who preyed on the Jews for financial gain.

Poland's prime minister has canceled plans to send a delegation to meeting in Jerusalem after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Poles 'collaborated with the Nazis'. This was later followed by the acting Israeli foreign minister repeating Netanyahu's words, and adding that Poles 'sucked anti-Semitism from their mothers' milk.'

News article:
JERUSALEM (JTA) — It was meant to be a diplomatic triumph for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: a much-touted diplomatic summit here on Monday with four Central European states. Instead, harsh words from Israel’s acting foreign minister opened a diplomatic rift threatening to severely damage Israeli-Polish relations, and the summit was canceled. Warsaw decided to pull out on the day of the meeting after Yisrael Katz, citing the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, told Israel’s Channel 13 that morning that Poles “suckle anti-Semitism with their mother’s milk,” causing a national furor in both countries. Netanyahu has been promoting the meeting of the so-called Visegrad Group — an alliance of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia that represents the nationalist and conservative wing of the European Union — as heralding a nationalist bloc within the EU that supports Israeli policies more strongly than many in the west. However, he has also come under harsh criticism from domestic critics on both the right and the left, who have alleged that Netanyahu has shown an overly solicitous attitude toward Israel’s Eastern and Central European allies. According to this view, Jerusalem has downplayed concerns over anti-Semitism and Holocaust memory in favor of closer engagement. Poland’s decision to pull out, which effectively canceled the summit and caused the other Visegrad, or V4, nations to downgrade their diplomatic visits to merely bilateral ones, came after several days of furious denunciations and diplomatic scrambling. The controversy began on Friday when The Jerusalem Post reported that Netanyahu, in Warsaw for a conference on the Middle East, accused “the Polish nation” of collaborating with the Nazis. Netanyahu later clarified that he had not implicated the Poles collectively. The Post subsequently amended its story and initially it appeared that the crisis had been averted. Katz’s comments, however, revived the diplomatic crisis. “I am a son of Holocaust survivors, and I was even born and grew up in a community made up of Holocaust survivors,” said Katz, a senior Likud minister just tapped by Netanyahu as acting foreign minister. “The memory of the Holocaust is something we cannot compromise about. It is clear and we won’t forget or forgive. “In diplomacy you try not to offend, but nobody will change the historical truth to do something like that,” he continued. “Poles collaborated with the Nazis, definitely. As Yitzhak Shamir said, they suckle anti-Semitism with their mother’s milk.” Poland’s ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski, tweeted that he was astonished that Katz had uttered “such a shameful and racist remark.” The Polish Foreign Ministry reprimanded Israeli Ambassador to Poland Anna Azari and is reported to be considering withdrawing Magierowski from Tel Aviv in protest. Katz was unapologetic, telling i24 News that “no one will tell us how to express ourselves or how to remember our fallen.” By early afternoon in Jerusalem the summit had been officially canceled, a stunning reversal of last year when Netanyahu had appeared to endorse a Polish narrative of the war years and released a joint statement with his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, defending Poland’s wartime record. That statement was itself an effort to repair ruptured ties after Jerusalem condemned Poland for a controversial law that made it a crime to hold Poland responsible for Nazi crimes. The release of the joint statement led to an unprecedented rebuke of the prime minister from the usually apolitical Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. It termed the joint statement “an offense not only to the historical truth, but also to the memory of the heroism of the Righteous Among the Nations.” Yad Vashem has recognized over 6,800 non-Jewish Poles as Righteous Among the Nations for having risked their lives to save Jews — far more than in any other country. Netanyahu’s joint statement with Morawiecki last year also seemed to equate anti-Semitism with animus toward Poles, stating immediately after a condemnation of anti-Semitism that “both governments also express their rejection of anti-Polonism and other negative national stereotypes.” It was later reported in the Polish press that Morawiecki had emphasized that the declaration was the first that put anti-Polonism on the books as a recognized form of discrimination. “One should read the current Polish reactions to Israeli expressions in this context,” said Havi Dreifuss, a historian of the Holocaust in Eastern Europe at Tel Aviv University. “Polish officials stated it is racism, since for them Israel confirmed that anti-Polonism and anti-Semitism are similar fundamental hatreds. This is just one problematic practical consequences of the joint declaration. “Yet one should also note that much of what was said lately in the Israeli media is far from being accurate. The fact that many Poles took part in harming Jews doesn’t mean that all Poles killed Jews. And the Holocaust was first and foremost the product of Nazi Germany and its murderous ideology. Moreover, anti-Semitism was one important motive for Polish readiness to harm Jews, but was definitely not the only one. Updated research and the vast documentation available exposed how alongside Polish anti-Semitism, Jews were harmed for various reasons, including greed, revenge, terror and more. We must remember to describe the Holocaust and Polish-Jewish relations in the Holocaust in a much more complicated manner.” Addressing the controversy at a gathering of American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem on Monday morning, Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett said Jerusalem “deeply value[s its] friendship with the Polish government and people, but we cannot in any way allow anyone to revise history. That’s not the way to build a good relationship.” While the Polish people were also victims of the Nazis, “they also had many Poles who were involved in anti-Semitism,” Bennett told members of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. He went on to describe how his wife’s grandfather’s mother and brothers were murdered near the end of the war by a gang of Polish teens. According to Rafal Pankowski, a Polish academic and the founder of the Never Again Association, recent days have seen an uptick in anti-Semitic sentiment in Poland that appears to mirror the atmosphere that prevailed last year during the previous diplomatic crisis. During that period, local media engaged in rhetoric seen by many as anti-Semitic. Pankowski cited recent statements by journalist Rafał Ziemkiewicz, a host on state television, who tweeted to his 166,000 followers that “the worst of it is that a man cannot even hate Jews in response” because this is what they want. Another state TV personality, Jakub Pacan, said he believed that recent Israeli comments were the moral equivalent of Pearl Harbor. “We saw the dynamics last year, so we know how it works more of less,” Pankowski told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “It’s a kind of spark that activates the kind of prejudice and rhetoric that is ready made.” Pankowski rejected the equivalence of anti-Semitism and anti-Polonism, saying that he had “never heard about anyone in Israel believing there is a Polish global plot against the Jewish people, but I’ve heard many times in Poland people [stating] that there is a global Jewish plot against the Polish people.” While acknowledging the complicity of “a number of Poles” in the Holocaust, the Union of Jewish Communities in Poland responded harshly to Katz’s words, saying in a statement that “accusing all Poles of anti-Semitism offends the Righteous; it also offends all those who today want to see in them the true representation of Polish society. And it also offends us, Polish Jews, who are a part of that society.” “One does not clarify lies by another set of lies,” Polish Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich told JTA. “It is not honest [and] it is not moral to fight lies with another set of lies. “What do you want?” he replied when asked about the uproar in Poland. Katz “functionally said that all Poles are anti-Semites. So how do you expect the Poles to react? There are irresponsible people on both sides, and when an irresponsible statement is made it empowers other irresponsible people to react. This in no way justifies anti-Semitism in Poland, just as it does not justify distortion of the truth by Israeli leaders.” The Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Efraim Zuroff, a harsh critic of Poland’s attempts to quash its complicated historical record, likewise reacted harshly to Katz’s statement, calling it “the kind of blanket generalization that should never be made.” The diplomatic spat between Jerusalem and Warsaw also coincided with conflict over the issue of Holocaust restitution. On Sunday, Morawiecki rejected U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s call “to move forward with comprehensive private property restitution legislation for those who lost property during the Holocaust era,” stating that the issue had been “definitely resolved.” According to the World Jewish Restitution Organization, Poland is the only European Union member without such legislation. “Jewish and non-Jewish rightful owners and their families have been waiting for many years for Poland to pass legislation to provide them some measure of justice for the property wrongfully taken from them in Poland,” the WJRO said in a statement. “We urge Prime Minister Morawiecki and his Government to seize this opportunity to do justice for those who lost so much.” Addressing the Presidents Conference on Monday evening, Netanyahu did not acknowledge the diplomatic breakdown that led to the canceling of the V4 summit, instead praising himself for expanding Israeli diplomatic relations around the world while pointing to a map labeled “expanding Israel’s diplomatic horizons.” Poland remained on the map. “There has been a tremendous change in Israel’s acceptance around the world by just about every country,” he said.

This in no way justifies anti-Semitism in Poland, just as it does not justify distortion of the truth by Israeli leaders.” The Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Efraim Zuroff, a harsh critic of Poland’s attempts to quash its complicated historical record, likewise reacted harshly to Katz’s statement, calling it “the kind of blanket generalization that should never be made.” The diplomatic spat between Jerusalem and Warsaw also coincided with conflict over the issue of Holocaust restitution. On Sunday, Morawiecki rejected U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s call “to move forward with comprehensive private property restitution legislation for those who lost property during the Holocaust era,” stating that the issue had been “definitely resolved.” According to the World Jewish Restitution Organization, Poland is the only European Union member without such legislation. “Jewish and non-Jewish rightful owners and their families have been waiting for many years for Poland to pass legislation to provide them some measure of justice for the property wrongfully taken from them in Poland,” the WJRO said in a statement. “We urge Prime Minister Morawiecki and his Government to seize this opportunity to do justice for those who lost so much.” Addressing the Presidents Conference on Monday evening, Netanyahu did not acknowledge the diplomatic breakdown that led to the canceling of the V4 summit, instead praising himself for expanding Israeli diplomatic relations around the world while pointing to a map labeled “expanding Israel’s diplomatic horizons.” Poland remained on the map. “There has been a tremendous change in Israel’s acceptance around the world by just about every country,” he said.

"Remarks by the new minister of @IsraelMFA @Israel_katz are not only insulting, but also stir up negative emotions between our nations and contribute to increasing anti-Polonism and anti-Semitism. We expect an adequate reaction from the Israeli side," the ministry said via its official Twitter feed. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki warned that Warsaw would not send any representatives to the upcoming Visegrad Group summit in Jerusalem if Israel did not react to the incident in a due manner. Commenting on the summoning, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek stated that Warsaw demanded that the Israeli authorities unequivocally condemn Katz’s allegations. "We expect a strong and unequivocal response from the Israeli authorities to that statement… It is extremely important for us that this kind of statement not overshadow relations between Poland and Israel… In this regard, we expect that [these statements] will become the subject of unequivocal condemnation and elucidation," Szynkowski vel Sek told reporters. He also stressed that the Polish authorities hoped that this situation would not affect relations with Israel. "It is very sad that there are politicians in Israel who are ready to put good Polish-Israeli relations on the altar of political struggle," Szynkowski vel Sek said.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week approached and briefly spoke with Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl despite a formal boycott, according to a senior official in Vienna. The Prime Minister’s Office denied the claim. In response to a query about the encounter, the PMO said in a statement: “Israel’s policy has not changed with regard to the party. The minister surprised the prime minister and approached him unexpectedly. There was no conversation or meeting.” Kneissl was appointed to her post by the far-right Freedom Party, which Jerusalem shuns due to its closeness to the neo-Nazi scene. She is not formally a member of the party and her office refused to comment on the reported meeting. If it indeed took place, the encounter, which is said to have occurred Thursday at the sidelines of an international conference in Warsaw, would indicate that the Israeli government is no longer adhering to its declared policy of refraining from contact with officials affiliated with the FPOe, as the party is known in German. A senior diplomatic official in Vienna confirmed to The Times of Israel that a brief meeting, including “some small talk,” took place at the sidelines of the so-called Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East” in the Polish capital, minutes after a photo of all delegates was taken. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu approached Kneissl and a “short, friendly exchange of words” ensued, the senior official told The Times of Israel, speaking on condition of anonymity. “I think that this meeting is an additional sign that the boycott against Mrs. Kneissl could end soon,” the official added. Officially, Israel has not changed its no-contact policy regarding the FPOe and officials affiliated with the party, though it has long been rumored that Jerusalem may consider easing establishing a relationship with Kneissl, since she holds the foreign portfolio and is not officially a member of the party. The Austrian Jewish community continues to advocate for a full boycott of the party — and Kneissl. Advertisement “It’s Israel’s decision how to deal with the FPOe. We in the Austrian Jewish community have a democratically elected board with seven different parties and a total of 24 members. This board has unanimously decided not to have any contact with the FPOe, not because of the party’s past, but because of the incidents in the present,” Austrian Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch told The Times of Israel in a recent interview. “I believe the Israeli government is following the situation closely, and its policy is very reasonable. But it’s up to them,” Deutsch said. “I speak on behalf of my community — we have so far no reason to change our decision.” Kneissl attends all major FPOe events and has so far failed to condemn FPOe-led attacks on shehita, or kosher ritual slaughter, and the numerous Nazi scandals party members are involved in, Deutsch lamented. Would Austrian Jews be unhappy if Israel established contact with FPOe or Kneissl? “Austrian Jews are very happy with many of the decisions the Israeli government makes, and less happy with some others. Not everyone agrees with everything,” Deutsch replied diplomatically. “Of course, I am satisfied with the Israeli government’s course until now. But if they change course at some point, I will take note of that decision. What else could I do? I don’t see a reason why the government should change its position now,” he said. Advertisement Noting that it is a hypothetical question, Deutsch indicated that he may not publicly criticize Jerusalem if it indeed changes its policy on the FPOe or Kneissl. “There are enough people in the world attacking Israel. I do not want to publicly attack the Israeli government,” he said, adding that Jerusalem’s current position “makes its foreign policy a truly Jewish position. Why should Jerusalem give up a Jewish foreign policy?” he asked rhetorically. The Israeli government has “good reasons” for its policies vis-à-vis ministers running on an FPOe ticket, he went on, referring to Kneissl. “It is one aspect of the Jewish character of this wonderful democracy to not give a hechsher [kosher stamp] to a party like the FPOe.”

News article:
Poland’s prime minister on Monday canceled Warsaw’s participation in a summit of central European countries in Jerusalem, branding as “racist” a comment by Israel’s newly appointed foreign minister, who said Poles “suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk.” “The words of the Israeli foreign minister are racist and unacceptable… it is clear that our foreign minister (Jacek) Czaputowicz will not be traveling to the summit,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Polish media. Poland earlier summoned Israeli Ambassador Anna Azari for a reprimand — the second in four days — and was reportedly weighing the option of recalling its envoy from the Jewish state. “We are considering recalling the Polish ambassador from Israel,” a source close to Morawiecki was quoted as saying by the Ynet news site. “There is a consensus in Poland that what has been done is very severe and cannot be ignored.” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Monday that the summit would now consist of bilateral discussions, and the conference would be rescheduled for later in the year, the Reuters news agency reported. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Morawiecki on Sunday canceled his trip to Israel for the high-level summit, as a diplomatic spat continued over comments made last week by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Polish collaboration with the Nazis. Czaputowicz had been expected to attend the summit of the so-called Visegrad Group of central European countries in place of the premier. Israel Katz made the remark in a TV interview on Sunday, after earlier the same day he was appointed acting foreign minister by Netanyahu. “I am a son of Holocaust survivors and I was even born and grew up in a community made up of Holocaust survivors,” Katz told Channel 13. “The memory of the Holocaust is something we cannot compromise about; it is clear and we won’t forget or forgive. Advertisement “In diplomacy you try not to offend, but nobody will change the historical truth to do something like that,” he added. “Poles collaborated with the Nazis, definitely. As [former prime minister] Yitzhak Shamir said, they suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk.” On Monday morning Katz told Israel Radio that “the Poles took part in the extermination of Jews in the Holocaust. Poland became the biggest cemetery of the Jewish people.” On Sunday night, Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski tweeted in response to Katz that “it is really astonishing that the newly appointed foreign minister of Israel quotes such a shameful and racist remark. Utterly unacceptable.” The crisis began on Thursday when Netanyahu was asked by The Times of Israel in Warsaw about a controversial agreement between Israel and Poland to end a dispute over a law passed by Warsaw that criminalizes blaming the Polish nation for Holocaust crimes. Netanyahu denied suggestions that he was going along with historical revisionism: “Here I am saying Poles cooperated with the Nazis. I know the history and I don’t whitewash it. I bring it up,” he said. He added that “a not insignificant number” of Poles had collaborated and said, “I don’t know one person who was sued for saying that.” Advertisement A Jerusalem Post story (later corrected) mischaracterized the Israeli leader’s quote as saying the Polish nation collaborated with the Nazis. And in some news reports, Netanyahu was quoted as saying “The Poles cooperated with the Nazis.” Netanyahu’s office later clarified that he did not say “the,” and played reporters a recording of the comments to confirm this. Netanyahu was in Poland for a US-sponsored summit on Mideast security. Poland later said it had received clarifications from the Israeli government that had alleviated its concerns. The presidential office blamed “media manipulation” by the Jerusalem Post for a misunderstanding about Netanyahu’s comments. Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement to similar effect: “The Prime Minister’s comments concerning Poland were misquoted by the Jerusalem Post, which quickly issued a correction clarifying that an error had been made in the editing of the article.” Netanyahu landed back in Israel late Friday and his office then clarified again: “In a briefing, PM Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland,” it said in a statement. “This was misquoted and misrepresented in press reports and was subsequently corrected by the journalist who issued the initial misstatement.” Nonetheless, Azari was summoned by Poland’s Foreign Ministry for a dressing down over the issue. The initial news reports led Polish President Adrzej Duda to threaten to block the high-level summit from taking place in Israel. Duda wrote on Twitter that if Netanyahu indeed had made the comments, he would offer to host the meeting of the so-called Visegrad group himself instead of holding the meeting in Israel. Advertisement “In this situation, Israel is not a good place to meet,” Duda had said. However, Israel’s embassy in Poland contacted the Polish leadership Thursday night and clarified that Netanyahu “didn’t say the Polish nation carried out crimes against Jews, but only that no one has been sued under the Holocaust law for saying ‘Poles’ collaborated.” Ambassador Azari said Netanyahu “never mentioned the ‘Polish nation’ in this context… The Jerusalem Post has already changed its article, noting that the earlier version was untrue — it happened at the request of Prime Minister Netanyahu.” On Sunday, Poland’s wPolityce news website reported that Morawiecki had informed Netanyahu in a phone conversation that he would not attend the Visegrad summit in Jerusalem. The site said that the conversation between the two was positive nonetheless. A senior Israeli diplomatic official said Israel was “happy” to host Czaputowicz instead, and hinted that Morawiecki was playing to domestic pressures by canceling his visit. “We expect this summit to become a great success,” the official said in a statement. “We understand that also in Poland there are elections.” Poland is slated to hold national elections in the coming year. Advertisement Israel was set to host the prime ministers of the four countries in the group — Poland’s Morawiecki, the Czech Republic’s Andrej Babis, Slovakia’s Peter Pellegrini, and Hungary’s Viktor Orban — in Jerusalem on February 18-19. The other premiers are still slated to attend. Netanyahu has been courting closer ties with Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe as part of a bid to build up a bloc of support within the EU. The Jerusalem meeting would be the first time the consortium, which was founded in 1991, ever convened outside of Europe. A dispute over the Polish Holocaust law was resolved last year when Poland softened the law and Netanyahu and his Polish counterpart agreed on a joint declaration stressing the involvement of the Polish resistance in helping Jews. It was seen as a diplomatic coup for Poland but Netanyahu faced criticism from historians in Israel, including at Yad Vashem, for agreeing to a statement that they said distorted history. Leading Israeli historians have harshly criticized the joint statement, arguing it inaccurately adopts the Polish narrative of the Holocaust, overstating Polish efforts to rescue Jews and understating anti-Jewish atrocities committed by Poles.

News article:
Poland’s prime minister on Monday canceled Warsaw’s participation in a summit of central European countries in Jerusalem, branding as “racist” a comment by Israel’s newly appointed foreign minister, who said Poles “suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk.” “The words of the Israeli foreign minister are racist and unacceptable… it is clear that our foreign minister (Jacek) Czaputowicz will not be traveling to the summit,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Polish media. Poland earlier summoned Israeli Ambassador Anna Azari for a reprimand — the second in four days — and was reportedly weighing the option of recalling its envoy from the Jewish state. “We are considering recalling the Polish ambassador from Israel,” a source close to Morawiecki was quoted as saying by the Ynet news site. “There is a consensus in Poland that what has been done is very severe and cannot be ignored.” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Monday that the summit would now consist of bilateral discussions, and the conference would be rescheduled for later in the year, the Reuters news agency reported. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Morawiecki on Sunday canceled his trip to Israel for the high-level summit, as a diplomatic spat continued over comments made last week by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Polish collaboration with the Nazis. Czaputowicz had been expected to attend the summit of the so-called Visegrad Group of central European countries in place of the premier. Israel Katz made the remark in a TV interview on Sunday, after earlier the same day he was appointed acting foreign minister by Netanyahu. “I am a son of Holocaust survivors and I was even born and grew up in a community made up of Holocaust survivors,” Katz told Channel 13. “The memory of the Holocaust is something we cannot compromise about; it is clear and we won’t forget or forgive. Advertisement “In diplomacy you try not to offend, but nobody will change the historical truth to do something like that,” he added. “Poles collaborated with the Nazis, definitely. As [former prime minister] Yitzhak Shamir said, they suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk.” On Monday morning Katz told Israel Radio that “the Poles took part in the extermination of Jews in the Holocaust. Poland became the biggest cemetery of the Jewish people.” On Sunday night, Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski tweeted in response to Katz that “it is really astonishing that the newly appointed foreign minister of Israel quotes such a shameful and racist remark. Utterly unacceptable.” The crisis began on Thursday when Netanyahu was asked by The Times of Israel in Warsaw about a controversial agreement between Israel and Poland to end a dispute over a law passed by Warsaw that criminalizes blaming the Polish nation for Holocaust crimes. Netanyahu denied suggestions that he was going along with historical revisionism: “Here I am saying Poles cooperated with the Nazis. I know the history and I don’t whitewash it. I bring it up,” he said. He added that “a not insignificant number” of Poles had collaborated and said, “I don’t know one person who was sued for saying that.” Advertisement A Jerusalem Post story (later corrected) mischaracterized the Israeli leader’s quote as saying the Polish nation collaborated with the Nazis. And in some news reports, Netanyahu was quoted as saying “The Poles cooperated with the Nazis.” Netanyahu’s office later clarified that he did not say “the,” and played reporters a recording of the comments to confirm this. Netanyahu was in Poland for a US-sponsored summit on Mideast security. Poland later said it had received clarifications from the Israeli government that had alleviated its concerns. The presidential office blamed “media manipulation” by the Jerusalem Post for a misunderstanding about Netanyahu’s comments. Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement to similar effect: “The Prime Minister’s comments concerning Poland were misquoted by the Jerusalem Post, which quickly issued a correction clarifying that an error had been made in the editing of the article.” Netanyahu landed back in Israel late Friday and his office then clarified again: “In a briefing, PM Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland,” it said in a statement. “This was misquoted and misrepresented in press reports and was subsequently corrected by the journalist who issued the initial misstatement.” Nonetheless, Azari was summoned by Poland’s Foreign Ministry for a dressing down over the issue. The initial news reports led Polish President Adrzej Duda to threaten to block the high-level summit from taking place in Israel. Duda wrote on Twitter that if Netanyahu indeed had made the comments, he would offer to host the meeting of the so-called Visegrad group himself instead of holding the meeting in Israel. Advertisement “In this situation, Israel is not a good place to meet,” Duda had said. However, Israel’s embassy in Poland contacted the Polish leadership Thursday night and clarified that Netanyahu “didn’t say the Polish nation carried out crimes against Jews, but only that no one has been sued under the Holocaust law for saying ‘Poles’ collaborated.” Ambassador Azari said Netanyahu “never mentioned the ‘Polish nation’ in this context… The Jerusalem Post has already changed its article, noting that the earlier version was untrue — it happened at the request of Prime Minister Netanyahu.” On Sunday, Poland’s wPolityce news website reported that Morawiecki had informed Netanyahu in a phone conversation that he would not attend the Visegrad summit in Jerusalem. The site said that the conversation between the two was positive nonetheless. A senior Israeli diplomatic official said Israel was “happy” to host Czaputowicz instead, and hinted that Morawiecki was playing to domestic pressures by canceling his visit. “We expect this summit to become a great success,” the official said in a statement. “We understand that also in Poland there are elections.” Poland is slated to hold national elections in the coming year. Advertisement Israel was set to host the prime ministers of the four countries in the group — Poland’s Morawiecki, the Czech Republic’s Andrej Babis, Slovakia’s Peter Pellegrini, and Hungary’s Viktor Orban — in Jerusalem on February 18-19. The other premiers are still slated to attend. Netanyahu has been courting closer ties with Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe as part of a bid to build up a bloc of support within the EU. The Jerusalem meeting would be the first time the consortium, which was founded in 1991, ever convened outside of Europe. A dispute over the Polish Holocaust law was resolved last year when Poland softened the law and Netanyahu and his Polish counterpart agreed on a joint declaration stressing the involvement of the Polish resistance in helping Jews. It was seen as a diplomatic coup for Poland but Netanyahu faced criticism from historians in Israel, including at Yad Vashem, for agreeing to a statement that they said distorted history. Leading Israeli historians have harshly criticized the joint statement, arguing it inaccurately adopts the Polish narrative of the Holocaust, overstating Polish efforts to rescue Jews and understating anti-Jewish atrocities committed by Poles.

News article:
YERUSHALAYIM (Reuters) — Hungarian leader Viktor Orban urged Poland and Israel on Tuesday to resolve their dispute over accusations of Polish complicity in the Holocaust, making the appeal in Jerusalem after Warsaw pulled out of a planned Israeli-hosted summit. The Hungarian prime minister and counterparts from Slovakia and the Czech Republic held back-to-back talks with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in lieu of the formal gathering of the central European Visegrad Group (V-4) of countries that also includes Poland. Poland withdrew from the summit after Israel’s Acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz said on Monday that “many Poles” had collaborated with the Nazis in World War II and shared responsibility for the Holocaust. “I think it would be better that they would be here, and we have good friendship with Poland, as you know … and we have good friendship with Israel,” Orban, asked by a reporter if he was disappointed by Poland’s absence, said after meeting Netanyahu. “When you have two friends having discussions with each other the only hope you can have is that they will talk directly with each other and improve the situation. That’s my hope also.” Netanyahu, who was standing at the podium with Orban when the question was asked, did not respond directly, saying only that the Hungarian leader was a “superb diplomat.” The diplomatic row has been escalating since Friday, when some Israeli media reported remarks by Netanyahu in which he appeared to accuse the Polish nation of involvement in the Holocaust. Netanyahu’s office said he had been misquoted in his response to a reporter’s question during a visit to Warsaw about Polish legislation related to Holocaust remembrance, and that he had not cast any blanket blame. Many Poles refuse to accept research showing thousands of their countrymen participated in the Holocaust in addition to thousands of others who risked their lives to help the Jews. Tensions between Israel and Poland also rose last year after Poland introduced new legislation that would have made the use of phrases such as “Polish death camps” punishable by up to three years in prison. After pressure from the United States and an outcry in Israel, Poland watered down the legislation, scrapping the prison sentences.

In an email exchange with American rabbi Shmuley Boteach, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has spoken about friendship between the Polish and the Jewish nations. "Poland is devoted to the Jewish people and the state of Israel," Morawiecki wrote on Tuesday in the email quoted by The Jerusalem Post. "I hope that we will finally come to terms with Prime Minister Netanyahu, but words like those by the minister of foreign affairs are totally unacceptable for Poland," Morawiecki said. Commenting on the diplomatic row, U.S. ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher said on Wednesday that Israeli acting foreign minister should apologize to Poland for his remarks. Israel's newly-appointed acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz said on Sunday that Poles "collaborated with the Nazis" during World War II.

Israel's newly-appointed acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz said on Sunday that Poles "collaborated with the Nazis" during World War II. Since then, numerous Polish politicians have demanded an apology and Poland pulled out of a meeting of Central European countries and Israel scheduled to take place this week in Jerusalem.

News article:
VIENNA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A group representing Austrian Holocaust survivors voiced outrage on Wednesday over staffing shortages in a government department dealing with Nazi-related crimes, calling on Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to take action. Kurz, a conservative governing in coalition with a far-right party founded by ex-Nazis, has repeatedly denounced anti-Semitism and the Holocaust since taking office just over a year ago. His government has pledged to offer citizenship to the descendants of Austrians who fled the country under Nazi rule. But a department at the main domestic intelligence agency that handles reports of Nazi-related crimes is understaffed to the point of having a large backlog, according to the Mauthausen Committee, which represents survivors of Austria's biggest Nazi-era concentration camp. "The government - and in particular the chancellor - stresses at every opportunity that everything is being done to fight neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism effectively," the committee said in a statement. "In fact the Nazism-reporting department is being denied the necessary staff, to the point that it has a backlog of hundreds of pieces of evidence and some far-right crimes are falling under statutes of limitations," it said, adding that it mainly gets no reply when it passes on information to the department. The far-right Freedom Party controls much of Austria's security apparatus including the Interior Ministry, to which the main domestic intelligence agency belongs. "Chancellor Kurz is responsible for ensuring that Interior Minister (Herbert) Kickl no longer hinders the fight against neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism. One can only hope that there is no political intent behind this hindrance," the committee said. In Austria, which was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, it is a crime to deny the Holocaust or give the Hitler salute. As in several other European countries, cases of anti-Semitism appear to be on the rise. The leader of Austria's main Jewish organisation also says the far-right Freedom Party that is in power has failed to tackle anti-Semitism within its ranks, even after scandals involving party officials. Israel refuses to deal directly with Freedom Party ministers even though the party says it has turned its back on its Nazi past, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised Kurz for saying Israel's security is a major priority.

News article:
The U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher called on Israel to apologize to Poland for Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz’s comments regarding the Holocaust. Mosbacher said that Katz should apologize, responding that what he said “warrants an apology.” Katz told Israel’s i24 news channel on Sunday, “I am the son of Holocaust survivors, we will never forgive and never forget, and there were many Poles who collaborated with the Nazis.” Quoting former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Katz added that “Shamir said that every Pole sucked anti-Semitism with his mother’s milk. Nobody will tell us how to express our stance and how to honor the dead.” The remarks were made after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the recent Warsaw summit on the Mideast that Poles cooperated with Nazis during the Holocaust, and that no one has been sued for asserting this truth, criticizing Poland’s Holocaust Law, which forbids accusing Poland of complicity with the Nazis under penalty of law.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) - The Latest on the dispute between Poland and Israel (all times local): 3:00 p.m. The American Jewish Committee says it hopes years of reconciliation work between Poland and Israel will not be undone by a new dispute over the Holocaust. American Jewish Committee CEO David Harris said Monday that "competing historical narratives" had strained the two countries' relations before. Harris says such disputes usually result from "varying assessments of the magnitude of anti-Semitism in Poland, especially before and during World War II." But he said it was important for public officials in Israel and Poland to choose their words carefully and not to let disagreements "escalate out of control." File -- In this Thursday, Feb. 14, 2019 photo Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, left, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, attend a group photo during a meeting in Warsaw, Poland. Poland's prime minister canceled plans for his country to send a delegation to meeting in Jerusalem on Monday after the acting Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz said that Poles "collaborated with the Nazis" and "sucked anti-Semitism from their mothers' milk". (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) Noting that Poland was a center of Jewish life for centuries, Harris said: "1,000 years of Jewish presence on Polish soil cannot be reduced to a single headline or sound bite." Poland pulled out of a meeting in Israel on Monday after the acting Israeli foreign minister said "Poles collaborated with the Nazis" and quoted a former Israeli prime minister who commented 30 years ago that Poles "sucked anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk." ___ 2:30 p.m. Jewish leaders in Poland say they are offended Israel's acting foreign minister said Poles "sucked anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk." The leaders issued a statement Monday saying that accusing all Poles of anti-Semitism slighted thousands of Poles honored by Israel's Holocaust memorial center, Yad Vashem, for helping Jews during the Holocaust. The comment on Sunday by the Israeli minister, Israel Katz, led to the scuttling of a meeting of central European leaders in Israel this week. Katz quoted a former Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, in making his remark alleging all Poles are prone to anti-Semitism. Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, and Union of Jewish Religious Communities head Monika Krawczyk said Shamir's words "were unjust already when they were first said, in 1989." The two continued that the words Katz repeated "are even more unjust today, 30 years later, when so much has been done on both sides for a mutual understanding of our very difficult, but shared history." ___ 1:15 p.m. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis says a planned summit meeting in Israel with his counterparts from Hungary, Poland and Slovakia has been canceled over a bitter new Holocaust spat between Poland and Israel. Babis, who is leaving for Israel later Monday, told reporters: "No V4 meeting in Israel is going to happen." The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia form an informal group known as the Visegrad group, or V4. The prime ministers regularly invite counterparts from other countries for those summits. Babis says only bilateral meetings are planned in Israel. The prime ministers of Slovakia and Hungary are already in Israel. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon confirmed the cancellation of the summit. "There will be no full V4 meeting (it requires the presence of all four). Three PMs are arriving and will hold meetings with PM," he said in a statement. Babis says a V4 summit might take place in the second half of the year when the Czech Republic holds the V4 presidency. ___ 11:35 a.m. Poland's prime minister says his country is not sending a delegation to a meeting in Jerusalem after the acting Israeli foreign minister said that Poles "collaborated with the Nazis" and "sucked anti-Semitism from their mothers' milk." The developments mark a new low in a bitter conflict over how to remember and characterize Polish actions toward Jews during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called the remarks by acting foreign minister Israel Katz "unacceptable" and "racist." Morawiecki had already announced Sunday that he was pulling out of the meeting in Israel on Monday and Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of four central European nations. That had followed a comment by Netanyahu last week about Polish cooperation with the Nazis. ___ 10:05 a.m. A government official says Poland is considering pulling out altogether from a visit to Israel over a comment made by the acting Israeli foreign minister, the latest in a bitter new Holocaust spat between the two nations. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki already pulled out of the meeting Monday and Tuesday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by leaders from Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz was tapped to go in his place. On Monday, Michal Dworczyk, the head Morawiecki's office, said Czaputowicz's attendance is now in doubt over comments made by Israel Katz, the acting foreign minister.

As the diplomatic falling out with Israel continues, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated in an interview published Friday that while he acknowledged that the Polish population included “individual criminals, as in any nation,” he would not accept a generalization about his country’s involvement in the horrors of the Holocaust. “I have no problem with someone mentioning the fact that during the cruel, evil, dehumanizing war there were individual criminals in my nation — obviously there were, just as in every other nation,” Morawiecki told the Haaretz daily. “But when you use these stereotypes that ‘every Pole suckled anti-Semitism out of their mother’s breast,’ it’s nothing short of racism.” Morawiecki on Sunday canceled his country’s participation in a high-level summit in Israel, as a diplomatic spat continued over comments made by Acting Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Polish collaboration with the Nazis. Netanyahu’s office later said that his comments on Poles’ collaboration with the Nazis were misquoted by Israeli media; he had not blamed the Polish nation for Holocaust crimes, but rather individual Poles. Katz made the more inflammatory remarks in a TV interview on Sunday, after earlier that day being appointed acting foreign minister by Netanyahu. “I am a son of Holocaust survivors and I was even born and grew up in a community made up of Holocaust survivors,” Katz told Channel 13. “The memory of the Holocaust is something we cannot compromise about; it is clear and we won’t forget or forgive.

As [former prime minister] Yitzhak Shamir said, they suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk.” On Monday morning Katz told Israel Radio that “the Poles took part in the extermination of Jews in the Holocaust. Poland became the biggest cemetery of the Jewish people.” Morawiecki told Haaretz that he was astounded that the remarks came from the foreign minister. Advertisement “When I first heard of this it seemed totally unbelievable. Such words could be used by a radical extremist, but not by a foreign minister,” Morawiecki said. “I understand that in the course of an electoral campaign some politicians want to make headlines.” The Polish leader also denied that his country has a problem with hatred toward Jews. “We also have to cope with some anti-Semitism in Poland, but fortunately it is marginal,” Morawiecki said. “Poland is one of the few countries in the EU where the number of anti-Semitic incidents is decreasing, while in many others we are witnessing worrying developments,” he added. On Thursday night, Katz himself remained unapologetic, reiterating that “many Poles” cooperated with the Nazis in World War II. “We reject actions that aim to blame Poland or the Polish nation as a whole for the crimes committed by the Nazis and their collaborators from other nations,” Morawiecki said during the Haaretz interview. Advertisement He went on to say that despite Netanyahu’s clarification about his remarks in Warsaw, the Israeli leader’s words were “not well-received in Poland,” adding that “I can only say that if someone ever misquoted my own words, I would take all effort to clarify it.” Tensions between the two countries have been high ever since Poland passed legislation outlawing the blaming of Nazi crimes against Jews during World War II on Poland. Israeli officials initially railed against the Polish law as a distortion of history. The measure led to a major diplomatic rift when the Polish parliament first green- lighted the legislation in January 2018. But the dispute over the law appeared to be resolved last year when Poland softened the legislation, and Netanyahu and his Polish counterpart agreed on a joint declaration stressing the involvement of the Polish resistance in helping Jews. It was seen as a diplomatic coup for Poland but Netanyahu faced criticism from historians in Israel, including Yad Vashem – The World Holocaust Remembrance Center, for agreeing to a statement that they said distorted history. Morawiecki echoed the narrative absolving Poland of any claims of collaboration with Germany during World War II. “Collaboration with Germany was never an official position of the Polish state,” he said. “The wartime Underground Polish State persecuted all those who were denouncing Jews, sentenced them to death and executed them, even during the war,” he said. “Occupied Poland was one of the very few states without a puppet Nazi government. And the only one in which a person helping Jews faced death penalty at the hands of the Germans. And not only this person — their entire families as well,” Morawiecki continued. Advertisement “It was a brave act to do so. Still, tens of thousands of Poles, perhaps even more, were helping their Jewish brethren… We share common history. Our nations were both victims of Nazi Germany. We should not allow some radicals to rewrite history and destroy the memory of that.” But despite the diplomatic row with Israel, Morawiecki said he believed relations between the country were still strong. “I don’t think there is a deep crisis between Poland and Israel. I understand that in the course of an electoral campaign some politicians want to make headlines. But in general, my government is one of the most pro-Israeli in the EU and in the United Nations. We openly criticized the BDS initiatives (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) aimed against Israel.”

News article:
By Alan Charlish WARSAW (Reuters) - Washington's ambassador to Warsaw on Wednesday called on Israel to apologize to Poland in a row between the two countries over the Holocaust, after Israel's acting foreign minister said "many Poles" had collaborated with the Nazis. The row, initially sparked by media reports suggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Poles of complicity in the Holocaust, deepened on Monday after the comment by his minister Israel Katz, who also labeled Poles anti-Semites. Katz's words led Poland to pull out of a planned summit of central European states in Israel. U.S. ambassador Georgette Mosbacher, asked if Katz should apologize, said the comment "warrants an apology". Mosbacher said she felt two strong allies like Israel and Poland "shouldn't be using that kind of rhetoric. We are too important to each other not to work these things out." Poland was home to one of the largest Jewish communities before World War Two, but more than 3 million Polish Jews died in the Holocaust. Many Poles still refuse to accept research showing thousands participated in the Holocaust in addition to the thousands who risked their lives to help the Jews. Katz is a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party which presently leads the polls ahead of national elections scheduled for April. Netanyahu, whose office said his initial comments had been misinterpreted, has faced criticism in Israel over what some see as a bid to win allies in central Europe at the expense of revising Holocaust history and whitewashing anti-Semitism. He had also hoped the Visegrad summit that was boycotted by Poland would burnish his diplomatic credentials as the election campaign picks up. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the prime minister, who was in Warsaw for a U.S.-sponsored Middle East conference, had been misquoted by The Jerusalem Post, which issued a corrected story. Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely, also a member of Netanyahu's Likud, said on Wednesday there were Poles who cooperated with the Nazis and Poles who saved Jews. "The entire Polish nation cannot be blamed for the Holocaust," he said in an interview with Reshet Beit Radio. "Poland is one of the friendliest countries to Israel... The understandings between us and Poland still stand." (Reporting in WARSAW by Alan Charlish and in JERUSALEM by Maayan Lubell; Writing by Marcin Goclowski; editing by John Stonestreet)

News article:
Jews with any connection to the Holocaust tend to harbor prejudice against Poles. Despite their 1,000-year sojourn in Poland, Jews were often discriminated against. In the Middle Ages, they were prohibited from engaging in agriculture or industry and were restricted to basing their livelihoods on money lending or working as merchants, tax collectors, or innkeepers. They were often perceived as alien extortionists and subjected to pogroms instigated by the ruling classes to divert attention from the prevailing poverty and abysmal social conditions. In the 19th century, the majority of Jews lived in abject poverty, but some Jews emerged as leaders of trade and industry. Nevertheless, prejudice against Jews remained intense and by the 20th century, antisemitism was rampant throughout Europe. The Polish people were considered racially inferior by the Nazis, whose occupation was brutal and who murdered millions of Poles. Unlike the French Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis, the London-based Polish government in exile encouraged resistance. And unlike local non-Jews in the Baltic countries, Poles did not serve as guards in the concentration camps. The extermination of the three million Jews concentrated in Poland was the prime Nazi objective. Jews were herded into ghettoes and then dispatched to death camps to be gassed. Auschwitz, the largest industrial complex for mass murder, was deliberately located in Poland so that Germans would not be directly exposed to the horrors perpetrated. Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... Even while suffering from the brutal Nazi oppression, many Poles continued to harbor prejudice against Jews. Tens of thousands collaborated by acting as informants and others were rewarded by being permitted to take possession of homes and goods left by deported Jews. But there were also heroic Poles who risked a mandatory death sentence for their help in hiding and saving Jews. We must also pay tribute to Poles such as Karol Wojtyła (who would become Pope John Paul II), who protected many individual Jews; and Jan Karski, who tried, without success, to convince Western leaders to act and prevent the mass murders. Unfortunately, those righteous gentiles who sought to save Jews and were executed rarely made headlines, but the media excelled in highlighting the collaborators. A particular case was the exposure of murderous behavior of many Poles in Jedwabme, who instigated a pogrom against Jews in 1941, burning over 300 alive in a barn. Unfortunately, most of the Polish authorities remained in denial over this mass atrocity until Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski bravely called this action not a pogrom, but a genocide. Antisemitism prevailed in Poland, as evidenced by the 1946 Kielce pogrom, in which 42 Holocaust survivors returning to their homes were massacred. But when the communists took over Poland in 1945, they suppressed exposure of the genocide. In 1968, the Polish government conducted an antisemitic purge, and 30,000 Jews, the bulk of whom were Holocaust survivors, were expelled from the country. After the collapse of communism in the early 1990s, the newly independent Polish government sought to create a fresh Polish image based upon nationalism and democracy. It sought to cleanse the record and set aside the ugly past episodes in its history. In this context, the Polish government passed a law last year that effectively criminalized anyone “besmirching” the Polish people by associating them with the Nazi genocidal industry applied against the Jews. This led to confrontational exchanges with Israel; in June 2018, a compromise law was finally passed by the Polish government, which many Jews and Poles still resented. It effectively emphasized the fact that the Holocaust was a Nazi objective in which some Poles collaborated and others endangered their lives by trying to save Jews. The highlight was that Polish people as such were not collaborators. This law was regrettable, but had to be viewed in the perspective of a right-wing nationalist government that condemned antisemitism and sought to create a new image by expunging or at least downplaying the role of Poles who collaborated. The government even invested in an impressive museum in the heart of Warsaw focusing on the Jewish contribution to Poland. In addition, together with Hungary and Slovakia, Poland has emerged as one of the most influential European supporters of Israel, and has acted as a restraint against anti-Israel forces within the EU. But sensitivities and emotions remained fragile, and when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in response to a question in Poland, was misquoted as saying “the Poles” engaged in anti-Jewish activity during the Nazi era, even though in the same response he stated that many Poles saved Jews, there was an uproar. This was laid to rest when he clarified that he had referred to Poles but not “the Poles” or “the Polish people” or Poland. Nevertheless, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki was distressed. The following day, Israel’s newly appointed acting foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, on his first day in office, blundered into the debate, stating that “one cannot sugarcoat this history,” reiterating that “Poles collaborated with the Nazis, definitely” and quoting former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who allegedly said that Poles “suckled antisemitism with their mother’s milk.” The diplomatic upheaval caused by Katz led to the Polish prime minister accusing him of engaging in racist defamation of the Polish people and promptly canceling Poland’s participation in the Visegrád group summit of Central European countries in Jerusalem. The summit would have presented a united front against Iran. There is surely a lesson to be learned from this self-inflicted fiasco. Other states and countries can act as important allies to Israel though their antecedents also included Nazi collaborators. The Polish case stands out because of the extent of the genocide — three million Jews were murdered in one country. But every single country under Nazi occupation included citizens who collaborated with the Nazis or benefited materially from the deportation of their Jewish neighbors. The clear majority simply stood by. A smaller number heroically saved Jews, often at the expense of their own lives. Unfortunately, we can assume that most European societies would not behave differently were they facing similar circumstances today. We must neither forget nor forgive those who betrayed us. But politicians should never generalize. The details should be left for our historians to compile and for our children to learn and understand. We are living in a dynamic environment and remain the only state that faces an existential threat from its neighbors. We benefit from building new alliances. Populist and nationalist parties are emerging as powerful political forces. They are likely to profoundly influence domestic and foreign policies in virtually every European country. The main source of support for these populists derives from those who consider the flood of Muslim migrants to be detrimental to the quality of their lives, due to a massive increase in crime and social chaos that threatens their entire social order. In addition, there is the increased threat of both imported and domestic terrorists, from which no European city is immune. Many of the voters for these nationalist parties support Israel as a bastion of the free world. Until recently, some of these parties and states included fascists and Holocaust revisionists. Any Jewish cooperation with such groups would have been an unthinkable desecration of the memory of Holocaust victims. However, over the past decade, most of them began purging their ranks of antisemites and publicly undertook to eradicate all anti-Jewish elements and thus today the situation is dramatically changed. There are those who say that by accepting the support of and allying with countries like Poland and Hungary, Israel is providing a fig leaf to fascists. This is nonsense. The reason for this relationship is that these governments support Israel and have pledged to combat antisemitism and purge Jew-baiters from their midst. There is less anti-Jewish violence in Poland and Hungary than there is in France. Besides, other than these Central and Eastern European states, Israel has no allies in the EU, which is now notorious for its shameless bias and double standards against the Jewish state. Needless to say, their support of Israel does not preclude some fascists voting for them. Likewise, the fact that racists and fascists may support Donald Trump does not mean that his administration is fascist. Nor have far-left antisemites or communists taken control of the US Democratic Party by voting for it. We do not boycott left-wing governments that appease Muslim extremists, most of whom lead the antisemitic packs. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and other countries have not disavowed and purged their ranks of antisemites, but nobody suggests that we cannot cooperate with them on mutual objectives and confront common enemies. Limited cooperation on specific common interests does not mean that Israel necessarily endorses the other policies of its allies. Many cynically describe this as realpolitik. In truth, it is acting in our self-interest. As long as leaders of the new generation publicly repudiate the crimes of their antecedents and practice what they preach, Israel would be making a major long-term blunder to spurn their support and continue accusing them collectively of being antisemitic. But that is what our foolish foreign minister did regarding Poland, with whom a strategic alliance would be of considerable benefit. Besides, if we continue to attack those seeking friendship and offering support, we shoot ourselves in the foot by deterring them from trying to make amends for the crimes and prejudices of their predecessors.

News article:
WARSAW, Poland (AP) - The Israeli government said Friday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was misquoted by a newspaper on the extremely sensitive issue of Polish behavior during the Holocaust, seeking to defuse a diplomatic crisis. However, the Polish government said it considered that response insufficient and expects a clearer explanation. Netanyahu said a day earlier during a visit to Warsaw that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting that some Poles during the German occupation of Poland took part in killing Jews. However, the Jerusalem Post quoted him as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation. The matter threatened to spark another major spat between the two countries, which clashed last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust. Poland has even threatened to withdraw from a meeting of Central European leaders that is to take place next week in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacts during a bilateral meeting with United States Vice President Mike Pence in Warsaw, Poland, Thursday, Feb. 14, 2019. The Polish capital is host for a two-day international conference on the Middle East, co-organized by Poland and the United States. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) Netanyahu was clearly eager to avoid another potential crisis. "The Prime Minister's comments concerning Poland were misquoted by the Jerusalem Post, which quickly issued a correction clarifying that an error had been made in the editing of the article," Netanyahu's office said in a statement. The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador for an explanation. But a deputy foreign minister, Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek, said the explanations given by Israel so far are "unclear" and that Warsaw is still awaiting a clarification that would leave it without any doubts. Poland has expressed an "expectation that the Israeli side will say in a clear way what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meant when he said the words that were quoted by the Israeli media," Szynkowski vel Sek said. He added, though, that this did not impact on the leaders' upcoming meeting slated to start Monday in Jerusalem, where Netanyahu hopes to strengthen Israel's political and economic ties with central Europe, a region that is a strong supporter of Israel. Later, Netanyahu's office weighed in with another statement, saying: "Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland. This was misquoted and misrepresented in press reports and was subsequently corrected by the journalist who issued the initial misstatement." The Holocaust is still an extremely sensitive subject in Poland, even nearly 80 years after World War II. Nazi Germany subjected the country to a brutal occupation, killing nearly 6 million citizens, about 3 million of them Jewish, but almost as many of them Christian Poles. Poland had an underground resistance movement that fought the Germans and more than 6,800 Poles have been recognized by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust memorial, for helping Jews at risk to their own lives, more than from any other country. However, there was anti-Semitism in Poland before the war and some Poles welcomed the removal of the large Jewish population from their society, while some blackmailed Jews or participated in the killings. Emotional debates rage to this day over how to characterize the Polish responses to the murder of Jews on their soil.

News article:
WARSAW, Poland (AP) - The Israeli government said Friday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was misquoted by a newspaper on the extremely sensitive issue of Polish behavior during the Holocaust, seeking to defuse a diplomatic crisis. However, the Polish government said it considered that response insufficient and expects a clearer explanation. Netanyahu said a day earlier during a visit to Warsaw that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting that some Poles during the German occupation of Poland took part in killing Jews. However, the Jerusalem Post quoted him as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation. The matter threatened to spark another major spat between the two countries, which clashed last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust. Poland has even threatened to withdraw from a meeting of Central European leaders that is to take place next week in Israel.

(AP Photo/Michael Sohn) Netanyahu was clearly eager to avoid another potential crisis. "The Prime Minister's comments concerning Poland were misquoted by the Jerusalem Post, which quickly issued a correction clarifying that an error had been made in the editing of the article," Netanyahu's office said in a statement. The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador for an explanation. But a deputy foreign minister, Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek, said the explanations given by Israel so far are "unclear" and that Warsaw is still awaiting a clarification that would leave it without any doubts. Poland has expressed an "expectation that the Israeli side will say in a clear way what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meant when he said the words that were quoted by the Israeli media," Szynkowski vel Sek said. He added, though, that this did not impact on the leaders' upcoming meeting slated to start Monday in Jerusalem, where Netanyahu hopes to strengthen Israel's political and economic ties with central Europe, a region that is a strong supporter of Israel. Later, Netanyahu's office weighed in with another statement, saying: "Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland. This was misquoted and misrepresented in press reports and was subsequently corrected by the journalist who issued the initial misstatement." The Holocaust is still an extremely sensitive subject in Poland, even nearly 80 years after World War II. Nazi Germany subjected the country to a brutal occupation, killing nearly 6 million citizens, about 3 million of them Jewish, but almost as many of them Christian Poles. Poland had an underground resistance movement that fought the Germans and more than 6,800 Poles have been recognized by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust memorial, for helping Jews at risk to their own lives, more than from any other country. However, there was anti-Semitism in Poland before the war and some Poles welcomed the removal of the large Jewish population from their society, while some blackmailed Jews or participated in the killings. Emotional debates rage to this day over how to characterize the Polish responses to the murder of Jews on their soil.

News article:
By Joanna Plucinska WARSAW, March 14 (Reuters) - A news kiosk inside Poland's parliament was found to be selling a newspaper with an article instructing readers on "How to recognise a Jew", drawing accusations that lawmakers were happy to tolerate anti-Semitism. The article in "Tylko Polska" ("Only Poland"), a low-circulation, nationally distributed right-wing weekly, describes how to recognise Jews based on their last names, personality traits and facial features. Jewish women, it says, "lack the delicacy, modesty and sense of shame that are innate to Polish women." It goes on: "Because the whole world belongs to them ... they are supposed to exist in every country, take power over nations and lead to the creation of one worldwide Jewish state." Pictures of the paper on sale at a newspaper kiosk in parliament, in a country where more than 3 million of a population of 3.2 million Jews were murdered by in the Holocaust, were widely shared on social media. Parliament said it would request the publication be withdrawn from sale, but a Jewish groups demanded stronger action. "The lack of clear condemnation of the incident on the part of key Polish politicians, such as the speaker of the Sejm (parliament), is disturbing," said Agnieszka Markiewicz, director of the American Jewish Committee for Central Europe. Some politicians did react. "It's an absolute scandal that, in the Polish parliament, such pitiful papers that look as if they are taken from Nazi publications, are sold," said Michal Kaminski, a member of parliament for the leftwing opposition Polish Peasants Party. Krzysztof Brejza, a member for the centre-right opposition Civic Platform, said the publication was a symptom of intolerance promoted by the ruling conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) led by former prime minister Jarosław Kaczyński. "The promotion of hatred in society serves Jarosław Kaczyński. It is disgusting that in the temple of democracy, in the Polish parliament, such materials are displayed," Brejza said. A spokesperson for PiS was not immediately available to comment. The Polish government has bristled at suggestions of anti-Semitism in the past. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki cancelled a trip to Jerusalem last month after Israel's foreign minister said many Poles "suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk" and had collaborated with Nazis in the Holocaust. Israel also opposed a law passed last year which made it a criminal offence to use phrases such as "Polish death camps" to refer to the Nazi-run concentration camps on Polish soil, including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor, where millions of Jews were killed.

Israel on Wednesday urged the Polish government to deny entry to British Holocaust denier David Irving, who is planning to lead a tour of Nazi death camps in the country later this year. Irving’s website is taking deposits for the tour of Nazi historical sites scheduled for September, the UK Jewish News reported Monday. Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett said he had subsequently sent a letter to Poland’s ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski. “Given Irving’s record of abhorrent statements and outright lies about the history of the Holocaust, it is quite clear that he intends to use this opportunity to spread further falsehoods and vitriolic narrative,” he wrote. “In so doing, he will doubtless cause deep offense to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and to all the Jewish people, as well as stoke the already raging fire of hatred and anti-Semitism we are witnessing around the world today. “I therefore respectfully request that the Government of Poland make it quite clear that Irving and his party will not be granted access to your country, and certainly not to the camps and other sites of memorial to the millions of my people who were murdered in that dark period of history,” Bennett added.

News article:
Warsaw seeks to maintain dialogue with Israel but only with politicians and organizations able of talking “constructively,” a top Polish diplomat has said, referring to fallout from remarks by the Israeli interim foreign minister. “There’s no conflict out there, as it means a quarrel between two sides. We have a statement by a single politician, which compromises himself, first of all, yet, undoubtedly, complicates our relationship,” Poland’s Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski said at a press conference on Wednesday. Warsaw will only engage in dialogue with those Jewish organizations and politicians who are supportive towards Poland, while ignoring those, who make “insulting remarks,” he added. Late in February, Israeli interim Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz had quoted former Israeli PM Yitzhak Shamir and said that “Every Pole suckled anti-Semitism with his mother's milk,” triggering a major row between the two countries. Also on rt.com Warsaw won’t bow to ‘lies & racist insults,’ Polish PM says amid simmering row with Israel Diplomatic relations between Warsaw and Tel Aviv have been quite strained recently, damaged by a controversial law adopted last year in Poland. The legislation bans phrases like “Polish SS,” “Polish death camps” and so on, prohibiting any implication that the Polish state and the Poles had been fully complicit in Nazi mass murders there during WWII. The legislation had initially provided for up to three years behind bars for persons convicted of this behavior, yet it was watered down later, and now pointing to the role played by the Poles in the Holocaust is merely a civil offence, punishable by a fine. While the diplomatic spat appeared to be over, it was reignited this February by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who yet again accused the Poles of “collaborating with Nazis” and condemned the “whitewashing” of history. Netanyahu's remark was swiftly echoed by Katz, who ultimately managed to make it worse. Katz’s comment caused an uproar in Poland, with Foreign Minister Marek Magierowski calling it “shameful and racist” and demanding an apology. As Tel Aviv did not apologize, Poland dropped out of the Visegrad 4 summit, hosted by Israel. Warsaw's move then ultimately led to the cancelation of the whole event. To try and fix the attempts to “distort history” and accuse the Poles of contributing to the Nazi crimes of the WWII era, the Foreign Ministry has issued a booklet, dubbed “How it was in reality,” Szynkowski revealed. The booklet, printed in English, German and Polish, is based on interviews with the survivors of Nazi death camps. “The booklets have been sent to countries where the problem [of history distortion] emerges the most often: to the US, the UK, Germany and Canada,” the diplomat said.

Poland – Warsaw is likely to refuse Holocaust denier David Irving entry to Poland later this year, the foreign minister said on Friday, citing local legislation that bans denying the genocide. Israel had urged Poland to deny Irving entry after reports that he planned to lead a tour of Nazi concentration camps in the country. The author of several books, Irving has denied that the Nazis murdered six million Jews during World War Two. Irving confirmed to Reuters by email that he had planned to visit Poland later this year, as he has in the past. “Negation of the Holocaust is not allowed by Polish law, therefore he will not be welcome here in Poland if he wants to come and present his opinions,” Jacek Czaputowicz told reporters at a press conference. Irving sued an American historian, Deborah Lipstadt, for libel in 1996 after she described him as a Holocaust denier. But Lipstadt won, in a case that became the film “Denial”, released in 2016. Poland’s right-wing government introduced legislation last year that would have made the use of phrases such as “Polish death camps” punishable by up to three years in prison. After pressure from the United States and an outcry in Israel, Poland watered down the legislation, scrapping the prison sentences. But the row with Israel revived this year after Israel’s foreign minister said many Poles “suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk” and had collaborated with Nazis in the Holocaust.

The booklet, printed in English, German and Polish, is based on interviews with the survivors of Nazi death camps."The booklets have been sent to countries where the problem [of history distortion] emerges the most often: to the US, the UK, Germany and Canada," the diplomat said.

EU Stance on Caracas Too Biased for Comprehensive Talks - Venezuelan Envoy Sputnik News 23:18 31.01.2019(updated 00:05 01.02.2019) BRUSSELS (Sputnik) - Positions expressed by EU officials regarding the events in Venezuela were not neutral enough to allow the European Union to participate as a full-fledged mediator in political dialogue, the country's ambassador to Brussels, Claudia Salerno Caldera, told Sputnik on Thursday. "After the attempted coup in Venezuela, and taking into account the fact that the EU countries are now divided between those who support it and those who do not recognize this attempt, still considering Maduro as the only president, and also taking into account some radical positions, which were voiced by a number of these countries, I do not think that they are now neutral enough to be involved [in the mediation process]", the ambassador said. From the very beginning, EU officials clearly stated that they do not want to act as a mediator, but wanted to help dialogue, she added. "It has been their position since last year," Caldera said, recalling EU initiative to create a contact group. Fortunately, there are European countries supporting peace efforts, she said. "There are those who follow Trump's position, and there are those countries that are taking the position of peace. Currently, the EU as a whole does not have a unified position on Venezuela. They are still conducting consultations, in particular, they are discussing this at the ministerial meeting today", the ambassador said. Caldera noted that she had conducted a number of meetings to discuss the Venezuelan crisis in Brussels. "We worked intensively with various EU countries, but also with colleagues in the region who expressed their interest in promoting various decisions regarding our country", she said, answering whether Venezuelan diplomats had succeeded in conveying to EU officials the position on the unacceptability of an ultimatum previously put forward by a number of countries. According to the ambassador, the whole world is now clearly divided between those joining the US position favoring military intervention and support of the current coup and those who oppose this approach and call for creating the conditions for resuming dialogue. "Diplomacy and dialogue are the only ways to resolve the current situation in Venezuela", she said. She expressed hope that, given the recent events, the EU countries would change their positions and move toward supporting peace. Earlier in the day, the European Parliament voted 439-104 for a non-binding resolution that recognized the self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido and urged the EU external action service to follow suit. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told Sputnik Tuesday that he was ready to sit at the negotiating table with the opposition with the participation of international mediators. On Wednesday, an EU source told Sputnik that Brussels was ready to support the political process in Venezuela by creating an international contact group, and is now consulting with partners on this issue. At the same time, the European Commissioner for Crisis Response Christos Stylianides told the European Parliament that such a contact group was not intended to conduct a direct dialogue between the conflicting parties in Venezuela. Venezuela is currently going through a severe political crisis, with Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled Venezuelan National Assembly, having proclaimed himself the country's interim president on 23 January. The United States and its several allies have instantly recognized Guaido. Some of the EU countries, including the UK, Germany, France, and Spain declared on Saturday their intention to recognise Juan Guaido as the country's interim president if Caracas does not announce snap presidential elections within eight days. President Maduro himself called Venezuela "the victim of a US conspiracy", referring to US Vice President Mike Pence promising Guaido "full American support" the day before he declared himself Venezuela's new head of state. Maduro also stressed that Venezuela had held legitimate elections and urged European countries to withdraw their demand. Constitutionally elected Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro accused Washington of orchestrating a coup in the country. Russia, China, Mexico, Uruguay, Iran and Turkey among other countries, have voiced support for Maduro as the only legitimate president of Venezuela. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Members of the European Union will officially recognize Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president next week. Earlier this week, the bloc's foreign ministers agreed to back Guaido's decision to declare himself president but will do so only until a new election is held. According to Reuters, the ministers are mindful the decision to back Venezuela's interim president could set a dangerous political precedent and will proceed cautiously. Each of the 28 members state will outline its position over the new head of Venezuela's National Assembly, as opposed to the EU making a joint declaration. Last month, Guaido declared himself the country's "acting president", a move which was recognized by the U.S, but dismissed by Nicolás Maduro, who has held office since 2013. Maduro was sworn in for a second term in January, a result which was disputed by several governments, including the U.S. Along with Washington, Canada, Australia, Georgia, Haiti, Israel, Kosovo and Morocco have all formally recognized Guaido. Britain, Germany, France and Spain will formally back Guaido on Monday. Smaller EU members, however, will adopt a more cautious approach, specifically avoiding to use words such as "recognition" in their statements. "A lot of countries will want to stress the interim nature of this de-facto recognition," an EU diplomat was quoted as saying by Reuters. The EU's position is further complicated by the fact the European Parliament on Thursday recognized the 35-year-old Guaido as the head of the Venezuelan congress. According to the report, the 28-country bloc based its decision on the Venezuelan constitution, which states the head of congress can take over if the president is absent, incapacitated or usurps power. Guaido's allies have long argued that Maduro stole the second mandate in January. Last Saturday, the EU set a eight-day deadline for a new election, which Maduro dismissed as an unacceptable ultimatum. Despite Guaido's attempt to oust him, Maduro retains the support of a host of allies in the region, including Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador and Nicaragua, as well as Dominica, Suriname, Saint Kitts, Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. Belarus, China, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Greece, Iran, Laos, North Korea and the Palestinian government have also declared their support for him, as have Russia, South Africa, Syria and Turkey. Uruguay and Mexico, meanwhile, continue to recognize Maduro but plan to hold a meeting to resolve the situation. Similarly, the EU has offered to lead an international delegation containing emissaries from 10 to 12 countries in a bid to solve the political impasse in Venezuela. The International Contact Group on Venezuela will meet in Montevideo, Uruguay next week. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the group will include the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, as well as Bolivia and Ecuador.

News article:
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s official IRNA news agency said Saturday that President Hassan Rouhani has expressed his support for embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. According to IRNA, Rouhani met with the Venezuelan envoy to Tehran, Carlos Alcala Cordones, and voiced his support for Maduro’s government. “We believe the people of Venezuela though unity and standing by the government will defuse the pressures by Washington,” Rouhani is quoted as saying. Rouhani describes what he termed as US intervention in Venezuela’s internal affairs as “very ugly.” “Americans basically oppose popular revolution and independent nations,” Rouhani said, according to the report. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Iran has been a key supporter of Venezuela’s government since 1999 when the late populist President Hugo Chavez came to power in Caracas. Both countries are members of OPEC and have had numerous economic agreements. Despite support from governments including Iran, Russia, China, Turkey, Belarus, Bolivia, as well as the Palestinian Authority, momentum is growing for Venezuela’s opposition movement led by lawmaker Juan Guaido. Advertisement Guaido declared himself interim president last week before tens of thousands of cheering supporters and vowed to end Maduro’s “dictatorship.” His claim to the presidency is backed by the United States and some two dozen other nations, including Israel, Canada, the EU, Australia and most of Latin America. US President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, tweeted Thursday that Maduro and his top advisers should retire to “a nice beach somewhere far away from Venezuela.” Bolton’s talk turned tougher Friday in an interview with conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt in which he warned that it could be a beach area more like Guantanamo. Maduro remains dug in, blaming the White House for openly backing what he calls a coup to remove him from power and exploit his country’s vast oil wealth. He retains support from powerful allies, but is growing increasingly isolated as more nations back Guaido. Maduro on Friday continued a show of might as commander-in-chief that has seen him crisscross Venezuela to oversee military exercises as he vows to defend his socialist government no matter the cost. The military’s top leadership is backing Maduro, though analysts warn that rank-and-file troops frustrated by their country’s economic and humanitarian crisis may not share that unwavering loyalty. The opposition’s street protests planned for Saturday are the second such mass action this week. Guaido led a peaceful demonstration Wednesday with residents stepping out of their homes and workplaces for two hours. Last week, street protests turned violent in days of unrest that killed nearly three dozen people in clashes with government security forces. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

© Reuters/Luisa Gonzalez As trucks with US "humanitarian aid" arrived at the Colombia-Venezuela border, the State Department insisted that time for talks with the government in Caracas is long past, and the only acceptable outcome is regime change.US President Donald Trump recognized opposition politician Juan Guaido as "legitimate president" of Venezuela last month. The State Department appointed neoconservative interventionist Elliott Abrams - who has a long and checkered past of meddling in Latin America - as its special envoy for freedom and democracy in Venezuela.

Venezuelan Opposition to Get Money From US Fund Filled With Oil Money - Report Sputnik News 13:41 07.02.2019 Washington earlier imposed sanctions against Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA and passed control over some of its foreign funds held by US-insured banks to Juan Guaido, a leader of the opposition, who proclaimed himself interim president of Venezuela. The Venezuelan opposition will be getting money from a US-based fund that will accrue some of the country's oil income, Reuters reported, citing opposition lawmaker Carlos Paparoni. The fund will be reportedly filled with the profits from PDVSA's American subsidiary, Citgo starting from last month. Paparoni has refused to give details about the future fund, but added that its creation will likely be announced next week by the opposition's representative in the US. Citgo is one of the largest US-based refineries and Venezuela's biggest foreign asset, which has found itself in the middle of a conflict between Caracas and Washington, as it is formally controlled by Venezuela's PDVSA, but operates on US soil. The move to create the fund, which will bankroll the Venezuelan opposition, comes in the wake of US calls for Nicolas Maduro to step down and recognition of self-proclaimed interim President of Venezuela – Juan Guaido. In a bid to cut Maduro's earnings, Washington has sanctioned major state-owned oil-producer PDVSA and frozen its foreign assets. The US passed control over some of these assets to Guaido and his team. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused Washington of orchestrating a coup and severed diplomatic ties with the country. He is currently supported as the only legitimate president by Russia, China, Iran, Turkey and several other nations. The US, Canada, Israel, and over a dozen South American countries have recognised Guaido as the interim president. Most EU states have supported him as well, with the notable exception being Italy. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

Military invasion among US options against Venezuela government: Russia Iran Press TV Fri Feb 8, 2019 02:51AM Russia has warned that the United States is considering a range of options against the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, including a direct military invasion of the Latin American country, which has been engulfed in political unrest over the past weeks. "There are still signs coming from Washington about the possibility of using force in order to overthrow the legal authorities, including through direct military invasion," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a weekly briefing in Moscow on Thursday. "This is actually being spoken about openly in the White House." Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have thronged the streets of Venezuela, holding rallies in support and against Maduro, who began his second six-year term in office last month. The clashes began after Juan Guaido, the opposition leader in the country's National Assembly, proclaimed himself as "interim president" and urged Maduro to resign. The US rushed to support Guaido, announcing sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry. Other US officials have also doubled down on the possibility of military action, reiterating President Donald Trump's stance that "all options are on the table." In an interview with CBS on Sunday, Trump said military action against Maduro remained "an option." Zakharova said Thursday that Washington had already made up its mind about a military action and "everything else is nothing more than a covering operation." The Russian diplomat said such threats violated the Charter of the United Nations. She criticized American officials for threatening Caracas with more economic sanctions while calling on the military to defect the legal government of Maduro. "Washington has turned to direct threats of sanctions to the Venezuelan military, which remains loyal to the legitimate government. That is just a different, new reading of the 'carrot and stick' approach. On the one hand, they threaten a potential punishment. On the other hand, they promise a potential reward", Zakharova noted. "I would like to recall that this kind of statement from the mouth of American officials is a direct violation of Article 2 Par. 4 of the UN Charter, ordering all UN members to refrain from the threat or use of force in international relations", she said at the briefing. On Wednesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said Washington was ready to exempt Venezuelan military commanders from sanctions if they joined Guaido. Earlier, he had called on Venezuela's military forces and other government officials to use Guaido's "amnesty" and pledge allegiance to him. Guaido has been in talks with military officials in Venezuela to convince them to defect. He has published an open letter, calling on the military to withdraw their support from Maduro. Venezuelan authorities said Wednesday they had seized a large shipment of US-made weapons aboard a cargo plane that had taken off from Miami, Florida. EU, LatAm countries call for peaceful resolution of crisis On Thursday, ministers from over a dozen European and Latin American countries called for "free, transparent and credible presidential elections" in Venezuela to resolve the ongoing crisis. The International Contact Group (GCI) said all sides needed to find a "peaceful, democratic" way out of the situation "without the use of force." Besides the US, other major Western powers such as the UK, France, Spain and Germany have recognized Guaido as president. Russia, China, Iran and Turkey are some of the countries that have thrown their support behind Maduro. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States scoffed on Friday at Venezuela’s accusation that it was poisoning humanitarian aid, and urged allies to stop the “decrepit, dictatorial regime” of President Nicolas Maduro from chairing U.N. arms talks. Sacks containing humanitarian aid are pictured at a warehouse near the Tienditas cross-border bridge between Colombia and Venezuela in Cucuta, Colombia February 14, 2019. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido U.S. envoy Robert Wood was speaking to the Conference on Disarmament hosted by the United Nations in Geneva that Maduro’s now widely-rejected government is due to chair from May 27. “I’m taking the floor to put on the record my government’s strong opposition to a representative of the former Maduro regime occupying the seat reserved for Venezuela,” he said. Washington is among some 50 governments, including major Latin American and European nations, who have disavowed Maduro and recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido. Last month, Guaido invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency on promises to end a humanitarian crisis. Wood said a Venezuelan chairmanship would further undercut the forum’s credibility after the “disastrous” Syrian presidency in 2018 which the United States boycotted. “In order to preserve the integrity, dignity and respect for this chamber, Maduro representatives must vacate the chair reserved for the government of Venezuela,” he said. “Let us not give one iota of legitimacy to this decrepit, dictatorial regime.” A Venezuelan representative said Wood was showing how little the United States cared about disarmament. “To come here and talk about how to overthrow the government of my country - this is really not a priority for discussion,” the diplomat said. Maduro, who is backed by China, Russia and Venezuela’s top military brass, accuses Washington of seeking a coup to take over the OPEC nation’s oil wealth. On Tuesday, his Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the United States was trying to send contaminated and carcinogenic aid into Venezuela, where the economy is in collapse and millions are facing hunger and shortages. “Various scientific studies have shown that this so-called food from the United States aims to poison our population with chemicals. We could say that this humanitarian aid is a biological weapon,” she told a news conference. Wood said Maduro’s government would go to any length to lie and deny reality. “It even made one of the most outrageous charges the international community has heard in decades: that the United States is sending in biological weapons as part of humanitarian assistance we have provided. Biological weapons? Really?” Diplomats from Syria, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Russia criticized the U.S. stance, while Australia’s representative said it was good to respectfully air views. Syria’s representative said the forum had no business shedding “crocodile tears” over humanitarian suffering and rights, while the United States was violating international law by sending troops to its country.

US preparing for military action in Venezuela: Cuba Iran Press TV Fri Feb 15, 2019 01:37AM The United States is moving its special forces closer to Venezuela as part of a covert plan to stage military intervention in the South American country, which has been engulfed by unrest over the past weeks. Cuba said in a "Declaration of the Revolutionary Government" on Thursday that recent events in Venezuela, where US-backed opposition Juan Guaido has been challenging the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro, amounted to an attempted coup that had so far failed. US President Donald Trump's administration has refused to rule out direct military action against Maduro to force him step down and hand over power to Guaido, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly. Havana said that Washington has been expanding the presence of its forces in neighboring countries. "Between February 6 and 10 military transport aircraft have flown to the Rafael Miranda Airport of Puerto Rico, the San Isidro Air Base, in the Dominican Republic and to other strategically located Caribbean islands, probably without knowledge of the governments of those nations," the declaration said. "These flights originated in American military installations from which units of Special Operations and Marine Corps operate, which are used for covert actions," it added. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have thronged the streets of Venezuela over the past weeks, holding rallies in support and against Maduro, who began his second six-year term in office last month. The clashes began after Guaido proclaimed himself "interim president" and urged Maduro to resign. The US rushed to support Guaido, announcing sanctions on the country's oil industry. According to the Havana declaration, the drastic sanctions imposed by the US were causing damage "1,000 times greater" than the aid Washington was reportedly trying to force on the country. US special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams dismissed the Cuban announcement as "a new lie." The Dominican Republic's foreign minister, Miguel Vargas, also reiterated support for a peaceful solution and said no US military transport planes had landed in his country. Besides the US, other major Western powers such as the UK, France, Spain and Germany have recognized Guaido as president. Russia, China, Iran and Turkey are some of the countries that have thrown their support behind Maduro. In a recent interview with CBS, Trump said military action against Maduro remained "an option." Other US officials have also doubled down on the possibility of military action, with National Security Adviser John Bolton going as far as warning the Venezuelan military to join Guaido and take his "amnesty" before they lose the chance. However, Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, made it clear on Wednesday that the US Congress won't allow Trump tp launch a military intervention in Venezuela. Under US law, Congress must approve foreign military action and the president doesn't have the power to act on his own. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

Maduro warns US against aggression, says Venezuela possesses advanced weapons Iran Press TV Thu Feb 21, 2019 02:37PM President Nicolas Maduro warns the US against carrying out the threat of military action in Venezuela, saying the country's armed forces are in possession of advanced weaponry supplied by Russia and China, and stand fully ready to face any act of aggression with the help of millions of paramilitaries. In an interview with Iran's Spanish-language Hispan TV, Maduro said the Caracas government takes Washington's military threats seriously and is already making preparations "to protect our borders and territorial integrity." "We recently held five days of maneuvers. Venezuela is also in possession of advanced military equipment, which it has received via China and Russia. We have upgraded our entire military and expanded our popular paramilitary forces, whose numbers will reach two million by April," the president added. Political tensions have been running high in the South American country since late January, when Western-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido abruptly declared himself "interim president" of Venezuela in an attempt to dispute last year's re-election of Maduro. The US and a number of its Latin American allies rushed to recognize Guaido. Several European countries also followed suit after Caracas dismissed an ultimatum they had set for a new presidential vote. In the other camp, Russia, China, Iran, Turkey and Cuba, among others, have voiced support for Maduro in the face of what Caracas views as a US-directed coup bid. The United Nations has also said it will only cooperate with the elected government. After recognizing Guaido, Trump threatened that military intervention in Venezuela was an "option" to support Guaido. In what Maduro condemned as an "almost Nazi-style" speech in Miami on February 19, Trump appealed directly to the Venezuelan military to abandon their support for Maduro, threatening that those who continued to back the Caracas government were risking their own future and lives. In the interview, Maduro rejected the possibility of the military turning against the Venezuelan government and said "our armed forces act in unison when it comes to morality, doctrine and strategy. They abide by the Constitution." Elsewhere in the interview, the Venezuelan head of state slammed Washington for slapping sanctions on the country's national petroleum company, PDVSA, in a bid to speed up the exit of the elected government, which relies heavily on crude exports for its revenues.The bans have been designed to funnel income from the country's largest revenue generator into the hands of Guaido. Maduro said the oil sanctions "will be to the detriment of the United States itself," because the Americans will have to buy lower-quality oil at a higher price from other parts of the world. The sanctions, he added, "would cause certain problems for us, but we will overcome these conditions. Be sure that Venezuela will sell its oil in the international markets and we will receive the income in time." "I personally tell you that I am working on reviving and forming a new PDVSA, about which I will issue an important statement in the coming days," Maduro said. Maduro also blasted Trump for adopting an "extremist, unwise and improper" position against Venezuela. America's president wants to bring Venezuela to its knees, said Maduro, adding that his main concern is not "democracy" or "humanitarian crisis," but he has an eye on the country's wealth and rich energy resources. Maduro outlined the measures taken by his administration to alleviate the nation's economic problems, saying that the top priority is to decrease the unemployment rate. "Venezuela will move on from all these acts of aggression. We will teach them a big lesson and promote our political, economic and social life," Maduro said, adding, "The battle is to protect not only Venezuela, but also independence, dignity, humanity and international law." The Venezuelan president went on to say, "The era for coups d'état and invasion…must come to an end. The 19th and 20th centuries are over. The current century is no time for neo-imperialism and slavery." Warning to Europe He also denounced the European Union's bias in favor of the Venezuelan opposition, saying the 28-nation bloc is making a "fundamental mistake" in dealing with the Latin American state. Europe only "listens to the rightist (opposition) and believes all their lies," Maduro added, advising the European countries to "lend an ear to the truth." The Union blindly follows the US in its aggressive approach towards Venezuela, said the president, warning that the Europeans will have blood on their hands if Venezuela comes under attack "as it happened in Iraq, Libya and Syria."

Maduro warns US against aggression, says Venezuela possesses advanced weapons Iran Press TV Thu Feb 21, 2019 02:37PM President Nicolas Maduro warns the US against carrying out the threat of military action in Venezuela, saying the country's armed forces are in possession of advanced weaponry supplied by Russia and China, and stand fully ready to face any act of aggression with the help of millions of paramilitaries. In an interview with Iran's Spanish-language Hispan TV, Maduro said the Caracas government takes Washington's military threats seriously and is already making preparations "to protect our borders and territorial integrity." "We recently held five days of maneuvers. Venezuela is also in possession of advanced military equipment, which it has received via China and Russia. We have upgraded our entire military and expanded our popular paramilitary forces, whose numbers will reach two million by April," the president added. Political tensions have been running high in the South American country since late January, when Western-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido abruptly declared himself "interim president" of Venezuela in an attempt to dispute last year's re-election of Maduro. The US and a number of its Latin American allies rushed to recognize Guaido. Several European countries also followed suit after Caracas dismissed an ultimatum they had set for a new presidential vote. In the other camp, Russia, China, Iran, Turkey and Cuba, among others, have voiced support for Maduro in the face of what Caracas views as a US-directed coup bid. The United Nations has also said it will only cooperate with the elected government. After recognizing Guaido, Trump threatened that military intervention in Venezuela was an "option" to support Guaido. In what Maduro condemned as an "almost Nazi-style" speech in Miami on February 19, Trump appealed directly to the Venezuelan military to abandon their support for Maduro, threatening that those who continued to back the Caracas government were risking their own future and lives. In the interview, Maduro rejected the possibility of the military turning against the Venezuelan government and said "our armed forces act in unison when it comes to morality, doctrine and strategy. They abide by the Constitution." Elsewhere in the interview, the Venezuelan head of state slammed Washington for slapping sanctions on the country's national petroleum company, PDVSA, in a bid to speed up the exit of the elected government, which relies heavily on crude exports for its revenues.The bans have been designed to funnel income from the country's largest revenue generator into the hands of Guaido. Maduro said the oil sanctions "will be to the detriment of the United States itself," because the Americans will have to buy lower-quality oil at a higher price from other parts of the world. The sanctions, he added, "would cause certain problems for us, but we will overcome these conditions. Be sure that Venezuela will sell its oil in the international markets and we will receive the income in time." "I personally tell you that I am working on reviving and forming a new PDVSA, about which I will issue an important statement in the coming days," Maduro said. Maduro also blasted Trump for adopting an "extremist, unwise and improper" position against Venezuela. America's president wants to bring Venezuela to its knees, said Maduro, adding that his main concern is not "democracy" or "humanitarian crisis," but he has an eye on the country's wealth and rich energy resources. Maduro outlined the measures taken by his administration to alleviate the nation's economic problems, saying that the top priority is to decrease the unemployment rate. "Venezuela will move on from all these acts of aggression. We will teach them a big lesson and promote our political, economic and social life," Maduro said, adding, "The battle is to protect not only Venezuela, but also independence, dignity, humanity and international law." The Venezuelan president went on to say, "The era for coups d'état and invasion…must come to an end. The 19th and 20th centuries are over. The current century is no time for neo-imperialism and slavery." Warning to Europe He also denounced the European Union's bias in favor of the Venezuelan opposition, saying the 28-nation bloc is making a "fundamental mistake" in dealing with the Latin American state. Europe only "listens to the rightist (opposition) and believes all their lies," Maduro added, advising the European countries to "lend an ear to the truth."

News article:
UNITED NATIONS: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on all parties in Venezuela to avoid resorting to violence Friday after soldiers killed at least two people trying to prevent troops from blocking aid on the Brazilian border. “Any loss of life is regrettable,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. “Looking ahead for tomorrow, the secretary-general strongly appeals for violence to be avoided.” Dujarric said the message has been shared with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and would also be handed to his Venezuelan counterpart Jorge Arreaza. Humanitarian aid has become a key focus of the power struggle between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who enjoys Russian support, and US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has been recognized as interim leader by more than 50 countries. The US and Venezuelan top diplomats requested the meetings with Guterres. So far, the UN chief has resisted pressure to take a side, instead using his position to seek to negotiate a solution to the crisis, and opposing any politicization of humanitarian aid. “The secretary-general is doing what he can,” Dujarric said, hinting that Guterres has little room to maneuver. “Aid should be used in a way which is impartial... and without military objective,” Dujarric added, denouncing Friday’s violent flare-up. Guterres has met with Arreaza twice so far since early February. Arreaza is due to preside over an afternoon meeting with 46 countries including China, Cuba, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia and Syria. The countries are part of a group created last week at the UN to defend the principles of the UN Charter.

As the Venezuelan government burns aid convoys, represses its people and forces them to eat out of garbage trucks, critics say the United Nations is struggling to find its voice as it issues weak statements of condemnations, while a pro-Maduro coalition digs in at U.N. headquarters "[Secretary General Antonio Guterres] is playing right into #Maduro plans,” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted this month. “Fake @UN 'negotiations' to divide opposition & buy time for protests to die down. Maduro will also want UN “experts” to blame #Venezuela crisis on sanctions.” HUNDREDS OF VENEZUELA'S MILITARY DEFECT IN FOUR DAYS AS COUNTRY SPIRALS INTO FURTHER CHAOS “When it comes to democracy & human rights UN increasingly worthless,” he said. Disputed President Nicolas Maduro’s forces fired tear gas and buckshot on activists over the weekend as they tried to deliver humanitarian aid across the border. The U.S. and around 50 other countries have recognized National Assembly leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader after disputed elections, and called for Maduro to step down. Univision anchor Jorge Ramos was briefly arrested and detained on Monday after he showed the president video footage of three children on the streets of Venezuela rummaging through the back of a garbage truck looking for food scraps -- the latest sign of the economic catastrophe his regime has wrought on his people. Rubio’s remarks represent part of a broader concern by conservatives that left-wing governments and institutions like the U.N. are downplaying the humanitarian crisis engulfing Venezuela due to its socialist ideology. In the U.S., politicians such as 2020 presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders have come under fire for their alleged failure to call out the Maduro regime. Meanwhile, there have been plenty of officials in international institutions lining up to condemn President Trump’s not-yet-built wall on the southern border Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was criticized by Rubio specifically for repeated meetings with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, offering to help conduct a “serious negotiation to help the country out of the present standoff for the benefit of the people of Venezuela.” Guterres’ statements since then have been weaker than what many hope the international body would issue given such dire circumstances, a statement in which his office said he was following “with increasing concern the escalation of tensions in Venezuela.” “The Secretary-General appeals for violence to be avoided at any cost and for lethal force not to be used in any circumstances,” his office said. “The Secretary-General appeals for calm and urges all actors to lower tensions and pursue every effort to prevent further escalation.” POMPEO URGES VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES TO LET HUMANITARIAN AID INTO THE COUNTRY: 'DO THE RIGHT THING' On Sunday, Human Rights Chief Michelle Bachelet was somewhat stronger as she decried “disgraceful scenes.” “The Venezuelan government must stop its forces from using excessive force against unarmed protesters and ordinary citizens,” she said. While appeals to “both sides” are typical of U.N. officials -- who regularly seek neutrality as much as possible so as to be a neutral space for negotiation -- to those looking for a tougher line on the Maduro regime, the statement from Guterres is likely only to fuel their disappointment. “The U.N. has not taken a side except that the U.N.’s concern is for the people of Venezuela,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Fox News Tuesday. “We’ve expressed our concern at the humanitarian problem in Venezuela. We’ve been working, our colleagues on the ground are working with the government to try to scale up the humanitarian aid notably in the areas of nutrition and health, and we will continue to do that,” he said. “But I think what we are seeing, what we saw over the weekend just makes it clearer for the need for a negotiated settlement.” Former Venezuelan U.N. diplomat Isaias Medina, who resigned his post in protest against Maduro’s policies in 2017, told Fox News the organization was suffering from “no clear movement or decision making" on the humanitarian situation. “The U.N. paralysis in Venezuela regarding the protection of the civilian population is only comparable to its empathy toward Maduro's regime,” he told Fox News. VENEZUELA UNVEILS ANTI-US COALITION AT UNITED NATIONS On Tuesday Under-Secretary General Rosemary DiCarlo addressed the Security Council on the subject and said it was working to provide assistance to those in need, particularly on saving lives, conflict prevention and human rights. “Such assistance should be free from political objectives and delivered on the basis of need,” she said. At the Council meeting, Arreaza accused the U.N. of being biased against Venezuela and accused the U.S. of attempting to push a coup. “Allow me to say to you [DiCarlo] that your briefing, your explanation was biased,” he said. “It always sought to disseminate information from one source and incidentally with all respect I don't at all agree, it is not in line with what we spoke with in our meeting with [Guterres]. “We denounce the United States government for organizing, financing and leading this clear aggression against Venezuela,” he said. Furthermore, far from being a neutral space for dialogue and negotiation, the U.N.’s New York headquarters is becoming something of a rallying point for pro-Maduro countries to give support to the failing regime. Arreaza, this month, announced the formation of a group that he said would defend the U.N. Charter, flanked by more than a dozen ambassadors and diplomats from countries including Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria, China and Russia.

News article:
'Significant Response': Bolton Warns Against Attempts to Prevent Guaido Return Sputnik News 05:14 04.03.2019(updated 06:02 04.03.2019) US National Security Advisor John Bolton said Sunday that any attempt to prevent the safe return of Venezuela's self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido would meet "strong and significant response" from Washington. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido has announced his return to Venezuela after the Latin American tour he kicked off in defiance of a travel ban, calling for new demonstrations to be held across the country on Monday. John Bolton said earlier that Washington plans to create a coalition to change the government in Venezuela amid the ongoing political crisis in the Latin American country. "We are trying to rally support for the peaceful transition of power from [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro to [self-proclaimed interim president of Venezuela] Juan Guaido, whom we recognize as president […] I'd like to see as broad a coalition as we can put together to replace Maduro, to replace the whole corrupt regime. That's what we are trying to do", Bolton said in an interview for the CNN broadcaster. Earlier this week, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has repeatedly slammed Guaido as a "US puppet" and accused Washington of trying to stage a coup in Venezuela, said that the opposition leader must be tried if he returns. US-backed Guaido, who proclaimed himself Venezuelan interim president in January, crossed into Colombia on 22 February in defiance of a Venezuelan Supreme Court order barring him from leaving the country due to an ongoing investigation. After unsuccessful attempts to deliver US-sponsored humanitarian aid to Venezuela from the neighboring country, Guaido said that he plans to return home. According to the deputy judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice, Juan Carlos Valdez, Guaido may face up to 30 years in jail for breaching foreign travel ban. US Special Envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams has threatened Caracas with a major international reaction in case of Guaido's arrest. The United States has recognized Guaido and around 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia, Iran, Turkey and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
US special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams failed to provide any legal reasons for Swiss banks to freeze Venezuelan government-linked accounts in a prank phone call placed by a famous Russian comedic duo. "I think everything should be frozen," the voice, allegedly belonging to Abrams, told pranksters Vovan and Lexus who were posing as the President of Switzerland and the chief of the nation's Department of Finance, Ueli Maurer. The men, whose real names are Vladimir Kuznetsov and Aleksey Stolyarov, are known for pulling off successful pranks on high-ranking politicians and public figures. They told the media that the conversation with Abrams was recorded in February. The prankers told their interlocutor that the accounts of Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA, as well as assets belonging to President Nicolas Maduro's inner circle, were discovered in "several large banks," including the made-up Limpopo Bank (named after a river in South Africa featured in a popular Russian children's story). However, Switzerland would need "serious" legal grounds to freeze the assets, they explained, asking Abrams to provide proof that the assets in question were "created by crime." "It's kind of obvious in this sense," the US special envoy for Venezuela replied. "If you are a public servant in Venezuela, there's no possible legal way that you could have acquired these amounts of money," he said. Washington, along with its allies in Europe and South America, have been openly backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself 'interim president' in January. The move was denounced by current President Maduro. The US has stepped up the pressure and sanctions on the Maduro government, while urging other nations to back Guaido and seize the assets of senior officials and state-run companies. In the phone call, the pranksters repeatedly pressed the man they said was US envoy Abrams to present some sort of data indicating that Venezuelan foreign assets were generated via corruption or other illicit activities. He failed to provide any concrete evidence but, nevertheless, insisted that they should block access to the accounts anyway. The man acknowledged that the situation on the ground in Caracas is a "dispute" with "most Western governments having taken a side" in it. His ultimate advice was: "The better wisdom would be to freeze the accounts." Vovan and Lexus also told the media that after speaking with Abrams, they were contacted by Venezuelan politician Carlos Vecchio, who Juan Guaido appointed as his envoy to the US. Vecchio was snooping for Maduro's personal assets and wanted to find out when his 'government' could "gain access" to them, the pranksters claimed. According to them, they told Guaido's envoy that Maduro keeps his money in the Fund Nurlan Baidilda (which actually exists and is owned by a Russian citizen). Vecchio took this information as truth and later shared it with Bloomberg and posted it on Twitter. 2.We are conducting an investigation to recover stolen assets. As a result, we have good reason to believe that a large part of these funds is located in the Fund Nurlan Baidilda Ltd. in an account belonging to the dictator @nicolasmaduro . — CARLOS VECCHIO (@carlosvecchio) February 25, 2019 A veteran politician with the Department of State, Elliott Abrams was heavily criticized for his role in shaping the US policy of interventions in Central America during the Cold War.

A cyber-attack is likely the reason for the major blackout that left most of Venezuela in darkness, a Maduro government official said, hinting that the US may be involved in the offensive. As Venezuela is still reeling from a nationwide blackout, Nicolas Maduro’s government says the emergency was the result of an external influence. The major power outage was likely prompted by a cyber-attack against the Guri hydroelectric plant which produces 80% of the country’s electricity, Jorge Rodriguez, Venezuela’s communication and information minister said on Friday, according to local media. The official went on to hint that US Senator and fierce anti-Maduro campaigner Marco Rubio may be linked to the offensive. Rodriguez found it suspicious that shortly after the failure Rubio shared specific information on Twitter about the emergency that even local authorities were not aware of at that time. How did Marco Rubio know [of the attack] a few minutes later that the backup generators had failed? At that time, no one knew yet. Branding the country-wide power outage “the most brutal attack on the Venezuelan people in 200 years,” the minister promised to file a complaint to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. President Nicolas Maduro earlier also raised suspicions of Washington standing behind the power outage as he accused the US of waging the “electricity war.” The country’s electric energy minister, for his part, said that “deliberate sabotage” on behalf of the US-backed opposition was the reason. Also on rt.com Venezuela blames sabotage & ‘US electricity war’ after major power outage Caracas and a number of other Venezuela’s cities were plunged into darkness on Thursday. The power outage shut the capital’s subway and left principal roads gridlocked as traffic lights were put out of order. The country’s largest international airport was also left without power. While power started to return to some parts of Caracas officials are so far unable to fully restore the supply. Also on rt.com Back to square one? Washington now says ‘no timeline’ for regime change in Venezuela (VIDEO) The blackout caught Venezuela amid a full-fledged political crisis as the country is split between the supporters of President Maduro and the opposition leader Juan Guaido. The latter – who enjoys the support of the US as well as most of the EU and Latin American countries – proclaimed himself an interim president back in January. In February, US President Donald Trump said he does not exclude military intervention in the conflict torn-country. Russia, China, Turkey, Iran and a number of other states have warned against meddling into Venezuela’s internal affairs. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

News article:
EU warns US against military action on Venezuela Iran Press TV Tue Mar 12, 2019 06:15PM The European Union has cautioned the United States against taking military action against Venezuela, saying the Latin American country's crisis has to be resolved through peaceful and political solutions. "We believe that no military development, from inside or outside of the country, would be acceptable," EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a United Nations Security Council meeting on cooperation between the European Union and the UN on Tuesday. "A solution cannot be, and should never be, imposed from the outside," she asserted. "The crisis that affects the country has political and institutional causes. It's not a natural disaster. Its solution needs to be peaceful, political, and democratic," said Mogherini. The official also reminded that the bloc had set up a contact group with Latin American countries to push for a political process. Venezuela has been facing dire economic conditions and months-long protests, with President Nicolas Maduro putting the country's woes down to US interventionism and accusing Washington of attempting a coup against his government. Congress chief Juan Guaido named himself as Venezuela's interim president amid the crisis in January. Washington took the lead in recognizing his claim followed by the US' major European allies, including France, Germany, and Britain. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that all options are on the table in promoting Washington's choice for Guaido over Maduro. Russia, China and Iran have, however, roundly rejected the US' meddlesome push targeting Venezuela. Caracas expels US diplomats Also on Tuesday, Venezuela ordered American diplomats to leave the country within 72 hours after Maduro accused Trump of cyber "sabotage" that has plunged the country into days-long blackout. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza made the announcement after talks broke down over maintaining diplomatic "interest sections" in the two countries. "The presence on Venezuelan soil of these officials represents a risk for the peace, unity, and stability of the country," the government also said in a statement. A day earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had announced that the United States would withdraw the diplomats. The US State Department, meanwhile, said their presence had become "a constraint on US policy." NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
(Miami Herald/TNS) — The Trump administration is considering imposing sanctions on companies from third countries that facilitate the shipment of Venezuelan oil to Cuba, a senior administration official said. “The interim president of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, recognized by the U.S. and Europe, where most of these companies are from, has asked us to stop these shipments and we are considering everything to be supportive,” the official said. The Venezuelan National Assembly, controlled by the opposition, agreed to suspend the shipment of crude oil to Cuba as part of a state of emergency decree approved Monday to respond to the chaos caused by a major electrical blackout. Guaido published on Twitter a chart estimating that the Nicolas Maduro regime sends 47,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba, worth about $2.5 million under current world oil prices. The decision “to cut the oil supply to Cuba asserts our independence,” Guaido wrote on Twitter. And the income from oil should boost the reconstruction of Venezuela.” The U.S. official said the administration is “aware of these shipments, we know where they are and who the companies are.” The official said both the United States and the interim Venezuelan government could take legal action against the companies. The United States has imposed similar sanctions on companies facilitating trade with North Korea and Iran. There are other steps the United States can take to increase pressure on the Maduro government, the official said, including the interdiction of oil shipments, “but we´re on step 1.” Through an agreement between the Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez to exchange oil for medical services, Venezuela sends 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba, less than half what it supplied a few years ago before oil production plunged under Maduro. In the midst of the deepest drop in oil production in 33 years, Venezuelan oil company PDVSA also bought $440 million in Russian oil to ship to Cuba from January 2017 to May 2018, according to documents obtained by Reuters. The company paid $12 more per barrel than the subsidized price for shipments under the barter agreement with Cuba. These shipments could stop or be substantially reduced if the National Assembly, with the aid of the U.S. government, succeeds in stopping the shipments or at least disrupts their transportation. The National Assembly appears to have taken control of Citgo, the PDVSA subsidiary in the United States, and appointed a new board to run PDVSA, but it is not clear yet how much control it has over the national oil firm.

News article:
Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro's government said Thursday that it has banned opposition leader Juan Guaido from public office for 15 years. The ban comes after Guaido challenged Maduro last week, saying his government was too dysfunctional to arrest him. Elvis Amoroso, the country's comptroller and a close ally of Maduro, made the announcement on state television, citing alleged irregularities with Guaido's finances. “We’re going to continue in the streets,” Guaido declared in response. Both opposition protesters and government forces plan on more demonstrations this week in their attempts to gain legitimacy. The United States and dozens of other countries recognize Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela, while China, Iran, and Russia back Maduro. Widespread protests broke out in the country when Maduro inaugurated his second term in January after what observers called a fraudulent election. Two million people have fled Venezuela during Maduro's rule, with food shortages and power outages becoming increasingly frequent. On Wednesday, President Trump hosted Guaido's wife, Fabiana Rosales and the wife of Guaido's chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, in the Oval Office. Romy Moreno Molina described the 2 a.m. raid on March 21 in which Maduro forces kidnapped her husband from their home. [Opinion: Venezuela is becoming Trump's version of Obama's Syria]

Both opposition protesters and government forces plan on more demonstrations this week in their attempts to gain legitimacy. The United States and dozens of other countries recognize Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela, while China, Iran, and Russia back Maduro. Widespread protests broke out in the country when Maduro inaugurated his second term in January after what observers called a fraudulent election. Two million people have fled Venezuela during Maduro's rule, with food shortages and power outages becoming increasingly frequent. On Wednesday, President Trump hosted Guaido's wife, Fabiana Rosales and the wife of Guaido's chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, in the Oval Office. Romy Moreno Molina described the 2 a.m. raid on March 21 in which Maduro forces kidnapped her husband from their home. [Opinion: Venezuela is becoming Trump's version of Obama's Syria]

News article:
(MENAFN- AzerNews) By Abdul Kerimkhanov China and Iraq are the main trading partners of Iran, said the head of the Iranian Customs Directorate, Mehdi Mirashrafi. He noted that China and Iraq imported non-oil goods from Iran in the amount of $8.3 billion and $8.2 billion respectively. Iranian exports of oil and non-oil products reached $ 40 billion in the first 11 months of the current 1,397 fiscal year, Mirashrafi said, adding that China and Iraq were the main destinations for Iranian goods, Fars News reported. During his visit to the port of Bandar-e-Imam Khomeini, in Khuzestan province on March 4, an Iranian official told reporters that Khuzestan has a sea and land border with Iraq, and visiting the customs centers of the region is one of the goals of his visit. "The trip in Khuzestan is intended for infrastructure development so that Khuzestan can increase its share in maritime and border trading with Iraq," he said. In late December, the Iranian Trade PromotionOrganization announced that Iraq, China and the United Arab Emirates were respectively the three main points of Iran's external trade flow in the first eight months of the current Iranian year (launched March 21, 2018). It was noted that the country's exports to Azerbaijan recorded an increase of 50 percent over the same period. Iran has sufficient financial resources and high solvency, although the damage caused to the economy by the global fall in oil prices and lengthy sanctions in the field of finance has been significant. The disconnection of Iranian banks from the SWIFT system in March 2012 led to a sharp decline in foreign exchange earnings. In fact, the funds of Iranian oil importers remained in their accounts and, accordingly, could be used by Iran only for the purchase of products in the importing countries. On the other hand, the current situation had a positive side, since it led to an increase in trade with these states. The main industries of Iran are oil (including extraction and primary processing of oil and gas), processing (including petrochemicals) and mining. The relations of Iraq and Iran have now reached a qualitatively new level which has prepared the ground for strategic cooperation in the field of defense and security. Bilateral cooperation between Iran and China is comprehensive and encompasses political, economic, social and other areas, and both sides are in favor of expanding bilateral cooperation.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Mar. 7 By Elnur Baghishov – Trend: The potential of Iran's flour processing plants is very high and imports of wheat bring additional income to the country at the same time, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad of Iran told Fars News Agency, Trend reports. According to the official, the imported wheat is brought temporarily and flour products are being prepared. Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad signed a contract with Russia for the import of 1 million tons of wheat, so as to use the full potential of Iran's flour processing plants. "After being processed at 15 flour plants, the imported wheat is exported to countries of South-East Asia and China," he said. Over the past days, the movement of an Iranian cargo carrier with about 4,900 tons of wheat was impeded at the Volga River. This has caused some Iranians to wonder as to why wheat is being imported to Iran, when there is no need for that.

News article:
The first attack on Soviet anti-Semitism was launched at the United Nations General Assembly today by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., head of the American delegation to the U.N., in the course of his first address to the Assembly. “The United States,” he said, “observed with indignation the persecution of Christians, Moslems and Jews that has been taking place in the Soviet Union for some time. That discrimination is not only wicked; it will also in the end prove to be totally ineffective because there is an undefeatable quality in human nature which will always resist totalitarian attempts to destroy religious and ethnic freedom.” Ambassador Abba Eban, head of the Israel delegation at the UN, today made an attempt to secure the earliest possible discussion at the Assembly of the anti-Jewish campaign in the Iron Curtain countries by voting with the Soviet bloc to put a Polish proposal on “measures to implement peace” third on the list of the agenda of the UN Political Committee, after the items on Korea and Greece. However, the motion was defeated by eight votes in favor, 33 against and 18 abstentions. Explaining his vote, Mr. Eban said “there were certain recent measures and movements” behind the Iron Curtain which he wished to bring to the attention of the United Nations. He was, of course, referring to the Soviet anti-Jewish campaign. He pointed out that since he wished to do this as soon as possible he was supporting moving the Polish proposal forward on the agenda. The item under which Israel will raise the issue of anti-Semitism remains in sixth place on the agenda.

News article:
Senator Warren Austin, head of the American delegation to the United Nations, today told the Security Council that the United States has no intention of backing down on its support of the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. “The General Assembly,” Austin said, “voted for partition as the solution of the Palestine problem. The United States of America voted for that solution and still supports it.” The U.S. delegate stood firm on his resolution presented to the Security Council last week, especially on that section which called on the Council to accept responsibility for partition as requested in the General Assembly’s decision. At the same time, he restated the American view that acceptance of such responsibility is “subject to the limitation that armed forces cannot be used for implementation of the plan because the U.N. Charter limits the use of United Nations force expressly to threats and breaches, and aggression affecting international peace.” Implementation of the partition decision must be achieved by peaceful measures, Austin insisted. Going into elaborate detail on the legal interpretation placed upon the Assembly resolution and the U.N. Charter by the United States, Sen. Austin made it clear that if the Council should decide that the Palestine situation constitutes a threat to world peace. The following steps, Austin said, could then be taken: 1.Military measures under Article 42 of the U.N. Charter. 2.Impose economic or other non-military sanctions upon those states which are involved in creating a threat to peace. 3. Take provisional measures to halt hostilities pending settlement of the dispute under Article 40 of the Charter. If a threat to peace is determined, the U.S. delegate declared, the Council would be required to follow one or more of these lines of action. This is an obligation that exists without the General Assembly resolution, because the Charter requires it, he pointed out. Austin’s address today came in reply to a Belgian amendment to the American resolution which would have struck out the part of the proposal calling on the Council to accept its assigned responsibilities for the implementation of the partition plan as recommended by the General Assembly. In elaborating upon the request contained in the General Assembly resolution Senator Austin said: “The Council may regard attempts to alter by force the settlement envisaged by this resolution as constituting a threat to peace. The obligation must be tarried out by the process of determination and not solely at the request of the General Assembly.” GROMYKO ASKS DIRECT “BIG GIVE” TALKS AND REPORT WITHIN TEN DAYS The Soviet Union made known its stand in a short statement by Andrei Gromyko calling for Big Five consultations, but outside of committee. Instead, Gromyko said, these consultations should be directly among the big powers. In addition, he called for haste, and urged that the Big Five report to the Council within ten to 15 days. Gromyko also described as ”complicated and confusing” the parts of the U.S. resolution which imply involved consultations with the Jews and Arabs. These consultations, he said, have been drawn out long enough. For additional information, the Soviet delegate pointed out, the Palestine Commission was available and ready to answer all questions and give all explanations, He asked the U.S. to delete that part of the proposal. The U.S. plan for consultations, he stressed, was “artificially put forth and cannot be justified” on practical grounds. Gromyko also declared himself in favor of the part of the American proposal which accords recognition to the demands of the General Assembly upon the Council, thus taking a stand in direct opposition to the Syrian and Belgian proposals. BRITAIN REFUSES TO PARTICIPATE IN “BIG FIVE” COMMITTEE ON PALESTINE Following Austin’s statement, British Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech-Jones told the Security Council that the British Government “cannot agree to take part in the Committee” of the Big Five proposed by the U.S. and Belgian resolutions to establish whether the present situation in Palestine presents a threat to peace. Britain, he announced, will cooperate with the work of the Big Five Committee, but will not vote for either the American or Belgian resolution. Creech-Jones warned the Council that after May 15, when the Palestine Mandate expires, the country “is likely to become disorganized, disintegrated and even more violent and disrupted on that date.” He expressed the hope that the Council will find a way to secure effective assumption of authority in Palestine by the United Nations when the Mandate is ended. At the same time, he warned that any force sent into Palestine from outside to impose any plan not acceptable either to the Jews or to the Arabs would have to be kept there for a long period. The British Colonial Secretary then made a vicious attack on the Jewish Agency. He said that the statement by Moshe Shertok before the Security Council last Friday was one of “suppressions, distortions and half-truths.” It was an attempt to divert attention “from its political ineptitude and moral weakness,” he charged. “The Agency,” he said, “has consistently subordinated moral considerations to political expediency.” The Council session opened with a fiery statement by Syria’s delegate Faris Kl. Khoury challenging the legal right of the Council to implement partition. In an article by article analysis of the U.S. resolution, EL Khoury defied Austin to answer his basic contentions that the Council has neither the right nor the power to muster force against the Arabs who, he said, have “the sacred right to defend themselves against criminal greed.” The Syrian denied the right of the Big Five to supersede the Council and supported the Belgian resolution. The Council adjourned the Palestine-debate this evening and will resume its discussion tomorrow afternoon.

The General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Wednesday for two resolutions aimed against a U.S. order to close the Palestine Liberation Organization’s United Nations observer mission in New York, effective March 21. Both resolutions were supported by 143 countries. Israel was the only country to vote against the first of them, which calls on the United States “to abide by its treaty obligations and to provide assurances that no action will be taken that would infringe” on the functions of the PLO observer mission. Israel did not participate in the second vote, which was for a resolution asking the General Assembly to seek an opinion from the World Court in The Hague as to whether the United States, as a party to the 1947 Headquarters Agreement with the United Nations, is obliged under international law to enter into arbitration of the dispute. An Israeli diplomat explained to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that Israel decided not to participate in the vote on that resolution, because it dealt with juridical matters to which Israel is not a party. The United States did not participate in cither vote. The U.S. ambassador, Herbert Okun, said after the voting that the United States regards the special session of the General Assembly convened to debate the issue as “premature and inappropriate.” “The U.S. has not yet taken action affecting the functioning of any mission or invitee,” Okun explained. He said that as U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar stated in his report to the General Assembly of Feb. 25, “the U.S. government has made no final decision concerning the application and enforcement of recently passed U.S. legislation, the Anti-Terrorist Act of 1987, with respect to the Permanent Observer Mission to the U.N. in New York.” ‘UNNECESSARY AND PREMATURE’ Okun added, “For this reason, we can only view as unnecessary and premature the holding at this time of the resumed session of the 42nd General Assembly.” The 42nd General Assembly opened last September and continues until next September, though not in regular session. The dispute with the United States stems from legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Reagan on Dec. 22. The United Nations maintains the law violates the Headquarters Agreement, and it has been seeking to take the matter to arbitration. Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Benjamin Netanyahu, was the last speaker in more than two days of debate on the issue, which started Monday, when the special General Assembly session opened. Mounting the podium only minutes before the voting began Wednesday, the Israeli envoy said the question before the General Assembly is not the closure of the PLO observer mission, but rather “whether the PLO should be in the U.N. in the first place.” Netanyahu charged that the PLO is dedicated to the eradication of the State of Israel through “armed struggle and violence.” He said this principal idea of the PLO is in sharp contradiction to the basic principles of the U.N. Charter, which calls for non-violent solutions to all conflicts and disputes. “The PLO is constitutionally incapable of non-violence and reconciliation,” because the only solution to the conflict with Israel that it advocates is a violent one, Netanyahu said. He said the PLO is responsible for international terrorism in the last 20 years “more than any other group or state in the world.”

News article:
The government and the opposition were united in the Knesset today in condemnation of the United Nations Security Council resolution calling for the dismantling of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and Jerusalem. Premier Menachem Begin indicated that he accepted President Carter’s explanation that U.S. support for the resolution was on error due to “a failure of communications” but he urged the U.S. to repudiate the resolution in its entirety. (Meanwhile, it was announced in Washington that a Congressional hearing will be held next Thursday to investigate the U.S. “out-up” in the UN. See separate story.) In a political statement to the Knesset, the first since the latest crisis in U.S. Israeli relations erupted, Begin repeated his claim that Israel has an undisputed right to settle anywhere in “Eretz Israel” and that the settlements are on integral part of the State’s security. He denounced the Security Council’s call for dismantling Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem as “barbaric.” Begin disclosed that he had received a cable from Carter explaining that the American vote had been cost in error on the assumption that a paragraph referring to Jerusalem had been deleted from the resolution. “It goes without saying that we regard the words of the American President with all due respect,” Begin said. But, he added: “A question must be asked whether this single error that Carter pointed at was the only expression of animosity in the resolution toward Israel and her vital interests. What about all other paragraphs which repeatedly mention Jerusalem and contradict the Camp David accords?” Labor Party chairman Shimon Peres supported the government’s stand against the American vote which, he said, went against “U.S. Mideast policy.” He also expressed opposition to the supply of sophisticated weaponry to the Arab states by the West, including the U.S. He said this limited Israel’s technological advantage over its neighbors. However, the opposition leader had strong criticism for Begin’s government. “We think that it caused, in a way, a deterioration of the Israeli position in the world,” he said. Referring to the controversial Hebron issue, Peres declared, “We are surely against settling Hebron with Jews as well as other settlements in the middle of densely populated Arab areas. “He said the only solution is to hold new elections to replace the present government with one that will adopt a clear policy. DAYAN ATTACKS SETTLEMENT POLICY Former Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan, on independent MK, surprised the Knesset with the vehemence of his attack on the government’s settlement policy, especially in Hebron. The settlement of Jews in Hebron is completely unnecessary, Dayan declared. If, indeed, the government believes the return of Jews to Hebron is so vital, why did it wait for a Jew to be murdered there before initiating such a step, he asked. He charged that the government was taking reprisal actions rather than adopting a clear policy in the occupied territories. Dayan also criticized the evacuation of the last Arab family from the Jewish quarter in East Jerusalem, Ayub Hamis Toutanji, his wife and six children, left their home overlooking the Temple Mount last Tuesday after on unsuccessful eight-year legal battle to retain ownership of the property that has belonged to his family since 1935. The neighbor-hood was taken over by the government after 1967 for conversion into on exclusively Jewish quarter. Dayan said the decision against the Toutanjis disturbed him both as a politician and a Jew. “Why? Why? What do we want, how do we want to live? Let us assume that an Arab would live in the Jewish quarter. So what?” Dayan asked.

News article:
The United States and Israel on one side, and the Soviet Union on the other, clashed here today over a proposal by Israel at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the world be called upon “to combat prejudices such as anti-Semitism.” The conflict developed at the morning session of the Commission during the debate of a draft United Nations Convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance a proposal which the USSR has been fighting here for six years through many parliamentary and procedural maneuvers. Israel’s representative on the Commission, Associate Israeli Supreme Court Justice Haim H. Cohn, submitted an amendment to one proposed article in the draft Convention, mentioning anti-Semitism specifically as a prejudice to combat. Evgeny Nasinovsky, the Soviet delegate to the Commission, presented an alternative amendment that would eliminate the word “anti-Semitism” and call, instead for “uniting the efforts of all persons and organizations, regardless of religion, in the interests of peace among peoples and states.” Morris B. Abram, the United States delegate to the Commission, backed the Israeli amendment. Referring to anti-Semitism as “the most pervasive and persistent form of the evil we are hoping to bring under international control, ” he asked the Commission: “Can it possibly do any harm for us to mention anti-Semitism in this Convention?” “My delegation believes,” Mr. Abram told the Commission, “that a specific reference to anti-Semitism in this Convention is not only proper but needed for many reasons. Anti-Semitism is an illustration of religious intolerance and discrimination in its most persistent and pervasive form. “Unchecked anti-Semitism, ” continued Mr. Abram, “played a leading role in the establishment of the criminal Nazi state which, in our own time, after devouring its Jewish population, proceeded to destroy the religious and political freedoms of other German citizens and then to the systematic genocide of several great peoples and the conquest of Europe. Anti-Semitism has played a critical role in the preparation of societies for the destruction of religious and political freedoms of everybody.” U.S. DELEGATE BACKS ISRAEL’S PROPOSAL WITH FORCEFUL ARGUMENTS Pointing out that some delegations in the last U.N. General Assembly noted that they believed a specific reference to anti-Semitism belonged in the Convention dealing with religious intolerance, and not in connection with racial discrimination, Mr. Abram said: “In the area of religious intolerance and discrimination, anti-Semitism is the classic case, as apartheid is in the area of racial discrimination.” “The anti-Semite, ” Mr. Abram continued, “advances any argument which will serve his ends, but the Jew is the only Semitic person whom he ever attacks, and his grounds will shift to exploit any advantage or when a previous argument has failed. Moreover, the same Jew may be described by the anti-Semite as a Wall Street capitalist and as a Communist; as a religious fanatic and an anti-religious devil; as an aggressive fighter and as a despicable coward.” Taking issue with the Soviet argument that peoples other than Jews are also Semites, and that therefore, it would be confusing to use the term in an international convention, the U.S. delegate urged the members of the Human Rights Commission to recognize this argument as “a quibble. ” The Soviet Government, he pointed out, had no problem about the meaning of the word anti-Semitism when, in July 1918, the Council of People’s Commissars declared that “the anti-Semitic movements and pogroms against the Jews are fatal to the interests of the workers’ and peasants’ revolution.” “Both the World Council of Churches and Vatican Council II of the Catholic Church have singled out anti-Semitism for specific condemnation,” he said. “The former, in November-December 1961, in a resolution on anti-Semitism urged its member churches ‘to do all in their power to resist every form of anti-Semitism.’ Pope Paul VI, on October 28, 1965, at the Vatican Council, promulgated the Declaration on the Relations of the Church to Non-Christian Religions which, as we have noted, specifically decried anti-Semitism and used that word.”

News article:
The Security Council adopted a resolution this afternoon which had been introduced by the United States calling upon Israel to cease its military action in south Lebanon and to immediately withdraw its forces from that area. The Council also agreed to establish immediately a United Nations interim force in the area taken over by Israel. Twelve of the 15 Council members voted in favor of the resolution. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia abstained and China declined to participate. According to the resolution, the UN force would be deployed in south Lebanon “for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and assisting the government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.” The resolution did not give a time limit for Israeli withdrawal or for the interim UN force. Soviet Ambassador Oleg Troyanovsky complained before the vote was taken that the U.S. had refused to include in the resolution his proposal that a time limit be placed on the life of the UN force. But American Ambassador Andrew Young said, in introducing the resolution last night, that the UN mission would be over when peace was restored and the Lebanese government had established its authority over the area. The U.S. reportedly wanted the resolution approved before the arrival of Premier Menachem Begin in the U.S. today. (Begin, who was en route to the U.S. when the Council action was taken, said at Ben Gurion Airport prior to his departure this morning that Israel did not think very highly of the American plan. “We have some suggestions of our own on this subject,” he said. But he did not reveal what they are.) HERZOG CITES FAILURE TO CONDEMN PLO TERROR Israeli Ambassador Chaim Herzog told the Council today that his government was ready to begin immediate negotiations on ways of returning south Lebanon to control of the Lebanese government. But Herzog criticized the resolution as being inadequate because “in keeping with the time-honored tradition of this organization, there is not one word of condemnation of terrorism and the horrible terrorist outrages committed against Israel.” He said while the resolution called for Israeli withdrawal it failed to demand that the terrorist elements be barred from the area of south Lebanon where they had usurped Lebanese authority. “Whatever arrangements may be negotiated and concluded with Israel and Lebanon,” Herzog stressed, “they must prevent renewed strife, vengeance and terrorism once and for all either against Israel or against any element of the population in south Lebanon. To this end, Israel is prepared to begin immediate discussions to achieve appropriate arrangements for the return of the area presently under our control to full Lebanese sovereignty and effective control.” UN TROOPS READY TO MOVE WITHIN 36 HOURS The Council resolution ordered Secretary General Kurt Waldheim to complete plans to send a UN force to Lebanon within 24 hours. He reportedly already has plans made and the first troops should be on their way within 36 hours. Canada, Norway and Australia have reportedly offered troops and Britain has offered its bases at Cyprus for use as staging areas. Transportation will reportedly be supplied by the U.S. (In Jerusalem, officials expressed concern over the likely nature of the UN force. See P. 3.) Today’s Council session was the third since both Israel and Lebanon requested meetings Friday. Israel asked the Council to consider the “continuous acts of terror and violence against Israeli civilians, together with the frequent shelling, sabotage incursions, bombings and murder being perpetrated from Lebanese territory against Israel.” Lebanon charged that Israel’s incursion into its territory was “naked aggression.” Herzog told the Council Friday night that the southern border area with Lebanon had been free of violence until the Palestine Liberation Organization moved into the area after its expulsion from Jordan in 1971. The PLO was allowed to participate in the Council debate over the objections of the U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT ACTION The U.S. resolution followed a statement by the State. Department late last Thursday in which it called on Israel to withdraw and suggested the idea of an arrangement in southern Lebanon that could use the UN. The statement was issued after the Senate had approved the first of the two Panama Canal treaties. The U.S. statement noted that President Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance “deplore this new cycle of violence which erupted in the tragic killings in Israel last Saturday (March II) and continued with the military action and tragic loss of innocent civilian lives in Lebanon over the past two days.” The U.S. stressed that “the only real solution” to the problems which caused Mideast violence “lies in the broader search for a comprehensive settlement” of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

The Security Council adopted a resolution this afternoon which had been introduced by the United States calling upon Israel to cease its military action in south Lebanon and to immediately withdraw its forces from that area. The Council also agreed to establish immediately a United Nations interim force in the area taken over by Israel. Twelve of the 15 Council members voted in favor of the resolution. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia abstained and China declined to participate. According to the resolution, the UN force would be deployed in south Lebanon “for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and assisting the government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.” The resolution did not give a time limit for Israeli withdrawal or for the interim UN force.

The belief that the United Nations Security Council would not act on the Egyptian request for condemnation and sanctions against Israel in connection with the Gaza incident was expressed here today in evaluations of the report presented by Maj. Gen. E.L.M. Burns, UN truce chief, to the Council last Thursday. Non-Israel circles here are of the opinion that the Burns report makes it quite clear that incidents on the Arab-Israel border are unavoidable as long as the Arab countries refuse to negotiate peace with the Jewish State. In the light of the views expressed by Gen. Burns it is expected that the Security Council will adopt a resolution deploring the Gaza incident and urging Egypt and Israel to take measures to prevent new incidents. It is no secret here that many of the Arab diplomats were stunned by the tone of Gen. Burns’ report, as well as by the contents of the document. The report placed the February 28 clash at Gaza in perspective against the tense border conflicts of the last few months. In his report, Gen. Burns not only indicated that Egypt was responsible for more aggressive acts than Israel, but he also showed that Egyptian officials admitted that some of the acts of “murder and sabotage” had indeed been committed by Arabs crossing the Israel borders. The Council will meet again this week, probably Tuesday, when it will hear a statement from Israel’s chief of delegation, Abba S. Eban. Mr. Eban refused at Thursday’s meeting to make any comment, after Gen. Burns had reported and after the Burns report had been discussed by Eypt’s representative, Dr. Omar Loutfi. Mr. Eban’s maneuver of silence at Thursday’s Council session was highly commended by many observers here, who pointed out that there was really no need for the Israel diplomat to try to improve Israel’s position after the Council had heard the report by Gen. Burns.

News article:
Sen. Warren R. Austin, head of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations, formally announced this afternoon at the Security Council the American proposal for establishment of an international trusteeship for Palestine which he had revealed earlier at a meeting of the Big Powers. (See earlier story on pages 1-4.) Declaring that there seems to be “general agreement” that the partition ?lan cannot be implemented now by peaceful means, and that “it is clear that the Security Council is not prepared to go ahead with efforts to implement the plan in the existing situation,” Austin made the following statement: “My Government “believes that a temporary trusteeship for Palestine should be established under the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations to maintain the peace and to afford the Jews and Arabs of Palestine further opportunity to reach an agreement regarding the future government of that country. Such a United Nations trusteeship would, of course, “be without prejudice to the character of the eventual political settlement, which we hope can be achieved without long delay. In our opinion, the Security Council should recommend the establishment of such a trusteeship to the General Assembly and to the Mandatory Power. This would require an immediate special session of the General Assembly, which the Security Council might call under the terms of the Charter. “Pending the meeting of the special session of the General Assembly, we believe that the Security Council should instruct the Palestine Commission to suspend its efforts to implement the proposed partition plan. Draft resolutions which would give effect to the above suggestions will be circulated shortly for the consideration of the Security Council. The American delegate also commented that “the plan proposed by the General Assembly is an integral plan which cannot succeed unless each of its parts can be carried out.” He added that the Security Council has “an inescapable responsibility” to bring about a cease-fire in Palestine and a halt to incursions into that country. Austin earlier had expressed the view of the U.S. Government that under the terms of the League of National Mandate, and the General Assembly resolution on partition of Palestine, and the transfer on League of Nationals functions to the United Nations, “the limited functions which the General Assembly offered to undertake in connection with its Palestine recommendation stand or fall with that resolution.” If it proved impossible to give effect to that resolution, continued Austin, the would not have any administrative and governmental responsibilities regarding Palestine after the end of the Mandate on May 15, unless the Assembly took further ?tions. SILVER REJECTS TRUSTEESHIP; SAYS IT WILL LEAD TO MOXE VIOLENCE Dr. Abba Hillel Silver served notice on the Council that “the shocking rehearsal of its position” by the United States will not deter the Jewish community of Palestine from going ahead with the establishment of a Jewish State. “The decision of the General Assembly remains valid for the Jewish people,” said. “If the United Nations Commission is unable to carry out the mandates which are assigned to it by the General Assembly, the Jewish people of Palestine will move Harvard in the spirit of that resolution and will do everything which will be dictated by considerations of national survival, as well as the considerations of Justice and historic rights.” The plan for an interim U.N. trusteeship is likely, he said, to lead “to increased violence in Palestine and will incalculably hurt the prestige of the United Nations for whose effectiveness the President of the United States pleaded again so recently as last Wednesday night.” “It should be clear to everyone,” Dr. Silver added, “that the establishment of a trusteeship by the United Nations in Palestine will not automatically insure Peace in that country.” He warned that force will have to be used, just as it would have been required to carry out partition. Dr. Silver said an attempt was clearly being made to force upon the Jewish community of Palestine a settlement that would “diminish its sovereignty, territory and immigration as was provided for in the partition plan. Otherwise no new proposals would now be made by the United States delegation looking toward a new solution. “The Jewish Agency has repeatedly been under the necessity of stating that the partition plan represented maximum sacrifice oh the part of the Jewish people beyond which it cannot go. Any proposals calling for further sacrifices will have to be imposed upon the Jewish community of Palestine by force.” He added that he hoped to be able to comment at a later opportunity upon the legal implications of Austin’s statement. He told the Council that the Mandatory Power had never been able to confirm the arrival in Palestine of armed immigrants by sea. GROMYKO CHARGES U.S. PRESSING PLAN THROUGHOUT BIG FOUR TALKS Soviet delegate Andrei Gromyko, in a preliminary comment on the U.S. proposal, He said it had nothing in common with the question of implementing the Palestine issue. He further labelled “misleading” the U.S. report that there was agreement among the Big Four that peaceful implementation was impossible. That, he said, is the view of China and the U.S. but not of other governments. Neither do the two general principles agreed upon by the Big Four lead to the United States conclusion, Gromyko charged. Instead, he said, they were formulated as a basis of implementation. Before Grosyko spoke, Dr. T.F.Tsiang of China defined the function of the Council as one of preserving the peace. Therefore, he argued, the Council could not furnish or authorize the use of force and so favored in principle the U.S. reversal. The Council then adjourned until Wednesday morning.

SILVER REJECTS TRUSTEESHIP; SAYS IT WILL LEAD TO MOXE VIOLENCE Dr. Abba Hillel Silver served notice on the Council that “the shocking rehearsal of its position” by the United States will not deter the Jewish community of Palestine from going ahead with the establishment of a Jewish State. “The decision of the General Assembly remains valid for the Jewish people,” said. “If the United Nations Commission is unable to carry out the mandates which are assigned to it by the General Assembly, the Jewish people of Palestine will move Harvard in the spirit of that resolution and will do everything which will be dictated by considerations of national survival, as well as the considerations of Justice and historic rights.” The plan for an interim U.N. trusteeship is likely, he said, to lead “to increased violence in Palestine and will incalculably hurt the prestige of the United Nations for whose effectiveness the President of the United States pleaded again so recently as last Wednesday night.” “It should be clear to everyone,” Dr. Silver added, “that the establishment of a trusteeship by the United Nations in Palestine will not automatically insure Peace in that country.” He warned that force will have to be used, just as it would have been required to carry out partition. Dr. Silver said an attempt was clearly being made to force upon the Jewish community of Palestine a settlement that would “diminish its sovereignty, territory and immigration as was provided for in the partition plan. Otherwise no new proposals would now be made by the United States delegation looking toward a new solution. “The Jewish Agency has repeatedly been under the necessity of stating that the partition plan represented maximum sacrifice oh the part of the Jewish people beyond which it cannot go. Any proposals calling for further sacrifices will have to be imposed upon the Jewish community of Palestine by force.” He added that he hoped to be able to comment at a later opportunity upon the legal implications of Austin’s statement. He told the Council that the Mandatory Power had never been able to confirm the arrival in Palestine of armed immigrants by sea. GROMYKO CHARGES U.S. PRESSING PLAN THROUGHOUT BIG FOUR TALKS Soviet delegate Andrei Gromyko, in a preliminary comment on the U.S. proposal, He said it had nothing in common with the question of implementing the Palestine issue. He further labelled “misleading” the U.S. report that there was agreement among the Big Four that peaceful implementation was impossible. That, he said, is the view of China and the U.S. but not of other governments. Neither do the two general principles agreed upon by the Big Four lead to the United States conclusion, Gromyko charged. Instead, he said, they were formulated as a basis of implementation. Before Grosyko spoke, Dr. T.F.Tsiang of China defined the function of the Council as one of preserving the peace. Therefore, he argued, the Council could not furnish or authorize the use of force and so favored in principle the U.S. reversal. The Council then adjourned until Wednesday morning.

News article:
The mayor of Jerusalem, members of Congress and nearly every major American Jewish organization have weighed in with immediate criticism of U.N. Security Council Resolution 280. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert sent a letter to President Clinton expressing “shock and disappointment” that the U.S. government did not veto the U.N. resolution. The letter, which was released on Sunday, stated, “This resolution, which is intended to entice the PLO back to the negotiation table, will in fact create serious obstacles in the peace process” by raising “false and unrealistic expectations on the part of the Palestinians regarding the future of Jerusalem. “The people of Israel will refuse to support any move that raises doubts as to the status of Jerusalem as the united capital of the State of Israel. “As mayor of Jerusalem, and on behalf of all Jerusalemites, I have to express to you my deep disappointment that you did not instruct (U.N.) Ambassador (Madeleine) Albright to prevent the adoption of this resolution,” the letter said. The resolution, which was passed Friday — three weeks after the mass murder of at least 29 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque — criticized the killings, called for measures to guarantee that Palestinians be protected in the future and for the speedy implementation of the self-rule accord signed last September in Washington. But the resolution’s preamble contained language regarding Jerusalem that Jewish leaders found impossible to swallow. Within hours of the resolution’s passage, condemnation of the resolution’s language was issued by leading Jewish organizations, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, B’nai B’rith, the Zionist Organization of America and the American Zionist Movement. FINDING A COMPROMISE FORMULA Referring to “territories occupied by Israel in June 1967, including Jerusalem,” the preamble’s avowal that Jerusalem was occupied territory flew in the face of a prime dictum of the Israeli and American Jewish leadership — that Jerusalem is the eternal and undivided capital of Israel. In a compromise formula worked out before the resolution came to a vote, the United States was able to abstain on this and another paragraph of the preamble while being able to approve the resolution as a whole. In addition to abstaining on the paragraph about the status of Jerusalem, the United States abstained on a second paragraph that said the Hebron attack “underlines the need to provide protection and security for the Palestinian people.” That language could be construed as lending support to the Palestine Liberation Organization’s demand that an international force be sent to the territories to protect Palestinians. A paragraph in the main body of the resolution, which the United States supported, called for an international presence in the territories, “which was provided for in the declaration of principles” that formed the basis of the Palestinian self-rule accord. Israeli officials have supported the idea of an unarmed international presence in the territories, stressing that this was a point already negotiated in the declaration of principles, which was signed in Washington in September. While the United States twice abstained during the voting, the 14 other members of the Security Council voted for every paragraph in the resolution. During their negotiations leading up to the Security Council vote, American officials had operated on the belief that passage of the resolution was key to restarting the Israeli-PLO negotiations, which were halted by the PLO after the Hebron murders. DO ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS? And indeed, the U.S. approach did bear fruit. Following the resolution’s passage, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced at a hastily called news conference that Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had agreed to return to Washington next month to resume negotiations with Israel. U.S. officials also believed that the PLO would now resume negotiations. The three Arab states, like the PLO, had broken off the talks following the Feb. 25 Hebron incident. But in its strategy at the United Nations, the United States had adopted an ends-justifies-the-means approach toward the resolution — a tactic sharply attacked not only by the American Jewish leadership but also by members of Congress. A day before the vote on the resolution, Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Connie Mack (R-Fla.) circulated a letter criticizing the Clinton administration’s handling of the resolution. The letter, which was signed by 83 of the 100 members of the Senate, said in part, “Sacrificing core principles for short-term objectives will ultimately retard, not advance the peace process.” And shortly after the passage of Resolution 280, Jewish groups provided their verdict on the day’s Security Council proceedings. The Conference of Presidents said in a statement that the “preamble’s reference to Jerusalem as occupied territory is couched in objectionable, offensive and inappropriate language and a cause for deep regret and disappointment. “No U.N. resolution can diminish 3,000 years of Jewish history, with Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” the statement read. A similar response was issued by AIPAC. “We regret that the administration abstained on the section of the resolution pertaining to Jerusalem because the pro-Israel community, an over-whelming bipartisan majority of Congress and the president himself have consistently maintained that Jerusalem is, and always should be, the eternal, undivided capital of Israel,” AIPAC said in its statement. Lynn Lyss, chair of the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, issued a statement saying that the organization was “extremely disappointed” that the preamble referred to Jerusalem as occupied territory, but went on to support the “overall thrust” of the resolution’s condemnation of the Hebron killings and its call for a speedy resumption of the Israeli-PLO dialogue. Melvin Salberg and Abraham Foxman, the national chairman and national director, respectively, of the ADL, said they were “disappointed that the United States failed to veto on principle” the resolution because of its language on Jerusalem. But “we are reassured by the (Clinton) administration’s strong disavowal of that language,” the ADL leaders said in their statement. “We urge the administration to publicly reaffirm its longstanding support for Jerusalem as the united and undivided capital of Israel.” Reps. Charles Schumer and Nita Lowey, both of whom are New York Democrats, also criticized the resolution. ‘A DOUBLE STANDARD’ Schumer questioned why a similar resolution was not introduced before the Security Council regarding the killings of Israelis by Arab terrorists. Resolution 280 “proves once again the United Nations’ bias against Israel and its lack of credibility in dealing with the Middle East even handedly.” “There’s a double standard when the U.N. can’t wait to condemn Israel, but remains silent when Jewish blood is shed at the hands of Arab terrorists, as has been the case during the many months of the current peace effort,” Schumer said in a statement. Lowey said that “this administration has made a major mistake by caving in to (PLO Chairman Yasser) Arafat. The United States should have vetoed this one-sided resolution.” The Clinton administration, expecting harsh fallout from critics of the resolution, has been hard at work on damage control. In a conference call with leaders of the 50 member organizations of the Conference of Presidents, before the Security Council vote Friday, Vice President Al Gore reaffirmed the administration’s position recognizing a united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Asserting that a U.S. veto might have prevented the peace talks from resuming, Gore explained that the United States would have exercised its veto if the reference to Jerusalem had been in an operative paragraph of the resolution rather than in its preamble. Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed a similar view before the Security Council on Friday. “The United States supports the operative paragraphs of the resolution that the council has just adopted,” she said. “But let me make it clear — we would have exercised our veto” had the language on Jerusalem been in the resolution’s operative paragraphs. “We simply do not support the description of the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war as occupied Palestinian territory,” Albright said. “In the view of my government, this language could be taken to indicate sovereignty — a matter which both Israel and the PLO have agreed must be decided in negotiations on the final status of the territories.” (Contributing to this report was JTA correspondent Michele Chabin in Jerusalem.)

News article:
The US refrained from speaking at a United Nations discussion of violations of human rights in the Palestinian territories Monday, saying the move was done in support of Israel. A statement by US Ambassador Keith Harper to the Human Rights Council in Geneva confirmed an Israeli claim that the US silence was meant to back Jerusalem against the historically anti-Israel panel, and not as a result of tensions between US president Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as had been reported. “Our non-participation in this debate underscores our position that Item 7 lacks legitimacy, as it did last year when we also refrained from speaking,” Harper said. “The United States’ approach to the Human Rights Council’s Item 7 has not changed. We remain deeply troubled, by this Council’s stand-alone agenda item directed against Israel, and by the many repetitive and one-sided resolutions under that agenda item.” The session was an annual review of Agenda item 7, which discusses accusations against Israel for alleged abuses against Palestinians, and is usually used by countries as a soapbox against Israel. The US’s policy for several years has been to boycott the debate, a move praised by Israel, which also does not take part. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “As was the case last year, the United States will not engage in the debate. Neither will Israel,” Harper said. The US traditionally defends Israel at the UN and its constituent bodies from international censure. However, officials have indicated Washington may pull back that umbrella in response to anger at Netanyahu for statements he made last week in which he seemed to take a two-state solution with the Palestinians off the table. Earlier Monday, an American spokesperson in Geneva told Reuters that “the US delegation will not be speaking about Palestine today,” which was taken as a sign of deteriorating ties with Israel. Reuters has since updated its story. Advertisement The move was reported by Reuters to be part of Obama’s “reassessment” of Washington’s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in light of Netanyahu’s pre-election comments rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state. But an Israeli Foreign Ministry source categorically denied the thrust of the Reuters report. Spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said the American delegation was not present at the debate “at Israel’s request.” He said that Jerusalem asked its friends to stay away from such debates every year. Jerusalem had quit the Human Rights Council in 2012 to protest its alleged anti-Israel bias. Late in 2013, Israel rejoined the body, after Western member states promised to admit the country into the Western European and Others Group (WEOG), which significantly increases Jerusalem’s ability to advance its interests at the body. In addition, the WEOG states agreed not to participate in discussions over Agenda item 7 for two years. “Reuters took the statement by the [American] spokesperson and misinterpreted it to mean that it was a response by the Obama administration to the elections in Israel,” he said. “The report is untrue. Every year, the Americans stay away from this debate, which singles Israel out for censure, at Israel’s request.” Advertisement Israel’s delegation to the Geneva-based UN body also refused to appear at the debate about the state of human rights in the Palestinian territories. Israel provided no immediate explanation for not being present at the session dedicated overwhelmingly to discussion of its policies and alleged abuses, but a source close to the council said its absence clearly amounted to a boycott. Monday’s session had originally been scheduled to discuss a probe on the 50-day war in Gaza last year, but the investigators obtained a delay after the head of the team quit under Israeli pressure. “The process cannot be rushed,” former New York judge Mary McGowan Davis, who has taken over as head of the team, told the council. Canadian international law expert William Schabas resigned as chair of the Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza conflict last month after Israel complained he could not be impartial because he had prepared a legal opinion for the Palestine Liberation Organization in October 2012. Schabas strongly denied that he was beholden to the PLO but said he was reluctantly stepping down to avoid the inquiry into the July-August conflict — commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council — being compromised in any away. AFP contributed to this report.

News article:
The US refrained from speaking at a United Nations discussion of violations of human rights in the Palestinian territories Monday, saying the move was done in support of Israel. A statement by US Ambassador Keith Harper to the Human Rights Council in Geneva confirmed an Israeli claim that the US silence was meant to back Jerusalem against the historically anti-Israel panel, and not as a result of tensions between US president Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as had been reported. “Our non-participation in this debate underscores our position that Item 7 lacks legitimacy, as it did last year when we also refrained from speaking,” Harper said. “The United States’ approach to the Human Rights Council’s Item 7 has not changed. We remain deeply troubled, by this Council’s stand-alone agenda item directed against Israel, and by the many repetitive and one-sided resolutions under that agenda item.” The session was an annual review of Agenda item 7, which discusses accusations against Israel for alleged abuses against Palestinians, and is usually used by countries as a soapbox against Israel. The US’s policy for several years has been to boycott the debate, a move praised by Israel, which also does not take part.

Neither will Israel,” Harper said. The US traditionally defends Israel at the UN and its constituent bodies from international censure. However, officials have indicated Washington may pull back that umbrella in response to anger at Netanyahu for statements he made last week in which he seemed to take a two-state solution with the Palestinians off the table. Earlier Monday, an American spokesperson in Geneva told Reuters that “the US delegation will not be speaking about Palestine today,” which was taken as a sign of deteriorating ties with Israel. Reuters has since updated its story. Advertisement The move was reported by Reuters to be part of Obama’s “reassessment” of Washington’s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in light of Netanyahu’s pre-election comments rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state. But an Israeli Foreign Ministry source categorically denied the thrust of the Reuters report. Spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said the American delegation was not present at the debate “at Israel’s request.” He said that Jerusalem asked its friends to stay away from such debates every year. Jerusalem had quit the Human Rights Council in 2012 to protest its alleged anti-Israel bias. Late in 2013, Israel rejoined the body, after Western member states promised to admit the country into the Western European and Others Group (WEOG), which significantly increases Jerusalem’s ability to advance its interests at the body. In addition, the WEOG states agreed not to participate in discussions over Agenda item 7 for two years. “Reuters took the statement by the [American] spokesperson and misinterpreted it to mean that it was a response by the Obama administration to the elections in Israel,” he said. “The report is untrue. Every year, the Americans stay away from this debate, which singles Israel out for censure, at Israel’s request.” Advertisement Israel’s delegation to the Geneva-based UN body also refused to appear at the debate about the state of human rights in the Palestinian territories. Israel provided no immediate explanation for not being present at the session dedicated overwhelmingly to discussion of its policies and alleged abuses, but a source close to the council said its absence clearly amounted to a boycott. Monday’s session had originally been scheduled to discuss a probe on the 50-day war in Gaza last year, but the investigators obtained a delay after the head of the team quit under Israeli pressure. “The process cannot be rushed,” former New York judge Mary McGowan Davis, who has taken over as head of the team, told the council. Canadian international law expert William Schabas resigned as chair of the Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza conflict last month after Israel complained he could not be impartial because he had prepared a legal opinion for the Palestine Liberation Organization in October 2012. Schabas strongly denied that he was beholden to the PLO but said he was reluctantly stepping down to avoid the inquiry into the July-August conflict — commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council — being compromised in any away.

Against the strenuous opposition of the Soviet Union, which once more resorted to an anti-Jewish attack directed specifically against the chief delegate of the United States, Morris B. Abram, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights voted here last night in favor of the formation of a new office, to be called the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The vote on the issue, following a day-long debate which made a night meeting necessary, was 20 to 7, with two abstentions. The United States, Britain and Israel were with the majority. The Soviet bloc in the Commission, consisting of the USSR, Poland and the Ukraine teamed up with Yugoslavia, Iraq, India and Egypt in the opposition. France and Nigeria abstained. There are 32 members on the Commission. The Commission’s vote culminated a long fight led by the United States and Israel. The Commission’s resolution was in the form of a recommendation to its parent body, the Economic and Social Council which, in turn, must approve the move then forward it to the General Assembly for final action. In the course of the debate, Yakub A. Ostrovski, chief of the USSR delegation, once more attacked Mr. Abram, as he did in the discussion Tuesday, linking Mr. Abram’s attitude on the issue to the fact the latter, in a private capacity, is president of the American Jewish Committee. Insinuating that Mr. Abram “was obeying the orders of the Zionists and the Jews of America,” and charging that the chairman of the American delegation was “serving two masters,” Mr. Ostrovski called the American Jewish Committee “a Zionist organization.” IRAQI DELEGATE ATTACKS ISRAEL FOR SUPPORTING HUMAN RIGHTS Replying very briefly to Mr. Ostrovski’s hour-long diatribe, Mr. Abram merely noted that, in the 20 years of the Commission’s existence, no similar incident had occurred, and no reference had ever been made by a delegate to another delegate’s religious affiliation. “Moreover, Mr. Abram noted, that reference was “irrelevant to the Commission’s work.” The Russian was not the only delegate who brought up the Jewish issue during the debate. The Iraqi delegate, in a 45-minute speech, took out against Israel’s member on the Commission, Supreme Court Justice Haim H. Cohn who, yesterday, had endorsed the High Commission proposal warmly. Iraq’s delegation head chided the Israeli for supporting human rights and the protection of minorities in other countries while the Arab minority in Israel was being “suppressed.” Justice Cohn, whose intervention on the issue had been supported by Italy and Argentina, replied that “in contrast with some other countries, my Government pledges that Israel would admit a High Commissioner for Human Rights and allow him to see whatever he wanted to see and could pledge that we would listen carefully to his advice.” At the night session, the American point of view was pressed by another member of the U.S. delegation, Roger W. Tuby, who said that the High Commissioner would help “to lessen abuses committed on racial, religious or other grounds.” The idea for the establishment of a United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights was first broached publicly by Jacob Blaustein, honorary president of the American Jewish Committee, in an address at Columbia University, in New York, on December 4, 1963. Later, the matter began taking form and, in 1966, Costa Rica proposed that the Human Rights Commission form a special working group to study the matter. As a result, a nine-member group was formed and met at U.N. Headquarters in New York earlier this year. The working group adopted a set of guiding principles for a High Commissioner who, as a global ombudsman, would be the U.N.’s human rights watchdog. The group, however, left open, for the full Commission’s determination, the basic question as to whether or not such a post as High Commissioner for Human Rights was to be created. Last night’s vote on the issue brought the matter further along toward possible enactment.

News article:
The United Nations Security Council will meet here tomorrow afternoon to vote on a resolution presented by the United States suggesting a visit by UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold to the Middle East to mediate between Israel and the Arab countries in an attempt to prevent the outbreak of war in the area. From Beirut it was reported today that the Syrian radio had announced that the Soviet Government had informed Syria that Moscow would oppose the American resolution at the Security Council. However, at the United Nations no such opposition was expected today, although no commitment on the American resolution was made by Soviet delegation members. Diplomatic circles here see in the United States move only an effort to stall further on the application for defensive arms which the Israel Government submitted to Washington last November to offset the huge quantity of defensive arms received by Egypt from Soviet satellite. It is known that the Defense Department has established that the-arms requested by Israel can be made available, but the State Department is withholding approval of the application or any part of it. It is estimated in United Nations circles that–whether Mr. Hammarskjold succeeds in his mission, or not–it will take him more than a month before he prepares a report on it for the Security Council. In the meantime, it is feared, the State Department will have an excuse to deny arms to Israel under the pretext that no decision on Israel’s arms application can be taken while Mr. Hammarskjold conducts his talks and until he submits his report. Syria and Lebanon have meanwhile requested postponement of tomorrow’s meeting of the Security Council. They asked for more time to consider the proposed United States resolution. However, it is expected that the request of the two Arab countries, which are not members of the Security Council, will be rejected. The Council does not intend to invite either Israel or the Arab countries to participate in tomorrow’s session or to present their views on the American resolution.

The Israel Government expects two developments to result from the discussions of the Communist anti-Jewish came paign at the present session of the United Nations, Mrs. Golda Myerson, Israel Labor Minister, who temporarily heads the Israel delegation at the UN during the debate on the Soviet anti-Jewish drive, declared here today. They are: 1. That the Communist governments, especially the Government of the Soviet Union, will take into consideration the international condemnation voiced at the current General Assembly session against their anti-Jewish policies, and will abandon them. 2. That the Soviet Government and the other Communist governments will comply with a plea to permit the emigration of Jews who want to leave these countries and will allow such Jews to proceed to Israel. Mrs. Myerson. who is returning to Israel after the debate concludes, spoke at a luncheon tendered her by the UN Correspondents Association. She emphasized that athough Israel faces many problems at present the Jewish State will welcome Jews from the USSR and its allied countries. “No matter what our problems are the State of Israel has been established for the purpose that Jews who must leave the countries in which they reside should find a place to go,” she declared. “Our doors are open for any number of Jews from these countries.” Mrs. Myerson reviewed the Soviet attacks on Israel and world Jewry, which started at the Slansky trial in Prague, continued during the arrests of the nine physicians in Moscow and culminated in the breaking off by Moscow of diplomatic relations with Israel. She emphasized the “terrifying aspects” of the Prague trial and said that the trial was conducted in such a way as to create the impression of the existence of an “international Jewish conspiracy” to overthrow the Czechoslovak Government. She charged that the Pague trial was a revival of the notorious “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” which long ago proved to be a forgery. Pointing out that the anti-Jewish propaganda in the Soviet press and in the press of the satellite countries constituted a danger to the lives of 3,000,000 Jews there, Mrs. Myerson stated: “My government does not dare to wait now. We must alert the world to this danger. We dare not sit back.” The Israel Minister quoted from official Soviet publications passages stating: “We hate the Greensteins, the Kaplans and the Cohens.” To these official Soviet utterances we say: we love the Greensteins, the Kaplans and the Cohens. Allow them to leave your countries and come to Israel,” Mrs. Myerson stated. She expressed her belief that after the current UN Assembly speaks up the delegations of the Communist countries will convey to their governments the sentiments expressed in the international body and will seek to influence their governments to change their attitude on the treatment of Jews and on the question of permitting them to emigrate. Mrs. Myerson, who was the first Israel Minister to Moscow, said that she had no contact whatsoever with Soviet Jews during her stay there, except for her visits to the Moscow Synagogue. Even during those visits, she only “saw” Jews, but did not conduct any conversations with any of them in view of the fact that such conversations are an impossibility for any diplomats under the Soviet regime.

She emphasized the “terrifying aspects” of the Prague trial and said that the trial was conducted in such a way as to create the impression of the existence of an “international Jewish conspiracy” to overthrow the Czechoslovak Government. She charged that the Pague trial was a revival of the notorious “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” which long ago proved to be a forgery. Pointing out that the anti-Jewish propaganda in the Soviet press and in the press of the satellite countries constituted a danger to the lives of 3,000,000 Jews there, Mrs. Myerson stated: “My government does not dare to wait now. We must alert the world to this danger. We dare not sit back.” The Israel Minister quoted from official Soviet publications passages stating: “We hate the Greensteins, the Kaplans and the Cohens.” To these official Soviet utterances we say: we love the Greensteins, the Kaplans and the Cohens. Allow them to leave your countries and come to Israel,” Mrs. Myerson stated. She expressed her belief that after the current UN Assembly speaks up the delegations of the Communist countries will convey to their governments the sentiments expressed in the international body and will seek to influence their governments to change their attitude on the treatment of Jews and on the question of permitting them to emigrate. Mrs. Myerson, who was the first Israel Minister to Moscow, said that she had no contact whatsoever with Soviet Jews during her stay there, except for her visits to the Moscow Synagogue. Even during those visits, she only “saw” Jews, but did not conduct any conversations with any of them in view of the fact that such conversations are an impossibility for any diplomats under the Soviet regime.

News article:
The United Nations was on notice Monday that Israel would retain its right to undertake all measures it deemed necessary to preserve its sovereignty and security despite Sunday night’s action by the Security Council condemning Israel’s raid on Jordan territory last Thursday to wipe out the guerrilla bases from which terrorist attacks had been mounted against Israel territory. In a dramatic statement to the Council Sunday night after its adoption of the resolution, Ambassador Yosef Tekoah, head of the Israel delegation told the Council that the only solution to the Middle East situation was peace but that as long as a state of war continued, Israel would abide by its obligations under the cease-fire agreement. He pointed out, however, that the cease-fire was a reciprocal agreement and required full reciprocity from the Arab states. He noted statements by Arab spokesmen to the Council that they would not seek to stem the terrorist raids and declared that if the Arabs engaged in military activity or terror, Israel had a right and duty to defend itself. Mr. Tekoah reminded the Council that the intent of the resolution referred to both the Israel and the Jordan complaints although the original draft and statements made during the debate suggested that the Council was dealing only with the Jordanian complaint. He drew attention to statements by the Jordanian representative that Jordan would persist in warfare, terrorism and sabotage. Israel, he said, asked nothing of its neighbors but to be left in peace. Jordan’s attitude would determine whether Israel would have to fight again or whether issues would be resolved at the negotiating table. The Israel envoy told the Security Council bluntly that Israel could not accept the condemnation contained in the resolution. The Charter of the United Nations, he reminded the Council, gave Israel the right of self-defense. RESOLUTION CONDEMNS ISRAEL’S ‘LARGE-SCALE’ ACTION, DEPLORES OTHER VIOLATIONS OF CEASE-FIRE The resolution adopted by the Council described the Thursday operation as of “a large-scale carefully planned nature’ and condemned it as a “flagrant violation” of the United Nations Charter and of the cease-fire resolutions. It deplored “all violent incidents on violation of the cease-fire” and warned that “such actions of military reprisal and other grave violations of the cease-fire cannot be tolerated and that the Security Council would have to consider further and more effective steps as envisaged in the Charter to insure against repetition of such acts” — a reference to sanctions. The resolution further called on Israel “to desist from acts or activities in contravention” of the Council’s Nov. 22 resolution. The resolution adopted by the Council was a modified form of a bitter anti-Israel draft proposed by India, Pakistan, and Senegal. It was declared acceptable by the United States and Great Britain after inclusion of a condemnation of all “violations of the cease-fire.” The resolution did not, however, rebuke Jordan by name for permitting these “violent incidents” nor did it call on the Arab state to take action to prevent them. The original draft resolution had made no reference to the cease-fire violations which preceded the Israeli action of last Thursday and had regarded the Israeli action without the background of extenuating circumstances. Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg, the head of the American delegation, fought long and hard to secure inclusion in the draft of a reference to the other violations of the cease-fire. He stressed that while the United States opposed acts of retaliation. It also opposed acts of terrorism in violation of the cease-fire agreements. He warned that “violence breeds violence” and that was the lesson of recent days. Both kinds of violence, he said, must be ended. The American envoy said that it was because the resolution “takes into account all types of violence in violation of the cease-fire that my delegation was able to support it.” He urged all parties to “scrupulous compliance” with the cease-fire and “fullest cooperation with the Jarring mission.” Sources at the U.N, said it was understood that President Johnson had taken a direct interest in the formation of the American position. The debate proved the Soviet Union to be the most adamant and Intransigent party to the debate, Yakov Malik, head of the Soviet delegation, stressed time and again his belief that the Security Council should condemn Israel and impose sanctions to compel the Jewish state to return to its pre-June borders. He linked his attacks on Israel with the United States and the Arab-Israel situation with Vietnam and reiterated frequently that his delegation was ready to vote for the imposition of sanctions, He indicated that he had voted for the resolution only because it seemed to satisfy his Arab allies. The Soviet envoy said his government was determined, “along with other peace-loving states,” to work for the cessation of Israeli aggression and the liquidation of its consequences. This, he said, Included the return of the occupied Arab territories and the necessary political settlement to assure the sovereignty. territorial integrity and independence of each state in the area.

News article:
The United States veto last Thursday night of a United Nations Security Council resolution, which deplored Israeli policies in the administered territories and Jerusalem, failed to dissipate the anger and resentment following the speech last Tuesday by William Scranton, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, in which he charged that Jewish settlements in the territories. “Including East Jerusalem,” was an obstacle to successful Middle East negotiations. Anger, as well as concern was also expressed over the fact that 14 of the 15 Security Council members–including England, France. Sweden, Panama, Japan and Italy — voted for the resolution which deplored Israel’s “failure to put a stop to actions and policies tending to change the status” of Jerusalem and called on Israel to refrain from actions against Arab residents in the administered territories. The resolution also called on Israel “to respect and uphold the inviolability of the holy places which are under its occupation.” and to “desist from the expropriation of or encroachment upon Arab lands and property or the establishment of Israeli settlements thereon in the occupied Arab territories.” Observers here tended to agree with reported Arab assessments that the Security Council debate proved a success for the Arabs, despite the U.S. veto, because the U.S. had been totally isolated in its support for Israel. The observers pointed out that this was plainly an uncomfortable situation which Washington will not wish to see perpetuated. The Arab view observers noted was that Scranton’s speech last Tuesday was in the final analysis more significant than the veto because it underscored publicly, for the first time in many years, the vital differences between Washington and Jerusalem over a final settlement. HERZOG SUMMONED FOR CONSULTATIONS Ambassador Chaim Herzog, Israel’s envoy to the UN, has been summoned home for consultations concerning the debate last week and possible Arab attempts in the near future to exploit what is seen here as a weakening of U.S. support for Israel. There is also concern here about the U.S. Administration’s determined defense of its plans to sell six C-130 military transport planes to Egypt and Egypt’s additional requests to Washington for a great deal of more military hardware. Scranton, in vetoing the resolution which had been worked out by the Council’s Third World members in talks with Arab and Islamic representatives and those of the Communist bloc, declared that the resolution was unbalanced. He said it did not correspond to the reality of the situation in Israeli-administered territories and that it was wrong to charge that Israel intended to change the religious character of Jerusalem. He said that on the contrary. Israel’s administration of the holy places in Jerusalem “has literally and actively minimized tensions.” Scranton also stated that the U.S. was trying to “regain momentum in the negotiating process to reach peace in the Middle East,” and that the resolution “would not help” such efforts. VETO BY U.S. PRAISED Herzog praised the veto, noting that it was “an effort to stem attempts to convert the United Nations into an instrument of intransigent despotism and to turn the discussion on the Middle East away from one-sided fiction back to reality.” Similarly, Rabbi Alexander Schindler, chairman of the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations, who met with Scranton Thursday afternoon, prior to the vote on the resolution, welcomed the U.S. veto and praised Scranton. He said he found the envoy understanding of and sensitive to “the concerns of the American people for the security and dignity of Israel as an essential element of the just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Foreign Minister Yigal Allon, in an apparent effort to stem any deterioration in Israeli-U.S. relations, told newsmen on Friday after an hour-long meeting with U.S. Ambassador Malcolm Toon that “without the veto there certainly would have been a big crisis, a far-reaching crisis. But thanks to the veto I think the situation has been restored.” Toon, who was asked if there was a crisis, laughed and said: “Not at all.” He acknowledged, however, that Allon was unhappy with Scranton’s earlier speech. RABIN: SCRANTON’S SPEECH WAS DAMAGING Nevertheless, Premier Yitzhak Rabin declared in a television interview Friday night that the gravity of Scranton’s speech last Tuesday had not been reduced by the veto. “No speeches by William Scranton and no resolutions or declarations will alter the fact of Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem,” Rabin stated. “It will continue for generations.” He said that the U.S. cast its veto because Israel had reacted sharply to Scranton’s speech and the U.S. understood the significance of Israel’s protest. “The timing, the place, the style and the cumulative effect of Mr. Scranton’s statement were damaging,” Rabin asserted. Replying to a question the Premier said that Israel’s political and security considerations would continue to determine settlement policy in the administered territories. In an address Friday to academic circles of the National Religious Party, Rabin said he felt sorry that a mere statement of an American representative, now or in the future, can raise any question as to the Israeli attitude toward Jerusalem. A united Jerusalem is a part and the heart of Israel, Rabin said. “I sometimes wonder at the nervousness of the Israelis,” he said. “Who can influence the fate of Jerusalem? Jerusalem is in our hands. She was united after the Six-Day War and for me this is an unquestionable axiom.” His statement was greeted by prolonged applause. The Foreign Ministry. In an official statement Friday, also welcomed the U.S. veto but took strong exception to Scranton’s speech. objection to its contents. time and place. The statement reiterated that Jerusalem “undivided is Israel’s eternal capital” and that “secure and recognized borders” would be negotiated in a peace agreement. Israel, the statement asserted, was ready fur such negotiations “tomorrow.” KOLLEK RAPS ISRAELI GOVERNMENT Meanwhile, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said that Scranton’s speech seemed to prove that even “our friends, the last and only country which remained friendly to Israel,” do not accept Israel’s view on the Jerusalem issue. But he also castigated the Israeli government for its failure to stress that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish State. While noting that he was happy with the statements and declarations of the government regarding Jerusalem, he added that “those declarations are worthless, and statements will not build this city.” Kollek attacked the government for “moving” every Thursday to hold its meetings in Tel Aviv. He said it was incredible that there was not even one Hebrew-language newspaper whose main office is in Jerusalem. “The government treats Jerusalem as if it was no different than Haifa or Rehovot,” Kollek said. He also noted that the government showed no understanding in its treatment of the minorities and the Jewish population in Jerusalem. While a consensus remains “only when we talk of the fact that Jerusalem would remain united” there are “divergent opinions” regarding the rights Israel should give to the Arab population of East Jerusalem. “Each person in Jerusalem has the right to express himself,” Kollek said, “but there is a minority which thinks it can create facts by declarations and demonstrative activities.” This was an apparent reference to the group of young people who tried to pray on the Temple Mount despite the fact that it is forbidden by government regulations. “We will not succeed in turning any Arab into a Zionist or into someone who identifies and favors our cause in Jerusalem,” he declared. “Whoever thinks that is expecting the impossible.” He added that for a long time “we were walking around in a fool’s paradise. We saw the unification of Jerusalem as a resolved fact–for us and the rest of the world–and we behaved as if our force and power was above anything else.” HUSSEIN DUE IN WASHINGTON In a related development King Hussein of Jordan is due to arrive tomorrow in Washington for three days of talks with U.S. officials. During that time, he said on Jordanian television last night, he will explain positions, “clarify ambiguities and put facts forward.” His reference to ambiguities was taken to mean the contrast between Scranton’s speech and his subsequent veto. Meanwhile the Jordanian press condemned the U.S. veto but welcomed Scranton’s earlier criticism of Israel.

RABIN: SCRANTON’S SPEECH WAS DAMAGING Nevertheless, Premier Yitzhak Rabin declared in a television interview Friday night that the gravity of Scranton’s speech last Tuesday had not been reduced by the veto. “No speeches by William Scranton and no resolutions or declarations will alter the fact of Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem,” Rabin stated. “It will continue for generations.” He said that the U.S. cast its veto because Israel had reacted sharply to Scranton’s speech and the U.S. understood the significance of Israel’s protest. “The timing, the place, the style and the cumulative effect of Mr. Scranton’s statement were damaging,” Rabin asserted. Replying to a question the Premier said that Israel’s political and security considerations would continue to determine settlement policy in the administered territories. In an address Friday to academic circles of the National Religious Party, Rabin said he felt sorry that a mere statement of an American representative, now or in the future, can raise any question as to the Israeli attitude toward Jerusalem. A united Jerusalem is a part and the heart of Israel, Rabin said. “I sometimes wonder at the nervousness of the Israelis,” he said. “Who can influence the fate of Jerusalem? Jerusalem is in our hands. She was united after the Six-Day War and for me this is an unquestionable axiom.” His statement was greeted by prolonged applause. The Foreign Ministry. In an official statement Friday, also welcomed the U.S. veto but took strong exception to Scranton’s speech. objection to its contents. time and place. The statement reiterated that Jerusalem “undivided is Israel’s eternal capital” and that “secure and recognized borders” would be negotiated in a peace agreement. Israel, the statement asserted, was ready fur such negotiations “tomorrow.” KOLLEK RAPS ISRAELI GOVERNMENT Meanwhile, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said that Scranton’s speech seemed to prove that even “our friends, the last and only country which remained friendly to Israel,” do not accept Israel’s view on the Jerusalem issue. But he also castigated the Israeli government for its failure to stress that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish State. While noting that he was happy with the statements and declarations of the government regarding Jerusalem, he added that “those declarations are worthless, and statements will not build this city.” Kollek attacked the government for “moving” every Thursday to hold its meetings in Tel Aviv. He said it was incredible that there was not even one Hebrew-language newspaper whose main office is in Jerusalem. “The government treats Jerusalem as if it was no different than Haifa or Rehovot,” Kollek said. He also noted that the government showed no understanding in its treatment of the minorities and the Jewish population in Jerusalem. While a consensus remains “only when we talk of the fact that Jerusalem would remain united” there are “divergent opinions” regarding the rights Israel should give to the Arab population of East Jerusalem. “Each person in Jerusalem has the right to express himself,” Kollek said, “but there is a minority which thinks it can create facts by declarations and demonstrative activities.” This was an apparent reference to the group of young people who tried to pray on the Temple Mount despite the fact that it is forbidden by government regulations. “We will not succeed in turning any Arab into a Zionist or into someone who identifies and favors our cause in Jerusalem,” he declared. “Whoever thinks that is expecting the impossible.” He added that for a long time “we were walking around in a fool’s paradise. We saw the unification of Jerusalem as a resolved fact–for us and the rest of the world–and we behaved as if our force and power was above anything else.” HUSSEIN DUE IN WASHINGTON In a related development King Hussein of Jordan is due to arrive tomorrow in Washington for three days of talks with U.S. officials. During that time, he said on Jordanian television last night, he will explain positions, “clarify ambiguities and put facts forward.” His reference to ambiguities was taken to mean the contrast between Scranton’s speech and his subsequent veto. Meanwhile the Jordanian press condemned the U.S. veto but welcomed Scranton’s earlier criticism of Israel.

News article:
The United States veto last Thursday night of a United Nations Security Council resolution, which deplored Israeli policies in the administered territories and Jerusalem, failed to dissipate the anger and resentment following the speech last Tuesday by William Scranton, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, in which he charged that Jewish settlements in the territories. “Including East Jerusalem,” was an obstacle to successful Middle East negotiations. Anger, as well as concern was also expressed over the fact that 14 of the 15 Security Council members–including England, France. Sweden, Panama, Japan and Italy — voted for the resolution which deplored Israel’s “failure to put a stop to actions and policies tending to change the status” of Jerusalem and called on Israel to refrain from actions against Arab residents in the administered territories. The resolution also called on Israel “to respect and uphold the inviolability of the holy places which are under its occupation.” and to “desist from the expropriation of or encroachment upon Arab lands and property or the establishment of Israeli settlements thereon in the occupied Arab territories.” Observers here tended to agree with reported Arab assessments that the Security Council debate proved a success for the Arabs, despite the U.S. veto, because the U.S. had been totally isolated in its support for Israel. The observers pointed out that this was plainly an uncomfortable situation which Washington will not wish to see perpetuated. The Arab view observers noted was that Scranton’s speech last Tuesday was in the final analysis more significant than the veto because it underscored publicly, for the first time in many years, the vital differences between Washington and Jerusalem over a final settlement. HERZOG SUMMONED FOR CONSULTATIONS Ambassador Chaim Herzog, Israel’s envoy to the UN, has been summoned home for consultations concerning the debate last week and possible Arab attempts in the near future to exploit what is seen here as a weakening of U.S. support for Israel. There is also concern here about the U.S. Administration’s determined defense of its plans to sell six C-130 military transport planes to Egypt and Egypt’s additional requests to Washington for a great deal of more military hardware. Scranton, in vetoing the resolution which had been worked out by the Council’s Third World members in talks with Arab and Islamic representatives and those of the Communist bloc, declared that the resolution was unbalanced. He said it did not correspond to the reality of the situation in Israeli-administered territories and that it was wrong to charge that Israel intended to change the religious character of Jerusalem. He said that on the contrary. Israel’s administration of the holy places in Jerusalem “has literally and actively minimized tensions.” Scranton also stated that the U.S. was trying to “regain momentum in the negotiating process to reach peace in the Middle East,” and that the resolution “would not help” such efforts. VETO BY U.S. PRAISED Herzog praised the veto, noting that it was “an effort to stem attempts to convert the United Nations into an instrument of intransigent despotism and to turn the discussion on the Middle East away from one-sided fiction back to reality.” Similarly, Rabbi Alexander Schindler, chairman of the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations, who met with Scranton Thursday afternoon, prior to the vote on the resolution, welcomed the U.S. veto and praised Scranton. He said he found the envoy understanding of and sensitive to “the concerns of the American people for the security and dignity of Israel as an essential element of the just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Foreign Minister Yigal Allon, in an apparent effort to stem any deterioration in Israeli-U.S. relations, told newsmen on Friday after an hour-long meeting with U.S. Ambassador Malcolm Toon that “without the veto there certainly would have been a big crisis, a far-reaching crisis.

News article:
The United Nations Security Council adopted today a resolution unanimously condemning the Israel attack on Gaza as “a violation of the cease-fire provisions” and as “inconsistent with the obligations” of the Israel-Egyptian armistice agreement and the UN Charter. The resolution called upon Israel “to take all necessary measures to prevent such actions.” The resolution was adopted following statements made by the delegations of the major powers, including the Soviet Union. In their statements the representatives of the United States. Britain and France said that while Egypt must be held responsible for numerous acts of violence on the Israel frontier, the Western powers do not consider Israel’s retaliatory attack on Gaza justified. American delegate Henry Cabot Lodge referred to the 1950 Tripartite Declaration by the United States, Britain and France and to a public statement made by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that should these three powers find that any of the Middle East states was preparing to violate frontiers or armistice lines, the “Big Three” would immediately take action both within and outside the United Nations to prevent such a violation. ISRAEL AND ARABS URGED BY U.S. TO MAKE CONCESSIONS Declaring that the U.S. Government stands fully behind that declaration, Ambassador Lodge emphasized that Secretary Dulles also said in his statement that Israel should become part of the Middle East community and cease to look upon itself, or be looked upon by others, as alien to this community. “To achieve this,” Ambassador Lodge stated, “would require concessions on both sides.” It was because “the present unhappy situation in Palestine” must be viewed in its true perspective, Mr. Lodge observed, that he had referred at some length to the outlines of United States policy as set out almost two years ago by Secretary Dulles. During the two years since that statement, he stated, the United States, both inside and outside the United Nations, had sought consistently to follow these objectives and he felt that “much progress” had been made. There had been good reason to believe, Mr. Lodge continued, that with the “significant progress” already made, the time was not too distant when the intermittent fighting on the borders of Israel and the Arab states would become a thing of the past, “The U.S., of course, was not satisfied as long as any disturbances occurred between Israel and her neighbors, but it had been encouraged and hopeful that patience, understanding and a real desire to put an end to hostility were beginning to prevail. Into this comparatively hopeful situation, the terrible event at Gaza broke rudely,” Mr. Lodge declared. U.S. DELEGATE NOTES EGYPTIAN ATTACK ON PATISH SETTLEMENT New incidents had occurred since the Gaza attack, Mr. Lodge continued. Most recently at Patish, innocent persons had suffered. He expressed “our great sympathy” to the bereaved families. “One can for the present conjecture to the immediate casual connection,” Mr. Lodge said, speaking of these incidents. He noted that General E.L.M. Burns. UN truce supervisor had pointed out in his report that infiltration from Egyptian-controlled territory, while not the only cause of tension prior to the Gaza incident had undoubtedly been one of its main causes. “But the Gaza incident has caused tension to mount on both sides, and is all the more to be deplored because deliberate,” he said. The U.S. Government, said Ambassador Lodge, was aware that Israel contended that there had been causes for the attack and was also aware “that there have been provocations.” Such provocations, he felt, should not only always be regretted but should also be prevented by all responsible authorities. As a sponsor of the resolution before the Security Council, the United States believed that “whatever the provocation might have been in this case, there was no justification for the Israeli military action at Gaza,” Mr. Lodge declared. Three times previously, he recalled, the Security Council had made the point clear that Israel’s retaliatory actions were inconsistent with its Charter obligations, he recalled. Now the Security Council was faced with the fourth incident and the United States believed it was “most serious because of its obvious premeditation.” BRITAIN, FRANCE, SOVIET UNION EXPRESS VIEWS Sir Pierson Dixon, British delegate, also referred to the Egyptian attack on the Israel wedding party at the Patish settlement and called the incident an “outrage.” If proof were needed, he continued, that Egypt and Israel should make a further “and more determined” effort generally to improve conditions along this section of the demarcation line, and in particular to control infiltration, “we have it here,” he said. As to the Gaza incident, he said that in view of the evidence, the Security Council must agree that this was a deliberate and planned military operation. As such, it is viewed by my government with very grave concern indeed,” he added. Henri Hoppenot, the French delegate, reviewed the information presented to the Council on the Gaza incident, and said that no proof had been adduced to back up the assertion of Israel that Egyptian forces had penetrated into Israel territory and attacked first. The Gaza action, he said, appeared to be a military action, deliberately planned and carried out by regular Israeli forces, “for purposes of intimidation and reprisal.” Nothing cited by the representative of Israel, M. Hoppenot continued, could serve as “excuse or justification” for this action, which “deeply shocked the conscience of men of good will” and especially saddened those who admired the people of the young democracy. He hoped that Israel would recognize the full weight of the council’s resolution as “a last warning.” Soviet delegate Arkadi Sobolev declared that the statements of Israel, Egypt and Gen. Burns had indicated that Israel was responsible for the Gaza attack and that therefore the Council had to take action to censure Israel. At the same time, he accused the Western Powers of heightening tension by their pressing for a system of regional alliances. This point brought him into sharp disagreement with the representatives of the U.S., Britain and Turkey. The Council is scheduled to meet again tomorrow to consider action on the second resolution sponsored by the Big Three, calling for both parties to cooperate with Gen. Burns in reducing tension in the border zones. It is understood that Ambassador Abba Eban will meet tomorrow morning with the delegates of the U.S., France and Britain to attempt to get them to include several amendments in their resolution.

News article:
Problems concerning the tension between the Arab countries and Israel were discussed today at a secret session of the Near Eastern Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, No information was given out on the decisions taken at the meeting nor on the exchange of views that took place. Arthur Z. Gardiner, the State Department’s top advisor on Palestine affairs, reported on the Arab-Israel crisis. The State Department today continued to refrain from making any statement on the discussions now taking place between the United States, Britain and France on the next step to be taken jointly by the Big Three to ease the Arab-Israel tension. It is understood that the U.S. Government is delaying action on bringing the Israel-Jordan issue before the United Nations Security Council because Soviet delegate Andrei Vishinsky is the April chairman of the Security Council and might veto any constructive resolution. It was learned that pressure has been brought to bear on the Department not only by Israel but by the Arab League as well as the British for immediate UN action. Israel Minister Plenipotentiary Reuven Shiloah returned to Israel today for consultations at the Foreign Office in connection with the current crisis. (Despite the heightened tension between Israel and Jordan, particularly in the Jerusalem area, the regular Israeli fortnightly relief and supply convoy made its way through the Arab Legion lines to the Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital grounds atop Mt. Scopus in Jerusalem late yesterday.)

News article:
The U.N. Security Council today voted in favor of the two American resolutions urging the convocation of a special session of the General Assembly to reconsider its Palestine partition decision and to call for an Arab-Jewish truce in Palestine. The resolution for the truce was adopted unanimously by the 11 members of the Council. The resolution for a special session was adopted by a vote of 9 in favor and two abstaining. The abstentions were recorded by the Soviet Union and the Ukraine. The special Assembly will open on April 16. Prior to the voting on the resolutions, British delegate Sir Alexander Cadogan announced that he had received instructions from his government to support the two U.S. proposals. At the same time, he declared that Britain will definitely terminate the Palestine Mandate by May 15 and will adhere to its original evacuation timetable. This was the first time since the Palestine question was placed before the U.N. that the British Government has abandoned its position of “neutrality” or abstention from voting on decisions concerning Palestine. In making his announcement, Sir Alexander emphasized that there could be no question of Britain continuing its administrative authority in Palestine after May 15. SHERTOK PLEADS AGAINST TRUSTEESHIP; WANTS U.N. AUTHORITY TO SUPERVISE TRUCE Moshe Shertok, presenting the views of the Jewish Agency on the American resolutions in an impassioned plea to the Council, spoke against trusteeship and for the continuation of U.N. plans to implement the partition decision. He also emphasized that if a truce is achieved in Palestine, there must be an international authority to maintain and supervise it. The U.S. proposal for a truce, he printed out, was “misleading” since it presented a distorted picture of the situation in Palestine by giving the impression that it was a purely local matter and that both sides were actually at fault. He said that 7,500 armed Arabs invaded Palestine from neighboring countries and that they are the main threat to law and order in the country. Without these incursions from the Arab states, which are members of the United Nations, he declared, there would be no crisis and the problem of partition would have been easily resolved. He asked whether it was proper for the Council not to take steps to condemn, suppress or even report such acts of aggression. The evidence, he said, was too overwhelming that Syria and Egypt were financing expeditions into Palestine while the Lebanese Parliament was openly voting appropriations to supply arms and men for the Palestine conflict. Referring to the U.S. proposal for an Arab-Jewish truce, Shertok said that the truce had to be regarded as a step in the implementation, of partition. It must ##ipulate the evacuation of the foreign armed Arabs from Palestine and the prevention further incursions. There must be no “political reward” for violence or for durance of a U.N. decision, he stated.Temporary trusteeship for Palestine, Shertok argued, would only aggravate be situation, unless it were tied to a definite political solution. He emphasized that the Jews and the Arabs were ready for independence and any trusteeship plan would any, or at least delay, that independence. The American proposal, he added, was “a ?ap into perils unknown” without assurance of cooperation or of means of carrying ?rt trusteeship, at a time when much effort had gone into charting the path to partition JERUSALEM MAY BECOME A “SHAMBLES,” SHERTOK WARNS; URGES U.N. ACTION In a climax which evoked applause from the audience, Shertok pleaded that is not yet too late to implement the U.N. partition decision. He concluded by speaking of the perils now facing Jerusalem, a city with a Jewish majority which, he said, the Mandatory Power is letting fall into the hands of Arab fanatics. Notorious henchmen of the Mufti, he said, were engaged in an attempt to cut off food and water from the Jews in Jerusalem and to harass and kill them. Warning that Jerusalem was in danger of becoming a battlefield, even a ?shambles,”1 Shertok emphasized that it was the responsibility of the United Nations at least to enforce peace and order in this city “so important to all mankind,” If the U.N. will not assume this responsibility, it will fall to the Jews to do their utmost to save the city, he declared. U.S. WILL PRESENT DETAILS OF TRUSTEESHIP PLAN ON MONDAY Following the vote by the Council favoring the American resolutions, U.S. delegate Warren Austin invited all of the Council members to meet in the office of his delegation on Monday afternoon to consider the U.S. proposal for a temporary U.N. trusteeship over Palestine. Soviet delegate Andrei Gromyko declared that the Council is not empowered to order the U.N. Palestine Commission to suspend its activities. The Soviet Union, he said, supported the American truce resolution, but believes that the Palestine Commission must continue its work on the basis of the powers granted it by the Assembly, and only the Assembly can revoke these powers. Dr. Abba Hillel Silver and Shertok insisted after today’s dramatic events that the formation of the Jewish State would go on.

News article:
Major General Carl C. von Horn, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, told the Security Council here today that Israel’s 11-year-old boycott of the Syrian-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission has “greatly weakened” his authority and is “inconsistent” with the objectives of the Syrian-Israel Armistice Agreement of 1949. He cited a Council resolution, adopted in 1951, to bolster his accusation. Israel has been boycotting the Mixed Armistice Commission since 1951. General von Horn’s statement on the MAC was part of a supplementary report on the current Syrian-Israeli situation, in which he replied in writing to questions asked of him at yesterday’s Council session dealing with the Israeli and Syrian charges and counter-charges of aggression. In his answers, he also accused both Syria and Israel of denying “freedom of movement” to the UN military observers in the demilitarized zone along the Lake Tiberias shore opposite Israel. The Council, which met today for the purpose of hearing General von Horn’s replies to specific queries, adjourned after a 20-minute session and will reconvene tomorrow morning after all participants have had the opportunity to study the UNTSO chief’s supplementary report. ISRAEL PLACES DRAFT RESOLUTION BEFORE SECURITY COUNCIL Meanwhile, as the session opened, Israel placed formally before the Council a draft resolution, which would express the Council’s “grave concern” over “the attacks by Syrian armed forces against citizens and territory of Israel.” In presenting the document formally, Michael S. Comay, chairman of the Israel Delegation here, had altered the draft somewhat from a proposal for a resolution which he placed before the Council yesterday as a “tentative suggestion.” In yesterday’s version Mr. Comay had asked the Council to “condemn” Syria instead of merely voicing “grave concern.” The rest of the Israeli draft, however, is harsher than the previous suggestions. The draft would have the Council not only express “grave concern” but would also call upon Syria to abide fully by all the provisions of the General Armistice Agreement, and in particular, to prevent all illegal crossings from Syrian territory, to cease all interference with Israel activities on Lake Tiberias, and to desist from firing into Israel territory. No member of the Council today made any comment whatever, publicly, either about the Israel resolution or about the Von Horn report. While a large section of General von Horn’s new statement concerned itself with the Mixed Armistice Commission, he also made these points: “No fortified position” on the Syrian side where Israel’s military forces staged the March 17 raid which preceded the current Syrian and Israeli complaints, was seen by the UN military observers as “existing or destroyed.”

A 15-year-old Palestinian died from Israeli gunfire during nighttime skirmishes along the Israel-Gaza border, the Strip's Health Ministry said. Saif A-Din Abu Zaied was wounded in the head Wednesday and died at a hospital, the ministry said early Thursday. The circumstances were not immediately known, but the incident occurred as dozens of youths engaged in “nighttime confusion,” a more violent form of protests involving firebombs and laser lights directed at Israeli forces along the border fence.

Israeli warplanes fired six missiles aimed at military facilities belonging to the Hamas movement and the Islamic Jihad in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, Al-Quds Radio reported, quoting security officials and eyewitnesses. The Israeli military confirmed on Twitter that "fighter jets and aircraft struck several military targets in a Hamas compound in Gaza." No injuries were reported, but the facilities were destroyed and nearby houses were also damaged, Al-Quds said. The IDF added that it held Hamas accountable for the cross-border attacks, which it said hit an empty area in southern Israel. No damage or injuries were reported and no one had yet claimed responsibility for firing the rocket. Every night since February, Palestinian young men known as the "night disturbance unit" have been gathering by the border with Israel as part of the "Marches of Return" protests, which began in late March last year. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have taken part in the demonstrations, demanding Palestinians be allowed to return to what is now Israel. At the end of February, UN investigators said there is evidence pointing to crimes against humanity by Israeli security forces who shot, injured and killed Palestinians during the massive protests last year. A UN Commission of Inquiry consisting of independent human rights experts counted 189 killed and estimated more than 9,000 injured Palestinians. Other counts put the number of Palestinian victims at 260 and the injured in excess of 26,000. One Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper and four others were injured during the demonstrations, the UN report said. The experts acknowledged that some demonstrators were members of armed groups and that the protest organizers, which included militants from the Hamas movement, encouraged the use of incendiary kites and balloons, causing extensive damage and fear in southern Israel. However, it only found two incidents, one in May and one in October, when Israeli forces actually faced imminent threats to their lives and were therefore within their rights in using live ammunition. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the report, saying that it "is setting new records of hypocrisy and lies, out of an obsessive hatred of Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East."

About 190 Palestinians have been killed during the protests. A United Nations independent commission of inquiry recently published its preliminary report stating that it had collected evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Israel which has used lethal military force against unarmed protesters. “[Israeli forces] have intentionally shot children, they’ve intentionally shot people with disabilities, they’ve intentionally shot journalists, knowing them to be children, people with disabilities and journalists,” Sara Hossain, one of the investigators appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, said. The report calls for the individuals responsible to face international sanctions and arrest. “Israeli forces caused permanent disabilities to many of the 940 children shot during the demonstrations,” the UN report states. Five Palestinian children have died after being struck by tear gas canisters since the start of 2018, according to Defense for Children International Palestine. Israel killed 60 Palestinian children in 2018. Targeting journalists and media organizations Israel also targets journalists during the protests, but its war on Palestinian media continues outside that context as well. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the Hamas-affiliated al-Aqsa TV channel a “terrorist organization” on Wednesday. Al Mezan, a human rights group based in Gaza, condemned Netanyahu’s decision as “a dangerous precedent.” “Occupation forces target journalists, employees of the press and media institutions systematically,” Al Mezan stated. Israeli forces have killed 18 journalists or media workers since the start of the second intifada in 2000, according to Al Mezan. The Israeli military has attacked 32 media organizations as well. This includes bombing al-Aqsa TV buildings and killing its journalists in Gaza. In November, an Israeli airstrike targeted the headquarters of al-Aqsa TV, which is located in a heavily populated area of Gaza City. The Committee to Protect Journalists has rejected Israel’s assertions that al-Aqsa TV’s links with Hamas make it a legitimate military target. This claim “has no basis in international law,” CPJ stated. “Journalists, like all civilians, only lose their protected status if they directly take part in hostilities.” Al Mezan warned that Israel’s designation of al-Aqsa TV as a “terrorist” organization could escalate Israel’s attacks on Palestinian journalists and media. Israeli forces have killed two Palestinian journalists covering the Great March of Return protests and injured many others. An Israeli sniper fatally wounded journalist Yaser Murtaja, who was wearing a flak jacket marked with the word PRESS on 6 April last year. A week later journalist Ahmad Abu Hussein died of injuries sustained while covering protests. In December, photographer Mohammed Asad, a regular contributor to The Electronic Intifada, narrowly escaped a similar fate. The fragment of a bullet fired by an Israeli sniper destroyed his camera but left him physically unscathed. But that same bullet had hit 16-year-old Muhammad al-Jahjouh in the neck, killing him.

For nearly a year Palestinian protesters have been gathering along the Gaza border calling for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to be allowed to return to former homes now inside Israel | AFP Gaza- Asharq Al-Awsat A Palestinian wounded last month during clashes on the Gaza border succumbed to his wounds on Monday, the health ministry in the Palestinian enclave said. A spokesman for the ministry said in a statement "Bissam Safi, 22, died this morning". He said he had been hit in the head with a tear gas canister on February 22 during the March of Return protest on the Gaza border near Khan Younis on February 22. For nearly a year protesters have been gathering along the border calling for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to be allowed to return to former homes now inside Israel. Israeli officials say that amounts to calling for the Jewish state's destruction and accuse the Gaza Strip's rulers Hamas of orchestrating the protests.

A Palestinian man wounded by Israeli security forces in clashes along the Gaza border last month succumbed to his injuries on Monday, the enclave’s health ministry said. Bassem Osman Safi, 22, died from his wounds after being injured during a weekly border protest east of Khan Younis on February 22, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said on Twitter. Reports in Palestinian media said Safi was hit in the head with a tear gas canister. The restive Gaza border has seen increasingly intense bouts of violence in recent days, with Israel carrying out airstrikes in response to explosives tied to balloons launched from the Palestinian territory. Amid the heightened tensions, the southern town of Netivot planned to test its air raid sirens at 10:05 on Monday morning. Residents of the area were told that in the case of an actual attack the alarm system would sound twice. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Also on Monday, a suspicious object tied to a cluster of balloons was found in the Eshkol region in southern Israel. A day earlier, Israeli jets bombed Hamas targets in Gaza after Palestinian terrorists in Gaza fired a mortar shell at Eshkol. The army said the early-morning strikes were in response to the mortar attack the previous night, as well as “continuing terror activities from the Strip, including balloon explosives and causing harm to security infrastructure in the last several days.” As tensions between the sides continue to simmer, Gazans have also been launching balloon-borne bombs at Israel and firing small arms across the border, along with holding near-daily protests and riots at the fence, in which fire bombs are thrown at troops and Palestinians attempt to damage the barriers, according to the army. Advertisement Israel has carried out perfunctory air raids after each balloon or mortar attack, usually hitting empty military posts maintained by the Hamas terror group, which is the de facto ruler in the Strip. The uptick of violence comes after several months of relative calm thanks to a hard-won ceasefire brokered by Egypt. Egypt and other mediators have been working intensively in recent weeks to broker a new ceasefire agreement between the two sides, but thus far to no avail. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Hamas that Israel would not hesitate to launch a large-scale military operation in Gaza, vowing his government would do whatever necessary to restore calm to southern communities. At the start to the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu warned Hamas that it should not assume that Israel would not respond to the recent attacks because of Israel’s approaching elections. “I heard people from Gaza saying that since we are in an election campaign a wide-ranging operation is out of the question,” he said. “I suggest to Hamas – don’t count on it. We will do everything necessary to restore security and quiet to the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and to the south in general.” Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report.

A Palestinian protester waves a flag near burning tyres during clashes with Israeli forces after a demonstration at the border with Israel, east of Gaza City A Palestinian was killed and more than 40 others wounded by Israeli fire Friday in renewed protests and clashes along the Gaza border, the enclave's health ministry said. Tamer Arafat, 23, died from his wounds after being shot in the head, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said. Qudra said earlier that overall at least 42 Palestinians had been wounded by Israeli gunfire during the 50th week of demonstrations. Four medics were among those hurt, the ministry said. An Israeli army spokesman said "approximately 8,400 demonstrators and rioters are currently gathered in a number of locations along the Gaza Strip security fence". "They have hurled explosive devices and rocks at the security fence and soldiers, and have also ignited tyres," the spokesman said. Troops responded according to "standard operating procedures", he added. The Israeli military on Friday evening reported the launch of a projectile from the Gaza Strip into its territory. Protests and clashes began along the Gaza border on March 30 last year. Demonstrators have been calling for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to be allowed to return to former homes now inside Israel, which Israeli officials say is akin to calling for the Jewish state's destruction. Israel accuses Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas of using the demonstrations as cover for infiltrations and attacks, while rights groups and Palestinians say protesters posing little threat have been shot by Israeli snipers. At least 253 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since March 2018, the majority shot during weekly border protests and others hit by tank fire or air strikes in response to violence from Gaza. Two Israeli soldiers have been killed over the same period. Israel and Hamas, which has controlled the blockaded Gaza Strip for over a decade, have fought three wars since 2008. There has been an increase in violence over the past week as Israel has repeatedly struck Hamas positions in response to what it said were balloon-borne "explosive devices" floated across the border.

GAZA CITY, Palestinian Territories: Two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in renewed clashes along the Gaza border on Friday, the health ministry in the enclave said. The clashes took place a week before the first anniversary of the weekly protests, when organisers have pledged larger than usual demonstrations. Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra told AFP the two men, aged 18 and 29, were shot in separate incidents along the fractious border. The teenager was shot in the head east of Gaza City, while the older man was hit in the chest near the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, Qudra told AFP. He did not name them but said at least 55 other people were shot. The Israeli army did not comment on the deaths but said "approximately 9,500 rioters and demonstrators" gathered in various locations, "hurling explosive devices, hard objects and rocks" at troops. Troops were "firing in accordance with standard operating procedures," a spokeswoman said. At least 257 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in Gaza since protests began on March 30 2018. Most have been killed during protests, though others have died in airstrikes and by tank fire. Two Israeli soldiers have been killed. The often violent protests are demanding Palestinian refugees and their descendants be allowed to return to former homes now inside Israel.

News article:
A Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip early Sunday, authorities in the territory said, during overnight riots that also saw many explosive devices hurled at IDF troops across the border fence. The 24-year-old man was fatally shot in the chest and two others were wounded, the Hamas-run health ministry said. There was no immediate comment or confirmation by the army. Also during the night, Israeli military aircraft bombed Hamas targets in Gaza after a rocket alarm sounded in some Israeli communities bordering the strip, triggered by an improvised bomb thrown at the border. The Israel Defense Forces said aircraft struck two Hamas reconnaissance posts in response to “the multitude of explosive devices that were thrown and exploded during the night.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Nighttime riots in Gaza have been led by so-called “confusion units” organized by the Hamas terror group, the Strip’s de facto ruler. On Saturday, the units said they would step up activities, with a week of nightly riots from 7 p.m. until dawn along the border and more airborne incendiary devices launched into Israel. It said the move was in response to the deaths of two Palestinians shot by troops during border riots Friday. During the nightly demonstrations, participants regularly set off loud explosives or sounds grenades, burn tires and throw rocks at Israeli troops on the other side of the security fence. Israeli soldiers typically respond with tear gas and, in some cases, live fire. Advertisement On Saturday, Israeli military aircraft launched a pair of strikes at Palestinian cells flying incendiary balloons from the southern Gaza Strip into Israel, the army said. Four Palestinians were injured in the strikes. On Friday, several thousand Palestinians took part in violent protests on the Gaza-Israel border, throwing explosive devices and rocks at Israeli soldiers who responded with tear gas and occasional live fire. Recent weeks have seen an uptick of incendiary balloons launched from the coastal enclave, after a drop-off in attacks following an unofficial truce between Israel and Hamas in November. The launch of incendiary and explosive devices into Israel tied to kites and helium-filled balloons became a common tactic in violent protests along the Gaza border over the past year, burning thousands of acres of farmland and nature reserves, and killing livestock and other animals. There are fears that violence will ramp up this week, with Hamas hoping to draw hundreds of thousands of rioters to the fence at the weekend to mark a year of so-called March of Return protests.

A Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip early Sunday, authorities in the territory said, during overnight riots that also saw many explosive devices hurled at IDF troops across the border fence. The 24-year-old man was fatally shot in the chest and two others were wounded, the Hamas-run health ministry said. There was no immediate comment or confirmation by the army. Also during the night, Israeli military aircraft bombed Hamas targets in Gaza after a rocket alarm sounded in some Israeli communities bordering the strip, triggered by an improvised bomb thrown at the border. The Israel Defense Forces said aircraft struck two Hamas reconnaissance posts in response to “the multitude of explosive devices that were thrown and exploded during the night.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Nighttime riots in Gaza have been led by so-called “confusion units” organized by the Hamas terror group, the Strip’s de facto ruler. On Saturday, the units said they would step up activities, with a week of nightly riots from 7 p.m. until dawn along the border and more airborne incendiary devices launched into Israel. It said the move was in response to the deaths of two Palestinians shot by troops during border riots Friday. During the nightly demonstrations, participants regularly set off loud explosives or sounds grenades, burn tires and throw rocks at Israeli troops on the other side of the security fence. Israeli soldiers typically respond with tear gas and, in some cases, live fire. Advertisement On Saturday, Israeli military aircraft launched a pair of strikes at Palestinian cells flying incendiary balloons from the southern Gaza Strip into Israel, the army said. Four Palestinians were injured in the strikes. On Friday, several thousand Palestinians took part in violent protests on the Gaza-Israel border, throwing explosive devices and rocks at Israeli soldiers who responded with tear gas and occasional live fire. Recent weeks have seen an uptick of incendiary balloons launched from the coastal enclave, after a drop-off in attacks following an unofficial truce between Israel and Hamas in November. The launch of incendiary and explosive devices into Israel tied to kites and helium-filled balloons became a common tactic in violent protests along the Gaza border over the past year, burning thousands of acres of farmland and nature reserves, and killing livestock and other animals. There are fears that violence will ramp up this week, with Hamas hoping to draw hundreds of thousands of rioters to the fence at the weekend to mark a year of so-called March of Return protests. Israel says the demonstrations are orchestrated by Hamas, which vocally supports them, sending free buses to the border and providing food and internet to participants — as well as money for those injured in them — in order to provide a cover for the organization’s nefarious activities along the security fence, including infiltration attempts, the planting of explosives and attacks on Israeli soldiers.

Additionally, on Friday evening, Israeli forces fired two shells at a building in Juhr ad-Deek area southeast of Gaza City, causing damage to the building. updated from: 800 Palestinians protest at Gaza border; two shot in the legs as Israel amasses tanks Mar 29, 2019 @ 22:56 Two Palestinians were moderately injured by Israeli gunfire Friday at protests on the eastern border of the Gaza Strip. The protests were smaller than the usual weekly protests have been, as Palestinians in Gaza gear up for major protests on Saturday to commemorate the 43rd Palestinian Land Day. It was Land Day 2018 that sparked the weekly protest movement known as the Great March of Return, which has taken place every week since March 30, 2018, and has resulted in the deaths of nearly 200 Palestinian protesters shot by Israeli sharpshooters, and the serious injuries of more than 11,000, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. Friday’s protests took place in four locations along the eastern border of Gaza, with Israeli tanks and troops lined up on the other side of the border. The troops and tanks have been amassing there since Monday, apparently planning for a land invasion of Gaza to accompany the airstrikes that have been ongoing all week, and have destroyed at least thirty buildings, including high rise apartment and office buildings. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two Palestinians were moderately wounded in their legs with live gunfire from Israeli snipers. The injuries took place at the protest east of Jabaliya, in the northern part of the West Bank. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from all over Gaza are expected to participate in the Land Day protests on Saturday, and Palestinian leaders have urged the Israeli military to show restraint and to stop their practice of indiscriminately firing live ammunition toward the unarmed protesters, as they have done every week since the protests began one year ago.

Gaza health officials said Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man near the perimeter fence with Israel early Saturday, hours before a planned mass rally to mark the annual Palestinian Land Day and the one-year anniversary of the start of weekly March of Return border protests. Gaza sources said he was a member of a group that has repeatedly burned tires and detonated explosives at the fence. Israel said there were riots at the border at the time. The fatal shooting raised tensions at a time when Egyptian mediators, shuttling between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers, are trying to broker a cease-fire deal that reportedly also includes proposed arrangements for preventing violence during Saturday’s protest. Early Saturday, Mohammed Saad, 21, was killed by Israeli army fire east of Gaza City near the perimeter fence, Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry said, adding he was hit by shrapnel in the head. A Gaza hospital worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media, said Saad was a member of the so-called “night disturbance unit.” Such groups routinely burn tires, flash laser lights and detonate explosives near the fence at night to distract soldiers and disturb residents of nearby Israeli communities.

The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza announced Saturday morning that it had completed preparations for the planned protests, with hospitals and ambulances on stand-by ahead of the demonstrations. Field hospitals have been set up at various points, and medical facilities in the Strip are on an emergency footing. Meanwhile, Israel has been warning Palestinians against approaching or breaching the security fence during Saturday’s border protest. Through phone calls, messages, public statements and pamphlets dropped from aircraft, the IDF has told Palestinians in the Strip that any attempts to break through the border fence will be met with live fire. Advertisement The IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman on Saturday appealed directly to Gazans, saying benefits could be in store if they refrain from violence. “According to Palestinian reports, if you don’t act violently or with terror today, significant measures will be implemented that can improve a variety of civilian fields in the Gaza Strip,” Avichay Adraee wrote on Facebook. The Israeli military’s primary concern in these March of Return protests is that large groups of people will break through the fence, armed with guns, grenades and knives, and either enter one of the Israeli communities located a few hundred meters from the border and attack those inside, or kidnap soldiers stationed along the security fence. Palestinian Land Day marks a 1976 decision by the Israeli government to seize thousands of dunams (acres) of Arab-owned land in the Galilee region of northern Israel. This year’s Land Day also marks a year since the start of weekly violent protests along the Israel-Gaza border, known as the “March of Return,” which at times have escalated into full-blown exchanges of fire between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in the coastal enclave, most recently earlier this week. Israel maintains that the Hamas terror group appropriated the campaign for nefarious purposes, using the civilian protesters as cover for violent military activities. Demonstrations are expected to peak on Saturday afternoon, with tens of thousands potentially taking part. Advertisement The timing of the anniversary rally is sensitive for both sides. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also serves as defense minister, is seeking his fourth consecutive term in April 9 elections, but is facing a serious challenge from a group of ex-army chiefs who have criticized what they say is his failed Gaza policy. He is also coming under attack over his policies from members of his coalition, including Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who has repeatedly called for wider military action in the enclave. Hamas, meanwhile, faces growing unrest in Gaza, as a result of worsening humanitarian conditions. Late Friday night, Hamas officials announced that a deal had been reached that would see the protesters refrain from approaching the border fence, in exchange for Israeli concessions. But there was no confirmation from Israel and it was unclear to what extent Hamas can control the protesters. While demonstrations have taken place at least weekly since March last year, Hamas has been building up the anniversary protests for several months. According to reports, Hamas is planning a mass transportation operation for Saturday, picking up protesters from 38 locations in the enclave and shuttling them to five sites along the border. The group’s leader Ismail Haniya has called for a million people to gather across five protest sites, and mosques in Gaza late Friday used loudspeakers to encourage a mass turnout. Advertisement Egypt has repeatedly tried to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, stepping up efforts in recent days after a Gaza rocket struck a house in central Israel earlier this week, injuring seven Israelis and threatening renewed escalation. Palestinians with knowledge of the talks have said that as part of the proposed deal, Gaza protesters were to keep away from the fence Saturday and Israeli troops were to hold their fire. Under the Egyptian plan, Israel was to offer economic incentives for Gaza in exchange for calm, according to Palestinian officials. On Saturday morning, Israeli troops arrested two Palestinian minors armed with knives attempting to breach the Gaza border fence, according to Ynet news site. The teens were questioned and returned to the Strip. Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report.

Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter Israeli military said the protesters hurled stones and explosive devices at the fence and set tires ablaze. The military added that they use crowd dispersal measures, including live fire and tear gas, to keep the rioters away from the border fence. Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said the day had "lots of rioters but significantly less violence", adding that it showed Hamas was able to stop violence when it wanted to.

"We are monitoring every crime Netanyahu commits and we will make every effort to defend our people." Sinwar added. "Our nation proves that it adheres to its principles and to the right of return no matter what."

(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) GAZA, March 30 (KUNA) -- At least three Palestinians were killed and 316 others injured by the Israeli fire on Saturday at Gaza border during demonstrations commemorating the 43rd anniversary of the Land Day. Tamer Hashem Aboul-Kheir, 17, was martyred as he was shot in the chest by the Israeli occupation forces in eastern Khan Yunis, Palestinian Health Ministry's spokesman Ashraf Al-Qedra said in a press statement.

News article:
By Nidal al-Mughrabi GAZA, March 30 (Reuters) - Israeli fire killed a Palestinian man near the Gaza border on Saturday, Palestinian Health officials said, as Israel's forces massed at the frontier ahead of a rally to mark the first anniversary of a surge of Gaza border protests. The Israeli military said it had not heard of any such incident. Palestinian medics said the man was killed by bullet shrapnel before dawn at a site of frequent night protests near the border. On Friday night, the Israeli military said Palestinians were throwing explosive devices at the border fence. Tensions have mounted along the Israel-Gaza border this week ahead of the commemoration of the 'Great March of Return' border protests, which began on March 30 last year. Fighting flared when a Palestinian rocket attack from Gaza wounded seven Israelis in a village north of Tel Aviv on Monday. In response, Israel launched a wave of air strikes and moved armour and reinforcements to the border. The Israeli forces remained at the border area on Saturday and the military said it was expecting "violent riots" to take place and was prepared for escalation. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were expected to attend the protests, which have turned deadly in the past, and Egyptian mediators were working to avoid further bloodshed. Leaders of Gazan armed groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said that progress had been made in the truce talks. LETHAL FORCE About 200 Gazans have been killed by Israeli troops since the protests started, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures, and an Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper. The demonstrations have turned into a standoff between Gazans hurling rocks and explosives and Israeli troops across the border. Palestinians have also launched incendiary balloons and kites into Israel and breached the Israeli frontier fence. Israel's use of lethal force has drawn censure from the United Nations and rights groups. U.N. investigators said last week that Israeli forces may be guilty of war crimes for using excessive force. Israel says it has no choice but to use deadly force at the protests to prevent militants from breaching the border fence and attacking civilian communities in the area. The protesters are calling for the lifting of a security blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt, and for Palestinians to have the right to return to land from which their families fled or were forced to flee during Israel's founding in 1948. More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the narrow coastal enclave where poverty and unemployment rates are high. The Isla mist Hamas group rules the territory and has fought three wars with Israel in the past decade. The blockade is cited by humanitarian agencies as a key reason for impoverishment in Gaza. Israel seized Gaza in a 1967 war and pulled out its troops in 2005. The security blockade, it says, is necessary in order to stop weapons from reaching Hamas and other armed groups which have fired thousands of rockets into Israel.

News article:
By Nidal al-Mughrabi GAZA, March 30 (Reuters) - Israeli fire killed a Palestinian man near the Gaza border on Saturday, Palestinian Health officials said, as Israel's forces massed at the frontier ahead of a rally to mark the first anniversary of a surge of Gaza border protests. The Israeli military said it had not heard of any such incident. Palestinian medics said the man was killed by bullet shrapnel before dawn at a site of frequent night protests near the border. On Friday night, the Israeli military said Palestinians were throwing explosive devices at the border fence. Tensions have mounted along the Israel-Gaza border this week ahead of the commemoration of the 'Great March of Return' border protests, which began on March 30 last year. Fighting flared when a Palestinian rocket attack from Gaza wounded seven Israelis in a village north of Tel Aviv on Monday. In response, Israel launched a wave of air strikes and moved armour and reinforcements to the border. The Israeli forces remained at the border area on Saturday and the military said it was expecting "violent riots" to take place and was prepared for escalation. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were expected to attend the protests, which have turned deadly in the past, and Egyptian mediators were working to avoid further bloodshed. Leaders of Gazan armed groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said that progress had been made in the truce talks. LETHAL FORCE About 200 Gazans have been killed by Israeli troops since the protests started, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures, and an Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper. The demonstrations have turned into a standoff between Gazans hurling rocks and explosives and Israeli troops across the border. Palestinians have also launched incendiary balloons and kites into Israel and breached the Israeli frontier fence. Israel's use of lethal force has drawn censure from the United Nations and rights groups. U.N. investigators said last week that Israeli forces may be guilty of war crimes for using excessive force. Israel says it has no choice but to use deadly force at the protests to prevent militants from breaching the border fence and attacking civilian communities in the area. The protesters are calling for the lifting of a security blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt, and for Palestinians to have the right to return to land from which their families fled or were forced to flee during Israel's founding in 1948. More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the narrow coastal enclave where poverty and unemployment rates are high. The Isla mist Hamas group rules the territory and has fought three wars with Israel in the past decade. The blockade is cited by humanitarian agencies as a key reason for impoverishment in Gaza. Israel seized Gaza in a 1967 war and pulled out its troops in 2005. The security blockade, it says, is necessary in order to stop weapons from reaching Hamas and other armed groups which have fired thousands of rockets into Israel.

A Palestinian man has succumbed to wounds sustained during riots and protests at the Israel-Gaza border last Saturday, the enclave’s Hamas-run health ministry said Tuesday. Fares Hajres, 26, was reportedly shot in the stomach by Israeli troops in the border area near Khan Yunis, the ministry said. Hajres is the fifth Gazan said to die from wounds sustained in clashes at the border over the weekend, amid Saturday afternoon rallies that drew some 40,000 Palestinians to the border to mark a year since the weekly protests billed “March of Return” began. According to Gazan officials, three of those killed were aged 17 and took part in the protests. Another Gazan died on Saturday from wounds sustained in a border clash earlier that morning, before the main protests began in the afternoon. The man was reportedly shot as he approached the border fence as part of an overnight protest. At least 300 were injured Saturday. Most of those hurt were lightly injured, but three were said at the time to have suffered critical injuries.

The Israeli army said that while soldiers were forced to respond with “riot dispersal means” and live fire in accordance with Israel Defense Forces regulations at times, most Palestinians attending the anniversary protests remained at a distance from the border. Advertisement IDF spokesman Ronen Manelis said Hamas had “operated with restraint not seen in the past year.” He said Israeli forces had observed hundreds of Hamas members wearing orange vests spread out between the crowd and the fence, preventing the masses from rushing toward the border. In the past, Israel has accused Hamas of encouraging the protests and using them as cover to carry out attacks on Israeli troops stationed along the frontier. Previous demonstrations have seen dozens of deaths.

A Palestinian demonstrator was critically wounded Friday by live Israeli fire in border protests east of Gaza City, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Some 10,500 Palestinians gathered along the border, marching and throwing stones. The ministry also reported that 63 demonstrators were wounded, some by live fire. This protests one day after the organizing committee behind the weeky demonstrations said they would freeze some of its activities and work to prevent mass gatherings near the border during Friday's march, as Egypt negotiates a long-term calm. Committee member Talal Abu Zarifa told Haaretz that organizers decided to support the Egyptian mediation efforts for implementing understandings between Israel and Hamas. "We've made it clear on several occasions that the intensity of the protest will depend on the implementation" of the agreements, which include easing some of the restrictions Israel imposes on Gaza, he said. >>Israel goes easy on Hamas, harder on Abbas | Analysis ■ While Palestinians gathered on Israel-Gaza border, Arab world looked away ■ Israel's concessions to Hamas are just the prelude | Analysis "We have no interest in young men coming close to the fence to be killed by sniper bullets," he said. "We want to secure achievements that will cost as little blood and victims as possible, and so as long as there's progress in the negotiations and implementation on the ground, we have no interest in escalation," Zarifa added. Israel expanded the approved fishing zone for Gazans to 15 nautical miles (equivalent to 28.8 kilometers from the shoreline) on Monday, the military said. This is the maximum fishing range allowed in the Gaza Strip since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Fishermen in Gaza say the 15-mile range is partial, only applying to waters off the southern part of the Strip. Last Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of the March of Return in which three 17-year-old demonstrators died after being shot by live Israeli fire, Gaza's Health Ministry said. Adham Amara died after he was shot in the face. Tamer Abu Al-Kheir and Bilal Al-Najar died after being shot in a protest east of Khan Younes. Tens of thousands of Palestinian protestors had gathered along the border and the Health Ministry in Gaza reported that over 300 people were wounded and referred to hospitals. At least 60 people were wounded by live Israeli fire, five of them are in critical condition and nine are in serious condition.

"We've made it clear on several occasions that the intensity of the protest will depend on the implementation" of the agreements, which include easing some of the restrictions Israel imposes on Gaza, he said. >>Israel goes easy on Hamas, harder on Abbas | Analysis ■ While Palestinians gathered on Israel-Gaza border, Arab world looked away ■ Israel's concessions to Hamas are just the prelude | Analysis "We have no interest in young men coming close to the fence to be killed by sniper bullets," he said. "We want to secure achievements that will cost as little blood and victims as possible, and so as long as there's progress in the negotiations and implementation on the ground, we have no interest in escalation," Zarifa added. Israel expanded the approved fishing zone for Gazans to 15 nautical miles (equivalent to 28.8 kilometers from the shoreline) on Monday, the military said. This is the maximum fishing range allowed in the Gaza Strip since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Fishermen in Gaza say the 15-mile range is partial, only applying to waters off the southern part of the Strip. Last Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of the March of Return in which three 17-year-old demonstrators died after being shot by live Israeli fire, Gaza's Health Ministry said. Adham Amara died after he was shot in the face. Tamer Abu Al-Kheir and Bilal Al-Najar died after being shot in a protest east of Khan Younes. Tens of thousands of Palestinian protestors had gathered along the border and the Health Ministry in Gaza reported that over 300 people were wounded and referred to hospitals. At least 60 people were wounded by live Israeli fire, five of them are in critical condition and nine are in serious condition.

(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) GAZA, April 5 (KUNA) -- At least 83 Palestinian people were wounded on Friday by the Israeli occupation forces during protests staged along the border fence, east of the Gaza Strip, Palestinian Health Ministry said. The protests are part of the great marches of return and breaking the siege imposed on the Strip. The wounded were admitted to nearby hospitals for treatment, the ministry's spokesman Ashraf Al-Qedra said in a statement. He added that they were suffering from different injuries. As soon as hundreds of Palestinians gathered near the fence, the Israeli army fired heavily live bullets and tear gas to suppress them, some eyewitnesses said. They added that tens of Palestinians were wounded because of the Israeli fire. Meanwhile, the Higher National Commission for the Great Return March and Breaking of the Siege said the only option for Palestinians is to continue protests until their demands are met.

Israeli forces injure 80 Gazans Press TV – Israeli forces have attacked Palestinians taking part in an anti-occupation protest along the edge of the besieged Gaza Strip, leaving more than 80 people injured. Ashraf al-Qedra, a spokesman for Gaza’s Health Ministry, said that at least 83 Palestinians had sustained various injuries during the rallies east of Gaza and along a fence separating the enclave from occupied lands on Friday. The rallies have been held every week since March 30 last year. The Palestinians demand the right to return for those driven out of their homeland by Israeli aggression. Israeli troops have killed over 260 Palestinians since the beginning of the rallies — called the “Great March of Return” — and wounded 26,000 others, according to the Gazan Health Ministry. A United Nations (UN) fact-finding mission found earlier that Israeli forces committed rights violations during their crackdown against the Palestinian protesters in Gaza that may amount to war crimes. On the eve of the first anniversary of the “Great March of Return” protests last Friday, Israel deployed tanks near the fence separating the occupied territories from Gaza. Gaza has been under Israeli siege since June 2007, which has caused a decline in living standards. Israel has launched three major wars against the enclave since 2008, killing thousands of Gazans each time and shattering the impoverished territory’s already poor infrastructure

News article:
Indications of increased Russian involvement in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad are prompting a reassessment in Israel about how to handle fall-out from the conflict without risking a clash with Moscow. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, Israel has occasionally fired across the Golan Heights in response to spillover shelling or bombed advanced arms it suspected were to be transferred to Assad's Lebanese guerrilla allies, Hezbollah. U.S. and regional reports that Moscow's diplomatic and logistical support for Assad is shifting into major military backing has raised the prospect of Israel and Russia accidentally coming to blows. "There could be ramifications for us, certainly," Ram Ben-Barak, director-general of Israel's Intelligence Ministry, told Reuters when asked if Russian intervention in Syria might necessitate new Israeli rules of engagement. Russian Air force air craft (Photo: Reuters) He was speaking at a security conference organised by the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center, where Russian policy in Syria was described both as an effort to shore up Assad and mobilise with other world powers in suppressing Islamic State insurgents. "We have been informed that the Russians are entering into active intervention, the Americans are attacking ... The West and now, in fact, the Russians and the whole world are trying to unite against them (Islamic State)," Amos Gilad, senior adviser to Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon, said in a speech. In separate remarks to Reuters, Gilad said it was too early to know how extensive Moscow's military involvement in Syria would be and whether it might clip Israel's wings operationally. "I don't know, because the scale is not yet clear. They haven't started working. They are just building up the capability," Gilad said of the Russian activity. Asked if Israel was communicating with Russia in a bid to head off any unintended confrontations between their forces, he said only: "There are ways. They are not our enemies today." In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said she had no information about any communication between Israel and Russia. Looking Anew Israel has sought to stay out of the Syrian civil war, seeing enemies on all sides. It says it intervenes militarily only when fired upon from Syria or to prevent Hezbollah operatives reinforcing Assad there from gaining advanced weapons that could pose a threat to it from Lebanon in the future. Past Israeli strikes in Syria killed Syrian troops as well as Hezbollah fighters, according to both countries and the guerrilla group - though the exact number remains unclear. In recent days, Moscow has reaffirmed its military backing for Damascus but said it was premature to talk about Russian participation in military operations in Syria. U.S. authorities have detected "worrisome preparatory steps", including transport of prefabricated houses for hundreds of people to a Syrian airfield, that could signal Russia is readying for deployment of heavy military assets, a senior U.S. official told Reuters last week. Russian cargo planes in Syria (Photo: AFP) Syria has not formally responded to the reports. But one of its military officials has spoken of a "big shift" in Russia's military support for Damascus. Amos Yadlin, an Israeli air force ex-general and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's former military intelligence chief, said Israel and Russia were unlikely to find themselves pitted against each other in Syria as they had different areas of interest. "I don't think there is any reason for the sides to collide, as we are not fighting the same enemy. I assume that we will be very careful, and so will they," said Yadlin, now director of Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies. He predicted Russian forces would avoid the Golan, near Israel's northern front, and Israel would think twice about carrying out air strikes where Russians might be harmed. "My assumption is that we don't attack any site on the ground in Syria unless we have an excellent picture of who is or isn't there," Yadlin said. A senior U.S. official briefed on Israel's actions in Syria shared Yadlin's assessment, but cautioned: "Nothing is fool-proof, so I can anticipate the Israelis will be looking anew at their risk-assessments now." Syria's ageing air force is largely Soviet-supplied, posing a possible scenario where similar models of jets and choppers could be flown by local and Russian pilots. Sam Gardiner, a retired U.S. air force colonel who runs wargames for various Washington agencies, said Israel would likely be able to spot Russian-operated aircraft in good time. "Russian aircraft would probably have a different 'signature' - even if they're the same airplane they wouldn't be equipped with the same electronics," he said, theorising that the Israelis would know which Syrian airbases were being used by Russia and be able to trace Russian-language radio communications to the jets or helicopters they came from.

News article:
(MENAFN- The Peninsula) HERZLIYA (Israel): Indications of increased Russian involvement in Syria in support of President Bashar Al Assad are prompting a reassessment in Israel about how to handle fall-out from the conflict without risking a clash with Moscow. Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011 Israel has occasionally fired across the Golan Heights in response to spillover shelling or bombed advanced arms it suspected were to be transferred to Assad's Lebanese guerrilla allies Hezbollah. U.S. and regional reports that Moscow's diplomatic and logistical support for Assad is shifting into major military backing has raised the prospect of Israel and Russia accidentally coming to blows. "There could be ramifications for us certainly" Ram Ben-Barak director-general of Israel's Intelligence Ministry told Reuters when asked if Russian intervention in Syria might necessitate new Israeli rules of engagement. He was speaking at a security conference organised by the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center where Russian policy in Syria was described both as an effort to shore up Assad and mobilise with other world powers in suppressing Islamic State insurgents. "We have been informed that the Russians are entering into active intervention the Americans are attacking ... The West and now in fact the Russians and the whole world are trying to unite against them (Islamic State)" Amos Gilad senior adviser to Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said in a speech. In separate remarks to Reuters Gilad said it was too early to know how extensive Moscow's military involvement in Syria would be and whether it might clip Israel's wings operationally. "I don't know because the scale is not yet clear. They haven't started working. They are just building up the capability" Gilad said of the Russian activity. Asked if Israel was communicating with Russia in a bid to head off any unintended confrontations between their forces he said only: "There are ways. They are not our enemies today." In Moscow the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said she had no information about any communication between Israel and Russia. "LOOKING ANEW" Israel has sought to stay out of the Syrian civil war seeing enemies on all sides. It says it intervenes militarily only when fired upon from Syria or to prevent Hezbollah operatives reinforcing Assad there from gaining advanced weapons that could pose a threat to it from Lebanon in the future. Past Israeli strikes in Syria killed Syrian troops as well as Hezbollah fighters according to both countries and the guerrilla group - though the exact number remains unclear. In recent days Moscow has reaffirmed its military backing for Damascus but said it was premature to talk about Russian participation in military operations in Syria. U.S. authorities have detected "worrisome preparatory steps" including transport of prefabricated houses for hundreds of people to a Syrian airfield that could signal Russia is readying for deployment of heavy military assets a senior U.S. official told Reuters last week. Syria has not formally responded to the reports. But one of its military officials has spoken of a "big shift" in Russia's military support for Damascus. Amos Yadlin an Israeli air force ex-general and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's former military intelligence chief said Israel and Russia were unlikely to find themselves pitted against each other in Syria as they had different areas of interest. "I don't think there is any reason for the sides to collide as we are not fighting the same enemy. I assume that we will be very careful and so will they" said Yadlin now director of Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies. He predicted Russian forces would avoid the Golan near Israel's northern front and Israel would think twice about carrying out air strikes where Russians might be harmed. "My assumption is that we don't attack any site on the ground in Syria unless we have an excellent picture of who is or isn't there" Yadlin said. A senior U.S. official briefed on Israel's actions in Syria shared Yadlin's assessment but cautioned: "Nothing is fool-proof so I can anticipate the Israelis will be looking anew at their risk-assessments now." Syria's ageing air force is largely Soviet-supplied posing a possible scenario where similar models of jets and choppers could be flown by local and Russian pilots. Sam Gardiner a retired U.S. air force colonel who runs wargames for various Washington agencies said Israel would likely be able to spot Russian-operated aircraft in good time. "Russian aircraft would probably have a different 'signature' - even if they're the same airplane they wouldn't be equipped with the same electronics" he said theorising that the Israelis would know which Syrian airbases were being used by Russia and be able to trace Russian-language radio communications to the jets or helicopters they came from.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Russia next week to speak with President Vladimir Putin about the deployment of Moscow’s forces to Syria and the threats to Israel caused by weapon deliveries to Damascus, his office said Wednesday. Netanyahu will discuss the dangers Israel faces if Hezbollah and other terror groups obtain Russian advanced weapons shipments, according to a government press release. Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the meeting was to to take place on Monday, Sputnik News reported. Israel opposes Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime, but has mostly sought to avoid being dragged into the conflict in neighboring Syria. Russia has recently stepped up military aid to Damascus, despite protestations from the US and elsewhere.

Lebanon’s powerful Shiite movement Hezbollah, with which Israel fought a devastating 2006 war, is a staunch ally of Assad and has sent fighters to support his forces. A number of airstrikes inside Syria attributed to Israel over the past several years were apparently aimed at keeping advanced weaponry from being transferred to Hezbollah.

Relations between Israel and Russia have been negatively affected by Moscow’s willingness to sell military equipment to Iran, which has said it seeks to destroy the Jewish state. Netanyahu last traveled to Moscow in 2013 to lobby Putin to cancel the sale of the advanced S-300 air defense system to Iran, though that effort failed. The US has also expressed its concern to Russia regarding an alleged recent increase in military buildup in Syria, including apparent moves to set up an airbase near Latakia, an Assad stronghold near where Russia once maintained a naval base. Moscow, however, denied the reports as false and said its aid to the Syrian government was nothing out of the ordinary. Advertisement US Secretary of State John Kerry Tuesday made a third phone call to his Russian counterpart, in which he warned that aid to the Syrian regime would only prolong the conflict in the war-torn country. Putin had earlier defended Russia’s military assistance to Assad’s government, saying it was impossible to defeat the Islamic State group without cooperation with Damascus and urging other countries to join the cause. The Obama administration said last week that any strategy to support Assad was “doomed to failure.” US military officials said on Monday that Russia appeared to be establishing a forward air base in Syria and had sent tanks and artillery to defend it.

Following a recent increase in the Russian presence in Syria, Israeli officials have been reassessing how to handle “fall-out” issues arising from the ongoing Syrian civil war. Israel has until now assumed a very standoffish approach to the Syrian conflict, sporadically retaliating to attacks by targeting weapons depots and military convoys in Syria that it deemed threatening. However, with an increase of Russian military support in Syria backing President Bashar al-Assad, Israeli officials may need to change tactics. Following US as well as regional reports which indicate that Russia’s diplomatic and logistical support for President Assad’s forces is turning into major military backing, Israel has begun putting plans in place to avoid an accidental confrontation with Moscow. When asked by a reporter at the Interdisciplinary Center conference in Herzliya if Russian intervention in Syria might necessitate new Israeli rules of engagement, Ram Ben-Barak, director-general of Israel’s Intelligence Ministry, said that “there could certainly be ramifications for us.” During the conference, experts described Russian policy in Syria as both an effort to shore up Assad and to mobilize Russian forces together with other world powers in an effort to suppress Islamic State insurgents. Amos Gilad, senior adviser to Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, said in a speech, “We have been informed that the Russians are entering into active intervention, the Americans are attacking … The West and now, in fact, the Russians and the whole world are trying to unite against [the Islamic State].” Gilad told Reuters reporters in separate remarks that it is still too early to know how extensive Moscow’s military involvement in Syria will be and whether or not their involvement might clip Israel’s wings operationally. Reporters questioned Gilad on whether or not Israel is communicating with Russia in a bid to head off any unintended confrontations between their forces. He responded by saying, that; “There are ways. They are not our enemies today.” In Moscow, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said she had no information about any communication between Israel and Russia regarding this matter. Amos Yadlin, the Director of Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies, predicted that Israel and Russia were unlikely to find themselves pitted against each other in Syria, as the two countries have different areas of interest. Yadlin, an Israeli air force ex-general and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s former military intelligence chief, said, “I don’t think there is any reason for the sides to collide, as we are not fighting the same enemy. I assume that we will be very careful, and so will they. My assumption is that we don’t attack any site on the ground in Syria unless we have an excellent picture of who is or isn’t there.” Russian forces would likely avoid the Golan, Israel’s northern front, as it is not their area of interest, and Israel would continue to thoroughly analyze any situation before carrying out airstrikes in order to ascertain that no Russian forces would be harmed.

I assume that we will be very careful, and so will they. My assumption is that we don’t attack any site on the ground in Syria unless we have an excellent picture of who is or isn’t there.” Russian forces would likely avoid the Golan, Israel’s northern front, as it is not their area of interest, and Israel would continue to thoroughly analyze any situation before carrying out airstrikes in order to ascertain that no Russian forces would be harmed.

Following a recent increase in the Russian presence in Syria, Israeli officials have been reassessing how to handle “fall-out” issues arising from the ongoing Syrian civil war. Israel has until now assumed a very standoffish approach to the Syrian conflict, sporadically retaliating to attacks by targeting weapons depots and military convoys in Syria that it deemed threatening. However, with an increase of Russian military support in Syria backing President Bashar al-Assad, Israeli officials may need to change tactics. Following US as well as regional reports which indicate that Russia’s diplomatic and logistical support for President Assad’s forces is turning into major military backing, Israel has begun putting plans in place to avoid an accidental confrontation with Moscow. When asked by a reporter at the Interdisciplinary Center conference in Herzliya if Russian intervention in Syria might necessitate new Israeli rules of engagement, Ram Ben-Barak, director-general of Israel’s Intelligence Ministry, said that “there could certainly be ramifications for us.” During the conference, experts described Russian policy in Syria as both an effort to shore up Assad and to mobilize Russian forces together with other world powers in an effort to suppress Islamic State insurgents. Amos Gilad, senior adviser to Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, said in a speech, “We have been informed that the Russians are entering into active intervention, the Americans are attacking … The West and now, in fact, the Russians and the whole world are trying to unite against [the Islamic State].” Gilad told Reuters reporters in separate remarks that it is still too early to know how extensive Moscow’s military involvement in Syria will be and whether or not their involvement might clip Israel’s wings operationally. Reporters questioned Gilad on whether or not Israel is communicating with Russia in a bid to head off any unintended confrontations between their forces. He responded by saying, that; “There are ways. They are not our enemies today.” In Moscow, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said she had no information about any communication between Israel and Russia regarding this matter. Amos Yadlin, the Director of Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies, predicted that Israel and Russia were unlikely to find themselves pitted against each other in Syria, as the two countries have different areas of interest. Yadlin, an Israeli air force ex-general and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s former military intelligence chief, said, “I don’t think there is any reason for the sides to collide, as we are not fighting the same enemy.

JERUSALEM (JTA) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss Putin’s support for the Assad regime in Syria. During the visit, which is scheduled for next week, Netanyahu will talk with Putin about “the stationing of Russian forces in Syria,” and “present the threats posed to Israel as a result of the increased flow of advanced war materiel to the Syrian arena and the transfer of deadly weapons to Hezbollah and other terror organizations,” a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said. On Tuesday, Putin pledged to continue military support for the Syrian government led by Bashar Assad. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said on the same day that the Russian military has had “increased activity” in Syria in the last few days.

Last week, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office announced that the primary purpose of Netanyahu's three-hour working visit would be to discuss Moscow's provision of lethal, state-of-the-art weapons to Syria, and the danger that some of these weapons, including missiles and air defense systems, could find their way into the hands of Hezbollah. The Lebanese Shia militant group assisting the Syrian military in its war against terror groups operating in Syria including Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIL is itself classified a terrorist organization by Tel Aviv, (although not by Moscow). It's worth mentioning that thus far, in contrast to its Iraqi counterparts, the Syrian army has shown much more discipline in keeping its advanced weapons systems out of unwanted hands, whether they be friend or foe. According to both Russian and Israeli analysts, the other less-publicized but no less important goals for the two sides will be to reach an agreement on preventing unintended clashes between the Israeli military and Russian forces stationed in Syria's western provinces, including the Latakia airport. In this connection, it is rumored that Israeli Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot may accompany Netanyahu on his trip.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Russia Monday to meet with President Vladimir Putin and discuss "the global terrorist threat." In a rare move, Netanyahu brought key military advisers to the closed meeting, as reports of Russia's increased military presence in Syria continued to surface. Netanyahu brought two top Israeli generals with him, which is highly unusual in a diplomatic visit, according to the Jerusalem Post. "Bilateral cooperation matters and current international affairs will be the main subjects of discussion," read a statement posted to the Russian president's website Monday. "In particular, Mr. Putin and Mr. Netanyahu will exchange views on the Middle East peace process and the fight against the global terrorist threat." Israel and Syria have fought several wars, and Israeli officials are increasingly concerned that Syrian weapons are going to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia allied to the Assad regime and a U.S. state-designated terror group that targets Israel. The Israelis warn that if Russia increases its military support to Syria, Hezbollah could acquire arms to add to the thousands of missiles it has aimed at their country. While President Bashar Assad's regime is opposed by the United States and European Union nations, Russia has remained staunch in its support. Russia has moved fighter jets to Syria, U.S. defense officials reported Friday, which alarms the Israelis. Israeli authorities said they were also concerned of an accidental exchange of fire between Russian and Israeli aircraft over Syria. Israel often flies surveillance missions over southern Syria to target Hezbollah, and if communication is not open, the two nations could accidentally attack each other. "What's important is Putin's commitment not to get mixed up in arming Hezbollah, which should help Israel, if it goes in there, to keep a safe distance from the Russians," said one former Israeli adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to Reuters, adding, "It is pretty clear that Putin is not looking for a fight with Israel."

"What's important is Putin's commitment not to get mixed up in arming Hezbollah, which should help Israel, if it goes in there, to keep a safe distance from the Russians," said one former Israeli adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to Reuters, adding, "It is pretty clear that Putin is not looking for a fight with Israel."

NOVO-OGARYOVO, Russia — Israel and Russia agreed on Monday to coordinate military actions over Syria in order to avoid accidentally trading fire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a visit to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their meeting in the Novo-Ogaryovo residence, outside Moscow, Russia, on Sept. 21, 2015. Ivan Sekretarev / AP Recent Russian reinforcements for Syrian President Bashar Assad, which regional sources say include warplanes and anti-aircraft systems, worry Israel, whose jets have on occasion bombed the neighboring Arab country to foil suspected handovers of advanced arms to Assad's Lebanese guerrilla ally Hezbollah. Briefing Israeli reporters after he met Russian President Vladimir Putin, Netanyahu said he had come with the goal of "prevent(ing) misunderstandings between IDF (Israel Defense Force) units and Russian forces" in Syria, where Assad is fighting Islamist-dominated insurgents in a civil war. Related: Russia Begins Drone Flights Over Syria: U.S. Officials Netanyahu added that he and Putin "agreed on a mechanism to prevent such misunderstandings." He did not elaborate. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin. In earlier remarks as he welcomed Netanyahu to the presidential residence of Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow, Putin said Russian actions in the Middle East would always be "responsible." Underlining the importance of Netanyahu's one-day visit to Moscow, Israel's premier took along the chief of its armed forces and the general in charge of Israeli military intelligence. Putin, who shares Western concern about the spread of ISIS influence, has pledged to continue military support for Assad, assistance that Russia says is in line with international law. Russia has been focusing forces on Syria's coast, where Moscow keeps a big Mediterranean naval base. The United States, which along with its allies has been flying missions against ISIS insurgents in Syria, has also been holding so-called "deconfliction" talks with Russia. Netanyahu told Israeli reporters that he had informed the Americans "on each and every detail" of his Moscow visit, adding: "Everyone has an interest in avoiding an unnecessary clash" over Syria. A U.S. official told Reuters that U.S.-Israeli coordination allowed the allies to share classified technologies for identifying Russian aircraft over Syria: "We know how to spot them clearly and quickly," the official said. Related: Analysis: Why Is Russia So Interested in Syria? Separately, U.S. officials said Russia had started flying surveillance missions with drone aircraft in Syria in what appeared to be Moscow's first air operations there since beginning its build-up. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, could not say how many aircraft were involved. A former Netanyahu adviser said Israel was concerned that Russia's help for Assad in battling an insurgency now in its fifth year could create a de facto axis between Moscow, Iran and Hezbollah.

The military leaders of Israel and Russia will meet in two weeks’ time to begin discussing coordination of their activities in Syria, officials said Monday night. Israeli chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot met with his Russian counterpart Valery Gerasimov in Moscow, some hours after the heads of the two countries also met in the Russian capital. The two military chiefs agreed to set up a work group which will establish a mechanism of cooperation between the two armies. Their deputies will lead this effort, with an initial meeting planned in about two weeks. The location of the group’s meetings has not yet been determined and it is not clear whether they will take place in Israel or Russia.

Israel and Russia agreed on a mechanism to avoid military confrontations between the two countries in Syria, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. “My goal was to prevent misunderstandings between IDF forces and Russian forces. We have established a mechanism to prevent such misunderstandings. This is very important for Israel’s security,” Netanyahu told Israeli reporters during a telephone briefing from the Russian capital. “Our conversation was dedicated to the complex security situation on the northern border,” the prime minister said. “I explained our policies in different ways to try to thwart the deadly weapons transfers from the Syrian army to Hezbollah — action actually undertaken under the supervision of Iran.” Netanyahu said that he told Putin in “no uncertain terms” that Israel will not tolerate Tehran’s efforts to arm Israel’s enemies in the region, and that Jerusalem has taken and will continue to take action against any such attempts. “This is our right and also our duty. There were no objections to our rights and to what I said. On the contrary: there was readiness to make sure that whatever Russia’s intentions for Syria, Russia will not be a partner in extreme actions by Iran against us.” Ahead of their meeting, as they made statements to the press, Netanyahu told Putin that Iran and Syria have been arming Hezbollah with advanced weapons, thousands of which are directed at Israeli cities. “At the same time, Iran, under the auspices of the Syrian army, is attempting to build a second terrorist front against us from the Golan Heights.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The prime minister told his Russian host that Israel’s policy is to prevent these weapons transfers “and to prevent the creation of a terrorist front and attacks on us from the Golan Heights.” Netanyahu came to the Kremlin to “clarify our policies, and to make sure that there is no misunderstanding between our forces,” he said. Putin replied by saying that the Syrian army was too bogged down in its own civil war to deal with fighting against Israel. “All of Russia’s actions in the region will always be very responsible,” Putin said. “We are aware of the shelling against Israel and we condemn all such shelling. I know that these shellings are carried out by internal elements. In regard to Syria, we know that the Syrian army is in a situation such that it is incapable of opening a new front. Our main goal is to defend the Syrian state. However, I understand your concern.” Advertisement He also said he remains mindful that many émigrés from the former Soviet Union live in Israel, which “has a special effect on our bilateral relations.”

Israel and Russia agreed on a mechanism to avoid military confrontations between the two countries in Syria, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. “My goal was to prevent misunderstandings between IDF forces and Russian forces.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Moscow's weapon deliveries to Syria. The leaders focused on how to keep their armed forces out of each other's way. At a meeting in Moscow on Monday, Netanyahu and Putin decided they would coordinate their military actions in Syria to avoid accidentally trading fire. "My objective was to prevent misunderstandings between IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units and Russian forces," Netanyahu told reporters, adding that he and Putin had "agreed on a mechanism" to prevent such events. Earlier, the Israeli prime minister had said it was important to remove misunderstandings between the two countries forces. Israeli planes have, on occasion, bombed neighboring Syria after suspecting Assad's forces of delivering weapons to the anti-Israeli Hezbollah, which is based in neighboring Lebanon and has Iran's support. Iran in turn, with the help of the Syrian army, was "trying to set up a second terrorist front on Golan Heights," which was captured by Israel in 1981, Netanyahu told diplomats in Moscow. Russia's 'responsible' role in Syria Putin rejected Netanyahu's concerns of Assad's forces opening up a second front. "We know that the Syrian army and Syria as a whole are in such a state that they have no time for a second front. They need to save their own state," the Russian president said, adding that he "understood" Israel's concerns. Moscow's actions in the Middle East "always were and will be very responsible," Putin stressed. The two leaders were also due to discuss the stalled peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was arriving in Moscow on Wednesday, the Kremlin said in a statement. Israel captured Golan Heights from Syria in 1981 Image: Reuters/B. Ratner Moscow to tie up with Assad? Last week, satellite images were released showing Russian tanks, armored vehicles and other military equipment arriving in Syria's Latakia province, a stronghold of President Bashar Assad's forces. The US had earlier reported a Russian military buildup in the Middle Eastern country. Moscow has dismissed US concerns, saying it has been reinforcing Assad's military to fight the "Islamic State" (IS). Its leaders have also been involved in diplomatic efforts to try and make US forces against the IS join hands with President Assad. Israel opposes Assad's regime, but has largely avoided being dragged into the Syrian conflict. However, following the international nuclear deal with Iran, Netanyahu is afraid that military aid in Latakia, on Israel's northeastern border, may embolden anti-Israeli groups like the Lebanon-based Hezbollah. The group, in turn, is supported by Iran, which has been a growing threat for Israel ever since western powers signed a nuclear deal lifting economic sanctions on Teheran. mg/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)

News article:
A Syrian man receives treatment at a makeshift hospital following reported air strikes by government forces in the rebel-held area of Douma, east of the capital Damascus, on Saturday (AFP photo) NOVO-OGARYOVO, Russia — Israel and Russia agreed on Monday to coordinate military actions over Syria in order to avoid accidentally trading fire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a visit to Moscow. Recent Russian reinforcements for Syrian President Bashar Assad, which regional sources say include warplanes and anti-aircraft systems, worry Israel, whose jets have on occasion bombed the neighbouring Arab country to foil suspected handovers of advanced arms to Assad's Lebanese guerrilla ally Hizbollah. Briefing Israeli reporters after he met Russian President Vladimir Putin, Netanyahu said he had come with the goal of "prevent[ing] misunderstandings between IDF [Israel Defence Force] units and Russian forces" in Syria, where Assad is fighting Islamist-dominated insurgents in a civil war. Netanyahu added that he and Putin "agreed on a mechanism to prevent such misunderstandings". He did not elaborate. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin. In earlier remarks as he welcomed Netanyahu to the presidential residence of Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow, Putin said Russian actions in the Middle East would always be "responsible". Underlining the importance of Netanyahu's one-day visit to Moscow, Israel's premier took along the chief of its armed forces and the general in charge of Israeli military intelligence. Putin, who shares Western concern about the spread of Daesh influence, has pledged to continue military support for Assad, assistance that Russia says is in line with international law. Russia has been focusing forces on Syria's coast, where Moscow keeps a big Mediterranean naval base. The United States, which along with its allies has been flying missions against Daesh insurgents in Syria, has also been holding so-called "deconfliction" talks with Russia. Keeping us informed Netanyahu told Israeli reporters that he had informed the Americans "on each and every detail" of his Moscow visit, adding: "Everyone has an interest in avoiding an unnecessary clash" over Syria. A US official told Reuters that US-Israeli coordination allowed the allies to share classified technologies for identifying Russian aircraft over Syria: "We know how to spot them clearly and quickly," the official said. Separately, US officials said Russia had started flying surveillance missions with drone aircraft in Syria in what appeared to be Moscow's first air operations there since beginning its build-up. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, could not say how many aircraft were involved. A former Netanyahu adviser said Israel was concerned that Russia's help for Assad in battling an insurgency now in its fifth year could create a de facto axis between Moscow, Iran and Hizbollah. Iran, Israel's arch-foe, is Assad's other foreign backer and patron of Hizbollah, which fought Israel to a standstill in the 2006 Lebanon war. Israel worries that top-of-the-line Russian military hardware being deployed in Syria could end up in Hizbollah's arsenal. "Our policy is to do everything to stop weapons from being sent to Hizbollah," Netanyahu told Putin at their photo-op. He also set out Israel's policy of striking at guerrillas suspected of preparing to attack it from the Syrian Golan, on the northern frontier — an apparent signal to Russia to steer clear there. The former Netanyahu adviser, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the issue, said any understandings reached with Putin "could come down to Israel and Russia agreeing to limit themselves to defined areas of operation in Syria, or even that they fly at daytime and we fly at night".

Russia’s president and Israeli’s PM have agreed to “establish a channel for information exchange” with regard to the current situation in war-torn Syria, a Kremlin spokesman said on Tuesday, commenting on the Netanyahu’s visit to Moscow. The two discussed the need for a “more honest information exchange and coordination between Russia and Israel” in their actions in Syria, Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said, adding that the agreement had been prompted by the worsening situation there. “Based on the partnership relations between Russia and Israel it has been considered appropriate to establish channels of informational exchange on such a sensitive issue,” Peskov told journalists, adding that this coordination has become necessary because of the difficult situation in the region, and has nothing to do with Russian military advisers in Syria. The Kremlin’s comments came after Benjamin Netanyahu said that his meeting with Putin on Monday was intended to “prevent misunderstandings between IDF (Israel Defense Forces) units and Russian forces” in Syria. Briefing Israeli reporters after the talks, Netanyahu said that they had “agreed on a mechanism” to ensure that such “misunderstandings” do not happen, without elaborating further. Following the statements, some anonymous sources told the Israeli press that the goal of such coordination was to avoid situations in Syria in which the Russian and Israeli military could find themselves accidentally trading fire. The coordination will apply to “air, naval and electromagnetic fields,” RIA Novosti reported citing a source in Israeli military. Neither country is directly involved in the Syrian conflict. Moscow has been supplying Syria with arms on a regular basis for years under previous contracts, and Israel has kept its distance from the war, with the exception of several reportedly “preventive airstrikes.” (RT.com)

It was the bon ton after the Camp David accords, the Oslo Agreements and most recently the Arab Spring, and in the end, it is usually the old Middle East, that of mayhem and chaos. So is the case these days, when the vacuum left by indecisive, if not outright confused American policy, invites another power to enter into the widely open door, and nowadays it is Russia of Vladimir Putin. In a matter of few weeks an impressive Russian military presence is established in North West Syria, the Alawite region, which is the power base of Bashar Assad. Putin did not talk much, he acted in accordance with his stated goal to prevent the complete downfall of his ally, Assad. A new Middle East? Well, by past precedents we are required to maintain a somewhat skeptic attitude, but definitely not too premature, to refer to the changing diplomatic, strategic and military landscape of the Middle East. Some contextual background is in place here. First, this blog called attention, in the last four years, to the Russian claim to be a partner for the solution of the Syrian problem, a call ignored, if not disrespectfully dismissed by the West, led by the Obama Administration. It is beyond the scope of this article, to delve deeply into the reasons of Putin's obsession with Syria, nor into that of the American policy there, or rather the lack of such policy, but the fact is, that the Russians have had a consistent policy there, the West has not, and those who know what they want, are always a step ahead of those who do not. Second, whether we like President Putin foreign and domestic policies or not, and clearly the Obama Administration does not, the Russians proved during the Syrian civil war, that they can play a positive role. I refer to the Russian contribution to the diffusion of the chemical weapons crisis in the fall of 2013. It was Russia, not the US, which brokered the deal which may not be an ideal one, but still good enough to satisfy concerned parties, for example Israel. Advertisement Here is where Israel gets into the picture. The Israelis have never had an interest in the complete collapse of the Assad regime, surely not if it means a Sunni Or Iranian-Oriented Shi'ite Jihadist state on the border. This was the quietest of all Israel borders from 1974 to 2011, despite the ringing rhetoric of the Alawite-Ba'ath-Assad regime. But then, the civil war developed in a way which surprised also Israeli intelligence and policy makers, particularly the gradual collapse of the regime as well as the extent and ferocity of the Hizballah and Iranian involvement. When this involvement became so apparent , aiming at spilling over towards the Israeli border, the leadership in Jerusalem decided to act, and a series of aerial attacks, mostly highly successful, made it clear, that there are two taboos for Israel; one to prevent transfer of dangerous weapons from the Syrian army to the hands of Hizballah, another a Hizballah-Iranian military and terrorist presence in the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. None of this two is or should be against Russian interest, and significantly enough, never since 2011, have the Israelis condemned any aspect of Russia's presence and policy in Syria. It should be noted, that there has never been any political commitment made by the Israelis towards any of the Syrian rebel groups, and the Israelis never deviated from humanitarian assistance , mainly by opening their hospitals to thousands of sick and injured Syrians. Unverified reports about some intelligence cooperation with more moderate Sunni factions notwithstanding, politically the Israelis never publicly tied themselves to the rebels 'cause, while maintaining no illusions about the murderous nature of the Syrian regime and the eventual, unavoidable actual partition of Syria along sectarian lines. Up to this moment, there is nothing in the Russian build-up in Syria which indicates a Russian commitment to reoccupy the large areas, in fact the majority of Syria lost by the regime to the various rebel factions. Until now, it seems that the Russians solidify their presence in the Latakiyya-Tartus area, where they have a naval base, the area otherwise known as Alawistan. Israel has no interest there, nor any problem with the Russian actions.It is against this background, that we need to view P.M. Netanyahu's visit in Moscow on Monday. The very fact, that such a visit, in which the Israeli Chief of Staff and Head of military Intelligence are instant welcome guests in the Kremlin is NOT a light affair. It is also a sign of Netanyahu's speedy adaptation to the new circumstances. The Russians are in Syria, so he goes to Moscow, not to Washington. Let us remember the not so distant past, when Russian, or Soviet military presence in the immediate vicinity of Israel might have instigated a flurry of activity between Jerusalem and Washington.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday to address the changing security situation near Israel’s northern border, with respect to the recent arrival of Russian forces arriving in Syria. “Israel and Russia share a common interest to ensure stability in the Middle East. And I am here because of the security situation which is becoming ever more complex on our northern border,” Netanyahu said. During the press conference, Netanyahu addressed concerns about an Iranian backed terrorist front opening up on its northern border. “Iran, under the auspices of the Syrian army, is attempting to build a second terrorist front against us from the Golan Heights,” Netanyahu claimed. The Israeli Prime Minister pointed to recent shipments of advanced weapons to Hezbollah from Iran and the current Syrian regime. “Our policy is to prevent these weapons transfers, and to prevent the creation of a terrorist front and attacks on us from the Golan Heights,” added Netanyahu. Israel has occasionally conducted airstrikes against such weapons transfers and in particular during the current civil war in Syria. “Under these circumstances, I thought it was very important that I come here, also to clarify our policies, and to make sure that there is no misunderstanding between our forces,” Netanyahu assured Putin. Members of Russia’s armed forces in Syria make Israel’s tactical striking of arms shipments to Hezbollah more complicated since Israel would need to avoid any inadvertent casualty among Russian forces during such an operation. For his part, President Putin assured Prime Minister Netanyahu that “all of Russia’s actions in the region will always be very responsible.” Putin also condemned all attacks on Israel but avoided making a reference to Hezbollah. “We are aware of the shelling against Israel and we condemn all such shelling,” said Putin. “I know that these shellings are carried out by internal elements.” Putin also doubted Netanyahu’s suggestion that the Syrian government would open up a terrorist front against Israel. “In regard to Syria, we know that the Syrian army is in a situation such that it is incapable of opening a new front,” argued Putin. Although diplomatic relations between Israel and Russia have grown and advanced since the fall of the Soviet Union, significant differences remain between both countries on various Middle East issues. Russia maintains strong connections with Iran and Syria, both of which are enemy regimes of Israel. In contrast with Israel, Russia also views Syria’s President Basher al-Assad as a necessity for maintaining stability and order in Syria. Despite existing disagreements, both leaders assured the other of maintaining good relations. “In all of the relations between us, whether I agreed and also when we differed, our discourse has always been conducted with mutual respect and openness,” Netanyahu told Putin. While Putin made it clear that Russia’s “main goal is to defend the Syrian state,” he also expressed a cordial greeting to Netanyahu. “I understand your concern and I am very pleased that you have come here to discuss all issues in detail,” Putin said to Netanyahu.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed on a plan to avoid "misunderstandings" in Syria amid an apparent military build-up by Moscow to support President Bashar Assad. The two leaders reached an agreement on Monday during talks in Russia, with Israeli media reporting that the discussions involved avoiding clashes between the two militaries' jets over Syria. "The conversation revolved, first of all, on the issue that I raised regarding Syria, which is very important to the security of Israel," Netanyahu said after the meeting, according to a statement from his office. "The conversation was substantive. A joint mechanism for preventing misunderstandings between our forces was also agreed to." Israeli military officials reportedly fear that any Russian air presence could cut their room for maneuver after several purported strikes on Iranian arms transfers to Hizbullah through Syria in recent months that were not officially acknowledged by Israeli authorities. Israel opposes Assad's regime but has sought to avoid being dragged into the conflict in neighboring Syria. It also fears that Iran could increase its support for Hizbullah and other militant groups as international sanctions are gradually lifted under a July nuclear deal that Moscow helped negotiate between Tehran and world powers. Before his talks with Putin, Netanyahu said he was determined to stop arms deliveries to Hizbullah and accused Syria's army and Iran of trying to create a "second front" against Israel. Putin said Russia's actions in the Middle East "always were and will be very responsible" and downplayed the threat by Syrian forces to Israel. The United States says Russia -- one of the few remaining allies of Assad -- is deploying personnel and military hardware to Syria, sparking fears Moscow is preparing to fight alongside government forces. Russia contends any such support falls in line with existing defense contracts.

News article:
By Reuters September 24, 2015 An Israeli-Russian coordination team set up to prevent the countries accidentally trading fire in Syria will be headed by their deputy armed forces chiefs and will hold its first meeting by Oct. 5, an Israeli military officer said on Thursday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Monday to set up the team as Moscow steps up military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been losing ground to an Islamist-led insurgency. Israel is worried the Russian deployment, which U.S. officials and regional sources say includes advanced anti-aircraft units and warplanes, risks pitting Russian forces against its own over Syria. Israeli jets have occasionally struck in neighboring Syria to foil suspected handovers of sophisticated Russian- or Iranian-supplied arms to Assad’s guerrilla allies in Lebanon. An Israeli military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the talks with Moscow would focus on aerial operations in Syria and “electromagnetic coordination.” The latter appeared to refer to the sides agreeing not to scramble each other’s radio communications or radar-tracking systems, and devising ways of identifying each other’s forces ahead of any unintended confrontation in the heat of battle. Israel and Russia will also coordinate on sea operations off Syria’s Mediterranean coast, where Moscow has a major naval base, the Israeli officer said.

Skip to comments. Putin’s offer to shield & develop Israel’s gas fields predated Russia’s military buildup in Syria Posted on by kindred More than a fortnight ago, Russian President Vladimir put a proposition to Israel for Moscow to undertake responsibility for guarding Israels Mediterranean gas fields, along with the offer of a Russian investment of $7-10 billion for developing Leviathan, the largest well, and building a pipeline to Turkey for exporting the gas to Europe, debkafile reports. The offer was made to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in confidential phone conversations and through quiet envoys. At the time, Putin did not share with Netanyahu his plans for an imminent buildup of marines, air force units, warships and missiles in Syria, although the plan had been worked out in detail with Tehran in late July. The Russian ruler put it this way: Leviathan abuts on the fringes of Lebanons economic water zone and is therefore vulnerable to potential sabotage by Iran, Syria or Hizballah, whether by commando or rocket attack. A multibillion Russian investment in the field would make it a Russian project which neither Syria nor Hizballah would dare attack, even though it belongs to Israel. But now the situation has assumed a different face. Russian forces are streaming to Latakia, and Moscow has declared the area from Tartous, Syria up to Cyprus closed to shipping and air traffic from Sept. 15 to Oct. 7 in view of a military exercise including test firings of guided missiles from Russian warships. When he offered a shield for Israeli gas fields in late August, The Russian ruler knew that implementation would rest with Russian military forces on the spot, rather than Iranian and Syrian reluctance to harm Russian interests. Then, on Aug. 30, Netanyahu discussed the new Russian proposition with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi when they met in Florence, in the context of the former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis involvement in Middle Eastern and European energy business and his close ties with Putin. Berlusconi and Netanyahu are also good friends. The Israeli prime minister never explicitly confirmed to Putin that he would consider the Russian transaction. He hesitated because he sensed that a deal with Moscow for gas projects would be unacceptable to Washington and Noble Energy of Texas, which holds a 39.66 percent share in the consortium controlling Leviathan, as well as stakes in the smaller Tanin and Tamar gas wells. Meanwhile, two Israeli ministers, Moshe Kahlon, finance, and Arye Deri, economy, consistently obstructed the final government go-ahead for gas production, tactics which also held Netanyahu back from his reply to Putin. But when the fresh influx of Russian troops and hardware to Syria became known (first revealed by debkafile on Sept.1), Netanyahu began to appreciate that, not only had Israels military and strategic situation with regard to Syria and the eastern Mediterranean been stood on its head, so too had foreign investment prospects for development projects in Israeli gas. Israels strategic landscape had in fact changed radically in four respects: 1. Its government can no longer accept as a working hypothesis (which never, incidentally, held up) the short term expectancy of the Assad regime. The injection of Russian military might, combined with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards forces, have given Assad a substantial lease of life. The Israel Defense Forces must therefore revamp its posture on the Syrian front, and reassess its sponsorship of the select rebel groups which are holding the line in southern Syria against hostile Iranian or Hizballah cross-border attacks on northern Israel. The changing attitude was suggested in views heard in the last couple of days from top Israeli security officials, who now say that leaving Assad in office might be the better option, after all. 2. The new Russian ground, air and sea buildup taking shape in Syria provides a shield not just for the Assad regime but also Hizballah. This too calls for changes in Israels military posture. 3. The Russian military presence in Syria seriously inhibits Israels flexibility for launching military action against Iranian or Hizballah targets when needed. 4. Three aspects of the new situation stand out prominently: a) The Russian air force and navy are the strongest foreign military force in the eastern Mediterranean. The US deplloys nothing comparable. b) Israels military strength is substantial but no one is looking for a military clash with the Russians, although this did occur four decades ago, when Israel was fighting for its life against Russian-backed Arab invasions. c) In view of the prevalence of the Russian military presence in the eastern Mediterranean, it is hard to see any foreign investor coming forward to sink billions of dollars in Israeli gas. d) Although Russia called Saturday, Sept. 12, for military-to-military cooperation with the United States to avert "unintended incidents" amid its naval "exercises" off the coast of Syria, the tone of the call was cynical. It is more than likely that Moscow may revert to the original Putin offer of a Russian defense shield for Israeli gas fields. But with such strong Russian cards in place in Syria, he may well stiffen his terms for this deal. TOPICS: Culture/Society Foreign Affairs Government News/Current Events KEYWORDS: Putin is after the gas fields of Israel and will build up Russian forces and ally himself with Iran and others to steal their gas and oil for his nation. We may be seeing the beginning of the one of the three latter day wars prophecied of in the Scriptures. To: kindred Or you’re referencing a DEBKA article, it is nonsense, and TEOTWAWKI #3,582,294 is wrong again. To: kindred I think Putin was far more interested in having control over Europe, as Israel could export there to weaken Russian control over their energy supply. by 3 posted onby yefragetuwrabrumuy ("Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative." -Obama, 09-24-11) To: EEGator Debka is also saying that the ChiComs now have a carrier and escort in Syria now. by 4 posted onby fella ("As it was before Noah so shall it be again,") To: EEGator So all the Russian and Chinese advanced military equipment is a mirage? Looks like the ingrained FR anti-debka dogma is reaching out again. by 5 posted onby PIF (They came for me and mine ... now it is your turn ...) To: PIF 1. Russia has moved military equipment into Syria. 2. Debka is largely garbage. 3. Many points in the article are ridiculous hearsay. 4. My previous post was to the original poster’s #1 comment...specifically prophecy garbage. How many times does one get to falsely babble about Ezekiel 38 or some other TEOTWAWKI nonsense? Fear mongering, with no basis in reality, should be met with mockery. To: kindred The fox has offered to guard the henhouse. by 7 posted onby UnwashedPeasant (A slave is one who waits for someone to come and free him.) To: EEGator Well said. I have a collection of rapture and end days books dating from the 60’s but especially the 70’s. It is a hoot to re-read it. Exact dates for the rapture, naming the anti Christ, the rise of religious Israel. To: EEGator ... four big Su-30SM Flanker-C and 12 smaller Su-25 Frogfoot fighter jets parked Sept. 20 at the al-Assad International ..." this picture is a lie:... four big Su-30SM Flanker-C and 12 smaller Su-25 Frogfoot fighter jets parked Sept. 20 at the al-Assad International ..." by 9 posted onby PIF (They came for me and mine ... now it is your turn ...)

He hesitated because he sensed that a deal with Moscow for gas projects would be unacceptable to Washington and Noble Energy of Texas, which holds a 39.66 percent share in the consortium controlling Leviathan, as well as stakes in the smaller Tanin and Tamar gas wells. Meanwhile, two Israeli ministers, Moshe Kahlon, finance, and Arye Deri, economy, consistently obstructed the final government go-ahead for gas production, tactics which also held Netanyahu back from his reply to Putin. But when the fresh influx of Russian troops and hardware to Syria became known (first revealed by debkafile on Sept.1), Netanyahu began to appreciate that, not only had Israels military and strategic situation with regard to Syria and the eastern Mediterranean been stood on its head, so too had foreign investment prospects for development projects in Israeli gas. Israels strategic landscape had in fact changed radically in four respects: 1. Its government can no longer accept as a working hypothesis (which never, incidentally, held up) the short term expectancy of the Assad regime. The injection of Russian military might, combined with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards forces, have given Assad a substantial lease of life. The Israel Defense Forces must therefore revamp its posture on the Syrian front, and reassess its sponsorship of the select rebel groups which are holding the line in southern Syria against hostile Iranian or Hizballah cross-border attacks on northern Israel. The changing attitude was suggested in views heard in the last couple of days from top Israeli security officials, who now say that leaving Assad in office might be the better option, after all. 2. The new Russian ground, air and sea buildup taking shape in Syria provides a shield not just for the Assad regime but also Hizballah. This too calls for changes in Israels military posture. 3. The Russian military presence in Syria seriously inhibits Israels flexibility for launching military action against Iranian or Hizballah targets when needed. 4. Three aspects of the new situation stand out prominently: a) The Russian air force and navy are the strongest foreign military force in the eastern Mediterranean. The US deplloys nothing comparable. b) Israels military strength is substantial but no one is looking for a military clash with the Russians, although this did occur four decades ago, when Israel was fighting for its life against Russian-backed Arab invasions. c) In view of the prevalence of the Russian military presence in the eastern Mediterranean, it is hard to see any foreign investor coming forward to sink billions of dollars in Israeli gas. d) Although Russia called Saturday, Sept. 12, for military-to-military cooperation with the United States to avert "unintended incidents" amid its naval "exercises" off the coast of Syria, the tone of the call was cynical. It is more than likely that Moscow may revert to the original Putin offer of a Russian defense shield for Israeli gas fields. But with such strong Russian cards in place in Syria, he may well stiffen his terms for this deal.

Skip to comments. Putin’s offer to shield & develop Israel’s gas fields predated Russia’s military buildup in Syria Posted on by kindred More than a fortnight ago, Russian President Vladimir put a proposition to Israel for Moscow to undertake responsibility for guarding Israels Mediterranean gas fields, along with the offer of a Russian investment of $7-10 billion for developing Leviathan, the largest well, and building a pipeline to Turkey for exporting the gas to Europe, debkafile reports. The offer was made to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in confidential phone conversations and through quiet envoys. At the time, Putin did not share with Netanyahu his plans for an imminent buildup of marines, air force units, warships and missiles in Syria, although the plan had been worked out in detail with Tehran in late July. The Russian ruler put it this way: Leviathan abuts on the fringes of Lebanons economic water zone and is therefore vulnerable to potential sabotage by Iran, Syria or Hizballah, whether by commando or rocket attack. A multibillion Russian investment in the field would make it a Russian project which neither Syria nor Hizballah would dare attack, even though it belongs to Israel. But now the situation has assumed a different face. Russian forces are streaming to Latakia, and Moscow has declared the area from Tartous, Syria up to Cyprus closed to shipping and air traffic from Sept. 15 to Oct. 7 in view of a military exercise including test firings of guided missiles from Russian warships. When he offered a shield for Israeli gas fields in late August, The Russian ruler knew that implementation would rest with Russian military forces on the spot, rather than Iranian and Syrian reluctance to harm Russian interests. Then, on Aug. 30, Netanyahu discussed the new Russian proposition with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi when they met in Florence, in the context of the former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis involvement in Middle Eastern and European energy business and his close ties with Putin. Berlusconi and Netanyahu are also good friends. The Israeli prime minister never explicitly confirmed to Putin that he would consider the Russian transaction.

Israel is not coordinating its operations in Syria with Russia, Israel’s defense minister said Tuesday, despite officials indicating cooperation between Jerusalem and the Kremlin as Moscow ramps up its involvement in the war-torn country. Moshe Ya’alon made the comments a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly expressed unhappiness with an Israeli strike on Syrian army positions following the landing of an errant shell in the Israeli Golan Heights. Israeli chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot met with his Russian counterpart Valery Gerasimov in Moscow last week, some hours after the heads of the two countries also met in the Russian capital, and the two military chiefs agreed to set up a work group which will establish a mechanism of cooperation between the two armies. Their deputies are slated lead this effort, with an initial meeting planned early next month. Despite that development, Ya’alon said that Israel “doesn’t coordinate our operations with Russia.” Speaking during a visit to communities along the Gaza border, Ya’alon said Russia’s growing presence in Syria was along the coast, far from Israel. But he said Israel will not tolerate advanced weapons reaching Hezbollah, which has fought alongside Syrian Army troops.

Israeli prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Moscow last week to discuss Russia’s military involvement in Syria and keep Israel from tangling with Russia during forays into the country to stymie planned or weapons transfers to Hezbollah. Ya’alon said Netanyahu told Putin that Israel had no interest in trying to depose the Bashar Assad regime, an ally of Russia. Advertisement “We are not involved and we don’t have any interest to intervene in the civil war in Syria, but we have to keep our interests,” he said Netanyahu told the Russian leader. “Whoever tries to violate our sovereignty, we’ll strike them, whoever tried to transfer advanced armaments to terrorist groups, particularly Hezbollah, we’ll strike them, and whoever tries to transfer chemical weapons to terrorist groups, or Hezbollah, we’ll strike them,” Ya’alon said. Russia has increased its military presence in Syria in recent weeks, and reportedly deployed advanced Su-34 fighter bombers to an airbase near the city of Latakia, on the Mediterranean coast. At least six of the sophisticated bombers were spotted landing near the airbase, the Aviationist reported Tuesday. A French news crew also managed to film advanced Russian planes at the Latakia airbase, the first on the ground confirmation of Moscow’s stepped up involvement in Syria. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C88sbemrzfA Ya’alon said Israeli warplanes on Monday targeted two Syrian artillery guns suspected of shelling inside the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. Advertisement The IDF launched artillery strikes on two Syrian military targets across Israel’s border on the Golan Heights on Sunday night, responding to errant mortar fire launched from Syria that has landed in Israel in the past two days. At least two Syrian soldiers were killed in the IDF shelling, according to an unconfirmed report by the Israel Hayom website. Former Israeli ambassador to Russia Zvi Magen said Tuesday that Moscow would likely make do with condemning Israeli actions but stop short of any meaningful response to Israeli strikes against Assad’s forces. Russia has characterized its military build-up as normal aid to Assad meant to help him fight the Islamic State group. In spite of the recent moves, retired Israeli army Col. Jacques Neriah said Russia has a “moderate presence” in Syria. “It will help in stabilizing the area, and especially if Russia has the intent to fight the Islamic State together with the United States and the Western coalition,” said the former deputy head for assessment of the Israeli army’s military intelligence.

News article:
Israeli responses to Syrian fighting bleeding into the Golan Heights will likely not change, despite Russia’s recent decision to take a more active role in the civil war there, a former ambassador to Moscow said Tuesday. Though occasional mortar shells and rockets from nearby Syria have been falling on the Israeli Golan Heights for years, increased Russian support for the Bashar Assad regime has changed the dynamic of the Syrian civil war and raised questions over how Israel will respond to attacks from across the border. On Monday, Israeli forces hit two Syrian positions in response to errant mortar fire that landed in the Golan, as it has in dozens of instances in the last several years. The move reportedly drew Russian consternation, but little else in the form of a response from Moscow. According to Zvi Magen, who served as Israel’s envoy to Russia from 1998 to 1999, that is likely as far as the Kremlin will go. Verbal condemnation is one thing, “but actual consequences are a long way away,” said Magen, who is also a senior research fellow at the Tel Aviv University-affiliated Institute for National Security Studies. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “They’re just hoping that Israel doesn’t attack too much,” he said. Last Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two top IDF generals — Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot and Military Intelligence Chief Hertzi Halevi — traveled to Moscow last week to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the leaders of the Russian military. In these meetings, the Israeli delegation reportedly made it clear to their Russian counterparts that though Israel would maintain its position of noninvolvement in the civil war, it would not allow Hezbollah and other terrorist groups to amass advanced weapons systems nor would it tolerate attacks against the Golan Heights. Advertisement During the three-hour meeting, Putin accepted Netanyahu’s position, reportedly telling him, “We are aware of the shelling against Israel and we condemn all such shelling.” As this was the first of such attacks on the Golan Heights since the meeting in Moscow, Magen said, “Israel was quick to respond to the rocket fire in order to show that it does not intend to shy away.” However, Russia was also quick to respond in its own way, despite the meeting with Netanyahu, with Putin criticizing Israel’s attack on the Syrian army in response to the rocket fire from the civil war. The Russian president again acknowledged Israel’s security concerns, but added he was “worried” by the IDF’s periodic strikes on positions in the embattled territory. “Putin, for his part, made it a point to say his piece so that they wouldn’t look like chumps,” Magen said. Israel is loath to pick a fight with the Russian Bear and potentially cause a break with Russia, with which Israel has shared diplomatic, military, business and cultural ties for decades. Advertisement However, Magen claimed, Russian criticism “will not have an influence” on future IDF attacks. Official Israeli policy has been to respond forcefully to every rocket and mortar that crosses the border into Israel — deliberate or otherwise, Magen explained. “If it was a mistake or not, we have responded to every attack because otherwise they won’t stop,” he said. However, Israel has not actually responded to every attack. Last month, for instance, two mortar shells landed in the Israeli Golan Heights, but caused no damage or injuries. The IDF did not respond with return fire. No one was injured in the rocket fire on Saturday night and Sunday night either and in fact the attacks did not even trigger a siren due to their distance from Israeli settlements, but the IDF nevertheless responded with artillery fire on two Syrian army positions, reportedly killing a deputy brigade commander of the Syrian army’s 90th battalion. “It was determined by the relevant parties both at the state and military levels to respond,” an IDF official explained, though they refrained from discussing what led to their determinations. Though in the past, the IDF has returned fire to the source of the attack — regardless of which side in the conflict was responsible — military officials made it clear in this week’s attacks that Israel “sees the Syrian regime and its army as responsible for what happens in the field.”

Israeli responses to Syrian fighting bleeding into the Golan Heights will likely not change, despite Russia’s recent decision to take a more active role in the civil war there, a former ambassador to Moscow said Tuesday. Though occasional mortar shells and rockets from nearby Syria have been falling on the Israeli Golan Heights for years, increased Russian support for the Bashar Assad regime has changed the dynamic of the Syrian civil war and raised questions over how Israel will respond to attacks from across the border. On Monday, Israeli forces hit two Syrian positions in response to errant mortar fire that landed in the Golan, as it has in dozens of instances in the last several years. The move reportedly drew Russian consternation, but little else in the form of a response from Moscow. According to Zvi Magen, who served as Israel’s envoy to Russia from 1998 to 1999, that is likely as far as the Kremlin will go. Verbal condemnation is one thing, “but actual consequences are a long way away,” said Magen, who is also a senior research fellow at the Tel Aviv University-affiliated Institute for National Security Studies.

Last Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two top IDF generals — Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot and Military Intelligence Chief Hertzi Halevi — traveled to Moscow last week to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the leaders of the Russian military. In these meetings, the Israeli delegation reportedly made it clear to their Russian counterparts that though Israel would maintain its position of noninvolvement in the civil war, it would not allow Hezbollah and other terrorist groups to amass advanced weapons systems nor would it tolerate attacks against the Golan Heights. Advertisement During the three-hour meeting, Putin accepted Netanyahu’s position, reportedly telling him, “We are aware of the shelling against Israel and we condemn all such shelling.” As this was the first of such attacks on the Golan Heights since the meeting in Moscow, Magen said, “Israel was quick to respond to the rocket fire in order to show that it does not intend to shy away.” However, Russia was also quick to respond in its own way, despite the meeting with Netanyahu, with Putin criticizing Israel’s attack on the Syrian army in response to the rocket fire from the civil war. The Russian president again acknowledged Israel’s security concerns, but added he was “worried” by the IDF’s periodic strikes on positions in the embattled territory. “Putin, for his part, made it a point to say his piece so that they wouldn’t look like chumps,” Magen said. Israel is loath to pick a fight with the Russian Bear and potentially cause a break with Russia, with which Israel has shared diplomatic, military, business and cultural ties for decades. Advertisement However, Magen claimed, Russian criticism “will not have an influence” on future IDF attacks. Official Israeli policy has been to respond forcefully to every rocket and mortar that crosses the border into Israel — deliberate or otherwise, Magen explained. “If it was a mistake or not, we have responded to every attack because otherwise they won’t stop,” he said. However, Israel has not actually responded to every attack. Last month, for instance, two mortar shells landed in the Israeli Golan Heights, but caused no damage or injuries. The IDF did not respond with return fire. No one was injured in the rocket fire on Saturday night and Sunday night either and in fact the attacks did not even trigger a siren due to their distance from Israeli settlements, but the IDF nevertheless responded with artillery fire on two Syrian army positions, reportedly killing a deputy brigade commander of the Syrian army’s 90th battalion. “It was determined by the relevant parties both at the state and military levels to respond,” an IDF official explained, though they refrained from discussing what led to their determinations.

Russia informed Israel ahead of its Wednesday airstrikes — the first it carried out in Syria — targeting rebel strongholds there, Israeli officials said. About an hour before the aerial bombardment near Homs, Moscow contacted several senior Israeli officials, including National Security Adviser Yossi Cohen, to apprise them. The advance notice was in keeping with an understanding reached between Israel and Russia last week, aimed at avoiding accidental confrontations between the two countries in Syrian airspace. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a September 20 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow “established a mechanism” to “prevent misunderstandings between IDF forces and Russian forces” operating in the war-torn country. Israel has been watching warily as Russia has ramped up its military support to Syria to bolster the Bashar Assad regime, some of which Jerusalem fears may reach the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, which is hostile to the Jewish state. Israeli officials have warned that Hezbollah agents have used the fighting in Syria as cover to build up forces along Israel’s Golan Heights border with the intention of carrying out attacks. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Israel has carried out a number of airstrikes in Syria over the last several years, reportedly targeting the Iranian-backed Hezbollah cells and weapons shipments. Putin said Wednesday’s action was preemptive, warning that Moscow would be hunting down Islamic State militants before they target Russia. “The only correct way to fight international terrorism… is to act preemptively, to battle and destroy fighters and terrorists on the territories they have already seized, not to wait for them to come to us,” he said in televised comments. Advertisement The Russian defense ministry said Moscow had launched targeted air raids against the “terrorists” in Syria. A Syrian security source said the warplanes hit three provinces. The strikes came as Putin and US President Barack Obama push rival plans on ways to defeat the Islamic State group in Syria and on the future role of the country’s embattled leader Assad. A US defense official said Wednesday that Moscow also gave Washington a heads-up prior to the strikes in Homs. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the bombs killed at least 30 jihadists, including 12 child soldiers. The strikes are Moscow’s first military engagement in a distant theater of war since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Putin is seeking to muscle his way back onto the world stage after months of Western isolation following Russia’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and support for a separatist insurgency in the east of the ex-Soviet country.

JERUSALEM (JTA) — Russia reportedly informed Israel ahead of its airstrikes on western Syria against ISIS. On Wednesday, Russia bombed rebel targets in Syria near Homs following unanimous approval by its parliament to President Vladimir Putin’s request to initiate the attacks. The strikes were trying to prop up the regime of President Bashar Assad, a Russian ally. Russia’s Defense Ministry said the airstrikes were carried out “against positions held by the Islamic State in Syrian territory.” Russian officials reportedly contacted their Israeli defense establishment counterparts about an hour before the attack, Israel’s Channel 2 reported. Russian government officials also contacted Yossi Cohen, the national security adviser in the Prime Minister’s Office, Haaretz reported, citing unnamed senior Israeli officials. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Putin in Moscow to discuss the security threats to Israel from Syria. During the meeting, the two leaders agreed to coordinate between the Israeli and Russian militaries in order to avoid conflicts over Syria. Putin also told Netanyahu that Syria is not in a position to open a second front against Israel. Russia reportedly also informed the United States before its airstrikes. It has called on U.S. and coalition aircraft not to fly over Syria. State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the Russian airstrikes “in no way will alter the United States or coalition missions” against the Islamic State in Syria. A U.S.-led coalition has launched thousands of airstrikes on Syria over the past year. Putin reportedly has said he will not introduce ground forces into Syria.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to set up a joint team of both the countries as Moscow ramps up its military support for Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, who is losing ground to Islamist militants in country’s bloody civil war. Israel has set up a joint mechanism with the Russian military to coordinate their operations in Syria and avoid any accidental confrontations between the two. Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu said the meetings in Moscow were aimed at preventing “misunderstandings” in Syria between the Russian and Israeli military. “We established a mechanism to prevent those misunderstandings” said Mr Netanyahu. Each of the militaries’ deputy chiefs will hold their first meeting soon and will discuss coordination of aerial, naval and electromagnetic operations around Syria. Israel in the past has occasionally conducted airstrikes in Syria to foil suspected handovers of Russian or Iranian-supplied arms to Assad’s guerrilla allies in Lebanon. The new talks could prevent a showdown between Israel and Russia in the region. This meeting between the two leaders is of potentially great importance and it may change geo-political realignment of the region. This meeting was attended by the head of the IDF, the chief of military intelligence, and their Russian counterparts which clearly illustrates its importance. The two countries have historically been on opposite sides of the Middle East divide, with the former Soviet Union being the principal supplier of military equipment and training for the Egyptian and Syrian armies for decades and Israel was always the main United States ally in the region. However, in the complex situation which has evolved in Syria both Jerusalem and Moscow have defined areas where cooperation can be mutually beneficial. Israel wants to act swiftly for safeguarding its own interests which is more important than pleasing the US government or American Jews. What’s happening in the region is part of a renewal of the Cold War. Israel does not want to be engaged in a proxy-war between the US and Russia, such as occurred in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, with great disaster for those places. The most obvious reason which concerns Israel is its air force’s freedom of action over Syria in curbing arms shipments to Hezbollah in Lebanon and maintaining air surveillance. The Russians are amassing a substantial air arm at a base on the Syrian coast and have begun installing ground-to-air missiles, which could pose a formidable threat to Israeli aircraft if there is no coordination. Moreover relation between Israel and Russia was not bad all the time. The Soviet Union was one of the first countries to officially recognize Israel in 1948. There are lots of reasons for the recently improved ties between Russia and Israel, but key among them is the fact that Israel has become increasingly Russian in the past 20 years. Putin is deeply concerned with the well being of Russian nationals wherever they reside, up to and including invading other countries to protect their interests, and 15 percent of Israeli immigrants are from the former Soviet Union. Russians can also benefit from good relations with the Israeli. Israel has quality intelligence on everything that is taking place in Syria and as time goes by the Russians might need Israel’s assistance in confronting the complexities of the fighting there. Israeli security sources say they could be in a position to inform the Russians about plans by Syrian rebels to hit Russian military targets or provide information about persons they might be seeking. Financially, Russia is struggling with low oil prices and Western sanctions, and it’s keenly looking for new markets for its armaments, Israel is a generous customer with a large defence budget. Putin desperately wants Russia to be a world power again, to be consequential and at the centre of major global decisions. Russian have good relations with Shia camp led by Iran and after having cordial relations with Israelis as well they will be in position to influence whole region significantly. The Russians and the Israelis agreed to establish a hotline between their militaries in order to minimise the chance of their hostile encounter. Efforts are also being made to stepped-up Russian-Israeli trade relations. Russia and Israel have been in discussions about increasing Israeli agricultural exports to Russia as well as other new economic projects.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to set up a joint team of both the countries as Moscow ramps up its military support for Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, who is losing ground to Islamist militants in country’s bloody civil war. Israel has set up a joint mechanism with the Russian military to coordinate their operations in Syria and avoid any accidental confrontations between the two. Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu said the meetings in Moscow were aimed at preventing “misunderstandings” in Syria between the Russian and Israeli military. “We established a mechanism to prevent those misunderstandings” said Mr Netanyahu. Each of the militaries’ deputy chiefs will hold their first meeting soon and will discuss coordination of aerial, naval and electromagnetic operations around Syria. Israel in the past has occasionally conducted airstrikes in Syria to foil suspected handovers of Russian or Iranian-supplied arms to Assad’s guerrilla allies in Lebanon. The new talks could prevent a showdown between Israel and Russia in the region. This meeting between the two leaders is of potentially great importance and it may change geo-political realignment of the region. This meeting was attended by the head of the IDF, the chief of military intelligence, and their Russian counterparts which clearly illustrates its importance. The two countries have historically been on opposite sides of the Middle East divide, with the former Soviet Union being the principal supplier of military equipment and training for the Egyptian and Syrian armies for decades and Israel was always the main United States ally in the region. However, in the complex situation which has evolved in Syria both Jerusalem and Moscow have defined areas where cooperation can be mutually beneficial. Israel wants to act swiftly for safeguarding its own interests which is more important than pleasing the US government or American Jews. What’s happening in the region is part of a renewal of the Cold War. Israel does not want to be engaged in a proxy-war between the US and Russia, such as occurred in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, with great disaster for those places. The most obvious reason which concerns Israel is its air force’s freedom of action over Syria in curbing arms shipments to Hezbollah in Lebanon and maintaining air surveillance. The Russians are amassing a substantial air arm at a base on the Syrian coast and have begun installing ground-to-air missiles, which could pose a formidable threat to Israeli aircraft if there is no coordination. Moreover relation between Israel and Russia was not bad all the time. The Soviet Union was one of the first countries to officially recognize Israel in 1948. There are lots of reasons for the recently improved ties between Russia and Israel, but key among them is the fact that Israel has become increasingly Russian in the past 20 years. Putin is deeply concerned with the well being of Russian nationals wherever they reside, up to and including invading other countries to protect their interests, and 15 percent of Israeli immigrants are from the former Soviet Union. Russians can also benefit from good relations with the Israeli. Israel has quality intelligence on everything that is taking place in Syria and as time goes by the Russians might need Israel’s assistance in confronting the complexities of the fighting there. Israeli security sources say they could be in a position to inform the Russians about plans by Syrian rebels to hit Russian military targets or provide information about persons they might be seeking. Financially, Russia is struggling with low oil prices and Western sanctions, and it’s keenly looking for new markets for its armaments, Israel is a generous customer with a large defence budget. Putin desperately wants Russia to be a world power again, to be consequential and at the centre of major global decisions. Russian have good relations with Shia camp led by Iran and after having cordial relations with Israelis as well they will be in position to influence whole region significantly. The Russians and the Israelis agreed to establish a hotline between their militaries in order to minimise the chance of their hostile encounter. Efforts are also being made to stepped-up Russian-Israeli trade relations. Russia and Israel have been in discussions about increasing Israeli agricultural exports to Russia as well as other new economic projects. Russia and Israel launched discussions on the prospects of creating a free-trade zone known as the Customs Union, which would bring together Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Israel. It’s clearly visible now that a new major realignment is emerging in the Middle East. But how it will going to work and its repercussion on the region is has to been seen in the future.

Israel is not coordinating our Syria response with Russia, Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said Tuesday in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin's statements that he was "worried" about recent Israeli strikes in Syria. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "The prime minister made it clear to President Putin that we are not getting involved in the debate of who will be in power, Assad or someone else," Ya'alon said during a tour of Gaza border communities. Earlier this month, Putin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met and declared the need for communication to avoid military "misunderstandings" near the Syrian-Israeli border. Russian fighter jets in Syria (screenshot) "We have our interests, and when they are threatened we act and will continue to act," continued Ya'alon. "This was made clear to the Russian president, and this is the result: During the holiday (Sukkot) we acted, and will to continue to act, against any violation of or damage to the interests I mentioned." "We will hit anyone who tries to violate our sovereignty, anyone who tries to transfer advanced weapons systems to terror organizations, especially Hezbollah, and anyone who tries to transfer chemical weapons to terror organizations and Hezbollah," he said. "There's been unrest in Syria, at our doorstep, for more than four years," he said, "yet we've managed to defend our borders. We will not tolerate any violation of our sovereignty. Once it happens, we will react." "There are other developments in Syria," he continued, "like the Russian and Iranian presence. But that's far away from us, in the north of the country. But we will not hesitate to take proactive measures to defend our interests, and the prime minister made it clear to President Putin." Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon (Avihu Shapira) Ya'alon also addressed the ongoing violence in Jerusalem. "Sadly, this is the work of some provocateurs, some of whom are Israeli Arabs – politicians as well as the Islamic Movement – who try to make political capital out of the violence in and around Temple Mount," he said. "And the Palestinian Authority, that has for years fanned the flames and stirred emotions about Temple Mount, doesn't stand idle either. We, however, have adhered very strictly to the status quo, for years." More than a year after the end of Operation Protective Edge, Ya'alon visited the border area around the Gaza strip together with Tamir Idan, the head of the local Sdot Negev Regional Council. "Local representatives tell me that there's a growing demand to live in the area," Ya'alon said. "Hamas, who rules the Gaza Strip, is deterred and faces domestic challenges. Radical groups that are affiliated with ISIS sometimes fire rockets at Israel to embarrass Hamas." "We employ carrots as well as sticks," he added. "We allow imports into the Strip to get the economy going – we don't want the locals to live in poverty, as long as it doesn't jeopardize our security. I hope the relative calm will persist in the foreseeable future." Several hours later, a rocket was fired from Gaza and was intercepted by Iron Dome above the city of Ashdod, the third in just under two weeks.

(JNS.org)—The heads of the Israeli and Russian militaries met for the first time Monday as the two countries announced further joint coordination of their Syria-related activities. Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eizenkot met with Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Army General Valery Vasilevich Gerasimov following a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin. At the Netanyahu-Putin meeting, the two nations agreed to form a “joint mechanism” in order to prevent any potential clashes between Israeli and Russian forces in Syria. An Israeli source said both sides agreed to coordinate in “air, naval, and electromagnetic areas,” and that the first joint working group between the two militaries will meet in two weeks, the Jerusalem Post reported. Israel has become increasingly concerned about the activity of Iran and its proxy—the Hezbollah terrorist group—in Syria, while Russia has been moving to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his fight against the Islamic State terrorist organization and other rebel groups. “I would say that the importance of preventing misunderstandings [between Israeli and Russian forces] is very big,” Netanyahu said after his meeting with Putin. “Israel is constantly working to prevent the transfer of advanced and deadly weaponry from Syrian territory to Hezbollah. Israel is not prepared to accept a second terrorist front that Iran is trying to build on the Golan Heights.”

News article:
The big losers are the US, its Arab and Western allies, and Israel, despite reports that Russia informed Washington and Jerusalem in advance of its air missions. Yet regardless what Israeli officials say, they will not be able to conceal the fact that Israel's previous unstoppable freedom of action and maneuverability in Syria is now restricted. A gun placed on stage in the first act must be fired by the last one. This axiom is attributed to Russian playwright Anton Chekov - the same one whose work Minister of Culture Miri Regev proudly declared she has never read.Even though it was clear that the extensive military buildup by the Russia Army in Syria was bound to eventually lead to military intervention in the civil war, the first Russian air strikes yesterday were received with a bit of surprise. Yesterday morning the Russia Duma (parliament) approved the use of military force - as if President Vladimir Putin really needed their approval - and yesterday by noon missions were executed near the towns of Homs, Hama, and Latakiya. According to Western sources, the Russians targeted positions of rebel groups opposing the regime of President Bashar Assad, including factions supported by the US. The Russian Ministry of Defense, on the other hand, said that its air force targeted ISIS.Nevertheless, one can assume that Russia is trying to create a division of labor that is not to the liking of the US and its Arab and Western coalition partners assembled to fight on two fronts: the Assad regime and Islamic State.The Russian logic is that the US-led coalition will attack ISIS and Russia will attack the rest of the rebel groups. Regardless of whether such a division will be in place de facto, one conclusion is emerging: the big winner of the new situation is Assad and his failed regime.There are already indications that his self-confidence is growing due to the newly formed supportive coalition of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah and partially the Iraqi government to save his neck.Really? If so, then why did Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself travel with the chief of staff and head of military intelligence to meet in Moscow two weeks ago? And why is the deputy chief of staff traveling next week to meet with his Russian counterpart? Of course, to have talks on "deconfliction" to avoid accidental clashes between Israel and the Russia armies.It doesn't mean necessarily that the IDF will not be able to respond in the future - as it did earlier this week to shells or rockets mistakenly or intentionally launched from Syria or to prevent terrorist attempts to penetrate the Golan Heights.Yet the question of what Putin's real goals are and what his grand strategy in Syria is, if he has one, puzzles Israeli and Western experts. All of them agree, however, that on the surface it seems that Putin hopes to achieve the following aims: to help Assad to consolidate his regime, even if it means allowing him to control only his "little Syria" fiefdom - or by a different name his "Alawaitestan;" to ensure Russian access to warm water ports in the Mediterranean; to safeguard Russia's last bastion and stronghold (Syria) in the Middle East; to enable Putin to conduct a confrontational foreign policy against the US; to leverage Syria as a bargaining chip for Russia to enhance agreements across the board - Ukraine versus Syria, for example - between world powers and to divide parts of the world to spheres of influence and interest, as it used to be during the cold war era; to contain ISIS - Putin may not care that the Islamic State controls chunks of Syria and Iraq, but he doesn't want it to advance in the direction of his back yard - the former Soviet- Muslim republic in Central Asia; to avoid sending "boots on the ground" to fight in Syria - for this purpose Putin has Hezbollah, Syrian and even Iranian- sponsored Shiite mercenaries to be used as cannon folder.Despite being an authoritative ruler, he doesn't want Russians to be returned in body bags to military funerals across Russia. He knows the lessons of the Soviet-era war in Afghanistan.From all of the above, it is also clear that the bloody civil war that has already caused the death of more than 250,000 Syrians will be prolonged because of Russian involvement, at least in the short term. Still, one should not rule out the possibility that in the long run Russia's entry may enhance the chance of a political-diplomatic settlement in which Assad will remain in power for a transition period and eventually step down.Against the background of negative ramifications on Israel's security posture, there is a possible positive side, although it is not politically correct to express it: the continuation of the war benefits Israel by enhancing its standing as an unmatched regional power, while Hezbollah and Iran are weakened by their involvement.

The big losers are the US, its Arab and Western allies, and Israel, despite reports that Russia informed Washington and Jerusalem in advance of its air missions. Yet regardless what Israeli officials say, they will not be able to conceal the fact that Israel's previous unstoppable freedom of action and maneuverability in Syria is now restricted. A gun placed on stage in the first act must be fired by the last one. This axiom is attributed to Russian playwright Anton Chekov - the same one whose work Minister of Culture Miri Regev proudly declared she has never read.Even though it was clear that the extensive military buildup by the Russia Army in Syria was bound to eventually lead to military intervention in the civil war, the first Russian air strikes yesterday were received with a bit of surprise. Yesterday morning the Russia Duma (parliament) approved the use of military force - as if President Vladimir Putin really needed their approval - and yesterday by noon missions were executed near the towns of Homs, Hama, and Latakiya. According to Western sources, the Russians targeted positions of rebel groups opposing the regime of President Bashar Assad, including factions supported by the US. The Russian Ministry of Defense, on the other hand, said that its air force targeted ISIS.Nevertheless, one can assume that Russia is trying to create a division of labor that is not to the liking of the US and its Arab and Western coalition partners assembled to fight on two fronts: the Assad regime and Islamic State.The Russian logic is that the US-led coalition will attack ISIS and Russia will attack the rest of the rebel groups.

News article:
On Wednesday the Obama administration was caught off guard by Russia’s rapid rise in Syria. As the Russians began bombing a US-supported militia along the Damascus-Homs highway, Secretary of State John Kerry was meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, at the UN. Just hours before their meeting Kerry was insisting that Russia’s presence in Syria would likely be a positive development. Reacting to the administration’s humiliation, Republican Sen. John McCain said, “This administration has confused our friends, encouraged our enemies, mistaken an excess of caution for prudence and replaced the risks of action with the perils of inaction.” McCain added that Russian President Vladimir Putin had stepped “into the wreckage of this administration’s Middle East policy.” While directed at the administration, McCain’s general point is universally applicable. Today is no time for an overabundance of caution. The system of centralized regimes that held sway in the Arab world since the breakup of the Ottoman Empire nearly a century ago has unraveled. The shape of the new order has yet to be determined. The war in Syria and the chaos and instability engulfing the region are part and parcel of the birth pangs of a new regional governing architecture now taking form. Actions taken by regional and global actors today will likely will influence power relations for generations. Putin understands the opportunity of the moment. He views the decomposition of Syria as an opportunity to rebuild Russia’s power and influence in the Middle East – at America’s expense. Russia isn’t the only strategic player seeking to exploit the war in Syria and the regional chaos. Turkey and Iran are also working assiduously to take advantage of the current absence of order to advance their long term interests. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is exploiting the rise of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq to fight the Kurds in both countries. Erdogan’s goal is twofold: to prevent the establishment of an independent Kurdistan and to disenfranchise the Kurds in Turkey. As for Iran, Syria is Iran’s bulwark against Sunni power in the Arab world and the logistical base for Tehran’s Shi’ite foreign legion Hezbollah. Iranian dictator Ali Khamenei is willing to fight to the bitter end to hold as much of Syrian territory as possible. Broadly speaking, Iran views the breakup of the Arab state system as both a threat and an opportunity. The chaos threatens Iran, because it has radicalized the Sunni world. If Sunni forces unite, their numeric advantage against Shi’ite Iran will imperil it. The power of Sunni numbers is the reason Bashar Assad now controls a mere sixth of Syrian territory. To prevent his fate from befalling them, the Iranians seek to destabilize neighboring regimes and where possible install proxy governments in their stead. Iran’s cultivation of alliances and proxy relationships with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida, and its phony war against Islamic State all point to an overarching goal of keeping Sunni forces separated and dependent on Tehran. The Iranian regime also fears the prospect of being overthrown by its domestic opponents. To counter this threat the regime engages in large-scale and ever escalating repression of its perceived foes. Iran’s nuclear program also plays a key role in the regime’s survival strategy. As Khamenei and his underlings see things, nuclear weapons protect the regime in three ways. They deter Iran’s external foes. They increase domestic support for the regime by enriching Iran which, no longer under international sanctions, sees its diplomatic and economic prestige massively enhanced due to its nuclear program. Finally, there is Iran’s war with Israel and the US. A nuclear-armed Iran is a direct threat to both countries. And this, too, is a boon for the mullacracy. From the regime’s perspective, fighting Israel and the US serves to neutralize the Sunni threat to the regime. The more Iran is seen as fighting Israel and the US the more legitimate it appears to Sunni jihadists. This then brings us to the Americans. Like the Russians, the Turks and the Iranians, President Barack Obama and his associates are strategic players. Unlike those powers however, the administration is moved not by raw power calculations but by ideological dictates. Obama and his advisers are convinced that the instability and radicalization of states and actors throughout the region is the consequence of the actions of past US administrations and those of America’s regional allies – first and foremost, Israel and Egypt. The basis for this conviction is the administration’s post-colonial ideological underpinnings. Because his strategy is based on ideological beliefs rather than power calculations rooted in reality, Obama’s position cannot be swayed by evidence, even when evidence shows that his administration’s policies endanger US national security. This brings us to Israel. Israel has limited power to influence regional events. It cannot change its neighbors’ values or cultures. Israel can however limit its neighbors’ ability to harm it and expand its ability to deter would be aggressors by among other things, using its power judiciously to influence now forming power balances between various regional and world actors. Israel has followed this model in Syria with notable success. At an early stage of the war our leaders recognized that aside from the Kurds, who have no shared border with us, there are no viable actors in Syria that are not dangerous to Israel. As a result, Israel has no interest in the victory of one group against others. The only actor in Syria that Israel has felt it necessary to actively rein in is Hezbollah. So it has acted repeatedly to prevent Hezbollah from using its operational presence in Syria as a means for augmenting its offensive capabilities in Lebanon. The problem with this strategy is that it has ignored the fact that from Hezbollah’s perspective, there is no operational difference between Lebanon and Syria. The war in Syria spread to Lebanon years ago. Now, with Iranian and Russian assistance, Hezbollah is beginning to develop the industrial capacity to bypass Israel and independently produce advanced weapons inside Lebanon. This rapid industrialization of Hezbollah’s military capabilities requires Israel to end its respect for the all-but-destroyed international border and take direct action against Hezbollah’s capabilities in Lebanon. This brings us to Hezbollah’s boss, Iran. For the past several years, the same caution that has led Israel to grant de facto immunity to Hezbollah forces in Lebanon has led to Israel’s passivity and deference to the Obama administration in relation to Iran’s nuclear program. With regard to Iran’s nuclear installations, the strategy of passivity has largely been forced onto an unwilling political leadership by Israel’s military leaders. For the past several years, the IDF’s General Staff has refused to support the government’s position on Iran’s nuclear program. Our military leaders have justified their insubordination by arguing that if Israel takes independent action against Iran’s nuclear program it will undermine its bilateral relations with the US, which they consider more important than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Although under the best of circumstances, the IDF’s position would be unacceptable from the perspective of democratic norms of governance, since the ideologically driven Obama administration took power seven years ago, the military’s position has imperiled the country. So long as Obama – or the ideology that informs his actions – remains in power in Washington, US security guarantees towards Israel will have no credibility. The IDF’s assessment that ties to the US are more important than preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power will remain incorrect, and dangerously so. Today is Israel’s opportunity to shape the future of the Middle East by not only preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power, but by preventing a regional nuclear arms race. The closer Iran comes to emerging as a nuclear power, the more Sunni regimes, including Islamic State, will seek their own nuclear capabilities. It goes without saying that the more regional actors have nuclear weapons, the more dangerous the region becomes for Israel, and indeed for the world as a whole. For many Israelis, the story of the week wasn’t Russia’s air strikes against US-allied forces in Syria. It was PLO chief and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s speech at the UN General Assembly. Leftists expressed horror in the face of Abbas’s threat to end the PLO’s adherence to the agreements it signed with Israel in the 1990s (and has stood in material breach of ever since). The government insisted, for its part that the reason the peace process has not brought peace is because Abbas and his PLO refuse to negotiate with Israel. Unfortunately, both sides’ responses to Abbas’s speech indicate that Israel has lost all semblance of strategic purpose in regard to the Palestinians. Fifteen years ago this week, on September 28, 2000, the Palestinians opened their terrorist war against Israel. Ever since it has been clear that no Palestinian faction is interested in living at peace with Israel. Despite this, for the past 15 years, Israel has refused to reconsider its strategic allegiance to the false notion that it has the ability to influence the hearts and minds of the Palestinians and bend them in the direction of peace. This delusional thinking is what caused the IDF’s General Staff to convene immediately after Operation Protective Edge ended and try to figure out how to rebuild Gaza. Ever since the cease-fire came into force, Hamas has diverted all the assistance it has received from Israel and the international community not to rebuild Gaza, but to rebuild its military capacity to harm Israel. And yet, from the IDF’s perspective, ever since the war ended our most urgent task has been to save Hamas and the Palestinians alike from reckoning with the price of their aggression. Likewise, Israel continues to insist that we have a strategic interest in peace with the PLO. Even if this is true in theory, chances are greater that unicorns will fall from the sky and prance through Jerusalem’s Old City than that the PLO will agree to make peace with Israel. Our continued defense of the PLO as a legitimate actor harms our ability to secure other strategic interests that are achievable and can improve Israel’s regional position. These interests include securing transportation arteries in Judea and Samaria and strengthening Israel’s military and political control over the areas. These interests have only grown more acute in recent years with the rise of jihadist forces throughout the region and among the Palestinians themselves. This brings us back to McCain and his strategic wisdom. Israel must not allow the risks of action to lure us into strategic paralysis that imperils our future. The more Israel allows other actors to determine the nature of the emerging regional order, the less secure Israel will be. The more willing we are to take calculated risks today the greater our ability will be to influence the future architecture of regional power relations and so minimize threats to our survival in the decades to come.

If Sunni forces unite, their numeric advantage against Shi’ite Iran will imperil it. The power of Sunni numbers is the reason Bashar Assad now controls a mere sixth of Syrian territory. To prevent his fate from befalling them, the Iranians seek to destabilize neighboring regimes and where possible install proxy governments in their stead. Iran’s cultivation of alliances and proxy relationships with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida, and its phony war against Islamic State all point to an overarching goal of keeping Sunni forces separated and dependent on Tehran. The Iranian regime also fears the prospect of being overthrown by its domestic opponents. To counter this threat the regime engages in large-scale and ever escalating repression of its perceived foes. Iran’s nuclear program also plays a key role in the regime’s survival strategy. As Khamenei and his underlings see things, nuclear weapons protect the regime in three ways. They deter Iran’s external foes. They increase domestic support for the regime by enriching Iran which, no longer under international sanctions, sees its diplomatic and economic prestige massively enhanced due to its nuclear program. Finally, there is Iran’s war with Israel and the US. A nuclear-armed Iran is a direct threat to both countries. And this, too, is a boon for the mullacracy. From the regime’s perspective, fighting Israel and the US serves to neutralize the Sunni threat to the regime. The more Iran is seen as fighting Israel and the US the more legitimate it appears to Sunni jihadists. This then brings us to the Americans. Like the Russians, the Turks and the Iranians, President Barack Obama and his associates are strategic players. Unlike those powers however, the administration is moved not by raw power calculations but by ideological dictates. Obama and his advisers are convinced that the instability and radicalization of states and actors throughout the region is the consequence of the actions of past US administrations and those of America’s regional allies – first and foremost, Israel and Egypt. The basis for this conviction is the administration’s post-colonial ideological underpinnings. Because his strategy is based on ideological beliefs rather than power calculations rooted in reality, Obama’s position cannot be swayed by evidence, even when evidence shows that his administration’s policies endanger US national security. This brings us to Israel. Israel has limited power to influence regional events. It cannot change its neighbors’ values or cultures. Israel can however limit its neighbors’ ability to harm it and expand its ability to deter would be aggressors by among other things, using its power judiciously to influence now forming power balances between various regional and world actors. Israel has followed this model in Syria with notable success. At an early stage of the war our leaders recognized that aside from the Kurds, who have no shared border with us, there are no viable actors in Syria that are not dangerous to Israel. As a result, Israel has no interest in the victory of one group against others. The only actor in Syria that Israel has felt it necessary to actively rein in is Hezbollah. So it has acted repeatedly to prevent Hezbollah from using its operational presence in Syria as a means for augmenting its offensive capabilities in Lebanon. The problem with this strategy is that it has ignored the fact that from Hezbollah’s perspective, there is no operational difference between Lebanon and Syria. The war in Syria spread to Lebanon years ago. Now, with Iranian and Russian assistance, Hezbollah is beginning to develop the industrial capacity to bypass Israel and independently produce advanced weapons inside Lebanon. This rapid industrialization of Hezbollah’s military capabilities requires Israel to end its respect for the all-but-destroyed international border and take direct action against Hezbollah’s capabilities in Lebanon. This brings us to Hezbollah’s boss, Iran. For the past several years, the same caution that has led Israel to grant de facto immunity to Hezbollah forces in Lebanon has led to Israel’s passivity and deference to the Obama administration in relation to Iran’s nuclear program. With regard to Iran’s nuclear installations, the strategy of passivity has largely been forced onto an unwilling political leadership by Israel’s military leaders. For the past several years, the IDF’s General Staff has refused to support the government’s position on Iran’s nuclear program. Our military leaders have justified their insubordination by arguing that if Israel takes independent action against Iran’s nuclear program it will undermine its bilateral relations with the US, which they consider more important than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Although under the best of circumstances, the IDF’s position would be unacceptable from the perspective of democratic norms of governance, since the ideologically driven Obama administration took power seven years ago, the military’s position has imperiled the country. So long as Obama – or the ideology that informs his actions – remains in power in Washington, US security guarantees towards Israel will have no credibility. The IDF’s assessment that ties to the US are more important than preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power will remain incorrect, and dangerously so. Today is Israel’s opportunity to shape the future of the Middle East by not only preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power, but by preventing a regional nuclear arms race. The closer Iran comes to emerging as a nuclear power, the more Sunni regimes, including Islamic State, will seek their own nuclear capabilities. It goes without saying that the more regional actors have nuclear weapons, the more dangerous the region becomes for Israel, and indeed for the world as a whole. For many Israelis, the story of the week wasn’t Russia’s air strikes against US-allied forces in Syria. It was PLO chief and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s speech at the UN General Assembly. Leftists expressed horror in the face of Abbas’s threat to end the PLO’s adherence to the agreements it signed with Israel in the 1990s (and has stood in material breach of ever since). The government insisted, for its part that the reason the peace process has not brought peace is because Abbas and his PLO refuse to negotiate with Israel. Unfortunately, both sides’ responses to Abbas’s speech indicate that Israel has lost all semblance of strategic purpose in regard to the Palestinians. Fifteen years ago this week, on September 28, 2000, the Palestinians opened their terrorist war against Israel. Ever since it has been clear that no Palestinian faction is interested in living at peace with Israel. Despite this, for the past 15 years, Israel has refused to reconsider its strategic allegiance to the false notion that it has the ability to influence the hearts and minds of the Palestinians and bend them in the direction of peace. This delusional thinking is what caused the IDF’s General Staff to convene immediately after Operation Protective Edge ended and try to figure out how to rebuild Gaza. Ever since the cease-fire came into force, Hamas has diverted all the assistance it has received from Israel and the international community not to rebuild Gaza, but to rebuild its military capacity to harm Israel. And yet, from the IDF’s perspective, ever since the war ended our most urgent task has been to save Hamas and the Palestinians alike from reckoning with the price of their aggression. Likewise, Israel continues to insist that we have a strategic interest in peace with the PLO. Even if this is true in theory, chances are greater that unicorns will fall from the sky and prance through Jerusalem’s Old City than that the PLO will agree to make peace with Israel. Our continued defense of the PLO as a legitimate actor harms our ability to secure other strategic interests that are achievable and can improve Israel’s regional position. These interests include securing transportation arteries in Judea and Samaria and strengthening Israel’s military and political control over the areas. These interests have only grown more acute in recent years with the rise of jihadist forces throughout the region and among the Palestinians themselves. This brings us back to McCain and his strategic wisdom. Israel must not allow the risks of action to lure us into strategic paralysis that imperils our future. The more Israel allows other actors to determine the nature of the emerging regional order, the less secure Israel will be. The more willing we are to take calculated risks today the greater our ability will be to influence the future architecture of regional power relations and so minimize threats to our survival in the decades to come.

News article:
Washington – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel wants to avoid an adversarial relationship with Moscow and is unsure how Russia’s recent military intervention in Syria will affect the situation there. Netanyahu, in an interview recorded for broadcast on Sunday on “CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS,” did not join the United States and other NATO nations in criticizing Russia’s taking military action in Syria. Russia has said it is only targeting Islamic State militants, but other countries including Britain have said the focus of its attacks has been other rebel groups fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad, Moscow’s ally. “We don’t want to go back to the days when, you know, Russia and Israel were in an adversarial position,” said Netanyahu, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow late last month. “I think we’ve changed the relationship. And it’s, on the whole, good.” Assad also is backed by Iran, Israel’s ardent foe and supporter of Hezbollah, and Israel is concerned that Russian weapons being deployed in Syria could end up with the militant group. “I went to Moscow to make it clear that we should avoid a clash between Russian forces and Israeli forces,” Netanyahu said. “In Syria, I’ve defined my goals. They’re to protect the security of my people and my country. Russia has different goals. But they shouldn’t clash.” He said Israel and Russia would talk soon about the situation. Asked if Russia’s entry in the Syrian conflict would be destabilizing, Netanyahu said: “I don’t know. I think time will tell.” Netanyahu signaled that Russian deployment would not deter Israel from continuing to take occasional military action in Syria. “If anybody wants to use Syrian territory to transfer nuclear weapons to Hezbollah, we’ll take action,” “And we continue to do that.” In an address at the U.N. General Assembly last week, Netanyahu had continued his harsh criticism of the deal reached by world powers to curb Iran’s nuclear program but looked ahead in the CNN interview. “I’m not going to rehash the deal,” he said. “… Let’s look forward. Let’s keep Iran’s feet to the fire. Let’s make sure that they keep all their obligations under the nuclear deal.”

Russia Israel military coordination talks on Syria to open Tuesday (MENAFN- The Peninsula)Russian President Vladimir Putin right listens to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their meeting at the Bocharov Ruchei residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi Russia Tuesday May 14 2013. JERUSALEM: A senior Russian military delegation will visit Israel on Tuesday for two days of talks on how the countries can avoid accidentally clashing while operating in Syria an Israeli military officer said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Sept. 21 to set up teams as Moscow steps up military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who has been losing ground to an Islamist-led insurgency. Israel is worried the Russian deployment which includes advanced anti-aircraft units and warplanes risks pitting Russian forces against its own over Syria. Israel has attacked Syrian armed forces and arch-foe Lebanese Hezbollah a Damascus ally during the four-year civil war in its hostile neighbour. It has said it holds the Syrian government responsible for any spillover of violence. On Sept. 27 Israel struck Syrian army targets on the Golan Heights in retaliation for cross-border rocket fire. In August it waged its heaviest bombardment since the conflict began killing Palestinian militants in response to cross-border fire. The Russian delegation will be led by First Deputy Chief of General Staff General Nikolai Bogdanovsky who will meet his Israeli counterpart Deputy Chief of Staff Major-General Yair Golan. "The two will meet at military command headquarters in Tel Aviv as part of the two-day visit of the Russian army delegation to Israel. Among other matters they will discuss regional coordination issues" the Israeli officer said on Monday. After Putin and Netanyahu met an Israeli military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters the countries would focus on aerial operations in Syria and "electromagnetic coordination". The latter appeared to refer to the sides agreeing not to scramble each other's radio communications or radar-tracking systems and devising ways of identifying each other's forces to avoid any unintended confrontation in the heat of battle. Israel and Russia will also coordinate on sea operations off Syria's Mediterranean coast where Moscow has a major naval base the Israeli officer said. In explaining Israel's objectives in coordination with the Russians Netanyahu told CNN in an interview on Sunday: "I went to Moscow to make it clear that we should avoid a clash between Russian forces and Israeli forces." "In Syria I've defined my goals. They're to protect the security of my people and my country. Russia has different goals. But they shouldn't clash" he said.

News article:

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Oct.7 By Anakhanum Khidayatova - Trend: Russia won't make compromise regarding the Syrian issue either with the US or Turkey, Yaakov Kedmi, diplomat, former head of Israel's 'Nativ' intelligence agency exclusively told Trend Oct.7. "The complicated relations between Russia and Turkey are full of contradictions," he said. "Both countries have common problems with Europe, as well as common economic interests, but Turkey is a NATO member." Russia supports Syrian's President Bashar al-Assad, sympathizes with Kurds, and speaks for secular Syria, said Kedmi, adding that meanwhile, Turkey pursues its own interests in Syria. Nevertheless, both Turkey and Russia want to have influence on Syria, according to the Israeli diplomat. The expert also touched upon the recent incident related to the violation of Turkey's airspace by Russian aircraft. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said that the planes of Russian air forces, involved in the military operation in Syria, violated Turkey's airspace on Oct. 3. The aircraft of Turkish air forces carried out warning sorties following the violation of the country's airspace. After this Russian planes left the Turkish airspace. Following the incident, Russian ambassador to Turkey was summoned to the country's Foreign Ministry to clarify the situation. "Despite Russia's apologies, Turkey strongly reacted to the unintended (for a few seconds) violation of its airspace by Russian aircraft," said Kedmi. In fact, Russia closed the Syrian airspace for Turkish air raids over the districts densely populated by Kurds as well, he added. The expert said that the further development of relations between Moscow and Ankara will depend on Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ability to act logically and within his country's interests, but not impulsively. --- Follow the author on Twitter: @Anahanum

News article:
Earlier this week, the UN Security Council passed a resolution ordering the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. Resolution 2118, the result of negotiations between the United States and Russia now gives these major powers the access to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons under international control. While Syrian President Bashar Al Assad has said his country would abide by the agreement, he added that such a process is “two-sided” and indicated it would only work if the US halts its threats of military action against Syria, does not arm Syrian rebels, and if Israel also ratifies its weapon ban conventions. Is there a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) double standard in works? Why is Israel not disarmed of its weapons? The fact of the matter is that Zionist Israel should be brought under the same microscope as Syria. Until Israel is forced to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and after they open their nuclear, chemical and biological capability to international inspection and sanction, we are going to continue to have problems. Most countries in the world including the United States, whose track record on weapons of mass destruction goes back to the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945 — until everybody is held to the same standard, we are going to have a very serious ongoing problem. Clearly, the responsible elements in the international community don’t want that. The fact of the matter is that a significant number of Japanese lost their lives in the most horrible fashion imaginable just so we could put on a show of demonstration of our possession of these weapons of mass destruction. One way to reduce the tensions surrounding the Syrian crisis would be for Israel to also give up its alleged chemical and biological weapons. Both Russia and the US are likely to ask Israel to dismantle its stocks because they did sign the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which came into force in 1997, but has never been ratified. It remains to be seen whether Tel Aviv will now ratify it, as well the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. The truth is that the main danger of WMD is the Israeli nuclear arsenal, whether the international community wants to believe it or not. — The reader is a South African educator based in Cape Town, South Africa

News article:
Russia's defense ministry said Thursday that its forces in Syria had set up a "hotline" with Israel's military to avoid clashes in the sky over the war-torn country. "Mutual information-sharing on the actions of aircraft has been established through a hotline between the Russian aviation command center at the Hmeimim air base and a command post of the Israeli air force," ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted as saying by Interfaxnews agency. The spokesman added that the two sides were undergoing training on how to cooperate. Russia has deployed a huge military presence in Syria over the last two weeks, to prop up the regime of Bashar al-Assad with a campaign of airstrikes it claims targets Islamic State (ISIS), but which Western officials have revealed is in fact almost exclusively focused on anti-Assad rebels, including those backed by the West. An American defense official on Wednesday said the US and Russia are nearing a pact on safety protocols to avoid outright warfare between American and Russian troops in the war-torn state, in a similar manner to the steps being taken with Israel. The fighting in Syria has frequently affected Israel, with "spillover" mortar fire onto the Golan Heights becoming a common occurrence. The most recent such incident took place this Tuesday, and the IDF responded by striking Syrian army sites, holding the regime responsible for attacks emanating from its sovereign territory. AFP contributed to this report.

The Russian Defense Ministry said Thursday that its forces in Syria had set up a “hotline” with the Israeli military to avoid clashes in the sky over the war-torn country. “Mutual information-sharing on the actions of aircraft has been established through a hotline between the Russian aviation command center at the Hmeimim air base and a command post of the Israeli Air Force,” ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency, adding that the two sides were undergoing training on how to cooperate. After Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his army was going to increase its activity in the Syrian theater, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Moscow to meet with him. During the September 21 meeting, Netanyahu and Putin focused on coordinating Israeli and Russian operations in Syria’s airspace. “It could come down to Israel and Russia agreeing to limit themselves to defined areas of operation in Syria, or even that they fly at daytime and we fly at night,” a former adviser to Netanyahu told Reuters at the time. “What’s important is Putin’s commitment not to get mixed up in arming Hezbollah, which should help Israel, if it goes in there, to keep a safe distance from the Russians. It is pretty clear that Putin is not looking for a fight with Israel,” the former adviser was quoted as saying.

Since the meeting, Israel on two occasions fired into Syrian territory after mortar shells launched in the Syrian civil war landed in the Golan Heights.

News article:
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions correspond to his words. In a speech to the Russian Duma (Parliament) last March, after the annexation of the Crimea, Putin declared: “If you compress a spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard”. Russia considers its near-abroad as a vital security belt in between its own forces and the NATO alliance. In a somewhat similar way, Israel’s security is totally dependent on its military control of the high ground of the West Bank and the Jordan River Valley. Russia understands Israel’s security concerns better than the Obama administration and certainly a whole lot better than the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party. Sanders himself is no surprise. A left-wing socialist in the Noam Chomsky mode, Sanders has gone even farther than Obama to turn the Democrats into America’s new party of isolationism. Obama, on the other hand, still appears willing to challenge the Russians in Europe and the Chinese in Asia. However in the Middle East, the Obama administration has never had a Syrian policy and therefore whatever regional policy it had ever possessed, is now in complete disrepair. The Democrats still maintain that after seven years in power in the White House, that everything that has happened in the Levant during that time can still be placed at the feet of the last Republican administration. Obama fails to mention the aftermath of the Bush surge and the concomitant Sunni defeat of the Jihadist extremists. And once this “Bush surge” was accomplished the party of Obama never mentions the incredible Iraqi election of 2010. In fact, the Democrats speak not a word of American negligence to elect as prime minister a true Iraqi moderate, Ayad Allawi. Obama’s motivations here are indeed quite murky, but the rapid rise of Iranian influence throughout Iraq can certainly be traced from this colossal US misstep. But just like President Putin’s “spring” in Europe, the success of the Bush experiment in democracy within Iraq had a strong “spring”, as well. In Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Jordan, Bahrain and Syria the success of the Bush democratic opening in Iraq ushered in the very hopeful Arab Spring. The Arab world had long been crippled by US and Russian-Soviet support for authoritarian governments. However with the Bush initiative, followed by Obama’s own Cairo speech, and what appeared at first hand to be a very successful 2010 Iraqi election, the Arab Middle East sprung into full democratic bloom. And for some reason (think Iran nuclear deal) this was followed by Obama’s strong support for the pro-Iranian al-Maliki government and its eventual repression of the Sunni community in Iraq. The Sunnis felt betrayed by Obama’s tacit cooperation with Iran throughout the Levant. In Syria, the Assad reaction to democratic forces was brutal. But the Obama administration never followed up its words of condemnation against Assad, with any real action. Meanwhile the Assad, Hezbollah and Iraqi links to Tehran eventually led to a region-wide Sunni response against a perceived US tilt toward Iran (once again think Obama and his nuclear deal). This perception enraged the Sunnis and brought back the Jihadi extremists. A full-fledged proxy sectarian war ensued, as all the Sunni Arab states and even NATO member, Turkey, felt abandoned by Washington. These states were compelled to stop Iran (by any possible means) in its drive for hegemony throughout the region. Enter Russia. Moscow has never believed in a unipolar, US dominated geopolitical structure. In the aftermath of the Cold War, US promises not to expand NATO eastward, were promptly broken. Once the Ukraine turned toward the EU, whatever permanent security architecture the Americans thought they had in place in Europe, fell like a house of cards. As I commented earlier, the Ukraine is to Russia, as the West Bank is to Israel. But Syria is another matter altogether. The effect of US policy toward the Sunnis within the Levant enabled a second, and far more tumultuous, rise of the Jihadi extremists within Iraq and Syria. Islamic State (ISIS) became a far more potent danger to Moscow then the initial peaceful democratic opposition in Syria or a successful electoral process in Iraq. Once the Islamic State eliminated the borders of the modern Middle East and claimed to represent a Caliphate; Moscow understood the real and abhorrent danger they posed. This encompassed not only the Middle East but Afghanistan, central Asia and the Russian Federation itself. With the possibility of central Asia being in play, Beijing became alarmed as well. Meanwhile alarm bells about Islamic extremism had gone off in India long ago. The vacuum created by the Obama de-linkage of the Iran nuclear deal with a stable conventional balance within the Middle East has unleashed unprecedented Sunni Jihadi extremist forces; forces that Russia felt were far more dangerous than the Shiites and Iran. But Moscow must certainly realize that for there to be a serious political settlement in Syria, Iranian influence needs to be vastly reduced and its links to non-state actors (Hezbollah) eliminated. Russia claims that it has some kind of understanding with Israel, but Iranian hegemony is as serious a threat to Jerusalem as it is to the the Sunni world. And Moscow must also understand that the Sunni world is by far more populated than Iran. In fact, Iran’s demographic future is as dismal as Russia’s. Sunni Islam will fight a “holy war” in Syria and Iraq in order to stem a Russian-Iranian alliance. Meanwhile the US elections are only a year away, and President Putin cannot count on an isolationist US administration to be installed. In fact, both Hillary Clinton and nearly all of the Republican presidential candidates are more like Cold Warriors than the left-wing of the Democratic Party. But a second Cold War is in no one’s interest. Yet, in a world of superpower quid pro quo, the Russian “spring” must now require some sort of an American “spring back”. This could happen in the Middle East; because that is exactly what most of established Washington is now calling for. Whether it be a no-fly zone or some other mechanism, the US position on the Russian “spring” — now directly into the Syrian sectarian conflagration — has caused its own political position to harden. The same is true for Washington’s allies. Turkey has begun to lean more heavily on NATO, while Germany, France and especially eastern Europe are all deeply concerned over Russian actions and the continued flow of Syrian immigrants into their territory. The eastern European countries are in a special quandary because they remember the Soviet era all to well. None of these countries have the inclination or the independence to move toward a more balanced European security structure. And their political nervousness is a direct result of Russian actions in both the Ukraine and Syria. This has placed the future of NATO under severe pressure. Meanwhile events in Taiwan and in the South China Sea (as well as the Ukraine and Syria) propel the world into very dangerous territory. Obama might appear weak, but a Russian or Chinese miscalculation might spur him towards some kind of action. After all, his legacy is now on the line as his potential successor, Hillary Clinton, has strengthened her position against both his Pacific trade deal and his lack of a coherent policy in Syria and the Middle East. Could Obama test both Russia and China in Asia or Europe? Or could his test be in the Middle East?. Now, for the first time, a Chinese aircraft carrier sails off the coast of Syria, along with a flotilla of Russian warships. And both Moscow and Beijing have promised Iran much greater military cooperation in the Gulf. Could an Iranian resupply of its proxies in Yemen become the theatre of a superpower showdown? Whatever Putin told Netanyahu at their recent meeting remains a secret, but Israel is an ally of the US and a bifurcated world order (a second Cold War or worse) is a direct danger to the Jewish state. Any attempt at Iranian conventional hegemony supported by Russia and China would mean a certain nuclear arms race in the Middle East. This would go way beyond anything which took place during the Soviet-US era. Since Israel has nuclear weapons, Iran could not achieve dominance within the region without such a force. However, President Putin is no fool. He knows that Shiite supremacy will be fought tooth and nail. And Iranian nuclear weapons are not in his interest. Only a positive political settlement in Syria can prevent inevitable chaos. But a political settlement in Syria requires a broad regional and global superstructure in order to be implemented on the ground. Moscow needs Jerusalem to help build that regional structure through an understanding on the future of nuclear weapons within the region. President Putin also needs the cooperation of US in order to establish such a regional settlement. And this implies US cooperation across the globe. Advertisement Yes the Russian “spring” has occurred. The question is where do we go from here? We might be headed toward an extremely dangerous time in world history. It certainly looks that way. However with the help of a visionary Israeli policy directed toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the cooperation of all the world’s powers; the end of state to state conventional conflict in the Middle East could also be achieved. One road is apocalyptical and the other road is very utopian. But there doesn’t seem to be much, if any, middle ground. Without a middle ground, utopian solutions become the realistic alternative. The Middle East could continue to deteriorate into superpower proxy client states, all with a destabilized nuclear arms component; or the region could seek genuine peace. Iran’s recent missile test and its now documented underground missile bases assure movement toward an apocalyptical nuclear scenario. The region could further fragment into near mini-states run by non-state actors. Worse still, terrorists might also have access to weapons of mass destruction. To put it simply, the region of the Middle East will either help to establish a multipolar cooperative world order; or continue on the path it’s already on and pay the consequences. The same is true for many other states in Europe and Asia, like France, Germany, India and Japan. But the three superpowers, Russia, China and the US must also begin to cooperate. And most importantly, they need to lead the way toward a durable world peace. We all do not need a repeat of the last century! Israel should choose a true, genuine and complete peace above nuclear weaponry. Praise the L-rd, the author of history, and pray for a new unprecedented era without war!

Islamic State (ISIS) became a far more potent danger to Moscow then the initial peaceful democratic opposition in Syria or a successful electoral process in Iraq. Once the Islamic State eliminated the borders of the modern Middle East and claimed to represent a Caliphate; Moscow understood the real and abhorrent danger they posed. This encompassed not only the Middle East but Afghanistan, central Asia and the Russian Federation itself. With the possibility of central Asia being in play, Beijing became alarmed as well. Meanwhile alarm bells about Islamic extremism had gone off in India long ago. The vacuum created by the Obama de-linkage of the Iran nuclear deal with a stable conventional balance within the Middle East has unleashed unprecedented Sunni Jihadi extremist forces; forces that Russia felt were far more dangerous than the Shiites and Iran. But Moscow must certainly realize that for there to be a serious political settlement in Syria, Iranian influence needs to be vastly reduced and its links to non-state actors (Hezbollah) eliminated. Russia claims that it has some kind of understanding with Israel, but Iranian hegemony is as serious a threat to Jerusalem as it is to the the Sunni world. And Moscow must also understand that the Sunni world is by far more populated than Iran. In fact, Iran’s demographic future is as dismal as Russia’s. Sunni Islam will fight a “holy war” in Syria and Iraq in order to stem a Russian-Iranian alliance. Meanwhile the US elections are only a year away, and President Putin cannot count on an isolationist US administration to be installed. In fact, both Hillary Clinton and nearly all of the Republican presidential candidates are more like Cold Warriors than the left-wing of the Democratic Party. But a second Cold War is in no one’s interest. Yet, in a world of superpower quid pro quo, the Russian “spring” must now require some sort of an American “spring back”. This could happen in the Middle East; because that is exactly what most of established Washington is now calling for. Whether it be a no-fly zone or some other mechanism, the US position on the Russian “spring” — now directly into the Syrian sectarian conflagration — has caused its own political position to harden. The same is true for Washington’s allies. Turkey has begun to lean more heavily on NATO, while Germany, France and especially eastern Europe are all deeply concerned over Russian actions and the continued flow of Syrian immigrants into their territory. The eastern European countries are in a special quandary because they remember the Soviet era all to well. None of these countries have the inclination or the independence to move toward a more balanced European security structure. And their political nervousness is a direct result of Russian actions in both the Ukraine and Syria. This has placed the future of NATO under severe pressure. Meanwhile events in Taiwan and in the South China Sea (as well as the Ukraine and Syria) propel the world into very dangerous territory. Obama might appear weak, but a Russian or Chinese miscalculation might spur him towards some kind of action. After all, his legacy is now on the line as his potential successor, Hillary Clinton, has strengthened her position against both his Pacific trade deal and his lack of a coherent policy in Syria and the Middle East. Could Obama test both Russia and China in Asia or Europe? Or could his test be in the Middle East?. Now, for the first time, a Chinese aircraft carrier sails off the coast of Syria, along with a flotilla of Russian warships. And both Moscow and Beijing have promised Iran much greater military cooperation in the Gulf. Could an Iranian resupply of its proxies in Yemen become the theatre of a superpower showdown? Whatever Putin told Netanyahu at their recent meeting remains a secret, but Israel is an ally of the US and a bifurcated world order (a second Cold War or worse) is a direct danger to the Jewish state. Any attempt at Iranian conventional hegemony supported by Russia and China would mean a certain nuclear arms race in the Middle East. This would go way beyond anything which took place during the Soviet-US era. Since Israel has nuclear weapons, Iran could not achieve dominance within the region without such a force. However, President Putin is no fool. He knows that Shiite supremacy will be fought tooth and nail. And Iranian nuclear weapons are not in his interest. Only a positive political settlement in Syria can prevent inevitable chaos. But a political settlement in Syria requires a broad regional and global superstructure in order to be implemented on the ground. Moscow needs Jerusalem to help build that regional structure through an understanding on the future of nuclear weapons within the region. President Putin also needs the cooperation of US in order to establish such a regional settlement. And this implies US cooperation across the globe. Advertisement Yes the Russian “spring” has occurred. The question is where do we go from here? We might be headed toward an extremely dangerous time in world history. It certainly looks that way. However with the help of a visionary Israeli policy directed toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the cooperation of all the world’s powers; the end of state to state conventional conflict in the Middle East could also be achieved. One road is apocalyptical and the other road is very utopian. But there doesn’t seem to be much, if any, middle ground. Without a middle ground, utopian solutions become the realistic alternative. The Middle East could continue to deteriorate into superpower proxy client states, all with a destabilized nuclear arms component; or the region could seek genuine peace. Iran’s recent missile test and its now documented underground missile bases assure movement toward an apocalyptical nuclear scenario. The region could further fragment into near mini-states run by non-state actors. Worse still, terrorists might also have access to weapons of mass destruction. To put it simply, the region of the Middle East will either help to establish a multipolar cooperative world order; or continue on the path it’s already on and pay the consequences. The same is true for many other states in Europe and Asia, like France, Germany, India and Japan. But the three superpowers, Russia, China and the US must also begin to cooperate. And most importantly, they need to lead the way toward a durable world peace. We all do not need a repeat of the last century! Israel should choose a true, genuine and complete peace above nuclear weaponry. Praise the L-rd, the author of history, and pray for a new unprecedented era without war!

News article:
It speaks volumes that Russia, rather than Israel, has been going public with details of a "hotline" and joint air exercises they have launched to avoid an accidental clash in the skies over Syria. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Israel is unusually tight-lipped about the military coordination, a reticence that officials and experts say stems in part from reluctance to signal any significant strategic shift away from the United States, its key ally but one that has reduced Middle East engagements as Russia steps up its own. In a three-week-old campaign, Russian aircraft have backed up Syrian President Bashar Assad's troops as they try to regain ground lost to rebels during a civil war raging since 2011. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Photo: Amit Shabi, Yedioth Ahronoth) Russia has also sent in advanced air defense systems, fuelling concern that its forces could accidentally clash with jets sent by Israel or the US-led coalition. "We don't interfere with them and they don't interfere with us," Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said in a radio interview, tersely summing up Israel's accommodation with Russia. Another reason Israel is holding back could be because it does not know the full extent of Russia's plans for Syria or what effect they could have on Assad's allies – Iran and the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah. A de-facto axis between Moscow and Israel's two most powerful regional enemies could seem an unsettling scenario for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, but it might also be seen as providing a moderating influence. "The new order in the Middle East is loose coalitions for specific purposes, so a Russian partnership with Iran and Hezbollah to save Assad is not necessarily bad for us," a Netanyahu confidant told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Russian President Vladimir Putin "is not looking to mess with Israel, and it's unlikely he would look kindly on Iran or Hezbollah messing with Israel now, either," the confidant said. The assurance has been echoed by Russia, which hosted Netanyahu for Syria "deconfliction" talks on Sept. 21. It took until this week for the United States, whose forces have long been in sync with Israel on Syria, to agree on similar coordination with Russia. Alexander Shein, Russia's ambassador to Israel, said his country's operations were limited to air and missile strikes on "terrorist groups." "In this context there is no reason to talk about any alliance between the Russian side, Hezbollah and the Iranian side in Syrian affairs," he said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters. Circumspect on Assad Shein said Russia was familiar with the reasoning behind past Israeli air strikes in Syria, including against alleged arms transfers by Iran or Assad's army to Hezbollah, and "fully aware of Israel's strategic importance in the Middle East." But he said Syria's neighbors and overall regional stability were threatened by the conflict, suggesting Israeli security might be best served by an Assad victory. Israel called for Assad to be ousted after the civil war began but the Netanyahu government has recently preferred neutral rhetoric even though Western powers continue to demand an eventual change of leadership in Syria A Russian helicopter above the airport in Latakia, Syria. (Photo: MCT) Exhausted by feuds with Washington over Iran's nuclear drive and now-frozen peace talks with the Palestinians, Israeli officials privately acknowledge being circumspect on Syria although they believe Assad's staying power has improved because of Russia's aerial campaign. Moscow, meanwhile, has made no secret of seeing vindication for its Syria strategy in the Netanyahu government's posture. "Israel’s prudence from the outbreak of the conflict in Syria has become apparent in the fact that Israel did not consider the overthrow of President Assad as an indispensable condition to avoid foreign intervention and impediment for the beginning of a national reconciliation," Shein said. He linked this to what he described as Israel's "wisdom" in not taking sides when Russia seized the Crimea region from Ukraine last year following the removal of a Ukrainian president who was sympathetic to Moscow. "I hope it reflects concern for the development of Russian-Israeli relations in a true, friendly and cooperative manner," Shein said. Israeli officials have spoken respectfully, but not lavishly, about their evolving relationship with Russia. A diplomatic dividend such as Russian recognition of Israel's ownership of the Golan Heights is nowhere on the horizon, and Moscow's growing relationship with Iran worries the Netanyahu government. Ya'alon suggested Iran could, following the deal with world powers over its nuclear program that offers sanctions relief, buy up to $21 billion of arms from Russia. Citing this prospect, he said he would try to secure increased US defense aid for Israel when he visits Washington next week. "Despite all the arguments we have with the United States, it is, ultimately, as an ally, the cornerstone of our strategy," Ya'alon told Israel's Army Radio.

News article:
Two weeks ago, Palestinians rioted on the Temple Mount, breaking into an area adjacent to Sha’ar HaRachamim (Gate of Mercy, also known as the Golden Gate) in the Temple Mount compound. The site was locked 16 years ago by court order after it was used as a meeting place for a Hamas-affiliated organization. The Israeli police have allowed Muslim prayers at the site and have thus far avoided confrontations. The Waqf (Muslim authority) requested permission from the Israeli police to bring in materials to convert the site to a Mosque and their request has not been rejected. The police issued restraining orders against Waqf guards and Palestinian activists, including the Waqf’s head, Sheikh Abdel-Azeem Salhab, to prevent them from reaching the site. An Israeli delegation traveled to Jordan last Thursday to discuss a solution with the government. After the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel handed administration of the site back to the Waqf (Muslim authority) under Jordanian custodianship, while maintaining Israeli security control. At the time, there was one Mosque on the Temple Mount but three more have been established since then without Israeli permission. Israel wants the renovations at Sha’ar HaRachamim to take place alongside archaeologists from Israel’s Antiquities Authority but the Jordanians rejected this condition. Israeli media reported that Jordan offered that the site be closed for long-term renovations. The Israeli delegation agreed to this plan but insisted it must first be closed without renovations taking place, as a statement of Israeli authority. This disagreement reportedly led to talks breaking down. Haaretz reported that a meeting between the head of the Waqf and the Israel Police commander for the Jerusalem District was canceled after the Waqf official received threats from extremist Palestinians who accused him of capitulating to Israel. Arutz Sheva, a Hebrew language news site, reported on Friday that a compromise had been reached between Israel and Jordan over the situation at the Sha’ar HaRachamim Arutz Sheva cited the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper which claimed that the Israeli government agreed to allow the Waqf (Muslim authority) to bring in building materials in order to renovate the site and convert it into a mosque. According to the report, the renovation will be delayed for the time being until calm is restored without a date being set for its commencement. A Jordanian source told Asharq al-Awsat that this is the best solution at this point in time, which will prevent unnecessary bloodshed. Arutz Sheva reported on Sunday that negotiations between the Israeli police, the Israeli National Security Council, and the Waqf had agreed that leaks in the roof would be renovated by the Waqf in cooperation with Israeli police and archaeologists. After the renovation, the Waqf will be allowed to use the building for classes, twice a month. In the wake of the failed talks, King Abdullah of Jordan traveled to the U.S. to meet with members of Congress. According to the Jordan News Agency, Abdullah is looking to “bolster the strategic partnership between Jordan and the United States,” and will also discuss the “latest regional developments, especially those connected to the Palestinian cause.” According to Jewish tradition, the Messiah will arrive at the Temple Mount via the Sha’ar HaRachamim.

Arutz Sheva, a Hebrew language news site, reported on Friday that a compromise had been reached between Israel and Jordan over the situation at the Sha’ar HaRachamim Arutz Sheva cited the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper which claimed that the Israeli government agreed to allow the Waqf (Muslim authority) to bring in building materials in order to renovate the site and convert it into a mosque. According to the report, the renovation will be delayed for the time being until calm is restored without a date being set for its commencement. A Jordanian source told Asharq al-Awsat that this is the best solution at this point in time, which will prevent unnecessary bloodshed. Arutz Sheva reported on Sunday that negotiations between the Israeli police, the Israeli National Security Council, and the Waqf had agreed that leaks in the roof would be renovated by the Waqf in cooperation with Israeli police and archaeologists. After the renovation, the Waqf will be allowed to use the building for classes, twice a month. In the wake of the failed talks, King Abdullah of Jordan traveled to the U.S. to meet with members of Congress. According to the Jordan News Agency, Abdullah is looking to “bolster the strategic partnership between Jordan and the United States,” and will also discuss the “latest regional developments, especially those connected to the Palestinian cause.” According to Jewish tradition, the Messiah will arrive at the Temple Mount via the Sha’ar HaRachamim.

AMMAN — Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's (PLO) executive committee, on Monday stressed the unified Jordanian-Palestinian stance on the Palestinian cause. This stance emphasises that the only road to comprehensive peace is one that meets all the Palestinians’ legitimate rights, foremost of which is the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and an independant Palestinian state along the June 4, 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, the two officials said. According to a Foreign Ministry statement, Safadi and Erekat reaffirmed the cohesion of Jordanian-Palestinian efforts that seek to protect Jerusalem’s Muslim and Christian holy sites. “The protection of Muslim and Christian holy sites is a priority under the patronage of His Majesty King Abdullah, who has devoted everything at the Kingdom’s disposal to preserve Jerusalem’s Arab, Muslim and Christian identities, its holy sites and their historical and legal status quo,” Safadi reiterated. Safadi and Erekat also reviewed the latest developments in relation to the Bab Al Rahmah (Gate of Mercy) building at Al Aqsa Mosque and the efforts being made to protect it as an integral part of Al Aqsa Mosque/Al Haram Al Sharif. The foreign minister stressed Jordan’s utter rejection of the Israeli court’s decision to close Bab Al Rahmah and any steps taken in attempt to change its legal and historical status. He added that Jordan does not recognise the legitimacy of the Israeli court in East Jerusalem, pointing out that the Jerusalem Awqaf Department is the only authority with jurisdiction to manage Al Haram Al Sharif in accordance with international law, according to the statement. Erekat expressed his appreciation, on behalf of the Palestinian state, for the “King’s efforts, as the patron of Christian and Muslim holy sites, in protecting the Arab-Islamic identity of Jerusalem’s holy sites, and his efforts to protect Bab Al Rahmah to preserve its historical status”. Furthermore, Safadi and Erekat agreed to continue coordination and negotiation in fulfilment of the King and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ directives. They highlighted the importance of maintaining cooperation between Jordan and Palestine in pursuit of a peace that restores the rights of the Palestinians to freedom and statehood, in accordance with a two-state solution, international legislation and the Arab Peace Initiative, the statement added.

News article:
(MENAFN- Jordan Times) The meeting between Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and Secretary General of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's Executive Committee Saeb Erekat on Monday was convened at the right time, given the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the recent wave of Israeli provocations in East Jerusalem against Islamic holy sites, including the attempt to close the Bab Al Rahmah (Gate of Mercy) of Al Aqsa Mosque. The two officials used the strongest words possible to describe the identical views of the two sides on the Palestinian case, which call for the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and an independent Palestinian state along the June 4, 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Palestinian recognition and support for the Hashemite Custodianship over the Islamic and Christian holy places in East Jerusalem was also highlighted as a pivotal point in their agreement on the East Jerusalem. It is, after all, on the strength and legitimacy of this Jordanian custodianship over the holy sites in East Jerusalem, including Al Aqsa Mosque and its Bab al Rahmah, that Jordan was able to defend their Islamic status from Israeli encroachments, and reject any Israeli court decisions on them as a clear violation of international law and UN resolutions. It is only the Jerusalem Awqaf Department, the two sides emphasised, that has the sole authority to determine the status of any part or entrance belonging to these Islamic sites. The unity of ranks between Jordan and the Palestinian Authority (PA) is what reinforces and lends support to the role of Jordan as the protector of the holy places in East Jerusalem and the final arbiter of their status. As long as Jordan and the PA see eye to eye on what counts most with regard to East Jerusalem, the Holy City and its shrines will be in safe hands and their protection from any Israeli attempt to change their status will be thwarted. This comes as no surprise, as what unites the Palestinians and the Jordanians goes back several decades, and nothing will succeed in dividing their ranks. That said, there is now a pressing need for an Arab and or an Islamic summit on East Jerusalem to discuss the latest developments. Now that Israel has decided to up the ante on the holy sites in East Jerusalem, the Arab and Muslim world need to react in a united front. The stakes in East Jerusalem and its Islamic and Christian holy places are now too high to be dealt with casually or routinely. A united Arab and Muslim front have become urgently needed.

His Majesty King Abdullah chose Zarqa to make momentous declarations, especially on East Jerusalem and its Muslim and Christian holy places. Zarqa is a major metropolitan urban city in Jordan that is home to about 50 per cent of the country’s industries and businesses. But that was not what the King had in mind when he spoke up about Jerusalem and its holy places. At a time when many countries, including some Arab states, are silent on the Israeli threats to the Islamic holy places, including Al Aqsa Mosque, the King chose to keep the torch of Jerusalem burning, hoping that the silent nations would wake up one day and speak up on the fate of the Muslim and Christian religious sites. The Zarqa declarations did not come, therefore, from a vacuum. The Hashemite Custodianship over the holy sites in East Jerusalem is a firm and unshaken conviction that no side can derail or question. That is what the King wanted to say in Zarqa loud and clear. East Jerusalem is a red line, said the King, that no side can cross with impunity. “No one can pressure Jordan on this matter, and the answer will be no. All Jordanians stand with me on Jerusalem. At the end of the day, Arabs and Muslims will stand with us as well,” the King said. The Jordanian custodianship over these holy sites is also a red line that the King will uphold at all costs. “All my people are with me,” the King added. His Majesty did not fail to add that he remains sanguine about the future, despite all the odds that the country faces, which undermine its stability and progress. Some countries, the King said, were actually applying pressure on his steadfastness on East Jerusalem, but he reiterated that he will not waver. Jordan’s stance on East Jerusalem and its holy places is a matter of principle and not a subject for negotiation. Well, the King has spoken loud and clear and it is up to the rest of the shareholders to take full note of his firm determination to uphold his custodianship of the holy sites in East Jerusalem, come what may. The King touched upon the so-called allegation that Jordan could be the homeland for the Palestinian people. He stressed that any talk about an “alternative homeland” for Palestinians in Jordan is rejected, noting that “to anyone who speaks about an alternative homeland, the answer is no”. Jordan is Jordan and Palestine is Palestine. This should put an end to those who still market the ridiculous idea that Jordan is the homeland for the Palestinians. Only when the state of Palestine is created on Palestinian soil in the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as it capital, would Jordan consider some form of unification or another. That moment in time has not arrived. That was Jordan’s official position and remains its final word on the subject.

As Israel’s legislative elections approach in a few weeks, American activity in the region is increasing, particularly towards regional settlement. This can be seen with the visit from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Israel this week, which many are suggesting will boost the electoral chances of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud Party. Meanwhile, there are shifts occurring amongst other key parties in any settlement agreement. In the West Bank, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas has asked Mohammad Shtayyeh to form a new government as prime minister. This could represent a new era in Palestinian leadership, as this step might show a tendency to having a more political and less technocratic prime minister, yet Shtayyeh is not a traditional Fateh fighter, but is from the business community and is a senior Fateh official in the West Bank. Jordan, another key country for regional settlement, should also become active, with His Majesty King Abdullah recently travelling to Washington to meet with President Donald Trump’s Middle East team. King Abdullah’s visit to Washington comes as many are saying that Jordan’s problems are not limited to economics, as there are worrying symptoms developing that require immediate intervention. There is also a growing consensus that Jordan’s institutions require horizontal change in order to make the changes that will reinvigorate the state and provide hope for a better future amongst the population. The transformation must come from within in order to avoid any forced change from protesters, who have so far been unable to produce concrete actions. The changes required must also address the mushrooming of power that has increasingly been centralised and behind the veil. Jordan’s institutions must be strengthened and subject to accountability and transparency, which will also improve the perceptions of the executive and the legislature. Across the region, Jordan’s allies and supporters are commenting that the current policy and trajectory is backing the country into a corner, from which it is increasingly difficult to remove itself. Many advise that the path forward is a balance of strategic pragmatism without falling into the trap of false populism. Jordan must develop workable policies in order to navigate regional settlement and ensure positive outcomes for itself and its people. Jordan needs pragmatic positions on the issue of Jerusalem, threats to Jordanian merchants with ties with Damascus and its relations with Saudi Arabia. While the region awaits the results of the Israeli elections, preparations have begun for the next phase across the region. The opportunity is there for countries to undertake reforms to enhance internal stability, while also reviewing regional policies and identifying the chance for advantage, or at least the realpolitik of avoiding negative outcomes.

News article:
His Majesty King Abdullah warned on Wednesday during a visit to Zarqa Governorate that Jerusalem is a red line, and that the Jordanian people stand behind him on this issue. On Monday, the King cancelled a scheduled visit to Romania planned to start the same day after its prime minister on Sunday expressed her country’s intention to move its embassy to Jerusalem. The Royal visit to Romania, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, had been scheduled to include meetings with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis and parliamentary leaders, in addition to the King’s participation in the Aqaba meetings, which had been planned to be hosted by Romania in partnership with Jordan. A business forum scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the visit was also called off by Jordanian business leaders, who expressed support of the cancellation of the Royal visit, affirming their full support for Hashemite Custodianship of Christian and Muslim holy places in Jerusalem. For Jordan, its Hashemite leadership and its people, the Israeli-occupied city of Jerusalem is a red line, as the King said, and it should be tackled through peace talks, rather than through unilateral measures by world politicians trying to win over lobby groups and dirty money to support their campaigns. Romania, which has always been a friend of Arabs, and a historical supporter of the Palestinian people, should not be changing its stance to follow the whims of leaders seeking to score personal gains at the expense of ties with the Arab peoples. It should instead work to support a peaceful solution to the issue of Jerusalem and not to blindly follow the camp of US President Donald Trump who seems to be focused on appeasing the Jewish lobby in the US and to please his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose questionable ties to Israel should be a good reason to remove him from his post as presidential adviser in charge of brokering a Mideast “peace” deal, which will certainly be at the expense of justice and Arab rights. The nepotism of Trump that is affecting his Mideast decisions, including his most recent decision on Monday recognising Syria’s Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, as part of Israel, should not be copied by other countries of the world. If Trump and Kushner love Israel so much they can donate US land to them, but not Palestinian and Syrian land. Any country in the world that also supports Israel so much can do the same by giving it part of their national land, not Palestinian or Syrian land. Jordan’s stand on Jerusalem should be emulated by other Arab countries, which are scheduled to convene for the annual Arab summit in Tunisia next week. Arab leaders should rise to the occasion and work to translate the will of their peoples on the Holy City of Jerusalem, on the suffering of the Palestinian people and on the Golan Heights. These peoples will judge their leaders harshly, as they will judge other countries that are doing them and their causes injustices. Friendly people in Europe, the US and around the world have to loudly express their rejection of any measures aiming to preempt the outcome of Arab-Israeli peace talks, which should be the focus of all justice-loving countries in the world. The world as whole should still have faith that a just peace is the only answer to all Middle East problems, not one-sided unilateral measures.

News article:
(MENAFN- Jordan News Agency) Amman, Mar.26 (Petra) -- His Majesty King Abdullah, the Supreme Commander of the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army (JAF), affirmed on Tuesday that "the future of Jerusalem and Palestine is a red line for Jordan". Speaking during a meeting at the JAF General Command, King Abdullah stressed that the position of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and all Jordanians is unwavering on Jerusalem and on any attempts to create an alternative homeland for the Palestinians in Jordan. His Majesty said the decision to cancel his visit to Romania was over Jerusalem. "As I said in Zarqa and as I have continued to say over perhaps the past 15 years Jerusalem and the future of Palestine is a red line for Jordan. I don't know what more I can say to make it clear!" the King said at the meeting, attended by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Freihat, heads of security agencies, and a number of senior army and security officers. His Majesty criticised those questioning Jordan's unequivocal position, underscoring that "this is the position of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and all Jordanians". The King said his recent remarks in Zarqa on the Hashemite state was directed at those cynics. "As a Hashemite, how can I back down on Jerusalem? Impossible. This is a red line. No on Jerusalem; no to an alternative homeland, no to resettlement [for Palestinians in Jordan]," His Majesty affirmed. The King warned against those who spread negativity and doubts "amongst us as Jordanians, as institutions, and as a state", calling for a national campaign to counter doubters. His Majesty warned against the danger of these campaigns to spread doubts, describing them as ammunition for Jordan's enemies. "How long can this continue?" the King asked. "Those speaking against us and against Jordan are adding fuel to the fire." His Majesty said Jordan is aware of the economic challenges it is facing and working to alleviate poverty and unemployment, warning that doubters must not be given the chance to spread their harm. The King criticised unfounded claims circulated regarding the "deal of the century" or "the alternative homeland". "Don't we have a voice? We are the brave Arab Army. We have a history in Jerusalem and in Palestine. We have a voice and a position," His Majesty affirmed. The King said his tour which starts Wednesday and includes Morocco, Italy, France, and Tunisia, where His Majesty will attend the Arab Summit will focus on Jerusalem and the peace process. During the meeting at the General Command of JAF, His Majesty was also briefed by Assistant to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs for Intelligence Brig. Gen. Nasser Mheirat on the northern and eastern borders. The King also checked on the readiness of JAF formations, commending the advanced level of their personnel in terms of preparedness, armament and training. AF 27/03/2019 00:02:04

(MENAFN- Jordan News Agency) Casablanca, Mar. 28 (Petra)-- His Majesty King Abdullah and King Mohammed VI of Morocco affirmed on Thursday that defending Jerusalem and its holy sites against attempts to change the historical, legal, and political status quo or alter their religious and cultural Islamic and Christian identity is a top priority for Jordan and Morocco. During talks in Casablanca ahead of the Arab Summit in Tunisia, the two leaders stressed their full support for the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate rights and enabling them to establish an independent Palestinian state on the 4 June 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on international law, relevant UN resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative, and the two-state solution. King Abdullah and King Mohammed VI reiterated their rejection of all unilateral measures and steps by Israel, the occupying power, to change the legal and historical status quo, the demographics, and the spiritual and historical identity of East Jerusalem, especially at Islamic and Christian holy sites in the city. His Majesty and King Mohammed VI affirmed the importance of the historical Hashemite Custodianship undertaken by King Abdullah over Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, noting its key role in safeguarding these sites and their Arab, Islamic, and Christian identity, especially Al Aqsa Mosque/Al Haram Al Sharif. The two leaders also noted the role of the Jordanian Jerusalem Awqaf Department as the sole legal authority administering, maintaining, and regulating entry into Al Haram Al Sharif. King Abdullah commended the ongoing efforts by King Mohammed VI, chairman of Al Quds Committee, in solidarity with Jerusalem, praising the initiatives implemented by Bayt Mal Al Qods Asharif Agency, under the Moroccan monarch's supervision, to support the steadfastness of Jerusalemites. On bilateral ties, the two leaders agreed to take cooperation between Jordan and Morocco to the level of a strategic partnership, while maintaining coordination. The two leaders also agreed to establish projects in renewable energy, agriculture, and tourism, as well as exchange expertise between Jordan and Morocco in tourism, food industries, construction, public works, and water resource management. A joint communique was released following the talks. Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, Adviser to His Majesty and Director of the Office of His Majesty Manar Dabbas, and Special Adviser to His Majesty Ali Fazza accompanied King Abdullah on the visit. 28/03/2019 22:19:37

His Majesty King Abdullah receives the 2019 Lamp of Peace award from Sacred Convent Custodian Father Mauro Gambetti (left), in the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right), on Friday, in Assisi, Italy (Photo courtesy of Royal Court) AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah reaffirmed on Friday that “today, nowhere is it more important to act than in safeguarding Jerusalem”. Speaking at a ceremony attended by Her Majesty Queen Rania in Assisi, Italy, after receiving the 2019 Lamp of Peace award for efforts to promote human rights, harmony, interfaith dialogue and peace in the Middle East and the world, King Abdullah noted Jordan’s duty in line with the Hashemite Custodianship of Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian holy sites, a Royal Court statement said. “As Hashemite Custodian of Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian holy sites, we are bound by a special, personal duty to the security and future of the Holy City,” His Majesty noted. “Ties of love and concern bind the Holy City to billions of Muslims and Christians around the world, and Jerusalem should be and must be a unifying city of peace,” the King underscored. In his speech, delivered at the Sacred Convent of St. Francis of Assisi, His Majesty also paid tribute to “the suffering families and victims of the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, two weeks ago” “Such evil, wherever it happens, is our suffering, too,” the King said, asking the attendees — who included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Italian Episcopal Conference President Gualtiero Bassetti and President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani — to observe a moment of silence for the victims of the New Zealand attack and all victims of hatred. His Majesty accepted the Lamp of Peace award, which recognises global figures for their work towards promoting peace and harmony, “on behalf of all who are working for a better future, and, most especially, on behalf of the people of Jordan, Muslim and Christian alike, who are making sacrifices every day for a better future for all”. Since its launch in 1981, the Lamp of Peace has been awarded to a number of political and religious leaders, including Chancellor Merkel in 2018, former Polish president Lech Wałęsa, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, former Colombian president and Noble Prize Laureate Juan Manuel Santos, Pope Francis, Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama and Mother Teresa. The King, who received this year’s award from the Custos of the Sacred Convent of Assisi Father Mauro Gambetti, said Muslims and Christians make up more than half the people on earth. “It has never been more important to come together in harmony,” His Majesty noted. “The principles of coexistence and interfaith harmony are deeply embedded in Jordan’s heritage. Our country is home to a historic Christian community. All our citizens actively share in building our strong nation,” the King said. “And indeed, Christians have been part of Middle East societies for thousands of years and are vital to the future of our region,” His Majesty stressed. “The people of the world do not have to be the same in order to have the same concerns, share the same needs or hope the same hopes. To reach a better future, we must find a common path,” the King said. Noting that “Jordan’s commitment to harmony and peace underlies our international role”, His Majesty highlighted the Kingdom’s role in the fight against terror and hatred on all fronts within a holistic approach, and in seeking effective solutions to global and regional crises. The King also reaffirmed Jordan’s ongoing efforts for a lasting resolution of the region’s core conflict, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the two-state solution. His Majesty concluded the speech with a call for peace and harmony, according to the statement. “Today, all over the world, millions of Muslims are coming together to perform Friday prayers, as those pious Muslims did who came to their mosques in New Zealand two Fridays ago. And today, as every day — five times a day — our prayers are calling for peace,” the King said. “So I ask you to listen to that call. I ask you to help be the lights of peace who create the understanding and hope that our world desperately needs,” His Majesty concluded. In his remarks at the beginning of the ceremony, Sacred Convent Custodian Father Mauro Gambetti commended the King’s efforts in promoting interfaith dialogue and peace. He also lauded His Majesty’s commitment to education reform, protecting religious freedom and offering millions of refugees a safe haven in times of conflict. Father Gambetti referenced His Majesty’s speech at the European Parliament in 2015, quoting him as saying that Islam demands respect and caring for others. Gambetti added that the Islamic greeting is one that wishes peace upon others, which is aligned with what Saint Francis of Assisi drew from the Bible. The Sacred Convent custodian thanked the King for promoting the shared commandments between Islam and Christianity on loving God and loving one’s neighbour. He added that such efforts enhance understanding between all religions and underscore the shared values of peace between them, the statement added. Father Gambetti thanked His Majesty for safeguarding Islamic and Christian holy sites, and called on him to continue his efforts in promoting and enhancing peace and interfaith harmony. Also speaking at the ceremony, Chancellor Merkel commended His Majesty’s efforts in promoting peace and harmony, as well as Jordan’s role in hosting Syrian refugees. Highlighting the refugee burden undertaken by Jordan, Merkel said it is as if Germany were hosting over 5 million refugees, or if Italy were hosting 4 million refugees. She noted that Europeans should always remember what the King has done for refugees, adding that Jordan deserves Europe’s respect, solidarity and support. Chancellor Merkel said the message of interfaith dialogue that His Majesty promotes is one of utmost importance, pointing to “A Common Word” as a historic event in Islamic-Christian relations. She described the King as a role model for people around the world, dubbing him a leader of peace. Jordan, she said, has proven to be a cornerstone for peace in the Middle East, having maintained its safety and stability. She also commended the King’s efforts in the peace process, promoting the two-state solution for the Palestinians and Israelis. The event included a tour of the Sacred Convent of St Francis of Assisi, during which Their Majesties visited the Tomb of Saint Francis and signed the Flag of Peace, according to the statement. His Majesty also signed the guest book at the Sacred Convent.

News article:
(MENAFN- Jordan Times) The 30th Arab summit in Tunis ended its meetings on Monday with the adoption of strong words of praise and appreciation for the Hashemite Custodianship over the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, especially Al Aqsa Mosque. This recognition of the Jordanian role in safeguarding and maintaining the holy places in East Jerusalem stands out as among the most important decisions adopted by the Arab leaders at the Tunis summit. The Hashemite role in protecting the Islamic and Christian holy places has already won international acclaim, recognition and appreciation. Jordan's Jerusalem Awqaf Department has also won recognition as the sole entity that has authority and mandate to administer Al Aqsa Mosque. These words of appreciation, however, come with a price. Protecting the holy places in Jerusalem from Israeli encroachments does not come free, as much effort and expenditures are incurred to offset the financial implications. Yet, Jordan has borne the brunt of the expenditures associated with its role as the custodian of the holy places, and has successfully put its political weight behind this responsibility at a time when Israel continues to fight tooth and nail the Hashemite role. It so happens that the preservation and protection of the holy places in Jerusalem requires also the promotion of the Islamic and Christian infrastructures in East Jerusalem. This noble mission cannot also be completed without aiding and supporting the continued steadfastness of the Palestinian people belonging to both faiths. The Israeli pressures on Muslim and Christian Palestinians to leave their homeland by all means, including the application of stiff administrative rules governing their residency, are obviously intended to suffocate the Palestinians and drive them away from their homeland. An Arab and Islamic fund needs to be created to sustain the continued presence of the Palestinians in East Jerusalem. This has become a major policy goal that the Islamic and Arab worlds are called upon to adopt as a matter of highest priority.

The Israeli pressures on Muslim and Christian Palestinians to leave their homeland by all means, including the application of stiff administrative rules governing their residency, are obviously intended to suffocate the Palestinians and drive them away from their homeland. An Arab and Islamic fund needs to be created to sustain the continued presence of the Palestinians in East Jerusalem. This has become a major policy goal that the Islamic and Arab worlds are called upon to adopt as a matter of highest priority.

News article:
Jordan is both everywhere and nowhere in Jerusalem. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is crucial to keeping a hesitant balance between Jerusalem’s volatile nationalities and religions. Jordan is the custodian of Jerusalem’s waqf, or religious endowments, including one of the city’s most revered and contested sites, the Haram Al Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. It’s also a source of refuge, education and travel documents for many of the city’s still stateless Palestinians. “Jordan is deeply involved in Jerusalem in many ways,” explained Palestinian-Jordanian journalist Daoud Kuttab, because Palestinians in Jerusalem are “political orphans, as they have no one taking care of them.” But you won’t see Jordanian flags waving about Jerusalem’s famed cobbled streets. In fact, there isn’t much physical presence of Jordan at all. Many Jerusalemites, moreover, are openly frustrated that Jordan, who ruled the east side of the city from 1948 to 1967, isn’t doing more to make room for Palestinian representation and end the now over fifty-year-old Israeli occupation. Recent political events – like the Trump administration’s moving of the US Embassy to Jerusalem and the Israeli government’s continuous squeezing of the city’s Palestinian residents – have renewed the spotlight on Jordan’s role, and where it’s going. “On the one hand there is an appreciation [among Jerusalem Palestinians] for Jordan’s role in restraining Israeli policies,” said Ofer Zalzberg, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Israel/Palestine. “And on the other hand there is a dissatisfaction that Jordan is not doing more.” Jordanians and Palestinians are historically and geographically linked. More than half of Jordanians are of Palestinian descent, their families having fled or been forced out of present day Israel in the 1948 and 1967 wars. Jordan also ruled the West Bank along with Jerusalem between 1948 and 1967, and some laws in the former are still based on Jordanian codes. Today, the 350,000 Palestinians residents of Jerusalem, who make up more than a third of the city’s residents, are technically stateless. Israel offered them citizenship in 1967, but most rejected, expecting the occupation would soon after end. They can still apply for Israeli citizenship, and the numbers of people doing so are rising. However, it's socially stigmatised and those that do often have to wait years and can be denied for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Today most Palestinians live on the city's marginalised east. As permanent residents they have access to Israeli education and healthcare, among other services, but they can’t vote in national Israeli elections and risk losing their residency if they live outside of Jerusalem for too long. As a holdover from the Jordanian era, most Palestinians living in East Jerusalem have Jordanian travel documents, and about 130,000 are citizens of Jordan, according to Mr Kuttab. (Many of the 2.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank also have Jordanian travel documents or citizenship. Their situation is different, however, as they are ruled by the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority and cannot move around Israel freely.) Last year, Jordan made it easier for Palestinians to renew their passports and travel documents, lowering the fees and cutting the costly requirement that they travel to Amman to do so. Israeli border police stand on duty as Palestinians pray at the Lion's Gate entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem, near to Haram Al Sharif, on July 25, 2017. Abir Sultan / EPA The most well known place to find Jordan is at the Haram Al Sharif Compound in the Old City, which Israeli Jews refer to as the Temple Mount. Jordan employs around 1,000 guards, staff, and other workers there. It also negotiates with the Israelis when this tentative status quo shakes, like in the summer of 2017 when Israel put metal detectors at the entrance to the compound and the Palestinian street erupted in protest. (Israel ultimately removed the gates.) In February, Jordan created a new Jordanian Islamic Waqf Endowment Council, intentionally including some leaders from the 2017 protests and more Palestinian members. It's first move has already made headlines: the council tried to enter the Bab Al Rahmeh prayer Hall, which Israel made off-limits to Muslims in 2003 during the second Intifada, or uprising, setting off days of Palestinian protests and protest prayers after the Israelis refused. As the custodian of Jerusalem’s waqf, Jordan also administers religious funded schools and overseas other tasks, like mosque renovations. In addition, the royal family legally and symbolically has to approve the heads of churches in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. While much of this work is intangible, inside a beautifully renovated Ottoman-era building perched above Al Aqsa in the heart of the windy Old City, is the office of Madrasati Palestine, a Jordanian initiative to rejuvenate schools and education in Jerusalem. Rami Moshasha, 38, is the Managing Director of the initiative, which Queen Rania spearheaded and opened in Jerusalem in 2010. Since then, the organisation has renovated more than 28 schools, conducted trainings for the waqf-school teachers, and organised activities for the more than 7,000 students in these schools, according to Mr Moshasha. The Palestinian economy is extremely aid-dependent. But Mr Moshasha, who is from Jerusalem, described the initiative as an extension of Jordan and the royal family’s duty to Jerusalem. “It’s not like Jordan is giving [it] to Jerusalem,” he said. “It’s part of their duty to give as much as we can to Jerusalem.” He continued, “I think Jerusalemites understand that King Abdullah and Queen Rania and all of the Hashemites are doing their best for the people of Jerusalem. There will always be a need to do more…But they are doing their best, especially at Al Aqsa and at schools.” Historically, Jordan has been in competition with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA) over control and representation of Palestinians, Jerusalem included. In 1988, Jordan renounced its claim to represent Palestinians, making room for the PLO to take on that role and establish the PA through the Oslo Peace Accords with Israel. Under Israel and Jordan’s 1994 peace treaty, the latter formally holds the role of custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. In 2013, Jordan and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas signed an agreement affirming this relationship of Jordan as custodian and Palestine, technically, retaining sovereignty. Some Jerusalemite Palestinians see protecting Al Aqsa as an integral part of their identity. This also at times breeds tension with Jordan and the feeling “that their most holy site is managed above their heads by Jordanians and Israelis,” said Mr Zalzberg. Jordan’s role in Jerusalem is consequently tied up with its relationship with Israel. Jordan, on the one hand, depends on Israel economically and politically in domains like water and energy, security cooperation and international aid. On the other hand, Jordan is a crucial intermediary for Israel with the Palestinians during times of tension in the city, particularly at the Haram Al Sharif. “It’s not just a bilateral relationship between Israel and Palestinians,” said Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli expert on Jerusalem. “You have to triangulate and always include the Jordanians.” Jordanians protest for the decision that American president took over Jerusalem, Tuesday, December 7, 2017 in front of the American embassy in Amman, Jordan. Salah Malkawi Still, during the metal detector protests in 2017, it was the Palestinian street and religious leaders who led the charge and kept up the momentum, with Jordan and the official Palestinian leadership taking a noticeably back seat. Now, in the wake of the Trump administration undoing decades of a hesitant diplomatic status quo, Mr Kuttab said he expected Jordan’s role in Jerusalem to deepen amid the political uncertainty. But Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the PLO, argued that with regional relations between Israel, America and Arab countries growing friendlier amid unpopular Palestinian leadership, she didn’t see Jordan being able to take on a more robust role. “It’s [Jordan] never been unhelpful but never particularly overly helpful,” said Ms Buttu. “It isn’t playing the heavyweight political role that it was once playing,” she said. “This is very much a problem… because no one else is doing it.”

News article:
Head of the political bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, yesterday reaffirmed the movement's support for Jordan in the face of "foreign pressures, especially American and Israeli pressure, aimed at changing the region's geopolitics". Haniyeh added that Hamas "will not accept any solution to the Palestinian cause at the expense of Jordan and its sovereignty", stressing that the "deal of the century" targets Palestine, Jordan and the Palestinian refugees. Haniyeh also reiterated the movement's rejection of "settling the Palestinian refugees in their places of residence, especially at the expense of Jordan's sovereignty". Last month, Jordan's King Abdullah II said pressure is being exercised on him personally to change his country's position regarding the occupied city of Jerusalem, adding that he will not change his position and that the Jordanian people stand with him on this issue. READ: Jordan rejects any change to status quo of Jerusalem "We in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have a historic duty towards Jerusalem and the holy sites there. Jerusalem is a red line, and my people stand with me," he said. Later on March, the king cancelled a planned visit to Romania after the Romanian prime minister pledged to transfer the country's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

People gather at Arab Army Square in Zarqa Governorate for a rally organised by the Zarqa Governorate Council to show support of His Majesty King Abdullah’s recent declarations on Jerusalem and Hashemite Custodianship (Petra photo) AMMAN — Jordanians on Wednesday took to Zarqa’s streets in a show of support for His Majesty King Abdullah’s stances towards Jerusalem. Jordanians marched to Arab Army Square in Zarqa Governorate, 22km northwest of Amman, where they held a rally waving Jordanian flags, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported. “Jerusalem is a Red Line,” one of the banners carried during the march read. Others read “No Alternative Homeland”, “Yes for the Hashemite Custodianship over Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian Holy Sites” and “No Settlement”, according to Petra. Organised by the Zarqa Governorate Council, the rally was designed to show that public stances align with King Abdullah’s positions expressed at international forums, as well as to renew rejections of any solution to the Palestinian cause which comes at the expense of the Kingdom, the president of the council, Ahmad Eleimat said. In solidarity with Jerusalem, King Abdullah previously called off a planned trip to Romania following a pledge by Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila to move her country’s embassy in Israel to occupied Jerusalem. The Romanian prime minister recently pledged during a trip to Washington that her country would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to occupied Jerusalem, breaking with both the EU position and with her own country’s president, according to AFP. Prime Minister Viorica Dancila made the announcement at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an influential pro-Israel lobby. Her stance would align Romania with the US position under President Donald Trump, and it came on a day when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was beginning a Washington visit which included an AIPAC appearance and a meeting with Trump.

People gather at Arab Army Square in Zarqa Governorate for a rally organised by the Zarqa Governorate Council to show support of His Majesty King Abdullah’s recent declarations on Jerusalem and Hashemite Custodianship (Petra photo) AMMAN — Jordanians on Wednesday took to Zarqa’s streets in a show of support for His Majesty King Abdullah’s stances towards Jerusalem. Jordanians marched to Arab Army Square in Zarqa Governorate, 22km northwest of Amman, where they held a rally waving Jordanian flags, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported. “Jerusalem is a Red Line,” one of the banners carried during the march read. Others read “No Alternative Homeland”, “Yes for the Hashemite Custodianship over Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian Holy Sites” and “No Settlement”, according to Petra. Organised by the Zarqa Governorate Council, the rally was designed to show that public stances align with King Abdullah’s positions expressed at international forums, as well as to renew rejections of any solution to the Palestinian cause which comes at the expense of the Kingdom, the president of the council, Ahmad Eleimat said. In solidarity with Jerusalem, King Abdullah previously called off a planned trip to Romania following a pledge by Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila to move her country’s embassy in Israel to occupied Jerusalem. The Romanian prime minister recently pledged during a trip to Washington that her country would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to occupied Jerusalem, breaking with both the EU position and with her own country’s president, according to AFP. Prime Minister Viorica Dancila made the announcement at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an influential pro-Israel lobby. Her stance would align Romania with the US position under President Donald Trump, and it came on a day when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was beginning a Washington visit which included an AIPAC appearance and a meeting with Trump.

News article:
DEAD SEA, Jordan — A senior Jordanian politician has said Jordan hopes Israel’s national elections will produce a new government headed by someone other than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Jordan is one of two Arab countries to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel. “Jordan hopes that after these elections, there will be a government led by someone other than Netanyahu, who knows that the only solution to the Palestinian issue is the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,” Jordanian Senate Speaker Faisal al-Fayez told The Times of Israel over the weekend, on the margins of the World Economic Forum at the Dead Sea in Jordan. “Netanyahu’s position on the Palestinian issue is known. He is not looking to resolve it and I worry that he may want to annex the West Bank in the future.” The Senate is the upper house of the Jordanian parliament, which proposes and approves legislation. The king appoints its speaker and members. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Jordanian King Abdullah has not made public comments about Israel’s upcoming elections. Asked about Benny Gantz, Blue and White’s top candidate and Netanyahu’s main challenger, Fayez, who has previously served as Jordanian prime minister and defense minister, said: “We in Jordan wish that if he becomes prime minister, he will be less extreme than Netanyahu and will make efforts to advance peace.” The latest polls indicate that Netanyahu’s Likud party will likely be best placed to lead the next government. But the prime minister has said in recent days that the Israeli right was in danger of losing its grip on power following the elections. In a video posted to social media, the premier called on voters to “come back home to Likud,” warning that the Blue and White party could “break the right-wing bloc.” Advertisement Gantz, a former IDF chief of staff, has said he believes he will become Israel’s next prime minister. While Gantz has said that Israel should “strive for peace” with the Palestinians, he has not endorsed the establishment of a Palestinian state. The Senate speaker also said he thinks personal ties between Jordanians and Israelis will remain almost nonexistent without a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “We have a peace treaty with Israel and there are official ties,” he said. “But on the popular level, interaction between Jordanians and Israelis is almost zero. The only way this can change is if Israel gives the Palestinian people their rights including to a sovereign, livable and independent state.” While Israel and Jordan signed a peace deal in 1994 and their governments cooperate on security, economic and other issue, contact between Jordanians and Israelis has continued to be very limited.

AMMAN — Jordan will reject any proposed settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that does not guarantee the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, Prime Minister Omar Razzaz said on Tuesday. The premier noted during a press conference on Tuesday that Jordan's position on the long-running Palestinian-Israeli conflict rests on two irreversible constants; the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and the Hashemite Custodianship over Jerusalem's Islamic and Christian holy sites. “These are the unshakable foundations of Jordan’s position on Palestine and the non-negotiable red lines,” Razzaz said in response to a question on how Jordan would respond to the so-called deal of the century. Regarding calls to scrap a gas deal between Jordan’s National Electric Power Company and Israel, Razzaz said that his government was not the one who signed the deal. He added that the decision to keep or cancel the deal will be taken in accordance with Jordan’s higher interests. “There is definitely a penalty clause in the deal,” the premier told reporters. Razzaz said that the deal is currently being reviewed by the Constitutional Court. The Lower House has recently declared its “utter rejection” of the gas deal, requesting that the agreement be “cancelled at any cost”. The government has decided to refer the gas deal with Israel to the Constitutional Court for interpretation of Article 33 of the Constitution. Paragraph B of the said article reads: “Treaties and agreements which involve financial commitments to the Treasury or affect the public or private rights of Jordanians shall not be valid unless approved by the National Assembly. In no circumstances shall any secret terms contained in any treaty or agreement be contrary to their overt terms”.

Reports on the upcoming publication of U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace initiative have whipped Jordan into a frenzy. Particularly troubling for it is the possibility of a change in its traditional status on the Temple Mount as guardian of the Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem. Instead, Jordan fears there will be a general Arab-Islamic guardian, meaning that Saudi Arabia will replace Jordan as the true guardian of the holy sites. From a historical point of view, the Hashemites having been pushed out as the guardians of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, makes it extremely difficult for them to come to terms with losing guardianship over the Al-Aksa mosque. Jordanian spokesmen have expressed themselves harshly on this issue, saying that this is a red line, and that Jordan will reconsider all of its regional alliances as a result of such a move. Developments behind the scenes with regard to the management of the Islamic Waqf should be noted in this connection. At first, Jordan reached an agreement with P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas about a change in the Waqf administration and the inclusion of Fatah personnel in it. Although neither have said so officially, this was a signal to Saudi Arabia that Jordan and Abbas are the landlords of the mosques and will not allow themselves to be pushed out. However, just when it seemed that Jordan and the P.A. had created a united front against Saudi Arabia, they began to clash over who would actually lead the new Waqf administration. Jordan saw to it that the addition of senior Fatah officials would not violate Jordan’s practical control of the council, but the P.A. in Ramallah had other ideas. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Sources in eastern Jerusalem report an all-out war is under way over the leadership of the new council. Ramallah wants to appoint Mufti Sheikh Mohammed Hussein, an Abbas loyalist, to lead the council. Jordan is completely opposed; it offered leadership of the council to Sheikh Ekrima Sa’id Sabri. Abbas removed Sabri, who had been appointed by Yasser Arafat, as mufti of Jerusalem back in 2006, reportedly for his growing popularity and dangerous political views. Sheikh Hussein was appointed by Abbas as Sabri’s successor. Sources revealed that when Ramallah found out, Tanzim-Fatah forces threatened Sheikh Sabri. He informed the Jordanians that he had been threatened and thus could not take them up on their offer. Thus, after a brief honeymoon, Jordan and Ramallah are now again divided over Jerusalem. Before the recent summit in Tunis, Jordan’s King Abdullah took an interesting step. He met with King Hassan II of Morocco, who is also from the Hashemite dynasty, in other words from the family of sharifs (“guardians”) that claim descent from the prophet Mohammed. Morocco is also currently fighting local Wahhabist elements and attributes this pressure to Saudi Arabia. Relations between Morocco and the Saudis have chilled a great deal as a result. The two Hashemite kings have thus identified a joint interest and are uniting against what they attribute to Saudi Arabia’s strong influence over the design of the U.S. plan.

(MENAFN- Jordan News Agency) Cairo, Apr. 21 (Petra) -- Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Ayman Safadi reaffirmed Jordan's position towards the Palestinian cause, which he said, "will remain the first and central cause" and towards achieving comprehensive peace. During his statement on Sunday at the extraordinary session of the Council of the Arab League at the ministerial level that Jordan will save no effort in supporting the Palestinians and their legitimate rights. He warned of the gravity of the situations in occupied Palestinian territories, calling for intensifying the joint Arab work and communicating with the international community to find a political detente to end the occupation and set up a Palestinian state. Safadi emphasized that Jordan will continue saving no effort in protecting occupied Jerusalem and its Muslim and Christian holy sites through His Majesty King Abdullah II's direct follow up. "Sovereignty over Jerusalem is Palestinian and custodianship over its sanctities is Hashemite directed by His Majesty King Abdullah II who has been harnessing all of Jordan's capabilities to protect them, but the responsibility of defending Jerusalem, its identity and legal status quo is Jordanian, Palestinian, Arab, Islamic and international," he said, adding that Jerusalem is the basis for peace and tampering with it or its sanctities is a threat to international peace and security. The session, which was convened upon the request of the state of Palestine, discussed challenges facing the Palestinian cause, as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas gave a comprehensive briefing about the developments in the Palestinian arena. Safadi also highlighted the importance of the Arab countries to adopt a new strategy to face the challenges facing the Palestinian cause based on Arab principles that have been reaffirmed in all Arab summits and in cooperation with the international community that supports the two-state solution as the only viable way to bring about peace. He also warned of the dangers in the occupied Palestinian territories in light of the Israeli measures and decisions that undermine the two-state solution, stressing the importance of adopting effective actions to help in addressing the financial issues suffered by the Palestinian National Authority.

He said that it was essential the international community understand the importance Jordan puts on being the custodian of Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian holy sites. “Jordan’s commitment to harmony and peace underlies our international role, our fight against terror and hatred on all fronts within a holistic approach,” the king said. In the wake of Israel’s elections on April 9 and the long-delayed decision by the White House to roll out a peace plan, Jordan’s role is key to any plan’s success and stability in the region. His speech underpins the policy of the kingdom, a small country with a struggling economy that is also a linchpin of security between Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria. Jordan recently hosted the World Economic Forum’s Middle East and North Africa meeting and held an important meeting in late January with Arab leaders to discuss the region’s future. In a trip to Jordan in early April, the kingdom’s challenges were clear. More than 1 million Syrians fled to Jordan during the Syrian conflict and 660,000 registered as refugees with UNHCR. It has the second highest number of refugees per capita in the world. The refugees are poor, with 80 percent living below the poverty line, most in rural areas and 51 percent of the population being children. Many of them do not live in refugee camps, meaning they are present throughout northern Jordan and in Amman, the capital. Despite the Syrian regime reconquering southern Syria last year, ostensibly offering amnesty to Syrian rebels, and reopening the border, the refugees are not going back. Instead they still require large amounts of assistance. UNHCR provided 132,000 people with cash assistance, 124,000 of them Syrians, in Jordan in March 2019. And this requires funding, to the tune of more than $500 million a year from the United Nations. It is worthwhile to look at Jordan’s historic role in the region in this respect. In the period up until the 1970s, Jordan was a key player in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. From controlling the West Bank through 1967, to its crackdown on Palestinian militant groups in in 1970, the kingdom also came to host millions of Palestinian refugees. Since the 1980s things have changed. Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994 as part of the Oslo era when it appeared a Palestinian state would come into being. Since the Trump administration came into office, the king of Jordan and Donald Trump have been in regular contact. Abdullah flew to Washington to meet U.S. officials in January 2017, telling the United States that the defeat of ISIS and the resolution of the Syrian conflict were key issues for Jordan. He was also concerned about Trump’s plans to move the embassy and how to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He met with Trump in April and September 2017, and emphasized the importance of confronting terrorism and regional security. Jordan rejected the U.S. embassy decision in December 2017, calling it “null.” More Jordan-U.S. talks were held in June of 2018 and March 2019 to examine the White House’s peace plan. It appears that Jordan has consistently sought a close working relationship with the United States, urging caution regarding U.S. decisions on Jerusalem, while seeking to influence any U.S. peace plan. Towards that end, the Trump administration has paused rolling out the peace plan, waiting for Israeli elections to conclude on April 9, 2019. Three years ago when I went to Jordan, the kingdom was still at the height of the refugee crises and was the center of a U.S. program to help train moderate Syrian rebels. That program was wrapped up in July 2017. During the period that the United States had embarked on training rebel groups, it had also moved into Tanf (Tanaf), a desert area in Syria near the Jordanian-Iraqi border. Since then that base has had an unclear future. In October, before Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from Syria, General Joseph Votel visited the base. Russia and the Syrian regime have sought to portray the U.S. presence in Tanf as both an illegal occupation of Syrian land and a place of suffering for Syrian refugees who fled to be under the U.S. security umbrella that extends around Tanf. At the same time, some U.S. policymakers believe that Tanf helps to block Iranian influence. The concept here is that the base, by its very existence, exerts influence around it and thus can help block the Iranian “corridor to the sea.” Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, and Iranian-backed groups in Syria both use the Iraq-Syrian border as a crossing. The United States has struck Syrian militias approaching Tanf. Across the border in Iraq, U.S. forces have faced harassment from Iranian-backed groups. Now that the United States has designated the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a terrorist organization and Iran has openly called for the United States to leave Iraq, Tanf and Jordan are of even greater importance to U.S. policy in the region. And Iran is watching: reports in Iranian media say that Jordan won’t take over the Tanf base if the United States withdraws. For now, the United States is poised to leave troops in Syria after the March defeat of ISIS. The issue facing Jordan is now a balancing act. Jordan wants to maintain close relations with the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas and does not want any instability in the West Bank. Israeli actions in Jerusalem—tensions over a mosque for instance—a U.S. peace plan, or even spillover from conflict in Gaza can all threaten stability in the West Bank. Jordan has repeatedly said that it is essential that a “just and comprehensive” solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict leads to a two state solution. Jordan also wants to build consensus among southern Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and Egypt. Jordan seeks to leverage this group to not only discuss Syria reentering the Arab League, but also to speak out about warming relations between the Gulf and Israel. Jordan was critical of Oman at the World Economic Forum Dead Sea even on April 7, arguing that Israel was occupying Arab land in the West Bank, while Oman has sought closer ties with Israel. Jordan’s main concern is not just balancing US policy, the post-Syria conflict, and the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, it also wants to find a way forward regarding the Syrian refugees. In conversations with refugees in Jordan in April it was clear that none of them expressed an interest in returning to Syria. One after another of those interviewed said that after initial hopes last year regarding the Syrian regime’s overtures, those who returned were detained and young men were taken away for forced conscription. Many of the refugees have been in Jordan for up to seven years. They have a high birth rate and many of those interviewed said they had one or two children already born in Jordan. That forms part of a large and growing population of Syrians in Jordan. The Syrians in Jordan mostly come from southern Syria and some have family ties in Jordan. Therefore, they have integrated culturally into Jordan. Jordan has also eased restrictions to allow some to work in certain industries, primarily as menial laborers. The idea is that they should not compete on the labor market with middle class Jordanians. With rents and costs rising at least in part due to so many refugees, the issue of economic competition and resentment is a real one. The local government officials and charitable organizations involved in helping the refugees, such as Caritas Jordan, a Catholic relief organization, repeatedly emphasize that Jordan sees itself as doing its duty to host the refugees who are portrayed as “brothers” of Jordanians. The larger issue in coming years will be if the Syrians choose to stay for the long term they will create a new, young generation. With around ten million Jordanians, the Syrians make up more than ten percent of the population. Jordan has already faced a smaller crisis after the United States cut aid to Palestinian refugees. It has concerns that UNHCR or other organizations may reduce funding. The kingdom is a key to regional security in the coming year and U.S. policymakers should recognize and build on that. The king’s position is also consistent and clear. In Italy he expressed support for “a viable, independent, sovereign Palestinian state, on the 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and a secure Israel, fully part of its own region, recognized by Arab and Muslim states around the world.” How the Trump administration chooses to roll out its peace plan, and how Netanyahu chooses to tack after the elections, whether he decides to go through annexing parts of the West Bank for instance, could have major repercussions for Jordan.

News article:
Jordan has been experiencing tough days which have led it to the current economic crisis given the absence of any Arab support. Instead, the Arabs' dollars are being set on fire in crushing wars here and there. Moreover, the Arabs and Israel are fighting from the same trench to pressure Jordan to accept the deal of the century. While Arab support is absent, the trade between Jordan and Israel has reduced to 65 per cent of what it was ten years ago. It has become known nowadays that the difficult situation in Jordan is due to its rejection of the deal of the century, an American-Israeli peace project that aims to eliminate and liquidate all issues, including Jerusalem and the refugees. Instead, the agreement seeks to resolve these issues at the expense of the Jordanian identity and interests, and of course, at the expense of the Palestinian people. Jordan is aware that it is engaging in the most difficult and most important confrontation since 1967, and therefore it has rejected all the generous offers it received. Such proposals include paying off its debt for the entire year, amounting to $40 billion in exchange for agreeing to the deal of the century. This is because it will ultimately mean that Jordan is selling Jerusalem, as well as Jordan itself, for this amount, making Jerusalem an Israeli city and Jordan, a homeland for refugees. The Palestinian cause will end with this in the face of the Arab, Israel, and American pressure, which Jordan is forced to confront. Jordan sees no other way of facing such pressure except by making a change, and this change has become apparent in several Jordanian measures over the past few days. The most important of such measures is the signing of several agreements with Qatar in the military and economic fields during a visit by a senior-level Qatari delegation. READ: Islamists make comeback in union elections in Jordan This means that Jordan has indeed begun looking for new allies in the region. Moreover, as of the beginning of 2019, King Abdullah II visited Turkey and met with Erdogan, as well as visited Tunisia, the cradle of the Arab Spring, and met with President Essebsi. He even sent a rare congratulatory telegram to the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani and visited Iraq, which is the first visit in 10 years. Jordan's most recent notable action occurred on a national level, as King Abdullah II met with Muslim Brotherhood MPs, which is the first meeting between Muslim Brotherhood leaders and the King in over seven years. This move has several implications for the countries pressuring Jordan. Significant developments are occurring in Jordan, which is experiencing a historically important turning point. However, the most significant event has not happened yet, i.e. ending the peace agreement with Israel, known as the Wadi Araba Treaty, completely and withdrawing from it. If the Israelis, along with with the Americans, the mediator and treaty guarantor, want to change the status of Jerusalem and the status of the refugees, then they would be violating the treaty's main clauses. The treaty stipulates that "Israel respects the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem," and "When negotiations on the permanent status will take place, Israel will give high priority to the historic Jordanian role in these shrines." The agreement also clearly states that Jordan must be involved in any solution related to the refugees, as it hosts the largest number of refugees since the Nakba in Palestine in 1948. Jordan's response to the deal of the century should be nothing less than completely withdrawing the peace agreement with Israel, as it cannot continue to adhere to an agreement that does not preserve Jordan's main interests. This along with the continued loss of the economic benefits of this treaty, which means that the deal is gradually losing all economic and political value and benefit.

He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions. Darius Shahtahmasebi is a New Zealand-based legal and political analyst who focuses on US foreign policy in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific region. He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s visit to Tehran has been marred by two recent deadly attacks. Despite an apparent willingness to cooperate, there remains many outside players who will push for this alliance to fail. Someone clearly hates the idea of peaceful dialogue between Iran and Pakistan. Whether a coincidence or not, the timing of an attack in Pakistan within barely a day or two of a planned visit to Iran’s capital by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is certainly perfect timing for those who view an increasing relationship between the two nations through negative terms. The attack in question saw at least 14 Pakistani security forces personnel killed in a bus ambush. Not helping the issue, is the fact that Pakistan’s foreign office instantly blamed the attack on Iran, accusing Iran of inaction against ethnic Baloch separatist groups, even as Khan was set to visit Tehran. In February, there was similarly an attack in eastern Iran that killed at least 27 Iranian security personnel. Tehran warned Islamabad it would “pay a heavy price” for allegedly harboring the militants who planned the suicide bombing, which was claimed by the Pakistan-based Jaish al-Adl group. Now, I am not saying that there is any conspiracy behind the attacks. I mean, why would I need to bother? Whether there are attacks or not, the media and a handful of notable leaderships will continue to portray Iran-Pakistan relations as the worst possible form of détente imaginable. All this being said, the two countries were able to have a somewhat fruitful and productive engagement during Khan’s visit. The news that is likely to infuriate some other major players on the world stage is the announcement of a creation of a joint rapid reaction force along the shared border of Iran and Pakistan. Ironically, the recent attacks against Iranian and Pakistani personnel may have brought these two nations closer together, as Khan announced that Pakistan will not allow any militant groups to operate from Pakistani soil, vowing to dismantle any militant group inside the country. On a side note, WikiLeaks documents have shown that Saudi Arabia financed militant groups inside Pakistan. Even Deutsche Welle notes that most of the Pakistani based militant groups “unleashing terror” on Pakistan’s minority Shiite population “take inspiration from the hardline Saudi-Wahhabi Islamic ideology”. Khan’s visit also magically coincided with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s announcement that it was clamping down hard on countries who sought to buy Iranian oil, namely, India, Japan, South Korea, Turkey and of course, China, who account for about half of Iranian oil exports. This would undoubtedly send a clear picture to Pakistan about what will happen if it continues down its current trajectory. Also on rt.com United States to end sanction waivers for countries importing Iranian oil Undeterred, Pakistan and Iran have agreed to establish a so-called barter committee to help in a planned increase in trade, with an eye for bypassing US-enforced sanctions. Despite the picture the media wants to paint of a hostile Pakistan weary of an aggressive, terrorist-supporting Iran, the truth is that Iran and Pakistan are not really traditionally that adversarial. Historically speaking, the two countries have had relatively friendly relations. Iran was one of the first countries to recognise and reach out to Pakistan after its creation in 1947. In fact, then-Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was the first head of a foreign nation to visit the newly created country. Iran also provided moral and material support to Pakistan during its infamous conflicts with India in 1965 and 1971. The countries only really split along a Sunni-Shia divide after the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. Aside from strengthening its relations with Saudi Arabia, Iran’s major rival, Pakistan also became a major US ally, particularly during the Afghan-Soviet war in the 1980s. Iran then viewed Pakistan as nothing but a lackey state of the United States. Even though, Khan has made it clear that Pakistan holds no ill will to Iran following the revolution, purportedly stating that “I came here [to Iran] in 1972. I saw a big difference between the rich and the poor, a big cultural difference. Iran has become a more egalitarian society that is what the revolution has done.” Despite the fact these two countries have many long standing differences and areas of competition, they still have many avenues of cooperation that they have felt the need to pursue. One such avenue is the question of Afghanistan. For example, India has increased its interest in the war-ravaged nation, which puts Pakistan in a very compromising position indeed given it is essentially on the verge of a major war with its Indian neighbour. According to Khan, both Pakistan and Iran have been affected by the conflict in Afghanistan, hosting millions of refugees between the two nations. Iran and Pakistan have also been in the line of fire of Donald Trump’s hawkish administration. While Trump’s desire to annihilate Tehran is much more apparent than any such desire to go to war with Pakistan, we cannot ignore the major blows to US-Pakistan relations that have occurred under the watch of Trump. The two nations further share close relations with China, the formulation of which has been termed as a trilateral nexus by the Asia Times. Pakistan and Iran also have a pipeline of their own capable of pursuing, which will most likely entail the deepening of cooperation even in spite of their major differences. Another interesting aspect that comes into play in this dynamic – which I guarantee you, you will never see highlighted in a corporate media outlet – is that Iranian President Rouhani actually enjoys the support of the local ethnic Sunni population of Iran. Therefore, it is not beyond the administration of Rouhani to work more closely with its predominantly Sunni neighbours (if you don’t believe me, I wrote an extensive article highlighting the notable attempts by Iran to reach out to Sunni Saudi Arabia over the last few years). Also on rt.com What you won’t hear from US govt: Iran is open to working with Saudi Arabia The major problem that Pakistan faces is that while it can find common ground with Iran, including on matters in relation to economic ties and security, it does not want to irk Saudi Arabia too much, a nation which just pledged $20 billion in investments to Pakistan. Islamabad is likewise not impressed by Iran’s growing relationship with India. This is why Pakistan put itself in a questionable position whereby its former Chief of Army staff was appointed as what is essentially the head of a Saudi-led Arab NATO, which does not include Iran (indeed, it seems as though its existence is based on the idea that it needs to counter Iran). At the end of the day, the optimist in me reckons that there are enough areas of cooperation between the two countries which can help to balance out the devastating rivalries between Iran and Saudi Arabia and prevent a deadly war. But in all honesty, if you were to compare the outcomes between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s (MBS) visit to Pakistan and Khan’s visit to Tehran, the latter seems a bit weak in substance. It seems as though no matter how far Iran reaches its hand out to Pakistan, its loyalty to Saudi Arabia will continue to prevail ($20 billion will always be worth more than anything Iran can ever offer to its neighbour). Not to mention the money that Pakistan is offered from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which also views Tehran mostly in hostile terms. Perhaps Khan can act as a mediator between Iran and Saudi Arabia, but the available evidence suggests there is nothing to mediate. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has destroyed an entire country on its border simply on the suspicion that Iran could be backing the rebel movement inside Yemen. Even the possibility that a rebel-controlled government installed on its border could align itself with Tehran is a major deal-breaker for the Saudi Kingdom, worth starving over 85,000 children to death and threatening behind closed doors that Yemen should “shiver” for generations when they hear Saudi Arabia uttered. The optimist in me is going to have to be a bit more realistic. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

However, India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran, where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy. India had recently approached the International Court of Justice, calling the Jadhav affair an "egregious" Pakistani violation of the provisions of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Addressing a joint press conference with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the end of his two-day trip (21-22 April) to Tehran, Pakistan's Prime Minister had said, "I know Iran has suffered from terrorism (perpetrated) by groups operating from Pakistan. We (need to) have trust in each other that both countries will not allow any terrorist activity from their soil. We hope this will build confidence between us."

Khurrum Dastigir, a senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) attacked Khan, saying the Prime Minister's statement threatens national security, as for the first time he has admitted the use of (the country's) soil for terrorism in Iran, according to a report in Pakistan's Daily Times. Pakistan Peoples Party leader and former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar said that the statement was not funny anymore, alluding to a faux pas in which Khan had referred to Japan when talking about Germany's relations with its European neighbours. "You cannot play with the future of the country anymore. This was not a slip of the tongue. The prime minister has distorted both geography and history for all of us." The Prime Minister's office added that Imran Khan has clearly stated during his visit to Iran that terrorists have been using Afghanistan and Iran as staging grounds for attacking Pakistan.

FILE PHOTO: EXPRESS The Foreign Office (FO) has reiterated that Prime Minister Imran Khan's comments on terrorism during his recent visit to Iran were presented out of context. At the weekly press briefing on Thursday, FO Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal said PM Imran was referring to foreign-funded non-state actors when he spoke of Iran being affected by terrorists operating from Pakistani soil. "We must remember that even Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested from the Pak-Iran border region." He announced that a meeting of the Pak-Iran border commission would be held in Islamabad next month. "Meetings of the Pak-Iran Joint Economic Commission and other bilateral groups will also be conducted over the course of this year," said Dr Faisal. "As stated by the premier during the press conference with President Rouhani, security issues of both sides need to be resolved completely through greater cooperation. We remain committed to comprehensive efforts to this end." Responding to a question, the FO spokesperson clarified that the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project was also discussed. "Both sides remain committed to the successful completion of the project." On PM Imran's visit to China starting today, the FO spokesperson said the four-day tour was of vital importance. "The prime minister will be holding meetings with the top Chinese leadership and other top leaders from around the world. This will be a very interesting and extremely important visit." Dr Faisal also condemned India's continuing atrocities in occupied Kashmir. "The occupying force has martyred two more innocent Kashmiris and has barred cellular services in the occupied valley. India continues to inflict misery on the people of Kashmir. We strongly condemn the treatment of Yasin Malik and other Kashmiri leaders and, once again, urge India to realise the need for dialogue," he said. He said Pakistan would continue to raise its voice against the anti-Muslim and anti-minorities policies of India's ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Responding to a question, the FO spokesperson said any future decision on Jaish-e-Muhammad leader Masood Azhar would be in line with Pakistan's national interest. On Sri Lanka, Dr Faisal said Pakistan had strongly condemned the Easter terrorist attacks and multiple offers of assistance and support were extended to the Sri Lankans. "We have not yet received any request for assistance in the investigation and forensics. Pakistan remains ready and willing to provide all possible support to Sri Lanka." On Afghanistan, he said Pakistan remains committed to an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led solution to the Afghanistan conflict. The weekly FO briefing concluded on a question regarding the status of the Pakistani community among rising violence in Libya. "Our high commission in Tripoli is in constant contact with the Pakistani community. We are monitoring the situation closely and are facilitating Pakistani nationals," said Dr Faisal.

FILE PHOTO: EXPRESS The Foreign Office (FO) has reiterated that Prime Minister Imran Khan's comments on terrorism during his recent visit to Iran were presented out of context. At the weekly press briefing on Thursday, FO Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal said PM Imran was referring to foreign-funded non-state actors when he spoke of Iran being affected by terrorists operating from Pakistani soil. "We must remember that even Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested from the Pak-Iran border region." He announced that a meeting of the Pak-Iran border commission would be held in Islamabad next month. "Meetings of the Pak-Iran Joint Economic Commission and other bilateral groups will also be conducted over the course of this year," said Dr Faisal.

News article:
Pakistan not to back any aggression against Iran: speakers IRNA – Senior political figures and leading Pakistani thinker said that Pakistan would not become part of any military misadventure against Iran. They emphasized on the government to strengthen relations with Iran by addressing issues of mutual concern and building trade ties. They said that Iran and Pakistan should cooperate for greater Asia region. They also stressed upon the need for the implementation of Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project for Pakistan’s national interest. They were speaking at a seminar on ‘Pakistan – Iran Relation: Challenges and Prospects’ organized by Islamabad Policy Institute (IPI). The discussion was held in the context of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s recent trip to Tehran. Ambassador of Iran to Pakistan Mehdi Honardoost was also present on the occasion. Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi, in his key note speech, recalled how Prime Minister Khan and the Iranian leadership overcame their communication gap during the premier’s visit to Iran through some candid talk. “It was a very positive visit. Ice has been broken and foundation has been laid for better ties. We now have to build on it,” he said in his assessment of Mr Khan’s maiden trip to Iran. While pointing out that several countries have continued trading with Iran despite sanctions, the federal minister said, ‘We too need to keep our interest supreme and explore ways for completing gas pipeline.’ He noted that absence of banking channels had been a major hindrance in development of ties, therefore a barter mechanism was under discussion for promoting bilateral trade. Chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator Mushahid Hussain, while presiding over the session, said the two neighboring countries enjoyed convergences in geography and culture with Allama Iqbal being the cementing factor; and compatibility of interest. ‘There is no incompatibility of interest on core issues,’ he underscored. However, he observed, there were concerns, mostly in security domain, which were being addressed through an ongoing and sustained security dialogue. Mushahid said Pakistan would never support a military adventure in the region and would not allow its territory to be used against Iran. He opined that scrapping of the Iran nuclear deal was detrimental for global and regional peace. He thanked Supreme Leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei for supporting the Kashmir cause. Pakistan Peoples Party leader Farhatullah Babar hailed PM Khan’s candid remarks on terrorism during Iran visit saying relations can be improved only by beginning with a clean slate. ‘There should be truth telling on both sides and the issue of ungoverned spaces on either sides of the border need to be tackled immediately,’ he said and regretted that in the past this important relationship was mishandled. Convener of Pak-Iran Friendship Group in Senate Lt Gen (R) Abdul Qayyum said there should be efforts for developing direct air link between Islamabad and Tehran and bilateral trade even if through barter to avoid sanctions. Gen Qayyum said Pakistan would never support aggression against Iran or its diplomatic isolation and economic strangulation. Director General Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) Aizaz Chaudhry said that it was incomprehensible that Pakistan and Iran have not fully exploited the potential of their economic cooperation and trade. He believed that border security issues should have been resolved long ago. These issues, he suggested, can be effectively addressed through security and intelligence coordination. “There is no option for the two countries, but to improve their bilateral cooperation and coordination,” he emphasized. Former Foreign Minister and President Pakistan Council on China Inamul Haque called for exploring ways through which bilateral trade can be enhanced with Iran despite the US sanctions and regularizing illegal trade. He also asked for seeing why fencing was required on borders with Iran and Afghanistan. Executive Director Islamabad Policy Institute Professor Sajjad Bokhari said that Iran and Pakistan always enjoy strong brotherly ties. He added that border between Iran and Pakistan is the border of peace and both countries have always shown readiness to discuss border issues at the very highest level. He added that improved border security can help for better understanding on different issues.

News article:
For Pakistan, the arrival of the United States in its neighbourhood cannot be seen as a happy development. Washington has a presence among four out of five Pakistani neighbours. Some of what Washington is doing around Pakistan may pose serious problems for Islamabad. In an earlier article, I explained why India-occupied Kashmir, or IOK, needed to be treated as a full-fledged Pakistani neighbour. The Line of Control (LoC), the boundary between Kashmir and Pakistan, is not an international frontier, but it has a dynamic difference from the Pakistan-India border. Even in IOK, the United States has played a role. Donald Trump, the American President, has drawn close to Narendra Modi who is about to be reelected as India’s prime minister for a second five-year term. There is no doubt that the growing relations with the United States had a sanction for New Delhi’s approach to Kashmir. Among other things, Modi is committing serious human rights violations in the part of the state that India occupies. What is the likely impact of that on South Asia is a story for another day. Today, I will concern myself with Washington’s rapidly-deteriorating relations with Tehran.There are two individuals in the US administration who are pushing their country towards a possible all-out war with Iran. The first, of course, is President Trump. He has a problem with Iran for two reasons. He is anti-Islam and anti-Muslim and sees Iran as an aggressive promoter of the Islamic faith. The President is also under the influence of Benjamin Netanyahu, recently elected to the fifth term as prime minister of Israel. The Israeli leader has convinced the American President that Iran presents an existential threat to the Jewish state. Israel has strong support in the United States not only of the powerful Jewish community but also of the Evangelical Christians whose interpretation of their scripture has the Jewish command of all of Palestine as a way towards the second coming of Christ.The other person responsible for the adoption by Washington of a hardline approach towards Iran is the influence of the national security adviser, John Bolton. Dexter Filkins of The New Yorker has a long Bolton profile in the magazine’s May 6 issue. In it, he tries to explain the long-cultivated hostility of Bolton towards Iran. His office is a few steps away from President Trump’s Oval Office. He sees Trump every morning before the President begins his day and every evening when he retires to his private quarters. Filkins, when he went to interview Bolton for the profile, saw on the wall of his office the framed executive order signed by Trump that pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran by Barack Obama in 2015. Bolton told Filkins that the day Trump signed that order was the happiest in his long career in public service.The tit-for-tat relationship between Iran and the United States took the two countries to a near-war situation on Monday, May 6, when the Pentagon decided to dispatch the Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln escorted by a fleet of navy ships to the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon issued a statement that cited “heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests” as the reason for moving ships closer to Iran. An agency spokesman said the carrier deployment “ensured we have forces” in the region to “defend American personnel”.The navy move followed two earlier decisions. In one, Washington refused to grant further extension to China, India, Japan and South Korea that had been allowed to import oil from Iran when the United States reimposed sanctions on Iran. Iraq was also treated as a special case as it was allowed to import energy from Iran in the form of electricity. This was done after Washington withdrew from the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran. Under the 2015 arrangement, Iran shipped roughly 97% of its nuclear fuel stockpile out of the country. With that done, experts didn’t believe Iran had enough weapon-grade material on hand to make a nuclear bomb. By closing the entire foreign market for Iranian oil, the United States aimed to produce enough pressure on the Iranian economy that would bring people out on the street and possibly cause regime change. That was all along the aim pursued by John Bolton. In response, Iran said that it would protect itself from what it called “economic terrorism”.The second action resulted in placing Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organisations. This was the first time that the terrorist designation was given to an arm of another nation’s government. In response, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared all American forces in the Middle East terrorists and labelled the United States government a state sponsor of terrorism. In early 2019, Bolton declared that the 5,200 American troops that remained in Iraq should stay there to “watch Iran”. There are no known attacks against American troops in Iraq from armed groups known as Popular Mobilisation Forces, some of which are linked to Iran.

News article:
For Pakistan, the arrival of the United States in its neighbourhood cannot be seen as a happy development. Washington has a presence among four out of five Pakistani neighbours. Some of what Washington is doing around Pakistan may pose serious problems for Islamabad. In an earlier article, I explained why India-occupied Kashmir, or IOK, needed to be treated as a full-fledged Pakistani neighbour. The Line of Control (LoC), the boundary between Kashmir and Pakistan, is not an international frontier, but it has a dynamic difference from the Pakistan-India border. Even in IOK, the United States has played a role. Donald Trump, the American President, has drawn close to Narendra Modi who is about to be reelected as India’s prime minister for a second five-year term. There is no doubt that the growing relations with the United States had a sanction for New Delhi’s approach to Kashmir. Among other things, Modi is committing serious human rights violations in the part of the state that India occupies. What is the likely impact of that on South Asia is a story for another day. Today, I will concern myself with Washington’s rapidly-deteriorating relations with Tehran.There are two individuals in the US administration who are pushing their country towards a possible all-out war with Iran. The first, of course, is President Trump. He has a problem with Iran for two reasons. He is anti-Islam and anti-Muslim and sees Iran as an aggressive promoter of the Islamic faith. The President is also under the influence of Benjamin Netanyahu, recently elected to the fifth term as prime minister of Israel. The Israeli leader has convinced the American President that Iran presents an existential threat to the Jewish state. Israel has strong support in the United States not only of the powerful Jewish community but also of the Evangelical Christians whose interpretation of their scripture has the Jewish command of all of Palestine as a way towards the second coming of Christ.The other person responsible for the adoption by Washington of a hardline approach towards Iran is the influence of the national security adviser, John Bolton. Dexter Filkins of The New Yorker has a long Bolton profile in the magazine’s May 6 issue. In it, he tries to explain the long-cultivated hostility of Bolton towards Iran. His office is a few steps away from President Trump’s Oval Office. He sees Trump every morning before the President begins his day and every evening when he retires to his private quarters. Filkins, when he went to interview Bolton for the profile, saw on the wall of his office the framed executive order signed by Trump that pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran by Barack Obama in 2015. Bolton told Filkins that the day Trump signed that order was the happiest in his long career in public service.The tit-for-tat relationship between Iran and the United States took the two countries to a near-war situation on Monday, May 6, when the Pentagon decided to dispatch the Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln escorted by a fleet of navy ships to the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon issued a statement that cited “heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests” as the reason for moving ships closer to Iran. An agency spokesman said the carrier deployment “ensured we have forces” in the region to “defend American personnel”.The navy move followed two earlier decisions. In one, Washington refused to grant further extension to China, India, Japan and South Korea that had been allowed to import oil from Iran when the United States reimposed sanctions on Iran. Iraq was also treated as a special case as it was allowed to import energy from Iran in the form of electricity. This was done after Washington withdrew from the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran. Under the 2015 arrangement, Iran shipped roughly 97% of its nuclear fuel stockpile out of the country. With that done, experts didn’t believe Iran had enough weapon-grade material on hand to make a nuclear bomb. By closing the entire foreign market for Iranian oil, the United States aimed to produce enough pressure on the Iranian economy that would bring people out on the street and possibly cause regime change. That was all along the aim pursued by John Bolton. In response, Iran said that it would protect itself from what it called “economic terrorism”.The second action resulted in placing Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organisations. This was the first time that the terrorist designation was given to an arm of another nation’s government. In response, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared all American forces in the Middle East terrorists and labelled the United States government a state sponsor of terrorism. In early 2019, Bolton declared that the 5,200 American troops that remained in Iraq should stay there to “watch Iran”. There are no known attacks against American troops in Iraq from armed groups known as Popular Mobilisation Forces, some of which are linked to Iran. According to one account, “there are some 30 armed groups in Iraq that are now part of the Iraqi forces. Most of them were formed to help fight the Islamic State when the Iraqi Army collapsed in 2014, and some were trained and armed by Iran.” The fight against the ISIS also involved the United States.

News article:
Voicing serious concerns over the deepening crisis in the Persian Gulf, Pakistan on Thursday urged Iran and the United States to show restraint as any “miscalculated move can transmute into a large-scale conflict”.Speaking at a weekly news briefing in Islamabad, Foreign Office Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal said recent developments in the Persian Gulf region were disturbing.He emphasised the need for resolving all issues through peaceful dialogue and engagement by all sides.“The US decision to deploy aircraft carrier and bombers has added to the tensions and the existing precarious security situation in Middle East,” Faisal said. “We expect all sides to show restraint as a miscalculated move can transmute into a large-scale conflict."His statement came against the backdrop of heightened fears of a clash between the US and Iran. The US has recently sent an aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the Middle East in response to what officials called “a credible threat” by Iranian regime forces.Saudi Arabia said that several of its oil tankers had been damaged in mysterious “sabotage attacks” after US warnings that Iran could target shipping in the region.Observers believe that any serious conflict between Iran and the US would test the diplomatic skills of Pakistan, which has close ties with Iran’s arch rival Saudi Arabia but at the same time does not want to antagonise the neighbouring country.Sensing the gravity of the situation, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi recently admitted that Pakistan needed to evolve a clear strategy on the Iran-US tensions. He went on to say that Pakistan would not join any camp in case of a conflict broke out between the Tehran and Washington. Qureshi noted that Pakistan would evolve its strategy keeping in view its best national interests.Meanwhile, the spokesperson said the UAE government had decided to release 572 Pakistani prisoners languishing in their jails. “Our mission in the UAE is in touch with the UAE authorities in order to expedite their release and deportation,” Faisal said.He also said that soon a good news would be shared regarding the release of Pakistani prisoners from Saudi jails. Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman during his visit to Pakistan in February had agreed to release over 2,000 Pakistan prisoners, held over minor crimes, at the request of Prime Minister Imran Khan.The spokesperson also confirmed that 50 Pakistanis were deported from the United States on Wednesday through a chartered flight.On the current situation in Kashmir, Faisal strongly condemned the Indian atrocities, saying the valley had been turned into a military camp, “where people are under siege, facing injustice, harassment and barbarism”.The spokesperson asked India to stop “misleading international community on Kashmir dispute and accept the ground realities and aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”

News article:
Pakistan has four immediate neighbours. All four are in the midst of more significant crises than Pakistan itself is in. All four have an enormous influence on the security and the economy of Pakistan. All four pull Pakistan in different directions. Let’s begin with the easiest of the four. China is the most important global partner Pakistan has. Without Chinese investment through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and the priority status it was afforded within President Xi Jinping’s wider Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistanis throughout the country would still be facing long, arduous stretched of the day without electricity. Since the PTI government took over, the relationship between the two countries has seen a lull, with at least three federal ministers – Razzak Dawood, Murad Saeed and Noorul Haq Qadri – taking public shots at China and CPEC. China is not unfamiliar with the PTI, given that it had to delay the launch of CPEC in 2014 thanks to its infamous dharna. China also doesn’t make policy on the fly. The China-Pakistan relationship can be shaken by the shenanigans of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ministers, but it cannot be stirred. The foundations of the bilateral relationship are strong enough to be able to withstand Razzak Dawood’s business interests, Saeed’s vocal chords and Qadri’s religiosity. So the primary issue today for Pakistan is not bilateral, but rather how Pakistan deals with potential changes to China’s own quantum of power and freedom within the global system. Growing trade tensions between China and the United States? Bad for Pakistan. Diminished capacity in China to spend large sums of money abroad? Bad for Pakistan. Increased pressure on China to assuage the US and its partners at the UN and FATF? Bad for Pakistan. In summary, a strong bilateral relationship between China and Pakistan cannot insure Pakistan from China’s wider vulnerabilities. The Masood Azhar listing at the UNSC and the upcoming FATF meetings in June this year and beyond increasingly illustrate the limits to what China can do for Pakistan. The situation between Iran and Pakistan is ever more complex, thanks to Iran’s insatiable appetite for trouble beyond its shores. Iran has active military conflicts, whether directly or through proxies, in virtually half of the entire Middle East and North Africa region. Its investment in sectarian conflict (notwithstanding the degree to which this can be justified as a reaction to Saudi Arabia’s sponsorship of the same), is a clear and present threat to the stability of several countries. But perhaps no one has the same range of vulnerabilities to Iran’s appetite for destruction as Pakistan. As Amir Rana of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies has succinctly summarized in his Dawn column this week, Iran has afforded unprecedented freedom and space to terrorist groups attempting to use Baloch ethnicity. This tactic may well make sense for Iran, from its narrow perspective of its interests in the region, but it may risk alienating a Pakistani military and civilian leadership that has always remained keen to establish stable and strong relations with Tehran. The sticking point in the relationship since the Revolution has been the Ayatollahs' objections to strategic ties between Riyadh and Islamabad – but these ties have never been subject to third-party approval. Meanwhile, there is no guarantee that the reckless and war-mongering John Bolton will fail in baiting his boss, President Trump into a needless conflict with Iran. How would an Iran besieged by the US and its Gulf allies react? How would Pakistan respond to pressures from those countries to take sides? How might Iran-backed sectarian and ethnic terrorist groups react to such conflict? Pakistan has never been divorced from the Arab-Persian conflict that has defined the Middle East since the late 1970s. But its vulnerabilities today are dramatically higher than ever before. Managing Tehran, whilst maintaining the vital strategic partnership Pakistan enjoys with Saudi Arabia, is no walk in the park at the best of times. The capacity to find and maintain equilibrium may be tested like never before. In Afghanistan, the momentum for a breakthrough between the US and the Taliban has suffered a moment of realism. Unlike previous phases in the now almost two-decades-long US military engagement in Afghanistan, today it is the Taliban that can afford to talk and fight simultaneously. The expansion of various footprints for the engagement between the two adversaries has diminished Pakistan’s centrality to the actual outcome – but it does not reduce Pakistan’s vulnerabilities to the absence of a compact for peace in Afghanistan. Absent a relatively quick and sustainable agreement, Afghanistan could very well collapse into a different version of the early 1990s civil war it was ravaged by. Many of the very same individuals that helped destroy Kabul between 1988 and 1996 are now in power. Many of the others that helped seal the destruction from 1996 to 2001 are talking their way back into power. Regardless of the direction of travel for Afghanistan, Pakistan will need to continue to open doors for dialogue with all Afghans, and all Afghan groups. It will have to learn to keep those doors open, despite the tendency of many Afghan leaders to unfairly pin the blame for their corruption and dysfunction on Pakistani interference. And perhaps most importantly, Pakistan will have to play a positive and constructive role for Afghanistan in a manner that eliminates the opportunity for the US and its Western allies, to continue to pin their failure to secure a normal Afghanistan, despite eighteen years of blood and treasure, on Pakistan. In short, Pakistan cannot afford to have rogue non-state actors determine the day’s news bulletins in Afghanistan. If there is one country that stability in Afghanistan favours most, it is Pakistan. This must be visible in both what Pakistan says, and what it does. Finally, there is India. Amidst all the risk and the worry of an evolving China, an insecure and under-threat Iran, and a perpetually unstable Afghanistan, India offers Pakistan a possible glimmer of hope. On Thursday, when the Indian election results are announced, it is likely that another BJP-led government will be formed in New Delhi. If this is the case, Pakistan will be in a position to present the new Indian government with an historic opportunity to frame a new deal for this region and its prosperity. One of the lessons India should have learned from the last decade of its repressive occupation of Kashmir is that its Kashmir policy is a shambles. Pakistan first offered India a decent face-saving path to redemption through the Musharraf four-point formula. Whatever other facts the Pulwama attack and the Balakot invasion may have helped expose, we know that a repeat performance of such events is rife with unprecedented and unimaginable risk to peace in the region, and around the world. The chest-beating in both countries is easy, and obvious (and politicians should be allowed some leeway with their people – especially if it is in the pursuit of historic peace). But ultimately the global risks of this local competition between India and Pakistan are too high for anyone’s liking. What could a new government in India, led by the BJP, be able to do, with its claims of post-Pulwama and post-Balakot victory (notwithstanding how ridiculous such claims may be)? Can the army and PM Imran Khan establish a clear set of principles through which they can offer India an opportunity to address the central and defining issue of Kashmir? Who are the spoilers in such a dynamic? Disruptions in the relationship through alleged terrorist actions have happened before. Perhaps equally important, what exactly will Pakistan have to show for its resistance to Indian hegemony, if the ultimate settlement is an India-centric four-point formula like Musharraf’s? None of these issues are unresolvable. But at least within Pakistan, a serious effort at detente and normalization with India demands a wide spectrum of political ownership. The passage of the 26th Amendment to the constitution was a reflection of how powerful national consensus can be. PM Khan will need to overcome his personal vitriol for the opposition, and reach across the aisle to take forward something as monumental as a re-opening of talks with India. If he does so successfully, he may well achieve the historic status that he longs to achieve for himself in the annals of Pakistani leadership. That is something all Pakistanis will pray for.

Can the army and PM Imran Khan establish a clear set of principles through which they can offer India an opportunity to address the central and defining issue of Kashmir? Who are the spoilers in such a dynamic? Disruptions in the relationship through alleged terrorist actions have happened before. Perhaps equally important, what exactly will Pakistan have to show for its resistance to Indian hegemony, if the ultimate settlement is an India-centric four-point formula like Musharraf’s? None of these issues are unresolvable. But at least within Pakistan, a serious effort at detente and normalization with India demands a wide spectrum of political ownership. The passage of the 26th Amendment to the constitution was a reflection of how powerful national consensus can be. PM Khan will need to overcome his personal vitriol for the opposition, and reach across the aisle to take forward something as monumental as a re-opening of talks with India. If he does so successfully, he may well achieve the historic status that he longs to achieve for himself in the annals of Pakistani leadership. That is something all Pakistanis will pray for. The writer is an analyst and commentator.

News article:
Iran's foreign minister was in Pakistan on Friday, a critically timed visit amid a simmering crisis between Tehran and Washington and ahead of next week's emergency Arab League meeting called by Saudi Arabia over regional tensions. The purpose of the visit by Mohammad Javad Zarif, who held talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and also Prime Minister Imran Khan, was not made public. But there has been speculation that Iran is looking to Islamabad and its close relationship with Riyadh to help de-escalate the situation. Ahead of Zarif's arrival, Pakistan's foreign ministry called on "all sides to show restraint, as any miscalculated move, can transmute into a large-scale conflict." Zarif has been criticized by name this week by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who named him and President Hassan Rouhani as failing to implement the leader's orders over Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Khamenei had claimed the deal had "numerous ambiguities and structural weaknesses" that could damage Iran. The official Iranian news agency IRNA quoted Zarif in Islamabad as warning of anarchy if world powers did not unite to stop what he called U.S. aggression — Iran's official parlance for Washington's pressure on Tehran. Tensions have ratcheted up recently in the Mideast as the White House earlier this month sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region over a still-unexplained threat it perceived from Iran. And on Thursday, the Pentagon outlined proposals to the White House to send military reinforcements to the Middle East to beef up defenses against Iran. The crisis takes root in the steady unraveling of the nuclear deal, intended to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The accord promised economic incentives in exchange for restrictions on Tehran's nuclear activities. The Trump administration pulled America out of the deal last year, and subsequently re-imposed and escalated U.S. sanctions on Tehran — sending Iran's economy into freefall. Khamenei's criticism of Zarif signaled a hard-line tilt in how the Islamic Republic will react going forward amid President Donald Trump's maximalist pressure campaign. Iran declared earlier this month that the remaining signatories to the deal — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have two months to develop a plan to shield Iran from American sanctions. On Monday, Iran announced it had quadrupled its production capacity of low-enriched uranium, making it likely that Tehran will soon exceed the stockpile limitations set by the nuclear accord, which would escalate the situation further. Several incidents have added to the crisis. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia said Yemen's Iran-aligned rebels again targeted an airport near its southern border with a bomb-carrying drone. The Saudi military said it intercepted the drone, while the rebel Houthis said it struck a Patriot missile battery at the airport. The Houthis have claimed three times in recent days to have targeted the airport, which also hosts a military base. It comes after the Houthis last week targeted a Saudi oil pipeline in a coordinated drone attack. Pakistan was quick to condemn the attacks and promised Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally, its full support. The kingdom this week announced a $3.2 billion deferred oil and gas payment package for energy-strapped Islamabad. With neighboring Iran, Pakistan walks a fine line and their relationship is sometimes prickly. Islamabad has little leverage with Washington, although relations between the two have improved since Pakistan expressed readiness to help move talks between the Afghan Taliban and Washington forward. IRNA also reported that Zarif came to Pakistan with a proposal to link Iran's port of Chabahar on the Arabian Sea with Pakistan's Gwadar port, mostly being developed by China as part of the multi-billion-dollar One Road project that will connect the Arabian Sea with China. The proposal is unexpected because Pakistan's rival India has been Iran's partner in developing Chabahar while Iran's key regional rival, Saudi Arabia, has been in talks to develop an oil refinery facility at Pakistan's Gwadar, though no agreements have been signed. Meanwhile, Oman's Foreign Ministry said it was working to "ease the tensions" between Iran and the U.S. The ministry in a series of tweets on Friday morning attributed the comments to Yusuf bin Alawi, the sultanate's minister of state for foreign affairs, and cited an interview in Asharq Al-Wasat, the London-based newspaper owned by a Saudi media group long associated with the Al Saud royal family. In the interview, bin Alawi warns war "could harm the entire world if it breaks out." He doesn't confirm any current Omani mediation but says both the U.S. and Iran realize the gravity of the situation. Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said spoke last week by telephone with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Oman, a nation on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long been an interlocutor of the West with Iran. The U.S. held secret talks in Oman with the Iranians that gave birth to the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Thursday any move by India to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir through constitutional amendments would be deemed as violation of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. “In principle, there cannot be any change on Jammu and Kashmir until plebiscite is held in accordance with the UNSC resolutions,” Foreign Office Spokesman Dr Muhammad Faisal said at a weekly press briefing here. He was responding to statements by top Indian politicians who said abrogating Article 370 of Indian Constitution, which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir, would pave the way for the valley’s freedom and resolution of the dispute. He categorically said India could not amend the status of Jammu and Kashmir against the wishes of the Kashmiri people. He strongly condemned the ongoing heinous human rights violations in Indian occupied Kashmir, including illegal detentions, killings, rapes and torture. He mentioned the recent killing of 14 Kashmiris by Indian security forces in Shopian, Pulwama, Sopore and Bhadarwa districts and pointed out that due to judicial impunity under the draconian laws, not a single culprit was sentenced. The spokesman expressed grave concern over the ongoing standoff between the US and Iran, saying Pakistan would support negotiations by any means. “Pakistan has a persistent stance and clear-stated position of supporting dialogue between the US and Iran, by adopting whatever mode suitable,” he said. Asked if Pakistan would mediate between the US and Iran, he said Pakistan had been offering its services many times in the past and would be ready to play its due role in future as well. Dr Faisal said Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi would visit Saudi Arabia on May 27 to participate in the meeting of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). To a question if the meeting between Qureshi and Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, would break the ice for resumption of dialogue between the two countries, he said foreign minister Qureshi would soon issue a statement in this regard. The spokesman dismissed reports about the Bangladesh government denying visas to Pakistanis, saying the press briefing by the Bangladeshi foreign minister on May 21 made it clear that Bangladesh had not stopped issuing visas to anyone. He said Pakistan wanted friendly relations with all countries, including Bangladesh, and was trying to address all pending matters on the basis of reciprocity. He confirmed that Cultural Attaché of Somalia Usman Abdullahi Hussain met an accident on May 17 at Nazimuddin-Marvi Road, hitting a Pakistani motorcyclist named Mushtaq Kiyani, resident of Bhara Kahu. He said police investigations found that the motorcyclist had violated red traffic light which resulted in the collision. He, however, added that on the same day the Somali ambassador was summoned to Foreign Office and conveyed that an appropriate action would be taken against the diplomat as per Vienna Convention and law of the land.

News article:
ISLAMABAD (AP) — Iran’s foreign minister was in Pakistan on Friday, a critically timed visit amid a simmering crisis between Tehran and Washington and ahead of next week’s emergency Arab League meeting called by Saudi Arabia over regional tensions. The purpose of the visit by Mohammad Javad Zarif, who held talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and also Prime Minister Imran Khan, was not made public. But there has been speculation that Iran is looking to Islamabad and its close relationship with Riyadh to help de-escalate the situation. Ahead of Zarif’s arrival, Pakistan’s foreign ministry called on “all sides to show restraint, as any miscalculated move, can transmute into a large-scale conflict.” Zarif has been criticized by name this week by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who named him and President Hassan Rouhani as failing to implement the leader’s orders over Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Khamenei had claimed the deal had “numerous ambiguities and structural weaknesses” that could damage Iran. Tensions have ratcheted up recently in the Mideast as the White House earlier this month sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region over a still-unexplained threat it perceived from Iran. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The crisis takes root in the steady unraveling of the nuclear deal, intended to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The accord promised economic incentives in exchange for restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear activities. The Trump administration pulled America out of the deal last year, and subsequently re-imposed and escalated US sanctions on Tehran — sending Iran’s economy into freefall. Khamenei’s criticism of Zarif signaled a hard-line tilt in how the Islamic Republic will react going forward amid President Donald Trump’s maximalist pressure campaign. Advertisement Iran declared earlier this month that the remaining signatories to the deal — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have two months to develop a plan to shield Iran from American sanctions. On Monday, Iran announced it had quadrupled its production capacity of low-enriched uranium, making it likely that Tehran will soon exceed the stockpile limitations set by the nuclear accord, which would escalate the situation further. Several incidents have added to the crisis. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia said Yemen’s Iran-aligned rebels again targeted an airport near its southern border with a bomb-carrying drone. The Saudi military said it intercepted the drone, while the rebel Houthis said it struck a Patriot missile battery at the airport. The Houthis have claimed three times in recent days to have targeted the airport, which also hosts a military base. It comes after the Houthis last week targeted a Saudi oil pipeline in a coordinated drone attack. Pakistan was quick to condemn the attacks and promised Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally, its full support. The kingdom this week announced a $3.2 billion deferred oil and gas payment package for energy-strapped Islamabad. With neighboring Iran, Pakistan walks a fine line and their relationship is sometimes prickly. Islamabad has little leverage with Washington, although relations between the two have improved since Pakistan expressed readiness to help move talks between the Afghan Taliban and Washington forward. Advertisement Meanwhile, Oman’s Foreign Ministry said it was working to “ease the tensions” between Iran and the US. The ministry in a series of tweets on Friday morning attributed the comments to Yusuf bin Alawi, the sultanate’s minister of state for foreign affairs, and cited an interview in Asharq Al-Wasat, the London-based newspaper owned by a Saudi media group long associated with the Al Saud royal family.

ISLAMABAD: As Indian Prime Minister-elect Narendra Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a decisive victory with two-thirds majority in the world’s largest elections, Pakistan has reiterated its readiness for talks with India in whatever manner it chooses. Reports are surfacing from New Delhi that now the BJP has enough strength to amend the Constitution with worries that Article 370 and 35(A) could be removed from the Indian constitution. Earlier, the Indian home minister had commented that removal of articles 370 and 35 (A) from the Indian constitution would resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. The Article 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir: It exempted the Indian-Held Kashmir from the complete applicability of the constitution of India. The IHK was allowed to have its own constitution. ... The Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the IHK constituent assembly. When the issue was raised at the weekly media briefing at the Foreign Office, the spokesman said, “Pakistan opposes any move which violates the United Nations Security Council Resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. In principle, there cannot be any change in the status of Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir until a UN administered plebiscite is held in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions”. He added that India should stop misleading the international community and accept the ground realities and aspirations of the people of IHK, instead of continuing with its policy of obduracy in the territory. “Pakistan has consistently maintained that the only way to resolve all outstanding issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is through implementation of UNSC resolutions. Dialogue is hence essential. We remain committed to the same, irrespective of whoever forms the new government in India,” he said. Several queries were raised about the informal meeting between Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj on the sidelines of the recent SCO meeting, but the spokesman shrugged it off saying that the minister himself would reply to this query. Regarding your second question, Pakistan always supports dialogue and desires that all issues should be settled peacefully and through engagement by all sides. If required, Pakistan is ready to play a constructive and positive role in this regard. On the issue of the visit of the Iranian foreign minister, the spokesman said that talks would be held today (Friday) with his Pakistani counterpart at the Foreign Office. Commenting on the continuing tensions between Iran and the United States, the spokesman responded, “We believe the situation in the region is serious and needs to be addressed through dialogue by all parties. We expect all sides to show restraint, as any miscalculated move can transmute into a large-scale conflict.” To a query on The Treaty on Transfer of Sentences Prisoners between Pakistan and China, the spokesman said Pakistan has completed its ratification process in early January, 2019 and conveyed it to Chinese side with request to complete its formalities. “Chinese side has informed that they are completing internal process for ratification. The matter has been taken up with Chinese government a highest level for early ratification of the treaty. Government of Pakistan will continue to raise this issue in future as well with Chinese side at all levels,” he said.

News article:
ISLAMABAD (AP) - Iran's foreign minister lashed out at President Donald Trump on Friday during a critically timed visit to Pakistan amid a simmering crisis between Tehran and Washington and ahead of next week's emergency Arab League meeting called by Saudi Arabia over the region's tensions. The remarks by Mohammad Javad Zarif were the latest in a war of words between him and Trump. The Iranian diplomat on Friday assailed the American president for his tweet earlier this week warning Iran not to threaten the U.S. again or it would face its "official end." "Iran will see the end of Trump, but he will never see the end of Iran," Zarif was quoted by Iran's semi-official Fars new agency as saying during a visit to Islamabad. Tensions have ratcheted up recently in the Mideast as the White House earlier this month sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region over a still-unexplained threat it perceived from Iran. And on Thursday, the Pentagon outlined proposals to the White House to send military reinforcements to the Middle East to beef up defenses against Iran. The purpose of Zarif's visit to Pakistan, where he held talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi and also Prime Minister Imran Khan, was not made public. But there has been speculation that Iran is looking to Islamabad and its close relationship with the Saudis to help de-escalate the situation. In a statement following meetings with Zarif, Khan said "Pakistan was prepared to use its friendly relations in the region to help lower tensions among brotherly countries and promote peace and stability in the region. ... War is not a solution to any problem." In this photo released by the Foreign Office, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, right, shakes hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad, Pakistan, Friday, May 24, 2019. Zarif is in Pakistan Friday on a critically timed visit amid a crisis between Tehran and Washington and ahead of next week's emergency Arab League meeting called by Saudi Arabia as regional tensions escalate.(Pakistan Foreign Office via AP) Zarif has been criticized this week by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who named him and President Hassan Rouhani as failing to implement the leader's orders over Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Khamenei had claimed the deal had "numerous ambiguities and structural weaknesses" that could damage Iran. Separately, the official Iranian news agency IRNA quoted Zarif in Islamabad as warning of anarchy if world powers don't unite to stop what he called U.S. aggression - Iran's official parlance for Washington's pressure on Tehran. The crisis takes root in the steady unraveling of the nuclear deal, intended to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The accord promised economic incentives in exchange for restrictions on Tehran's nuclear activities. The Trump administration pulled America out of the deal last year, and subsequently re-imposed and escalated U.S. sanctions on Tehran - sending Iran's economy into freefall. Khamenei's criticism of Zarif signaled a hard-line tilt in how the Islamic Republic will react going forward amid President Donald Trump's maximalist pressure campaign. Iran declared earlier this month that the remaining signatories to the deal - Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia - have two months to develop a plan to shield Iran from American sanctions. On Monday, Iran announced it had quadrupled its production capacity of low-enriched uranium, making it likely that Tehran will soon exceed the stockpile limitations set by the nuclear accord, which would escalate the situation further. Several incidents have added to the crisis. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia said Yemen's Iran-aligned rebels again targeted an airport near its southern border with a bomb-carrying drone. The Saudi military said it intercepted the drone, while the rebel Houthis said it struck a Patriot missile battery at the airport. The Houthis have claimed three times in recent days to have targeted the airport, which also hosts a military base. It comes after the Houthis last week targeted a Saudi oil pipeline in a coordinated drone attack. Pakistan was quick to condemn the attacks and promised Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally, its full support. The kingdom this week announced a $3.2 billion deferred oil and gas payment package for energy-strapped Islamabad. With neighboring Iran, Pakistan walks a fine line and their relationship is sometimes prickly. Islamabad has little leverage with Washington, although relations between the two have improved since Pakistan expressed readiness to help move talks between the Afghan Taliban and Washington forward. IRNA also reported that Zarif came to Pakistan with a proposal to link Iran's port of Chabahar on the Arabian Sea with Pakistan's Gwadar port, mostly being developed by China as part of the multi-billion-dollar One Road project that will connect the Arabian Sea with China. The proposal is unexpected because Pakistan's rival India has been Iran's partner in developing Chabahar while Iran's key regional rival, Saudi Arabia, has been in talks to develop an oil refinery facility at Pakistan's Gwadar, though no agreements have been signed. Meanwhile, Oman's Foreign Ministry said it was working to "ease the tensions" between Iran and the U.S. The ministry in a series of tweets on Friday morning attributed the comments to Yusuf bin Alawi, the sultanate's minister of state for foreign affairs, and cited an interview in Asharq Al-Wasat, the London-based newspaper owned by a Saudi media group long associated with the Al Saud royal family. In the interview, bin Alawi warns war "could harm the entire world if it breaks out." He doesn't confirm any current Omani mediation but says both the U.S. and Iran realize the gravity of the situation. Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said spoke last week by telephone with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Oman, a nation on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long been an interlocutor of the West with Iran.

ISLAMABAD (AP) - Iran's foreign minister lashed out at President Donald Trump on Friday during a critically timed visit to Pakistan amid a simmering crisis between Tehran and Washington and ahead of next week's emergency Arab League meeting called by Saudi Arabia over the region's tensions. The remarks by Mohammad Javad Zarif were the latest in a war of words between him and Trump. The Iranian diplomat on Friday assailed the American president for his tweet earlier this week warning Iran not to threaten the U.S. again or it would face its "official end." "Iran will see the end of Trump, but he will never see the end of Iran," Zarif was quoted by Iran's semi-official Fars new agency as saying during a visit to Islamabad. Tensions have ratcheted up recently in the Mideast as the White House earlier this month sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region over a still-unexplained threat it perceived from Iran. And on Thursday, the Pentagon outlined proposals to the White House to send military reinforcements to the Middle East to beef up defenses against Iran. The purpose of Zarif's visit to Pakistan, where he held talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi and also Prime Minister Imran Khan, was not made public. But there has been speculation that Iran is looking to Islamabad and its close relationship with the Saudis to help de-escalate the situation. In a statement following meetings with Zarif, Khan said "Pakistan was prepared to use its friendly relations in the region to help lower tensions among brotherly countries and promote peace and stability in the region. ... War is not a solution to any problem."

Prime Minister Imran Khan. PHOTO: REUTERS Prime Minister Imran Khan warned against the risk of conflict in the region, following a visit to Islamabad by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif as tensions between Washington and Tehran escalated. Strains have increased between Iran and the United States, which is a firm backer of Tehran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia, in the wake of this month’s attack on oil tankers in the Gulf region that Washington has blamed on Iran. Tehran has distanced itself from the bombings, but the United States has sent an aircraft carrier and an extra 1,500 troops to the Gulf, sparking concerns about the risks of conflict in a volatile region. PM Imran, who has been seeking to improve Pakistan’s strained relations with neighbour Iran, said he was concerned about the “rising tensions in the Gulf”, but did not specifically name the United States or Saudi Arabia. “He underscored that war was not a solution to any problem,” Imran's office said in a statement late on Friday, citing the premier. “Further escalation in tensions in the already volatile region was not in anyone’s interest. All sides needed to exercise maximum restraint in the current situation.” Washington has been seeking to increasingly tighten sanctions against Iran, as relations continue to worsen under President Donald Trump. At the end of the two-day visit to Pakistan, Zarif told Iranian state-run newswire IRNA that US allegations against Tehran were increasing tensions. “These actions are also a threat to global peace and stability,” he said. Earlier this month, four tankers, including two belonging to Saudi Arabia, were bombed near the United Arab Emirates’ Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs, located just outside the Strait of Hormuz. Washington has accused Iran’s Revolutionary Guards of carrying out the attacks, and the Trump administration has declared a national security-related emergency that would clear the sale of billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, bypassing congressional approval.

PM Imran, who has been seeking to improve Pakistan’s strained relations with neighbour Iran, said he was concerned about the “rising tensions in the Gulf”, but did not specifically name the United States or Saudi Arabia. “He underscored that war was not a solution to any problem,” Imran's office said in a statement late on Friday, citing the premier. “Further escalation in tensions in the already volatile region was not in anyone’s interest. All sides needed to exercise maximum restraint in the current situation.” Washington has been seeking to increasingly tighten sanctions against Iran, as relations continue to worsen under President Donald Trump. At the end of the two-day visit to Pakistan, Zarif told Iranian state-run newswire IRNA that US allegations against Tehran were increasing tensions. “These actions are also a threat to global peace and stability,” he said. Earlier this month, four tankers, including two belonging to Saudi Arabia, were bombed near the United Arab Emirates’ Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs, located just outside the Strait of Hormuz. Washington has accused Iran’s Revolutionary Guards of carrying out the attacks, and the Trump administration has declared a national security-related emergency that would clear the sale of billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, bypassing congressional approval.

News article:
Jeddah- Mohammed Al-Ayed Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has affirmed that the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) hosted by Saudi Arabia in attendance of Arab, Gulf, and Islamic leaders is an opportunity to address the tensed conditions in the region and avoid the breaking out of the war. Amid the tension arising from the Iranian interventions in the region, Qureshi said that the war won’t be in the best interest of anyone, and won’t serve the region or the global economy. In fact, it would weaken the investment and increase the threat of terrorist activities, he added. Despite all, Iran remains part of the region and can’t be removed and that’s why there should be a way to deal with it, Qureshi asserted. As for the ballistic missiles launched by Houthis - Iran’s arm in Yemen – towards Makkah, Qureshi told Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that any attack against the kingdom and the Two Holy Mosques is equivalent to an attack targeting Pakistan. Qureshi stressed that his country will be ready in case any danger threatens the Saudi territories, lauding the continuous Saudi support to Pakistan. Commenting on the attacks against energy sources and passages in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, the Pakistani FM stated that these energy sources don’t only contribute to economy and trade development on the level of Saudi Arabia but the world overall. Further, he considered that the Iranian intention to close the Strait of Hormuz would escalate regional crises -- Qureshi urged Iran to desist from escalation and to open up to diplomacy because extremist means would not be constructive. Qureshi noted that the visit of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, to Pakistan brought several achievements to both countries, adding that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have key roles in the Islamic world that could boost stability and security in the region.

News article:
JEDDAH: Pakistan’s Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Wednesday that his country is willing to play a role to help resolve some of the region’s “long-standing issues” between Muslim countries. Speaking exclusively to Arab News on the sidelines of the 14th Islamic Summit Conference in Makkah, Qureshi said: “Pakistan believes that this region is in flux. We have some very serious issues in the region. Our message is that we have to join hands; we have to understand each other’s concerns and have a collective objective of peace and stability so that our region can develop like other parts of the world. “The point is that it is a concerted effort,” he continued. “How are we going to achieve what we want to achieve if we do not sit and resolve our issues through diplomatic means? We should keep on joining hands, as that is the only way forward.” With around 5 million Pakistanis working in the Gulf, the region is of special interest to Islamabad, Qureshi pointed out. “We have excellent relations with all Gulf countries, historically and traditionally,” he said. “The Gulf is economically very important for Pakistan. The bulk of our energy requirements are being fulfilled from the Gulf. “So, for Pakistan, peace within the GCC states is always advocated. And the issues within the Gulf need to be resolved through dialogue. You can agree to disagree, but you can reconnect to resolve,” he added. Asked to comment on Iran’s role in the escalating tension in the Gulf, Qureshi said that any country isolating itself from the rest of the Muslim world “because of pursuing a particular policy” was going to suffer negative consequences. However, he added, “Iran is part of the region. It is a country that you have to live with. We share a border with them, so we recognize the challenges. But we have to see how those tensions can be defused and resolved.” Qureshi met with Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in Islamabad last Friday to discuss rising tensions between Iran and the US. “My message to him was: Restraint, calm, and resolution of issues through diplomatic channels,” he said. “Conflict will not pay. It will only aggravate the situation. People want to see peace and stability in the entire region and we all have to play a responsible role.” It is important, he said, for the Muslim world to improve its international image. “We have to eliminate terrorist elements, and we have to reverse extremism,” he said. “Why is the world looking at us in a particular way? And how can we get rid of that image to make the world look at us positively?” Forums such as the Islamic Summit Conference and Arab League meetings provide vital opportunities to answer such questions, he suggested. “These meeting are very important,” he said. “And they will provide ample opportunity for all of us to achieve our goals.” One particular goal on which Pakistan is currently focused is a resolution to “the Kashmir issue.” “The situation (on the Indian side of Kashmir) has changed dramatically,” Qureshi said. “Today the world recognizes that Kashmiris — Kashmiris who were engaging with the union in India — are now distant from the center because the reality on the ground has changed.” A number of reports, from the UN, the UK and the EU, he said, “are all pointing in one direction.” “People are being alienated, excessive use of force has taken place, human rights are being violated and people are being killed and maimed,” he explained. “Pellet guns are being used and horrific stories of killings and gang rapes have surfaced. The situation is explosive, and unless it is addressed, it could lead to new tensions within South Asia between two neighbors, and no one wants that; particularly the Gulf countries because any deterioration will affect the Gulf as well. “We want to live in peace with India, but the issue of Kashmir has to be addressed,” he continued. “It cannot be ignored or overlooked.”

News article:
DOHA, May 4 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways' return to flying over Syria as its eight-year war dies down is part of its efforts to grapple with a nearly two-year Gulf dispute that has blocked it from using the airspace of many of its neighbours, CEO Akbar al-Baker said on Saturday. Syrian transport minister Ali Hammoud said last month that his country had approved a request by Qatar Airways to begin using the country's airspace for routes, one of the first airlines to do so. Qatar did not comment at the time. Qatar's state-owned carrier has had to re-route many of its flights since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with the tiny Gulf state in 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies. The adjusted routes have increased the duration and cost of flights moving west and south of the Gulf, and in March the company reported an annual loss for the second consecutive year. "This is all about the blockade," Baker said of the decision, referring to the 2017 boycott. "We are blockaded, so we have to find ways to fulfil the requirements of my country. It's very simple". Baker said the restored routes, which analysts have said include flights to Doha from Beirut and Larnaca, do not pose safety issues. "You know Qatar Airways would not fly anywhere that is not safe. We have to protect our passengers and our crew," said Baker. (Reporting by Eric Knecht; Editing by Hugh Lawson) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

News article:
(MENAFN- Gulf Times) The Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has called on the authorities in Saudi Arabia to remove obstacles facing citizens and residents of Qatar who wish to visit the holy sites to perform Umrah during the holy month of Ramadan or Haj as its season approaches. In a statement issued on Thursday, the ministry also demanded that the Saudi authorities provide all facilities similar to those extended to other citizens of the GCC states and Arab and Islamic countries. The ministry noted that direct flights from Doha to Jeddah are still not allowed, and that Saudi Arabia continues to close the only land border crossing which is used by people from Qatar who cannot travel by air and want to visit Al-Masjid Al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Makkah Al-Mukarramah. The ministry pointed out that the Saudi authorities do not allow the Qatari Umrah and Haj campaigns to enter and obtain the necessary licences, which are available for Haj authorities of all other countries. This means that they cannot ensure the health and safety of pilgrims, which is a great challenge, especially in the case of women and the elderly persons and patients. The ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs pointed to systematic media incitement against Qataris and the dangers that may ensue. The continuation of inflammatory media discourse against Qatar and Qataris may pose a threat to their safety, it added. The ministry renewed its call on the Saudi authorities to review these discriminatory measures against Qatari citizens and residents, calling for a heightened sense of religious responsibility and non-politicisation of the religious rituals. The Haj is a religious pilgrimage for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in a lifetime by all who are physically and fi nancially capable of undertaking the journey. The event takes place once a year and culminates in the festival of Eid al-Adha, one of the two major Islamic holidays. Saudi Arabia, alongside the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, severed relations with Qatar in June 2017, and has placed the Gulf state under a land, sea, and air blockade.

News article:
(MENAFN- Gulf Times) The Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has called on the authorities in Saudi Arabia to remove obstacles facing citizens and residents of Qatar who wish to visit the holy sites to perform Umrah during the holy month of Ramadan or Haj as its season approaches. In a statement issued on Thursday, the ministry also demanded that the Saudi authorities provide all facilities similar to those extended to other citizens of the GCC states and Arab and Islamic countries. The ministry noted that direct flights from Doha to Jeddah are still not allowed, and that Saudi Arabia continues to close the only land border crossing which is used by people from Qatar who cannot travel by air and want to visit Al-Masjid Al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Makkah Al-Mukarramah. The ministry pointed out that the Saudi authorities do not allow the Qatari Umrah and Haj campaigns to enter and obtain the necessary licences, which are available for Haj authorities of all other countries. This means that they cannot ensure the health and safety of pilgrims, which is a great challenge, especially in the case of women and the elderly persons and patients. The ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs pointed to systematic media incitement against Qataris and the dangers that may ensue. The continuation of inflammatory media discourse against Qatar and Qataris may pose a threat to their safety, it added. The ministry renewed its call on the Saudi authorities to review these discriminatory measures against Qatari citizens and residents, calling for a heightened sense of religious responsibility and non-politicisation of the religious rituals. The Haj is a religious pilgrimage for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in a lifetime by all who are physically and fi nancially capable of undertaking the journey. The event takes place once a year and culminates in the festival of Eid al-Adha, one of the two major Islamic holidays. Saudi Arabia, alongside the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, severed relations with Qatar in June 2017, and has placed the Gulf state under a land, sea, and air blockade.

News article:
JEDDAH: As international pressure on Iran increases, its ally, Qatar, finds itself in a precarious situation. Should the situation escalate and Washington decides to take military action, there is a real risk that Doha could share sensitive US military intelligence with Tehran, experts warn. Doha has a history of running with the hare while hunting with the hound. Since 2017, however, when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain — the anti-terror quartet (ATQ) — imposed a boycott on the country over its support of terrorist organizations, Qatar has shown its true colors and its previously secret alignment with Turkey and Iran has been exposed. Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani, who was Qatar’s prime minister from April 2007 until June 2013 and foreign minister from January 1992 to June 2013, recently suggested, in a message posted on Twitter, that his country does not support the escalation of action against Iran. On Wednesday night, state-funded Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera cited an anonymous official as saying that Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani recently traveled to Tehran to meet his Iranian counterpart, Mohammed Javad Zarif. Flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com reportedly tracked a Qatari government plane that landed in Tehran at 7 p.m. on Saturday and set off on the return flight to Doha at 10:30 p.m. the same day. Other media outlets suggested that the Doha official who visited Iran was in fact Sheikh Tamim, Qatar’s ruler. Hamdan Al-Shehri, a Riyadh-based international-affairs scholar, said that if America decides to take military action against Iran, there is a risk that Qatar will repeat the “treason” it is believed to have committed while participating in Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen in 2015, during which unconfirmed leaks suggested that Qatari troops shared military intelligence with the Iran-backed Houthi militias. “There is a possibility that the US will attack Iran, in which case the B-52s and US bombers will fly out from Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar,” said Al-Shehri. “How will Qatar then defend its position as an ally of Iran? They are caught out now, and this happened because of the boycott of Qatar by the quartet of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. The boycott forced Qatar to shed its duplicity.” Al-Udeid is the forward headquarters of the US Central Command. Several of the B-52 bombers ordered by the White House to the region during the latest escalation between Washington and Tehran are stationed there. “The Qataris are a strange case,” Al-Shehri said. “They chose to side with the enemies of Gulf countries. The Iranian militias undermine the stability of the entire region. Iran is the biggest threat to this region, and Qatar stood with Iran against their (Gulf) brothers. “Now, because of Iran’s actions, the safety and security of the region is at risk — the same region of which Qatar is a part. The question is, will they stick to being a trusted US ally? Or will they end up sharing US military intelligence with the Iranians?” Salman Al-Ansari, the founder of the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee (SAPRAC), said: “The Qatari regime was, and still is, in complete denial of their poisonous behavior. Qatar was playing the dirty game of pretending to be a friend of its Arab neighbors while strengthening its relations with Iran and its militias. That all has been unmasked after the ATQ boycott. “Qatar seemed to enjoy stabbing the GCC and its Arab neighbors in the back. The Qatari regime is obviously on the very wrong side of history. Qatar should know one thing: That the world after the Riyadh summit (a series of summits in May 2017 during US President Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia) is never going to be like the world was before. The financial and ideological support of terrorism will not be taken lightly by the region and the world.” Al-Ansari added that with a US presidential election looming in November next year, Doha might be thinking that it only has to bide its time until the Trump administration is possibly replaced. “Qatar might still be holding onto the hope that the US will have a Democratic president soon, who will be lenient about its support of Iran and terror organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood,” he said. “The thing they don’t understand is that the train of combating the evil of terrorism is unstoppable.”

Kuwait - Merza al-Khuwaldi The region has entered a "very critical and dangerous" stage, said Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah during his visit to the headquarters of the Foreign Ministry. The parliament has announced its support to the Emir for adopting a balanced diplomatic role during the current Gulf crisis, amid an unprecedented escalation between the US and Iran. “We are living through a very critical and dangerous stage,” Sheikh Sabah said, hoping that “calm will be restored and wisdom will prevail.” “The current circumstances have doubled your responsibilities and diplomatic endeavors to achieve the higher interest of your country,” the Emir said, addressing diplomats. He also spoke of Kuwait’s diplomatic history, saying it has been almost 18 months for Kuwait's non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council, through which it succeeded in playing a balanced role in a host of issues. “Kuwait's diplomacy succeeded in representing the Arab and Islamic group, and defending Arab and Islamic causes,” he was quoted as saying by Kuwait News Agency (KUNA). The Emir was accompanied by the Crown Prince, Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, in his visit to the Foreign Ministry headquarters where they were received by the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Hamad al-Sabah, Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Sulaiman al-Jarallah and senior officials. The meeting was attended by Speaker of the National Assembly Marzouq Ali al-Ghanim, Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber al-Mubarak al-Sabah, Sheikhs and senior officials. Meanwhile, members of the National Assembly supported Tuesday all measures ordered by the Emir and the government to safeguard national security, following the US escalation against Iran. Last week, Ghanim warned of an expected war in the Gulf region following a secret meeting called by the Kuwaiti parliament to discuss with the government the current regional challenges. “Based on the presentations made by the government, regrettably the chances of a regional war breaking out are very high,” Ghanim told reporters. In their statement, Assembly members asserted the need for the government to move forward in completing the roles of ministries and government agencies concerned with civil defense and emergency. They stressed the significance of official mass media in covering all security and political developments in a clear-cut and transparent manner in light of the surrounding political and security developments. They also discussed preparedness of state agencies for state of emergency and crises and the importance of involving citizens, residents and civil society institutions in successful emergency plans. Citizens and residents, together with civil society organizations, should have some role in ensuring a successful emergency plan, according to the statement. The MPs called on citizens to adhere to the Emir’s directives who repeatedly warned of the gravity of the developments.

News article:
Riyadh - Fatehelrahman Yousif President of Djibouti Ismail Omar Guelleh hailed Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the Gulf, Arab and Islamic summits, saying it stems from its sense of duty towards the region. He told Asharq Al-Awsat: “The summits will bolster security and stability given the critical situation in the region.” He hoped that the Islamic summit would yield decisions that would help resolve crises and maintain unity and solidarity between Islamic states. “Saudi Arabia is the leader of the Arab world and Muslims. Any assault against it targets the Arab and Muslim nations,” he declared. The summits, he continued, are being held at time of instability in Yemen, Syria, Libya, Iraq, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia. He also noted Israeli violations in the Palestinian territories and the growing extremist and terrorist threats in the world. These challenges demand massive efforts, especially in wake of last week’s sabotage operation off the coast of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, Guelleh said. “We condemn in the strongest terms the sabotage operation off Fujairah,” he added. Commenting on the security threats in the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea and Ban al-Mandeb Strait, he strongly condemned any threat to international marine navigation and international peace and security. Asked about the Iranian threat in the region and the targeting of Saudi Arabia with drones, he replied: “Saudi Arabia is the leader of Arabs and Muslims… We reiterate our condemnation of the recent drone attack against oil pumping stations in the Kingdom, as well as the failed ballistic missile attack that targeted the holy city of Makkah.” These assaults are dangerous threats to the security of the region and energy supplies, he added. “We renew our absolute solidarity with Saudi Arabia’s government and people in confronting them.” Guelleh also urged international solidarity to confront these criminal acts. On ties between Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, he said that they date back to Djibouti’s independence in 1977. Riyadh played a major role in ensuring this independence. “The fraternal historic ties between us are based on trust, understanding and high coordination on all levels,” he noted. “This consequently lead to common ground on several regional and international issues.” Moreover, he said that ties between Saudi Arabia and Djibouti witnessed a “qualitative leap” in wake of his latest visit to the Kingdom. “Relations between us are growing stronger every day,” Guelleh remarked. “I am in constant contact with Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Prime Minister and Ministers of Defense.” On developments in Sudan, he stated: “Throughout history, we have expressed solidarity with Khartoum and continue to do so based on the strength of relations that bind us.” He highlighted that Djibouti has played an honorable role in sponsoring peace deals and reconciliations in the Horn of Africa. He cited its efforts in bringing together Sudanese rivals in 1999, which culminated in easing tensions that existed at the time. Guelleh said that Djibouti was closely following the ongoing developments in Sudan and is completely prepared to exert all possible efforts to ensure its stability and interests. On relations with Eritrea after the Saudi-led reconciliation, he remarked that the deal helped restore ties with its neighbor and rebuild trust between them. He hoped that the reconciliation would be crowned with the demarcation of the border between them.

Riyadh played a major role in ensuring this independence. “The fraternal historic ties between us are based on trust, understanding and high coordination on all levels,” he noted. “This consequently lead to common ground on several regional and international issues.” Moreover, he said that ties between Saudi Arabia and Djibouti witnessed a “qualitative leap” in wake of his latest visit to the Kingdom. “Relations between us are growing stronger every day,” Guelleh remarked. “I am in constant contact with Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Prime Minister and Ministers of Defense.” On developments in Sudan, he stated: “Throughout history, we have expressed solidarity with Khartoum and continue to do so based on the strength of relations that bind us.” He highlighted that Djibouti has played an honorable role in sponsoring peace deals and reconciliations in the Horn of Africa. He cited its efforts in bringing together Sudanese rivals in 1999, which culminated in easing tensions that existed at the time. Guelleh said that Djibouti was closely following the ongoing developments in Sudan and is completely prepared to exert all possible efforts to ensure its stability and interests. On relations with Eritrea after the Saudi-led reconciliation, he remarked that the deal helped restore ties with its neighbor and rebuild trust between them. He hoped that the reconciliation would be crowned with the demarcation of the border between them.

News article:
DUBAI: Qatari media has been upping the ante with articles and opinion pieces shedding negative light on the US-lead “Peace to Prosperity” economic workshop in Bahrain, which led to Palestinian officials to have a negative view of the summit and urge other Arab states of boycotting it. “We call on the countries that have agreed to attend the Bahrain workshop to reevaluate their decision,” the secretary of the PLO’s executive committee, Saeb Erekat, told Arab News in an interview yesterday. Experts predict that comments come as a result of Iranian and Qatari media propagating a negative view of the workshop, which is being falsely portrayed as an effort to force Palestinians to sell-away their right to a state. “‘A two-day international Peace to Prosperity economic workshop in Bahrain undermines #Palestinians and their calls for sovereignty’” read a tweet from Qatar-owned English version of The New Arab, a newspaper based in London. ‘A two-day international Peace to Prosperity economic workshop in #Bahrain undermines #Palestinians and their calls for sovereignty‘ https://t.co/ihGC4fkckh — The New Arab (@The_NewArab) May 26, 2019 Another tweet by the same news website read: “In-depth: ‘Palestinian political and religious leaders have slammed Jared Kushner’s so-called Deal of the Century Israel-Palestine peace plan, due to be revealed in part in a controversial Bahrain summit‘” In-depth - “Palestinian political and religious leaders have slammed Jared Kushner's so-called Deal of the Century #Israel-Palestine peace plan, due to be revealed in part in a controversial #Bahrain summit“ https://t.co/KsH83LFLBP — The New Arab (@The_NewArab) May 26, 2019 While a Twitter poll from senior Al Jazeera New channel anchor Jamal Rayyan asked “Do you support Saudi Arabia, UAE and Israel’s organization of an economic conference in Bahrain to finance the deal of the century and the liquidation of the Palestinian cause?” The results showed 71 percent against while 29 percent for.

No reports of Qatar confirming or denying the Haaretz article were found by Arab News. Dubbed “Peace for Prosperity,” the conference is expected to bring together leaders from several governments, civil society and the business sector. Trump’s office said the conference was a “pivotal opportunity... to share ideas, discuss strategies, and galvanize support for potential economic investments and initiatives that could be made possible by a peace agreement.” The Palestinians see this as offering financial rewards in exchange for accepting ongoing Israeli occupation. “Attempts at promoting an economic normalization of the Israeli occupation of Palestine will be rejected,” Erekat said.

(Adds details) CAIRO, May 26 (Reuters) - Qatar has been invited by Saudi Arabia to attend two emergency Arab summits being convened in the Saudi city of Mecca on May 30, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Sunday, after previously saying it had not been. Last week Qatar said it had not been invited to the two summits Saudi is planning in Islam's holiest site to discuss the implications of drone strikes on oil installations in the kingdom and attacks on four vessels, including two Saudi oil tankers, off the UAE coast earlier this month. Saudi, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed an economic and diplomatic boycott on Qatar since June 2017 over allegations that Doha supports terrorism and is cosying up to regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the charges. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani received an invitation from Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to attend the summit of Gulf Arab rulers and a wider meeting of Arab leaders, the Qatari Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The invitation and a letter was passed to Qatar by the head of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the statement said, without saying whether Qatar would accept it. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of ordering the drone strikes, for which Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis claimed responsibility. The kingdom said that while it did not want war in the region, it was ready to respond strongly. The UAE has not blamed anyone for the sabotage of the tankers pending an investigation, and said it was committed to de-escalation. Iran has denied it carried out either attack. The UAE has said that the current "critical circumstances" in the region required a "unified Arab and Gulf stance".

DOHA: Qatar said on Sunday that it had received an invitation from Saudi Arabia to attend emergency regional talks to discuss mounting tensions between Iran and the United States. Riyadh had called two gatherings – one for Arab League members, the other for Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) regional bloc nations – after a spate of attacks. Several tankers in Gulf waters were targeted under mysterious circumstances and a Saudi crude pipeline was hit by drone strikes coordinated by Yemen rebels who Riyadh said were acting on Iranian orders. King Salman had invited Gulf leaders and Arab League members to summits in Makkah on May 30 but it was not stated if Qatar was also invited to the Arab bloc deliberations. It was unclear if Qatar – subject to a Saudi-led economic and diplomatic boycott over alleged support for Iran and religious fundamentalist movements – would be invited at all, with Doha initially reporting it had not received an invite. Qatar's emir "has received a written message" inviting the government to join the crisis talks, the government's information office said in a statement. The invitation was received by Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani during a meeting with the secretary general of the GCC, it added. Al-Thani has previously called for a "dialogue" between Iran and the United States to resolve the crisis between their countries.

Qatar’s prime minister will travel to Saudi Arabia for two summits in the kingdom, authorities announced Wednesday. This would mark the highest-level contact between the neighboring nations since a Saudi-led boycott of Doha began in 2017. It remains unclear what such a trip could mean for the ongoing boycott, part of a political dispute between Qatar and four Arab nations — Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Qatari emir's plan lands in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Credit: Qatar Today/Twitter Also on Wednesday, Arab media reported that a Qatari royal flight landed at Jeddah airport in Saudi Arabia, for the first time since the Gulf crisis began two years ago. Qatar Today tweeted that the plane "is landing at Jeddah airport for the first time since the outbreak of the Gulf crisis and the siege of Qatar." >> Read more: Despite Saudi blockade, Qatar plans to attend Trump peace conference in Bahrain The reported visit that took place on Wednesday, the first since 2017, comes days after Qatar's Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani received an invitation from Saudi Arabia's King Salman to attemd two summits in Mecca, according to a statement by Qatar's Foreign Ministry. It confirmed on Sunday it has been invited by Saudi Arabia to attend the emergency summits, after previously saying it had not been. The four nations say the Gulf Crisis stems from Qatar's support for extremist groups in the region, charges denied by Doha. They have also pointed to Qatar's close relationship with Iran, with which it shares a massive offshore gas field that provides the peninsular nation its wealth. Qatar restored full diplomatic ties to Iran amid the dispute.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed an economic and diplomatic boycott on Qatar since June 2017 over allegations that Doha supports terrorism and is cosying up to regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the charges. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of ordering the drone strikes, for which Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis claimed responsibility. The kingdom said that while it did not want war in the region, it was ready to respond strongly. The UAE has not blamed anyone for the sabotage of the tankers pending an investigation, and said it was committed to de-escalation. Iran has denied it carried out either attack. The UAE has said that the current "critical circumstances" in the region required a "unified Arab and Gulf stance."

News article:
The World Trade Organisation on Wednesday announced that it would investigate the complaint filed by the UAE against a ban imposed by Qatar on Emirati products. The global body has created an arbitration committee to oversee and probe the UAE complaint. Doha's ban arose after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties with the small Gulf state because of its support for extremist outfits. "The UAE believes that the Qatari measures violated the WTO’s basic principles of market access and its rules against discrimination. The Qatari measures aimed to target the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, which opposed Qatar’s patronage for terrorism and extremism, dissemination of hate speech, and interference in the internal affairs of other countries," Emirati news agency Wam reported. It continued to say that Qatar is "indulging in gross duplicity in its efforts to use international bodies for its own ulterior motives" and called on it to "desist from supporting and funding extremism and terrorism". Last month, Qatar partially withdrew measures imposed against the UAE and its products in an announcement at the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. The Qatari climbdown recognises that Doha's policies violated its international obligations. Abdullah Hamdan Al Naqbi, director of the International Law Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, said after Qatar's move that it was ''a clear concession" before the UAE request was heard. ''We continue to seek Qatar’s full withdrawal of these measures so as to ensure Doha's commitment to its WTO obligations and ensure our exports of goods has free access to Qatar markets,'' he said.

News article:
In the face of mounting tensions between the US and Iran, with repercussions across the region, Saudi Arabia is hosting two emergency summits in Makkah on Thursday, one with Arab League leaders and the other with members of the Gulf Co-operation Council. A third meeting with members of the Organisation for Islamic Co-operation will follow on Friday. Top of the agenda will be Iran's destabilising behaviour, which threatens the whole region, from its ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon to its support of Houthi rebels in Yemen. Leaders will be discussing Tehran's latest bout of aggression, launched under the weight of punitive US sanctions and in retaliation for the US pullout from the nuclear deal. Houthi rebels attacked a Saudi pipeline and Iran-backed militias launched a rocket at Baghdad's Green Zone earlier this month. The sabotage of four tankers off the coast of Fujairah in the UAE – which US national security adviser John Bolton today blamed on Iranian naval mines – will also be among the chief concerns of the summits. These meetings are an opportunity for the Arab world to stand united in the face of aggression. The nations convening in Makkah have strong historic and cultural bonds, even if they do not always concur on how to deal with threats. Iraq is expected to attend, despite its close ties with Iran. Qatar has been invited to the talks, even though the two-year boycott by the Arab quartet continues. Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s presence in the Lebanese government has prevented its leaders from taking a stand against Iran. The fragile stability of these two countries relies on maintaining good relations with both Washington and Tehran. But at a time when Iran is threatening to destabilise the whole region, a firm stance is needed to prevent further incursions. This is a time for Arab leaders to set aside their differences and express solidarity as those most affected by American-Iranian tensions. But Arab countries must also be able to count on their western allies to provide support. In this regard, Mr Bolton’s current visit to Abu Dhabi sends a strong message. He reaffirmed that the US, the UAE and Saudi Arabia were “on the same page” about the threat of Iranian weapons and made a point of visiting the UAE capital to discuss the next steps. Diplomatic talks are essential to de-escalate the situation and Mr Trump has repeatedly said he would be ready to sit down at the negotiating table with Tehran – an offer that Iran has shown no interest in reciprocating. The meetings in Makkah should not be treated as a mere photo opportunity. They can and should be used to reaffirm strong ties, decide a course of action and play a pivotal role in de-escalating a dangerous situation.

News article:
Qatar has been blockaded by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt since June 2017. The counties cut diplomatic and economic ties with Doha and accused it of supporting Iran and terrorism. Qatar denied these allegations, but is still isolated from its neighbours. Although this week, for the fist time since the blockade, Qatari diplomats travelled to Saudi Arabia to attend the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to discuss the situation around Iran. Meanwhile, Iran's deputy foreign minister has said that while the country is ready for war with the US, it still hopes to solve the crisis through dialogue. READ MORE: ‘Exclusive Intel' Claims Iran Cuts Funding to Allies Amid Economic War — Report The political analyst noted that Iran is the dominant force in the Persian Gulf in terms of its geographical and strategic position and the fact that it has advised all countries in the region to refuse to meet the demands of the United States only proves that it is seeking ways to diffuse tensions: "If so far no action has been taken by Iran, it only means that Iran does not want to exacerbate the situation. One should remember that countries in the region that would start a war would not be able to end it, because the scale of the war will increase as the number of its participants increases. Therefore, Qataris will never take such a risk and compromise the security of their country.

News article:
JEDDAH: With the theme “Hand in Hand toward the Future,” and an agenda packed with issues affecting the Muslim world, the 14th ordinary summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) convenes in the Saudi holy city of Makkah on Friday. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman will chair the Islamic Summit, a gathering of monarchs, heads of state and government that dates back 50 years, and nowadays convenes every three years to deliberate, make decisions and try to resolve crises in Muslim-majority countries. This year, the summit coincides with two emergency meetings — the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summits — called by King Salman amid escalating tensions between Iran on one side and the US and its Gulf allies on the other. The summit in Makkah is expected to address a long list of pressing political problems, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rising anti-Muslim prejudice in different parts of the world, and violent extremism. Coinciding with the final days of Ramadan, the summit is expected to deal with the consequences of the US decision last year to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; the suffering of Syrian civilians due to an ongoing military assault in Idlib province; and the destabilizing activities of Iran and its proxy forces in the Middle East. Amid rising tensions between the US and Iran, attacks on four commercial vessels near the UAE’s Fujairah port earlier this month have raised serious questions about maritime security in the Gulf. Senior US officials have pointed the finger at Tehran. The incidents, which included attacks on two Saudi oil tankers, drew strong condemnation from governments in the Middle East and worldwide, as well as the Arab League. The acts of sabotage were followed by strikes by explosives-laden drones on Saudi oil installations, which led to a temporary closure of the East-West pipeline. A TV station run by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militia said it had launched drone attacks on Saudi installations. The incidents were described by the OIC as a threat to the security and safety of international maritime traffic. On Wednesday, addressing the preparatory meeting of OIC foreign ministers in Jeddah, Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim Al-Assaf said: “Tehran’s support for Houthi rebels in Yemen is proof of Iranian interference in other nations’ affairs, and this is something that ... Islamic countries should reject.” Al-Assaf, who chaired the meeting, said the Kingdom condemned the attacks aimed at threatening the supply of oil, and called for a UN-backed political solution in Syria. He added: “I would like to emphasize that the Palestinian issue is a paramount Saudi concern, in particular the Palestinian people’s full legitimate rights, and the establishment of an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.” Speaking at the preparatory meeting, OIC Secretary-General Yousef Al-Othaimeen expressed his gratitude to King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the summit. Al-Othaimeen also praised the Kingdom’s support for the OIC, and its generous contributions for Islamic causes. In a significant development in the lead up to the Islamic Summit, an anti-extremism document was signed by 1,200 figures from the Muslim world during a gathering in Makkah. The four-day event, organized by the Muslim World League (MWL), was attended by dignitaries, scholars, senior officials and leading thinkers, who between them represented 139 countries and 27 Islamic sects. Members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group march in December 2017 to protest the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. (AP) King Salman was the first leader to sign the declaration, and later received the scholars in Makkah, where he was handed the final document. It says religious and cultural diversity does not justify conflict, and civilized dialogue is the path to overcoming historical differences. The declaration condemns attacks on places of worship, calling them criminal acts that require a strong legislative and security response. It says the extremist ideas that motivate such attacks need to be challenged. The document urges non-interference in the affairs of other states, and singles out for criticism dissemination of sectarian ideas. It recognizes the importance of women’s empowerment, rejects their marginalization, and opposes the denial of opportunities for them in various fields. The document says it is everyone’s duty to fight terrorism, injustice, oppression and human rights violations. It also urges greater environmental protection, saying wasting natural resources and causing pollution infringe on the rights of future generations. Salem Al-Yami, an international-relations analyst, said the three conferences in Makkah were taking place at a sensitive and critical moment for the Middle East. “The summits are a chance to enlighten some Muslim brothers and Arabs as to the true nature of the current conflicts since they may not be fully aware of the reality,” Al-Yami told Sky News Arabia. Once they have the full facts at their disposal, the leaders attending the conferences will become aware of their individual responsibilities, be they from Arab, GCC or Muslim countries, Al-Yami said. He said it is evident from the recent sabotage incidents near UAE’s Fujairah port, the attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil stations, and the rocket strikes on the Green Zone in Baghdad that Iran is trying to stir tensions across the Middle East. Al-Yami said there is no denying that relations between some of the summit attendees are less than cordial. “Some governments do not have a clear position on the regional situation,” he said. “Still, the objective of the summits is to clarify the picture and devise ways to confront the challenges.” According to Al-Yami, the international community has a duty to stand by the countries that Iran is trying to drag into its conflict with the US in view of the vital role they play in global economic stability. “The (oil) wealth serves not just our own interest. We have partners who benefit from this wealth. So they should also take a firm position on the matters at issue,” Al-Yami said. The OIC is the second-largest inter-governmental institution after the UN, with 57 member states from four continents. It is the voice of 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide. Between 1969 and 2016 there were 13 Islamic summits, with seven held for emergencies in the capitals of Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey. In 1970, the first Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers was held in Jeddah, culminating in the decision to establish a permanent secretariat in the Saudi city.

It recognizes the importance of women’s empowerment, rejects their marginalization, and opposes the denial of opportunities for them in various fields. The document says it is everyone’s duty to fight terrorism, injustice, oppression and human rights violations. It also urges greater environmental protection, saying wasting natural resources and causing pollution infringe on the rights of future generations. Salem Al-Yami, an international-relations analyst, said the three conferences in Makkah were taking place at a sensitive and critical moment for the Middle East. “The summits are a chance to enlighten some Muslim brothers and Arabs as to the true nature of the current conflicts since they may not be fully aware of the reality,” Al-Yami told Sky News Arabia. Once they have the full facts at their disposal, the leaders attending the conferences will become aware of their individual responsibilities, be they from Arab, GCC or Muslim countries, Al-Yami said. He said it is evident from the recent sabotage incidents near UAE’s Fujairah port, the attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil stations, and the rocket strikes on the Green Zone in Baghdad that Iran is trying to stir tensions across the Middle East. Al-Yami said there is no denying that relations between some of the summit attendees are less than cordial. “Some governments do not have a clear position on the regional situation,” he said. “Still, the objective of the summits is to clarify the picture and devise ways to confront the challenges.” According to Al-Yami, the international community has a duty to stand by the countries that Iran is trying to drag into its conflict with the US in view of the vital role they play in global economic stability. “The (oil) wealth serves not just our own interest. We have partners who benefit from this wealth. So they should also take a firm position on the matters at issue,” Al-Yami said. The OIC is the second-largest inter-governmental institution after the UN, with 57 member states from four continents. It is the voice of 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide. Between 1969 and 2016 there were 13 Islamic summits, with seven held for emergencies in the capitals of Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey. In 1970, the first Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers was held in Jeddah, culminating in the decision to establish a permanent secretariat in the Saudi city.

JEDDAH: With the theme “Hand in Hand toward the Future,” and an agenda packed with issues affecting the Muslim world, the 14th ordinary summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) convenes in the Saudi holy city of Makkah on Friday. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman will chair the Islamic Summit, a gathering of monarchs, heads of state and government that dates back 50 years, and nowadays convenes every three years to deliberate, make decisions and try to resolve crises in Muslim-majority countries. This year, the summit coincides with two emergency meetings — the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summits — called by King Salman amid escalating tensions between Iran on one side and the US and its Gulf allies on the other. The summit in Makkah is expected to address a long list of pressing political problems, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rising anti-Muslim prejudice in different parts of the world, and violent extremism. Coinciding with the final days of Ramadan, the summit is expected to deal with the consequences of the US decision last year to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; the suffering of Syrian civilians due to an ongoing military assault in Idlib province; and the destabilizing activities of Iran and its proxy forces in the Middle East. Amid rising tensions between the US and Iran, attacks on four commercial vessels near the UAE’s Fujairah port earlier this month have raised serious questions about maritime security in the Gulf. Senior US officials have pointed the finger at Tehran. The incidents, which included attacks on two Saudi oil tankers, drew strong condemnation from governments in the Middle East and worldwide, as well as the Arab League. The acts of sabotage were followed by strikes by explosives-laden drones on Saudi oil installations, which led to a temporary closure of the East-West pipeline. A TV station run by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militia said it had launched drone attacks on Saudi installations. The incidents were described by the OIC as a threat to the security and safety of international maritime traffic. On Wednesday, addressing the preparatory meeting of OIC foreign ministers in Jeddah, Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim Al-Assaf said: “Tehran’s support for Houthi rebels in Yemen is proof of Iranian interference in other nations’ affairs, and this is something that ... Islamic countries should reject.” Al-Assaf, who chaired the meeting, said the Kingdom condemned the attacks aimed at threatening the supply of oil, and called for a UN-backed political solution in Syria. He added: “I would like to emphasize that the Palestinian issue is a paramount Saudi concern, in particular the Palestinian people’s full legitimate rights, and the establishment of an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.” Speaking at the preparatory meeting, OIC Secretary-General Yousef Al-Othaimeen expressed his gratitude to King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the summit. Al-Othaimeen also praised the Kingdom’s support for the OIC, and its generous contributions for Islamic causes. In a significant development in the lead up to the Islamic Summit, an anti-extremism document was signed by 1,200 figures from the Muslim world during a gathering in Makkah. The four-day event, organized by the Muslim World League (MWL), was attended by dignitaries, scholars, senior officials and leading thinkers, who between them represented 139 countries and 27 Islamic sects. Members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group march in December 2017 to protest the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. (AP) King Salman was the first leader to sign the declaration, and later received the scholars in Makkah, where he was handed the final document. It says religious and cultural diversity does not justify conflict, and civilized dialogue is the path to overcoming historical differences. The declaration condemns attacks on places of worship, calling them criminal acts that require a strong legislative and security response. It says the extremist ideas that motivate such attacks need to be challenged. The document urges non-interference in the affairs of other states, and singles out for criticism dissemination of sectarian ideas. It recognizes the importance of women’s empowerment, rejects their marginalization, and opposes the denial of opportunities for them in various fields. The document says it is everyone’s duty to fight terrorism, injustice, oppression and human rights violations. It also urges greater environmental protection, saying wasting natural resources and causing pollution infringe on the rights of future generations.

News article:
(MENAFN- Khaleej Times) Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Ibrahim bin Abdulaziz Al-Assaf has affirmed the success of Gulf and Arab summits in garnering support for Saudi and UAE position against the actions carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, the Saudi Press Agency, SPA, has reported. Speaking at a joint press conference along with Secretary-General of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit, and the Secretary-General of the GCC Abdullatif bin Rashid al-Zayani, following the conclusion of Gulf and Arab summits in Makkah, Dr. Al-Assaf said that the Iranian-backed Houthi militia were behind the attacks on two oil pumping stations in the Kingdom by using armed drones, and also sabotaged commercial vessels near the UAE's territorial waters. Saudi Foreign Minister said that the GCC countries have expressed their desire for peace and cooperation with Iran, but "Iran must stop supporting terrorist acts in our countries and be a cooperative neighbour". He added that the focus of these meetings was on the terrorist attacks on vessels near the UAE's territorial waters and the drone attacks on two pumping stations in Afif and Dawadmi governorates in Saudi Arabia, but "everyone knows that Iranian-backed terrorist Houthi militia has so far carried out 225 missiles and 155 drones attacks against the Kingdom". These attacks were carried out in the past, the Minister added, noting that this time they appear to be aiming at a huge escalation in light of the current situation in the Gulf region as well as relations between Iran and the United States. "In our view, these attacks have gone beyond the goals of the previous attacks," Dr. Al-Assaf stated. Answering a question about Qatar's participation in the two summits at the level of the prime minister, and if it is a beginning to solve the Gulf crisis, Dr. Al-Assaf explained that Qatar had participated in previous summits. He affirmed that Arab quartet's position is to find a solution to the causes of the crisis between these countries and Qatar, and there will be a solution "if Qatar returns to the right path". The Foreign Minister stressed that the concern from Iran is not only about its support for the Houthi militia and other terrorist groups, including the terrorist Hezbollah in Lebanon, but also their interference in the internal affairs of other countries such as Bahrain. The biggest concern, he added, is Iran's development of ballistic missiles and nuclear capabilities, pointing to the fact that this poses a direct threat to the Gulf states. He said that Iran's transgressions and support for the groups have exceeded Arab and neighbouring countries to Latin America and America "when they tried to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington". Minister Dr. Al-Assaf stressed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's approach is clear, as it has repeatedly called for constructive and peaceful relations with Iran.

News article:
Beirut: June 5 marks the second anniversary of the diplomatic crisis between the Arab Quartet and Qatar. Relations were suspended on June 5, 2017 over Qatar’s continued support for internationally-sanctioned non-state players like Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and its alliance with both Iran and Turkey. Qatar’s behaviour could no longer be tolerated, said the leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt two years ago, claiming that in addition to upsetting security in the Gulf, Qatar was also promoting religious fanaticism and intolerance through terrorist groups like the Brotherhood and the editorial policy of the Doha-based Al Jazeera TV. Qatari stubbornness Two years down the road, however, nothing has changed. The offices of Hamas in Doha remain wide open and its leaders still have unlimited access to the studios of Al Jazeera. The Muslim Brotherhood is still a guest of the Emir of Qatar, Tamim Bin Hamad, and so is its aging spiritual godfather, Yousuf Al Qaradawi. The editorial policy of Al Jazeera has not softened—let alone changed—and Qatari officialdom remains firmly allied to Tehran and Ankara. In September 2017, Shaikh Tamim made himself clear at the General Assembly of the United Nations, saying that his country was going to remain “a save haven for the oppressed (in reference to Hamas and the Brotherhood). That month, Qatari money was used to remove Al Qaradawi from the Interpol’s list of “wanted” criminals, accused of “theft” and “terrorism” by the Egyptian Government. That same month, Sheikh Tamim opened the mosques of Doha for absentee prayers for Mohammad Mehdi Akef, the Brotherhood chief who died at a Cairo hospital. Al Qaradawi led the prayers, with Khaled Meshaal of Hamas by his side, despite being “wanted” on all four corners of the globe. It was a clear message from the Qataris that they had no intention of changing their behaviour, and that they had little regard for the worries and concerns of their Gulf neighbours. Al Jazeera’s continued bias coverage In this file picture, a Qatari employee of Al Jazeera news channel walks through the office in Doha. Image Credit: AP This policy was recently mirrored with the unwavering support that Al Jazeera is still showing to Al Houthis and the Brotherhood-backed Islah Party in Yemen, both engaged in fierce battles against the legitimate and internationally-recognised government of Abd Rabo Mansour Hadi. They are also aggressively targeting Libyan Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who, with international backing, is marching on Tripoli to put an end to the Brotherhood-affiliated government and its militias. Undermining security in the Gulf Last month, the UAE filed a complaint against Qatar at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), objecting to a ban on Emirati products imposed by Doha. The ban was a “flagrant violation” of the WTO charter, which calls for open market access and rules against discrimination. Earlier, Qatar had hampered attempts by its citizens to travel to the UAE, blocking a website that allowed them to apply for visas. Meanwhile, despite all tension, the UAE was still acting in good faith, releasing a Qatari vessel that entered its waters on 30 April, with four military personnel onboard. It also did not expel Qatari nationals already living in the UAE, but only asked newcomers wanting to visit to obtain a visa beforehand—an internationally recognised and respected measure taken by all countries across the world. This handout photo taken and released by the Saudi Royal Palace on May 31, 2019 shows (from L) Sayyid Shihab bin Tariq Al Said, advisor of the Omani Sultan, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al-Thani, Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Bahraini King Hamad Al-Khalifa, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salma posing for a family photo during the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) held at al-Safa Royal Palace in the Saudi holy city of Mecca. Image Credit: AFP On May 30, King Salman also acted in good faith, inviting Qatar to attend two summits in Mecca, aimed at discussing “aggression” in the Gulf after four oil tankers were sabotaged earlier in the month, near the Straits of Hormuz, off the coast of Al Fujairah. Relations with Iran and Turkey In this undated photo, Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan visits Turkish troops in Doha. Image Credit: Agencies One month after the crisis started, Qatar re-established full diplomatic relations with Iran and welcomed Turkish troops on its territory. In June 2018, it publicised a phone call between Tamim and President Hassan Rouhani, where the Qatari emir sought Iranian support against the Arab Quartet. The Iranians have also sent food aid to Doha and gave its national carrier Qatar Airways rights to use Iranian—and more recently—Syrian airspace as of April 2019. Last October, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that bilateral relations between the two countries have reached an “ideal level.” In February of this year, Turkey announced that it would be sending six Turkish-made military drones to the Qatari Armed Forces. This was part of a 2018 deal that led to the training of 55 Qatari military personnel on drone command in Turkey and two-years of technical support from Ankara to Doha. Bilateral trade between the two countries stands at $1.5 billion and is expected to rise to $5 billion USD. Crisis will last a ‘few years’ “Qatar will not change its policies” boomed prominent Kuwaiti journalist Fouad Hashem, speaking to Gulf News. “If it takes just one step back, a coup will happen in Qatar. The two Hamads (Hamad Bin Jassem and Hamad Bin Khalifa) came to power with a price; and that price was to carry out this scheme of tearing the Gulf apart.” He also pointed out that the Brotherhood, which he describes as “the cat’s claws of Qatar”, was created to spread fanatic Islamist ideology across the region. “Qatar needed them because it does not have enough citizens to do the job, investing in their wide network across the world.” Hashem expected the crisis to last for another 2-3 years, saying that Qatar will expand its “criminality” into other parts of the Arab World, reaching into counties like Jordan, while still meddling in the affairs of Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine, and Gaza. In December 2017, the Emir of Qatar hosted Michael Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), trying to drum up Zionist support for its crisis with the Arab Quartet.

The two Hamads (Hamad Bin Jassem and Hamad Bin Khalifa) came to power with a price; and that price was to carry out this scheme of tearing the Gulf apart.” He also pointed out that the Brotherhood, which he describes as “the cat’s claws of Qatar”, was created to spread fanatic Islamist ideology across the region. “Qatar needed them because it does not have enough citizens to do the job, investing in their wide network across the world.” Hashem expected the crisis to last for another 2-3 years, saying that Qatar will expand its “criminality” into other parts of the Arab World, reaching into counties like Jordan, while still meddling in the affairs of Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine, and Gaza. In December 2017, the Emir of Qatar hosted Michael Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), trying to drum up Zionist support for its crisis with the Arab Quartet.

News article:
Beirut: June 5 marks the second anniversary of the diplomatic crisis between the Arab Quartet and Qatar. Relations were suspended on June 5, 2017 over Qatar’s continued support for internationally-sanctioned non-state players like Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and its alliance with both Iran and Turkey. Qatar’s behaviour could no longer be tolerated, said the leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt two years ago, claiming that in addition to upsetting security in the Gulf, Qatar was also promoting religious fanaticism and intolerance through terrorist groups like the Brotherhood and the editorial policy of the Doha-based Al Jazeera TV. Qatari stubbornness Two years down the road, however, nothing has changed. The offices of Hamas in Doha remain wide open and its leaders still have unlimited access to the studios of Al Jazeera. The Muslim Brotherhood is still a guest of the Emir of Qatar, Tamim Bin Hamad, and so is its aging spiritual godfather, Yousuf Al Qaradawi. The editorial policy of Al Jazeera has not softened—let alone changed—and Qatari officialdom remains firmly allied to Tehran and Ankara. In September 2017, Shaikh Tamim made himself clear at the General Assembly of the United Nations, saying that his country was going to remain “a save haven for the oppressed (in reference to Hamas and the Brotherhood). That month, Qatari money was used to remove Al Qaradawi from the Interpol’s list of “wanted” criminals, accused of “theft” and “terrorism” by the Egyptian Government. That same month, Sheikh Tamim opened the mosques of Doha for absentee prayers for Mohammad Mehdi Akef, the Brotherhood chief who died at a Cairo hospital. Al Qaradawi led the prayers, with Khaled Meshaal of Hamas by his side, despite being “wanted” on all four corners of the globe. It was a clear message from the Qataris that they had no intention of changing their behaviour, and that they had little regard for the worries and concerns of their Gulf neighbours. Al Jazeera’s continued bias coverage In this file picture, a Qatari employee of Al Jazeera news channel walks through the office in Doha. Image Credit: AP This policy was recently mirrored with the unwavering support that Al Jazeera is still showing to Al Houthis and the Brotherhood-backed Islah Party in Yemen, both engaged in fierce battles against the legitimate and internationally-recognised government of Abd Rabo Mansour Hadi. They are also aggressively targeting Libyan Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who, with international backing, is marching on Tripoli to put an end to the Brotherhood-affiliated government and its militias. Undermining security in the Gulf Last month, the UAE filed a complaint against Qatar at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), objecting to a ban on Emirati products imposed by Doha. The ban was a “flagrant violation” of the WTO charter, which calls for open market access and rules against discrimination. Earlier, Qatar had hampered attempts by its citizens to travel to the UAE, blocking a website that allowed them to apply for visas. Meanwhile, despite all tension, the UAE was still acting in good faith, releasing a Qatari vessel that entered its waters on 30 April, with four military personnel onboard. It also did not expel Qatari nationals already living in the UAE, but only asked newcomers wanting to visit to obtain a visa beforehand—an internationally recognised and respected measure taken by all countries across the world. This handout photo taken and released by the Saudi Royal Palace on May 31, 2019 shows (from L) Sayyid Shihab bin Tariq Al Said, advisor of the Omani Sultan, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al-Thani, Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Bahraini King Hamad Al-Khalifa, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salma posing for a family photo during the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) held at al-Safa Royal Palace in the Saudi holy city of Mecca. Image Credit: AFP On May 30, King Salman also acted in good faith, inviting Qatar to attend two summits in Mecca, aimed at discussing “aggression” in the Gulf after four oil tankers were sabotaged earlier in the month, near the Straits of Hormuz, off the coast of Al Fujairah. Relations with Iran and Turkey In this undated photo, Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan visits Turkish troops in Doha. Image Credit: Agencies One month after the crisis started, Qatar re-established full diplomatic relations with Iran and welcomed Turkish troops on its territory. In June 2018, it publicised a phone call between Tamim and President Hassan Rouhani, where the Qatari emir sought Iranian support against the Arab Quartet. The Iranians have also sent food aid to Doha and gave its national carrier Qatar Airways rights to use Iranian—and more recently—Syrian airspace as of April 2019. Last October, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that bilateral relations between the two countries have reached an “ideal level.” In February of this year, Turkey announced that it would be sending six Turkish-made military drones to the Qatari Armed Forces. This was part of a 2018 deal that led to the training of 55 Qatari military personnel on drone command in Turkey and two-years of technical support from Ankara to Doha. Bilateral trade between the two countries stands at $1.5 billion and is expected to rise to $5 billion USD. Crisis will last a ‘few years’ “Qatar will not change its policies” boomed prominent Kuwaiti journalist Fouad Hashem, speaking to Gulf News. “If it takes just one step back, a coup will happen in Qatar. The two Hamads (Hamad Bin Jassem and Hamad Bin Khalifa) came to power with a price; and that price was to carry out this scheme of tearing the Gulf apart.” He also pointed out that the Brotherhood, which he describes as “the cat’s claws of Qatar”, was created to spread fanatic Islamist ideology across the region. “Qatar needed them because it does not have enough citizens to do the job, investing in their wide network across the world.” Hashem expected the crisis to last for another 2-3 years, saying that Qatar will expand its “criminality” into other parts of the Arab World, reaching into counties like Jordan, while still meddling in the affairs of Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine, and Gaza.

Qatar's foreign minister said on Sunday that Doha rejected the outcome of the recent Mecca talks on mounting regional tensions with Iran as it had not been properly consulted. Saudi Arabia hosted three summits in the holy city over the weekend critical of Iran after King Salman warned that "terrorist" attacks in the Gulf region could imperil global energy supplies. "The statements of the Gulf and Arab summits were ready in advance and we were not consulted on them," Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told the Al-Araby broadcaster. "Qatar has reservations on the Arab and Gulf summits because some of their terms are contrary to Doha's foreign policy." Tehran has strongly denied involvement in recent attacks on oil infrastructure and regional shipping -- incidents that prompted Riyadh to convene the three crisis summits. In a tweet just before the start of the summit, the king vowed to confront "aggressive threats and subversive activities". Qatar is the subject of a two-year Saudi-led economic embargo including bans on direct air, land and sea travel between the boycotting nations and Qatar, as well sanctions. The alliance, which also includes Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, accuses Qatar of supporting Islamist movements and Iran -- claims it denies. But Doha has looked to Tehran to ease its economic isolation, sourcing key imports from Iran and re-routing many flights by its flag carrier Qatar Airways over the Islamic republic. "We hoped the Mecca summits would lay the groundwork for dialogue to reduce tensions with Iran," the foreign minister added in comments reposted on Twitter by his ministry. "The Mecca summit ignored the important issues in the region, such as the Palestine issue and the war in Libya and Yemen." Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
DOHA: In a region of tight media control and official statements, the body language of Saudi Arabia’s king and Qatar’s prime minister spoke volumes about one of the Gulf’s deepest fault lines. Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser Al-Thani did not bow or kiss the cheek of King Salman, whose country has led a two-year economic boycott of Qatar, when they met in Makkah on Thursday. Their closely watched meeting was the highest level encounter between the neighbours since the crisis began on June 5, 2017. Diplomats said the embargo enforced by Riyadh and its allies over Doha’s alleged support for Islamist movements and Iran -- charges Qatar denies -- was unlikely to ease following the frosty encounter. "At least they’re meeting at the highest level in two years, but so many grudges remain," said a Western ambassador in Doha. The weekend talks in Makkah were aimed at addressing soaring regional tensions between Iran on one side and the United States and its allies, including Riyadh, on the other. "Will Qatar go along with a purely anti-Iranian narrative? Interesting times in any case," added the ambassador. King Salman used the meeting of Gulf and other Arab powers to call on attendees to confront Iran’s "criminal" actions after attacks on oil assets heightened fears of a regional flare-up. But Qatar’s Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani questioned on Sunday how the "Gulf summit statement talked about a unified Gulf". "Where is it amid the continuation of Qatar’s blockade?" he added, rejecting the gathering’s position on Iran. Riyadh’s minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir fired back on Monday, criticising Doha for backtracking "after the end of the meetings" and accusing Qatar of "distortion of the facts". "I don’t think it will prove to be a rapprochement. Qatar couldn’t refuse the invitation sent to the emir, they had to send someone on such an important issue -- the stability of the Gulf nations," a European diplomatic source said. "But sending the prime minister instead of the foreign minister is a novelty." Andreas Krieg, an assistant professor at King’s College London, said it was a positive sign that the king’s invitation to the talks did not have "strings attached". "They might overcome their smaller differences for the time being in addressing the issue of Iran," he said. The Makkah meetings kicked off a day after hawkish US National Security Adviser John Bolton said Iran was almost certainly behind this month’s sabotage of four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates -- charges Tehran rejected. But Doha has looked to Tehran over the past two years to ease its economic isolation, sourcing key imports from Iran and re-routing many flights by its flag carrier Qatar Airways over the Islamic republic. Saudi and its allies the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have barred Qatari flights from their airports and airspace, banned most Qatari visitors, cut trade and shipping links, and closed the border. The Saudi-led bloc initially set out a 13-point list of demands, including the closure of Qatar’s flagship Al Jazeera broadcaster, curbing its relations with Iran and closing a Turkish military base in the emirate. Doha dismissed the demands as "unrealistic and not actionable", pressing on despite the sizable diplomatic and economic impact of the embargo -- which Qatar refers to as a "blockade". But as the crisis continues, it is ordinary people who have borne the brunt of the restrictions. "I’m Qatari so it’s impossible for me to cross to Bahrain," Wafa al-Yazeedi, a Qatari medic who was married to a Bahraini man, told AFP. Her three children -- aged 24, 22 and 19 -- hold both Qatari and Bahraini citizenship but have not visited their father or grandmother in the nearby Gulf kingdom since the start of the crisis, she said. Though they have not formally been told by Bahrain that they are barred from the country, "we know because it’s in the newspapers". "The children showed allegiance to Qatar at the beginning but there has to be relations between families, whatever the political situation," said Yazeedi. "It’s having a psychological burden on those affected." Qatari Salah al-Yafie, 42, was studying for a postgraduate degree provided by the University of Northampton in the UAE when the embargo came into force. "We were 18 male and female students. We tried everything after the blockade saying ‘we are students and have no fault in this crisis’," he said. "Unfortunately, the university told us that we are prohibited from attending." Stories like his are common, as are accounts of business ventures disrupted by the restrictions. "The crisis cost me a lot financially and psychologically. We lost lots of money, lost our diplomas and missed out on our dreams," he added. Ahead of the talks in Makkah, a senior Qatari official said "there are some small signs" the boycott could begin to ease, but he did not provide any details. "They are our family," he said. "Thank God we are not a poor country so we can deal with any crisis."

The Saudi-led bloc initially set out a 13-point list of demands, including the closure of Qatar’s flagship Al Jazeera broadcaster, curbing its relations with Iran and closing a Turkish military base in the emirate. Doha dismissed the demands as "unrealistic and not actionable", pressing on despite the sizable diplomatic and economic impact of the embargo -- which Qatar refers to as a "blockade". But as the crisis continues, it is ordinary people who have borne the brunt of the restrictions. "I’m Qatari so it’s impossible for me to cross to Bahrain," Wafa al-Yazeedi, a Qatari medic who was married to a Bahraini man, told AFP. Her three children -- aged 24, 22 and 19 -- hold both Qatari and Bahraini citizenship but have not visited their father or grandmother in the nearby Gulf kingdom since the start of the crisis, she said. Though they have not formally been told by Bahrain that they are barred from the country, "we know because it’s in the newspapers". "The children showed allegiance to Qatar at the beginning but there has to be relations between families, whatever the political situation," said Yazeedi. "It’s having a psychological burden on those affected." Qatari Salah al-Yafie, 42, was studying for a postgraduate degree provided by the University of Northampton in the UAE when the embargo came into force. "We were 18 male and female students. We tried everything after the blockade saying ‘we are students and have no fault in this crisis’," he said. "Unfortunately, the university told us that we are prohibited from attending." Stories like his are common, as are accounts of business ventures disrupted by the restrictions. "The crisis cost me a lot financially and psychologically. We lost lots of money, lost our diplomas and missed out on our dreams," he added. Ahead of the talks in Makkah, a senior Qatari official said "there are some small signs" the boycott could begin to ease, but he did not provide any details. "They are our family," he said. "Thank God we are not a poor country so we can deal with any crisis."

DOHA: In a region of tight media control and official statements, the body language of Saudi Arabia’s king and Qatar’s prime minister spoke volumes about one of the Gulf’s deepest fault lines. Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser Al-Thani did not bow or kiss the cheek of King Salman, whose country has led a two-year economic boycott of Qatar, when they met in Makkah on Thursday. Their closely watched meeting was the highest level encounter between the neighbours since the crisis began on June 5, 2017. Diplomats said the embargo enforced by Riyadh and its allies over Doha’s alleged support for Islamist movements and Iran -- charges Qatar denies -- was unlikely to ease following the frosty encounter. "At least they’re meeting at the highest level in two years, but so many grudges remain," said a Western ambassador in Doha. The weekend talks in Makkah were aimed at addressing soaring regional tensions between Iran on one side and the United States and its allies, including Riyadh, on the other. "Will Qatar go along with a purely anti-Iranian narrative? Interesting times in any case," added the ambassador. King Salman used the meeting of Gulf and other Arab powers to call on attendees to confront Iran’s "criminal" actions after attacks on oil assets heightened fears of a regional flare-up. But Qatar’s Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani questioned on Sunday how the "Gulf summit statement talked about a unified Gulf". "Where is it amid the continuation of Qatar’s blockade?" he added, rejecting the gathering’s position on Iran. Riyadh’s minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir fired back on Monday, criticising Doha for backtracking "after the end of the meetings" and accusing Qatar of "distortion of the facts". "I don’t think it will prove to be a rapprochement. Qatar couldn’t refuse the invitation sent to the emir, they had to send someone on such an important issue -- the stability of the Gulf nations," a European diplomatic source said. "But sending the prime minister instead of the foreign minister is a novelty." Andreas Krieg, an assistant professor at King’s College London, said it was a positive sign that the king’s invitation to the talks did not have "strings attached". "They might overcome their smaller differences for the time being in addressing the issue of Iran," he said. The Makkah meetings kicked off a day after hawkish US National Security Adviser John Bolton said Iran was almost certainly behind this month’s sabotage of four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates -- charges Tehran rejected. But Doha has looked to Tehran over the past two years to ease its economic isolation, sourcing key imports from Iran and re-routing many flights by its flag carrier Qatar Airways over the Islamic republic. Saudi and its allies the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have barred Qatari flights from their airports and airspace, banned most Qatari visitors, cut trade and shipping links, and closed the border. The Saudi-led bloc initially set out a 13-point list of demands, including the closure of Qatar’s flagship Al Jazeera broadcaster, curbing its relations with Iran and closing a Turkish military base in the emirate.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will host Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani at the White House next month, the White House said in a statement on Friday. The two leaders will discuss "economic and security ties" and counterterrorism issues during the July 9 visit, the White House said, amid a US effort to build pressure on the Iranian regime. Qatar has maintained cordial relations with Tehran even as other Arab states led by Saudi Arabia have cooperated with Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran. Saudi Arabia and its allies the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have boycotted Qatar for two years, unhappy about Doha's insistence on maintaining its own approach to regional relations and links with Iran and terrorist organizations. Doha denies any such links. Qatar is also slated to take part in the June 25-26 Bahrain conference on the Trump administration's Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative, where Washington hopes to raise financial pledges to support the Palestinian economy

News article:
The Hague (AFP) - The UN's top court on Friday rejected a request by the United Arab Emirates to take special measures against Qatar in a two-year crisis that has added to growing tensions in the Gulf. Oil and gas-rich Qatar has faced an economic and diplomatic boycott since June 2017 by Gulf rivals who accused Doha of backing terrorism and being too close to regional rival Iran. Abu Dhabi had asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to prevent Doha "aggravating" the dispute, after Qatar won a case last year over alleged discrimination against its citizens. ICJ Chief judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf said the court "rejects the request for provisional measures submitted by the United Arab Emirates" by a margin of 15 to one. The measures it asked for were temporary ones while the Hague-based court decides on a wider legal battle between the UAE and Qatar over the blockade. The legal blow for the UAE comes as tensions soar in the Gulf after two oil tankers were set ablaze in an attack that Washington has blamed on Tehran. - 'Groundless' request - Qatar's representative to the ICJ said it welcomed the rejection of the "groundless" UAE request. "Qatar brought this case to protect the Qatari people against the UAE’s policy and practice of racial discrimination. It is the Qatari people who are the victims here, and not the government of the UAE," said Mohammed Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi. For two years Saudi Arabia and its allies the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have barred Qatari flights from their airports and airspace, banned most Qatari visitors, cut trade and shipping links, and closed their borders, unhappy about Doha's insistence on maintaining its own approach to regional relations. Last June, in a case brought by Qatar, the ICJ ruled that the UAE must allow families which include Qatari members to be reunited, and that Qatari students must be given the chance to complete their education in the Emirates. Story continues But Abu Dhabi this year went back to court to seek the special measures, including to stop what it alleged was Doha blocking its own citizens from accessing Emirati websites to ease travel issues. It also asked the ICJ to order Doha to withdraw a separate discrimination case that it has lodged against the UAE with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), a body which upholds a 1965 UN treaty on equality. - Regional tensions - The ICJ however ruled that the UAE's requests for special measures did not cover "plausible rights" that needed to be protected. "The conditions for the indication of provisional measures... are not met," the court said in its judgment. During a hearing earlier this year, the Emiratis meanwhile also accused Qatar of backing terrorist groups including the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda, echoing one of the original allegations by the Gulf allies against Doha. They also alleged that Qatar used its state-controlled news channels and fake documents to hamper Abu Dhabi's own efforts to damp down the row, and asked the court to tell Qatar to stop. Doha has repeatedly denied the claims of its rivals, accusing them of seeking regime change. Qatar has maintained cordial relations with Tehran even as other Gulf Arab states led by Saudi Arabia have cooperated with US pressure campaign against Iran, but Doha is also still close to Washington.

Palestinian artists have called on contestants taking part in Eurovision "to boycott the international music competition that Israel is hosting next week", reported Al Jazeera. According to the Palestinian Artists Association, based in the occupied Gaza Strip, Israel is using the event to "perpetuate oppression, promote injustice or whitewash a brutal apartheid regime". In the statement published yesterday, the artists cited the killing of more than 60 Palestinians by Israeli forces during protests in Gaza along the perimeter fence on 14 May last year, "the same day Israel won the Eurovision". READ: Israel's Eurovision flop The association also held a sit-in outside the European Union's Gaza office and wrote a letter of protest. Numerous artists and cultural figures have already urged a boycott of this year's Israeli-hosted Eurovision, including Roger Waters – who wrote an open letter to Madonna, asking her to cancel her planned performance at the event – as well as British personalities such as Vivienne Westwood, Peter Gabriel and Mike Leigh – who have asked the BBC to cancel its coverage. The calls to boycott Eurovision have also come from the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which since 2005 has called for and coordinated a global, civil-society led anti-apartheid campaign. The boycott includes economic, academic and cultural elements.

Palestinian artists have called on contestants taking part in Eurovision "to boycott the international music competition that Israel is hosting next week", reported Al Jazeera. According to the Palestinian Artists Association, based in the occupied Gaza Strip, Israel is using the event to "perpetuate oppression, promote injustice or whitewash a brutal apartheid regime". In the statement published yesterday, the artists cited the killing of more than 60 Palestinians by Israeli forces during protests in Gaza along the perimeter fence on 14 May last year, "the same day Israel won the Eurovision". READ: Israel's Eurovision flop The association also held a sit-in outside the European Union's Gaza office and wrote a letter of protest. Numerous artists and cultural figures have already urged a boycott of this year's Israeli-hosted Eurovision, including Roger Waters – who wrote an open letter to Madonna, asking her to cancel her planned performance at the event – as well as British personalities such as Vivienne Westwood, Peter Gabriel and Mike Leigh – who have asked the BBC to cancel its coverage. The calls to boycott Eurovision have also come from the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which since 2005 has called for and coordinated a global, civil-society led anti-apartheid campaign. The boycott includes economic, academic and cultural elements.

Germany today voted to define the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement as anti-Semitic, becoming the first major European parliament to do so. The German parliament – known as the Bundestag – this afternoon voted to accept a motion defining BDS as anti-Semitic. The motion, "Resist the BDS Movement – Fighting Antisemitism," was sponsored by the Bundestag's two largest parties – Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian-Democratic Union and the Social Democrat party – as well as the Green Party and the Free Democratic Party. The text of the motion stated that "the German Bundestag is unwavering in its commitment to condemn and combat anti-Semitism in all its forms," stressing it will oppose "anyone who defames people because of their Jewish identity […] questions the right of the Jewish and democratic state of Israel to exist or Israel's right to defend itself." On the BDS movement specifically, the motion claimed that "the arguments, patterns and methods of the BDS movement are anti-Semitic". As evidence of this, the motion argued that BDS' "don't buy" stickers – which aim to identify products of Israeli origin so consumers can refrain from purchasing them – "arouse associations [with] the Nazi slogan 'Don't buy from Jews'" and are "reminiscent of the most horrific phase in German history". READ: UK film-makers urge boycott of Israel film festival Although the motion is non-binding, its significance both within Germany and across Europe is likely to be profound. In practical terms, German newspaper Algemeiner explains that today's passing of the motion will "prevent 'organizations which express themselves in an antisemitic manner, or question the right of Israel to exist' from using 'premises and facilities under Bundestag administration'". It will also require the Bundestag "not to financially promote organizations that do not respect Israel's right to exist". On a European level, the motion could serve as a precedent for other parliaments to label BDS anti-Semitic. Several European countries have sought to crack down on the movement in recent years, most notably Spain which, at the behest of Israel, has dragged a number of municipal councils to court for announcing that they would support a boycott. The move could also pave the way for other groups to be labelled anti-Semitic for their criticism of Israel. By arguing that "the state of Israel can also be understood as a Jewish collective," the passing of the motion will further narrow the space for criticism of Israel's government and its policies by conflating this with anti-Semitic rhetoric. READ: Guest Writer: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign and public discourse The Bundestag also voted today on two other anti-BDS resolutions: the first, which was submitted by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, called on the German government to outlaw the BDS altogether; meanwhile the second, submitted by the left-wing party Die Linke, called on the government to condemn "anti-Semitism within" the BDS movement. The AfD's proposed resolution called on the German government to "prohibit" BDS and "recognize the injustice done to Jewish settlers in Palestine by Arab calls for boycott, in cooperation and coordination with the Nazi regime". It went on to denounce the distinction made between Israel and its illegal settlements, including the European Union (EU)'s labelling of Israeli goods made in West Bank settlements. It claimed that, in labelling the products as such, the EU had created a "de facto economic recognition" of an independent Palestinian state "without this being legitimate in any form".

In March, three BDS activists stood trial for trumped-up claims of trespassing and assault after they protested against Israeli politician Aliza Lavie, who spoke at Berlin's Humboldt University in 2017.

News article:
Calls to boycott this year's Eurovision song contest have focused on Israel's brutal occupation. Mercury Prize-winning rock band Wolf Alice, for example, gave their backing by evoking images of Israel's domination over Palestinians saying that it was "weaponising culture" and that the Zionist state was a "serial human rights abuser" who "use culture to art wash" and "whitewash over their human rights abuses". British ban Slovo cited apartheid – again with Israel's discriminatory laws in the West Bank in mind – and elected not only to boycott the event but also to release a song called "I don't sing for apartheid". A similar message was echoed by an Israeli group known as Breaking the Silence who called for Eurovision goers to experience "the full picture" of Israel's occupation by taking a tour to the West Bank city of Hebron, where the apartheid system of domination imposed on 300,000 Palestinians have made their lives punishingly difficult. The NGO, founded by former members of the Israeli army, erected a giant billboard on a highway between Israel's Ben Gurion Airport and Tel Aviv – where this year's Eurovision Song Contest is being held – in a bid to highlight Israel's now 52-year-old occupation of the Palestinian territories. For Palestinians in Gaza and the millions of others across the region that were made stateless by Israel's ethnic cleansing in 1948, the Eurovision contest, which coincides with the 71st Nakba anniversary, will evoke long and bitter memories. Eurovision will take place in a venue that's only two hour's drive from the protestors in an area known to Palestinians as the location of the village of Al-Shaykh Muwannis and the euro village housing tourists, located on Al-Manshiyya neighbourhood of Jaffa. For Palestinians these areas arouse powerful memories of violent displacement, expulsion and the erasure of their history. Erasure of Palestinian history Israel's creation in 1948 kick-started a desperate attempt to remap and erase Palestinian history. As Ramzy Baroud points out, during the British mandate, the colonial authorities were using predominantly Arabic names of localities, towns and villages; 3,700 such places were named. By contrast, there were just 200 Hebrew toponyms, most of them being names of Jewish settlements, including new ones that were being built under the patronage of the Zionist movement. This, according to Baroud, was quite indicative of the demographic distribution and land ownership in Palestine at the beginning of the British mandate in the 1920s where Jews, including newly arrived settlers, were just 11 per cent of the total population. However, immediately after the creation of the state of Israel, against the wishes of the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab population of the Middle East, a vicious campaign to "remap" Palestine was launched. Baroud goes on to explain that soon after, a government commission was created and tasked with renaming everything Palestinian so the new state can lay its claim on towns, villages and various other geographical areas. The village of Al-Shaykh Muwannis and the Al-Manshiyya neighbourhood endured a similar fate. This erasure is often exposed to make a mockery of Israel's attempt to deny that Palestine ever existed; that it contained 600 Palestinian towns and villages that were razed to the ground; that half the population were expelled to artificially create a Jewish majority, and make way for a state comprising of indigenous Palestinian Jews and European migrants with Jewish heritage. It says Haifa is in Israel on @googlemaps but this shore that looks a good century old says its in Palestine 🧐🧐 @georgegalloway @normfinkelstein #Palestine pic.twitter.com/jRN6nWf3py — Graham Matthews (@180Gringo) May 14, 2019 Al-Shaykh Muwannis This small Palestinian village, located in an area that is known today as Ramat Aviv, belonged to Jaffa's sub-district of Mandatory Palestine. It was abandoned in March 1948 under fear of attack by Jewish paramilitary groups, two months before the 1948 Arab–Israeli war began. Their flight is one of many instances that belie the popular myth that the indigenous Arabs left as a result of the 1948 war when in fact hundreds of thousands had fled their homes in fear of their lives from Jewish militias months before Arab armies and Israeli soldiers clashed. Al-Shaykh Muwannis was a victim of the early Zionist's plan to create "Jewish-only" neighbourhoods in the coastal area that later became part of Israel's capital. As the UN was about to start drafting its Partition Plan for Palestine, the port of Jaffa, one of the oldest in the region, was targeted by Zionist terrorists, forcing the town's 120,000 Palestinians to leave as Jewish para military groups seized their property and labelled the area a "Jewish" neighbourhood. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, who has carried out extensive work on the flight of Palestinian refugees, Al-Shaykh Muwannis' population – numbering around 2,239 – enjoyed friendly relations with their Jewish neighbours. However on 7 March 1948, the Haganah's Alexandroni Brigade imposed quarantine on the village by closing off all access roads to it and two smaller satellite villages of Jalil Al Shamaliyya and Jalil Al Qibliya. Residents of Al-Shaykh Muwannis – who it seems wanted to come to an agreement and avoid the same fate as others in nearby villages – met with Haganah representatives and expressed their desire for peace, according to Palestine Remembered – a website that catalogues information on demolished Palestinian villages. The villagers, despite agreeing to not harbour any Arab Liberation Armies or local Arab Militia, were forced to flee following intimidation from Jewish paramilitary groups. Like other Palestinians, many fled towards Gaza, the West Bank and neighbouring Arab countries. Today, not much remains of the original village. Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi says that a number of houses, exhibiting a variety of architectural features, remain; they are now occupied by Jewish families. One of them is a two-storey house with a one-storey annex; it is made of cement and has rectangular doors and windows and flat roofs. Another is a two-storey, two-unit, symmetrical house with two front porches on the top floor. Each porch is defined by five lancet arches. A single wall of another house stands alone, topped by a post that supports an electric wire. This sea-front village grabbed the headlines this week when party-goers residing in the Eurovision village upset worshippers fasting in the month of Ramadan. A "Eurovision Village" pavilion set up on the Tel Aviv beachfront to host parties is located directly opposite the century-old Hassan Bek Mosque, named after an Ottoman governor and frequented by Israeli Arabs from nearby Jaffa. The mosque, along with the area of the railroad station, is the only building remaining. Charles Clore Park and part of Tel Aviv promenade now sit on the ruins of this neighbourhood first established in 1870. A profile of the town's history by Zochrot– an Israeli organisation based in Tel Aviv that aims to promote awareness of the Palestinian Nakba – shows that Al-Manshiyya had a population of 12,000 Palestinians and about 1,000 Jews in 1944. Egyptian soldiers are said to have helped build the town walls which contained Palestinian and Jewish neighbourhoods. HaTahana Street which stretched north to the area was known as the "Jews' market". Until 1947, the market contained a number of shops owned by Jewish merchants, as well as many owned by Arabs. The fate of Al-Manshiyya was sealed when Jewish paramilitary group, Irgun, launched operation Hametz, at the end of April 1948. Its objective was the capture of Palestinian villages inland from Jaffa and establishing a blockade around the town. Irgun began a direct attack on the Manshiyya neighbourhood and carried out its operations with units drafted in from different parts of the country. Some 600 fighters with a large amount of ammunition and grenades, some of which are said to have been stolen from the British military were used to carry out the assault. The residents of Al-Manshiyya and the other villages resisted in vain. They gathered, primarily around the Hassan Beq Mosque, and fought back despite their lack of numbers and weapons. Al- Manshiyya finally fell on 28 April 1948, and was cut off from Yafa. The town was demolished completely, except for the Hassan Beq Mosque and a park that sits opposite the mosque as a memorial to the forces that captured Yafa. Some of Al-Manshiyya's inhabitants were expelled to Jordan, and others were sent by sea to Gaza and Egypt. A few were transferred to Yafa and later lived in the Ajami ghetto where the Israeli army held 4,000 Palestinians alongside refugees from Yafa and the nearby villages. Al Manshiyya became publicly owned. In the 1950s plans were drawn up for the future of the area, which is now a modern commercial centre. Understandably the besieged enclave of Gaza and cities like Jerusalem and Hebron are at the forefront of people's mind in resisting Israel's apartheid regime. However as Palestinians mark their Nakba day while Israel seeks to whitewash its occupation and system of racist domination, it is important to recall other areas of historic Palestine that were brought under Israeli control in 1948.

The NGO, founded by former members of the Israeli army, erected a giant billboard on a highway between Israel's Ben Gurion Airport and Tel Aviv – where this year's Eurovision Song Contest is being held – in a bid to highlight Israel's now 52-year-old occupation of the Palestinian territories. For Palestinians in Gaza and the millions of others across the region that were made stateless by Israel's ethnic cleansing in 1948, the Eurovision contest, which coincides with the 71st Nakba anniversary, will evoke long and bitter memories. Eurovision will take place in a venue that's only two hour's drive from the protestors in an area known to Palestinians as the location of the village of Al-Shaykh Muwannis and the euro village housing tourists, located on Al-Manshiyya neighbourhood of Jaffa. For Palestinians these areas arouse powerful memories of violent displacement, expulsion and the erasure of their history. Erasure of Palestinian history Israel's creation in 1948 kick-started a desperate attempt to remap and erase Palestinian history. As Ramzy Baroud points out, during the British mandate, the colonial authorities were using predominantly Arabic names of localities, towns and villages; 3,700 such places were named. By contrast, there were just 200 Hebrew toponyms, most of them being names of Jewish settlements, including new ones that were being built under the patronage of the Zionist movement. This, according to Baroud, was quite indicative of the demographic distribution and land ownership in Palestine at the beginning of the British mandate in the 1920s where Jews, including newly arrived settlers, were just 11 per cent of the total population. However, immediately after the creation of the state of Israel, against the wishes of the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab population of the Middle East, a vicious campaign to "remap" Palestine was launched. Baroud goes on to explain that soon after, a government commission was created and tasked with renaming everything Palestinian so the new state can lay its claim on towns, villages and various other geographical areas. The village of Al-Shaykh Muwannis and the Al-Manshiyya neighbourhood endured a similar fate. This erasure is often exposed to make a mockery of Israel's attempt to deny that Palestine ever existed; that it contained 600 Palestinian towns and villages that were razed to the ground; that half the population were expelled to artificially create a Jewish majority, and make way for a state comprising of indigenous Palestinian Jews and European migrants with Jewish heritage. It says Haifa is in Israel on @googlemaps but this shore that looks a good century old says its in Palestine 🧐🧐 @georgegalloway @normfinkelstein #Palestine pic.twitter.com/jRN6nWf3py — Graham Matthews (@180Gringo) May 14, 2019 Al-Shaykh Muwannis This small Palestinian village, located in an area that is known today as Ramat Aviv, belonged to Jaffa's sub-district of Mandatory Palestine. It was abandoned in March 1948 under fear of attack by Jewish paramilitary groups, two months before the 1948 Arab–Israeli war began. Their flight is one of many instances that belie the popular myth that the indigenous Arabs left as a result of the 1948 war when in fact hundreds of thousands had fled their homes in fear of their lives from Jewish militias months before Arab armies and Israeli soldiers clashed. Al-Shaykh Muwannis was a victim of the early Zionist's plan to create "Jewish-only" neighbourhoods in the coastal area that later became part of Israel's capital. As the UN was about to start drafting its Partition Plan for Palestine, the port of Jaffa, one of the oldest in the region, was targeted by Zionist terrorists, forcing the town's 120,000 Palestinians to leave as Jewish para military groups seized their property and labelled the area a "Jewish" neighbourhood. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, who has carried out extensive work on the flight of Palestinian refugees, Al-Shaykh Muwannis' population – numbering around 2,239 – enjoyed friendly relations with their Jewish neighbours. However on 7 March 1948, the Haganah's Alexandroni Brigade imposed quarantine on the village by closing off all access roads to it and two smaller satellite villages of Jalil Al Shamaliyya and Jalil Al Qibliya. Residents of Al-Shaykh Muwannis – who it seems wanted to come to an agreement and avoid the same fate as others in nearby villages – met with Haganah representatives and expressed their desire for peace, according to Palestine Remembered – a website that catalogues information on demolished Palestinian villages. The villagers, despite agreeing to not harbour any Arab Liberation Armies or local Arab Militia, were forced to flee following intimidation from Jewish paramilitary groups. Like other Palestinians, many fled towards Gaza, the West Bank and neighbouring Arab countries. Today, not much remains of the original village. Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi says that a number of houses, exhibiting a variety of architectural features, remain; they are now occupied by Jewish families. One of them is a two-storey house with a one-storey annex; it is made of cement and has rectangular doors and windows and flat roofs. Another is a two-storey, two-unit, symmetrical house with two front porches on the top floor. Each porch is defined by five lancet arches. A single wall of another house stands alone, topped by a post that supports an electric wire. This sea-front village grabbed the headlines this week when party-goers residing in the Eurovision village upset worshippers fasting in the month of Ramadan. A "Eurovision Village" pavilion set up on the Tel Aviv beachfront to host parties is located directly opposite the century-old Hassan Bek Mosque, named after an Ottoman governor and frequented by Israeli Arabs from nearby Jaffa. The mosque, along with the area of the railroad station, is the only building remaining. Charles Clore Park and part of Tel Aviv promenade now sit on the ruins of this neighbourhood first established in 1870. A profile of the town's history by Zochrot– an Israeli organisation based in Tel Aviv that aims to promote awareness of the Palestinian Nakba – shows that Al-Manshiyya had a population of 12,000 Palestinians and about 1,000 Jews in 1944. Egyptian soldiers are said to have helped build the town walls which contained Palestinian and Jewish neighbourhoods. HaTahana Street which stretched north to the area was known as the "Jews' market". Until 1947, the market contained a number of shops owned by Jewish merchants, as well as many owned by Arabs. The fate of Al-Manshiyya was sealed when Jewish paramilitary group, Irgun, launched operation Hametz, at the end of April 1948. Its objective was the capture of Palestinian villages inland from Jaffa and establishing a blockade around the town. Irgun began a direct attack on the Manshiyya neighbourhood and carried out its operations with units drafted in from different parts of the country. Some 600 fighters with a large amount of ammunition and grenades, some of which are said to have been stolen from the British military were used to carry out the assault. The residents of Al-Manshiyya and the other villages resisted in vain. They gathered, primarily around the Hassan Beq Mosque, and fought back despite their lack of numbers and weapons. Al- Manshiyya finally fell on 28 April 1948, and was cut off from Yafa. The town was demolished completely, except for the Hassan Beq Mosque and a park that sits opposite the mosque as a memorial to the forces that captured Yafa. Some of Al-Manshiyya's inhabitants were expelled to Jordan, and others were sent by sea to Gaza and Egypt. A few were transferred to Yafa and later lived in the Ajami ghetto where the Israeli army held 4,000 Palestinians alongside refugees from Yafa and the nearby villages. Al Manshiyya became publicly owned. In the 1950s plans were drawn up for the future of the area, which is now a modern commercial centre. Understandably the besieged enclave of Gaza and cities like Jerusalem and Hebron are at the forefront of people's mind in resisting Israel's apartheid regime. However as Palestinians mark their Nakba day while Israel seeks to whitewash its occupation and system of racist domination, it is important to recall other areas of historic Palestine that were brought under Israeli control in 1948.

Calls to boycott this year's Eurovision song contest have focused on Israel's brutal occupation. Mercury Prize-winning rock band Wolf Alice, for example, gave their backing by evoking images of Israel's domination over Palestinians saying that it was "weaponising culture" and that the Zionist state was a "serial human rights abuser" who "use culture to art wash" and "whitewash over their human rights abuses". British ban Slovo cited apartheid – again with Israel's discriminatory laws in the West Bank in mind – and elected not only to boycott the event but also to release a song called "I don't sing for apartheid".

News article:
The legislation that passed in the German Bundestag last week defining the BDS movement as anti-Semitic has great symbolic importance. For the first time, a country has declared that the boycott movement isn’t simply political, but racist. This important decision is a significant achievement, that can be credited to a few factors. First, this is a clear implementation of a policy, first outlined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whereby the security and existence of the State of Israel are a top German national interest. The fact that all of the centrist German parties supported this decision further enforces this. Second, the one who pushed for a clearer definition of BDS as an anti-Semitic movement was none other than the Federal Commissioner for Jewish Life in Germany and the Fight against anti-Semitism Felix Klein. Prior to being appointed to this position a year ago, Klein introduced many pieces of legislation that specifically condemned anti-Semitism, despite numerous challenges he faced, mainly from the German left. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories The third factor was Israel: After many long years of ignoring the BDS movement and the monetary and political support it received from certain German groups, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government finally changed its policy. Directly taking on the boycott movement, it called upon the German government to finally cut off funding to such groups. There is an additional element at play here, however, that bothers a number of Israelis, and especially top government officials in Jerusalem: the rise of the far-right nationalistic party Alternative for Germany (AfD). The party has helped expose the duality of the German government’s position towards Israel: embracing Israel while simultaneously supporting the Jewish state’s enemies. The fear that the AfD would raise a draft resolution on BDS created a sense of urgency that spurred the ruling German government to pass the anti-BDS legislation. Now, after this historic recognition, we will see how things play out. Germany will be judged based on its implementation of this decision. For example, who will decide now which groups are supporters of BDS or identify with its policies? Supporters of BDS on the far-left of Israeli and Jewish society have already come together to fight this decision. This development may result in the German authorities trying to find ways to bypass the law. The new legislation is admirable, but it is still too early to celebrate. Only after we see the law’s implementation will we be able to declare success. Until then, expect the Israeli supporters of BDS movement, many of whom reside in Germany, to assist the authorities to find ways to bypass this legislation.

News article:
The past weekend was one of the most successful for Israel in the international arena in a long time. The Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv - viewed by hundreds of millions of people - was one of the most impressive productions in the competition’s history. Australia reelected one of Israel closest allies, Scott Morrison, for another term as prime minister (despite everyone predicting a defeat for his conservative coalition). And finally, in the most important development of all, the German parliament voted to designate the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement as anti-Semitic. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter The decision of lawmakers in the Bundestag, including some from the German far-left Die Linke party, decided a Working Definition of Antisemitism - formulated during 2003–04 - is the one should be adopted by the state. The non-legally binding definition, which among other things equates some criticism of Israel to anti-Semitism, was adopted by a plenary meeting of the 31 countries in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance back in 2016. BDS campaign t-shirt (Photo: AFP) The German parliament’s motion, however, doesn’t simply adopt the definition, but also states that a BDS campaign uses anti-Semitic tactics to fulfill its political goals. For instance, calling for Israeli products to be labeled with "Don't Buy" stickers was reminiscent of the Nazi-era boycott of Jewish businesses, known in German as "Judenboykott", which used slogans such as: "Don't buy from Jews." One of the main problems in the fight against the BDS lies in the deceptive definition of its goal to "pressure Israel into ending the occupation." Although some BDS activist do genuinely believe the organization uses legitimate and non-violent ways to apply pressure on Israel - in order to achieve peace between Palestinians and the State of Israel - the movement's true goal isn't to end the occupation. The BDS opposes the very existence of Israel, and the movement’s leaders admit that. The fact that the Bundestag had the courage to call the movement by its true name (and for such left-leaning publications like the New York Times and the Guardian to report on it) is excellent news for Israel. But, this is no time to rest on our laurels. The BDS movement - which has many branches and organizations operating in its name in the Western world - continues to gain momentum in the two most important spheres: media and academia. German parliament building Some of the most prominent figures who participate in whitewashing of the movement's true nature are, in fact, Israelis. Before the German vote, some 60 Israeli researchers and professors signed a petition calling on the German political parties not to equate the movement’s activity with anti-Semitism. Although in this particular instance they failed, the propaganda of this nature has been known to bear fruit. The Bundestag's decision, however, is non-binding and Germany still funds plenty of pro-Palestinian groups that work for (or inspired by) the BDS. In order to inflict a severe blow on the movement, it's important to stop funding the organizations that make it their mission to vilify the State of Israel in the eyes of the world. If the funding continues, the German decision will become a merely symbolic one.

The past weekend was one of the most successful for Israel in the international arena in a long time. The Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv - viewed by hundreds of millions of people - was one of the most impressive productions in the competition’s history. Australia reelected one of Israel closest allies, Scott Morrison, for another term as prime minister (despite everyone predicting a defeat for his conservative coalition).

One of the main problems in the fight against the BDS lies in the deceptive definition of its goal to "pressure Israel into ending the occupation." Although some BDS activist do genuinely believe the organization uses legitimate and non-violent ways to apply pressure on Israel - in order to achieve peace between Palestinians and the State of Israel - the movement's true goal isn't to end the occupation.

Germany's decision to equate the boycott of Israel with anti-Semitism "violates international law", "international legitimacy" and is "immoral", the Boycott Campaign – Palestine said in a statement today. "This immoral decision violates as well human rights, freedom of expression and the right of people to support the oppressed around the world," the movement added. BCP warned that this decision "will give immunity and strengthen the occupation and encourage it to continue to commit further crimes and apartheid acts against the Palestinian people." Last week, German parliament – known as the Bundestag – voted to accept a motion defining BDS as anti-Semitic. The motion, "Resist the BDS Movement – Fighting Antisemitism," was sponsored by the Bundestag's two largest parties – Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian-Democratic Union and the Social Democrat party – as well as the Green Party and the Free Democratic Party. This decision, BCP said, comes at a time when Germany should be putting pressure on Israel "to comply with the resolutions of international legitimacy and end the occupation". "We call on the German parliament to immediately reverse the decision and support any popular action against any occupation around the world, especially the Israeli occupation, which continues to commit war crimes and genocide against the defenseless Palestinian people," the BCP concluded.

News article:
In a furious response to the passing of a landmark anti-BDS resolution in the German Parliament, the Palestinian Authority released a sickening statement in which it accused Israel of invoking the Holocaust to “blackmail” European countries to reject the boycott of the Jewish State. In a vote on Friday, an overwhelming majority of German lawmakers deemed the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement anti-Semitic and reminiscent of the Nazi campaign against the Jews. The statement released by the PA’s Foreign Ministry in response to the adoption of the resolution deployed overtly anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations against Israel. The PA charged that Israel is using the Holocaust to its own political and financial advantage. “Israel continues to impose its wishes on the representatives of the European peoples by blackmailing them using the historical German stigmatization of the Jews to achieve what it [Israel] wants,” the statement said. As a consequence, the statement added, the “German establishment is entrenching its complicity in Israel’s crimes of military occupation, ethnic cleansing, siege and apartheid, while desperately trying to shield it from accountability to international law.” Ben Cohen noted in The Algemeiner that the statement failed to acknowledge the $100 million in aid provided by German taxpayers to the Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA in 2018, nor did it mention the German government’s pledge to increase its contribution to Palestinian development projects following dramatic cuts in U.S. government funding last year. Instead, the PA statement charged that the German Parliament’s decision “reflects first that the role and action of the [BDS] organization is so influential that Israel and its supporters began to look for a pretext or justification for attacking the organization and distorting its image.” The anti-Semitic BDS movement seeks the total destruction of Israel, as acknowledged by leaders of the campaign. Co-founder Omar Barghouti said: “Definitely, most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine.” [Photo: Alex Chis / Flickr]

News article:
Advertisement Britain did even worse in the Eurovision Song Contest than viewers first thought as its disatrous bottom-placed entry was actually awarded five more points that it should have been on the night. Michael Rice’s song, Bigger Than Us, was originally thought to have picked up 16 points, putting Britain in last place. But it turns out he scored just 11 in the final on Saturday in Tel Aviv, as the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) reveal a mistake due to 'human error'. The blunder originated with the Belarussian jury's dismissal from the competition when its members broke the contest's rules by revealing who they'd voted for in the semi-final. Michael Rice (pictured, left) bagged a disastrous 16 - but it turns out he actually scored just 11. An error in counting resulted from a mistake in the allocation of points from Belarus (pictured, right, their entree, Zena) Duncan Laurence, 25, of the Netherlands reacts after winning the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Saturday, when Britain finished last For the final, competition bosses pooled previous Belarussian votes with those of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia and Georgia to give an aggregate score to award finalists. The scores were supposed to be spread among the countries that were running in the top 10, but the EBU mistakenly dished them out to the bottom 10, with Rice gaining five points belonging to Azerbaijan. What are the corrected Eurovision results? 1. Netherlands (498 points) 2. Italy (472 points) 3. Russia (370 points) 4. Switzerland (364 points) 5. Sweden (334 points) 6. Norway (331 points) 7. North Macedonia (305 points) 8. Azerbaijan (302 points) 9. Australia (284 points) 10. Iceland (232 points) 11. Czech Republic (157 points) 12. Denmark (120 points) 13. Cyprus (109 points) 14. Malta (107 points) 15. Slovenia (105 points) 16. France (105 points) 17. Albania (90 points) 18. Serbia (89 points) 19. San Marino (77 points) 20. Estonia (76 points) 21. Greece (74 points) 22. Spain (54 points) 23. Israel (35 points) 24. Belarus (31 points) 25. Germany (24 points) 26. United Kingdom (11 points) Advertisement Though the top four remain unchanged by the correction, winner Duncan Laurence’s song Arcade gained six points for the Netherlands after the error was rectified. Norway had points deducted and dropped to sixth from fifth. Yesterday's revelation came after fans claimed online that Hartlepool-born Rice should have received an even lower score. Wily Twitter users theorised that Belarus's points were incorrectly allocated to the bottom 10 songs rather than the top 10. Professor Adrian Kavanagh, of Maynooth University in Ireland, said: 'I think this is more a case of "you had just one job" rather than a scandal. Just an absolute mess up.' According to the Eurovision website semi-finalists get allocated into six pots, based on historical voting patterns as calculated by the contest's official televoting partner Digame. They say: 'Drawing from different pots helps to reduce the chance of so-called neighbourly voting and increases suspense in the semi-finals.' Belarus was in the same 'pot' as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Russia but the points Belarus gave were in the exact opposite order to the rest of the pot's rankings. The other four nations put Malta at the top, but Belarus gave it zero points. Belarus also gave Israel the maximum of 12 points, despite the other four placing it bottom. Dr Kavanagh believes the UK's low score was the result of a perceived lack of effort, rather than politics, after Rice suggested that he was being punished for Brexit. He said: 'I don’t think the poor UK jury results in past years are a reflection on Brexit, more a reflection that other countries don’t think that the UK cares or tries at Eurovision. 'When the UK has made a concerted effort at Eurovision, they’ve done OK with the juries, even in the Brexit era – Lucie Jones finished 10th in the Eurovision Final Jury Vote in 2017 (despite this being in the wake of the Brexit vote) on the basis that the UK had done a really great job that year in terms of the selection and staging of their entry.' On the topic of Ireland's jury giving the UK zero points Dr Kavanagh said: 'While Ireland's jury gave no points to the UK in the Final (the UK jury likewise gave no points to Ireland in the semi final), it was not unusual in doing so - only six juries awarded the UK points (and most of these only awarded 1 or 2 points).' Wily fans on Twitter first spotted the mistake, as social media user @euro_bruno drew up a table showing how the points should have been allocated (see top 10 in the table) and how they were in reality (see bottom 10) Criticism: Madonna left fans disappointed on Saturday night with her poor performance of 1989 hit Like a Prayer at the 64th Eurovision Song Contest, which saw Holland triumph at the competition, held at the Tel Aviv Fairgrounds in Israel All five members of the Belarus jury flagrantly disobeyed the competition's rules as they openly discussed who they had voted for in the semi-final on May 16, before the grand final had taken place. The members were Anastasiya Tikhanovich, Anzhela Mikulskaya, Artsem Mikhalenka, Olga Rizhikova and Valeriy Prigun. All of them openly discussed who their favourite entries were ahead of the final on Saturday - which is strictly against Eurovision Song Contest rules. Michael Rice (pictured on stage in Tel Aviv, Israel, last night) performed the song 'Bigger Than Us' as he represented Great Britain and finished in last place Duncan Laurence of the Netherlands performs the song 'Arcade' during the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest grand final in Tel Aviv A Eurovision Song Contest spokesman said: 'The Belarussian jury voting was revealed in an interview contravening Eurovision Song Contest rules. 'In order to be compliant with the voting regulations, the European Broadcasting Union took action and dismissed the Belarussian jury from the Grand Final on Saturday. 'An aggregated result approved by the auditors was used in order to determine to whom the Belarussian votes would be allocated.' The final had already been dogged with criticism as fans expressed disappointment over the highly anticipated performance from Madonna. During her appearance, two of the Queen of Pop's dancers embraced while displaying Israeli and Palestinian flags on their backs. Iceland's contestants, Hatari, also flew the Palestinian flag as they sat backstage awaiting to hear the results of the competition.

An error in counting resulted from a mistake in the allocation of points from Belarus (pictured, right, their entree, Zena) Duncan Laurence, 25, of the Netherlands reacts after winning the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Saturday, when Britain finished last For the final, competition bosses pooled previous Belarussian votes with those of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia and Georgia to give an aggregate score to award finalists. The scores were supposed to be spread among the countries that were running in the top 10, but the EBU mistakenly dished them out to the bottom 10, with Rice gaining five points belonging to Azerbaijan. What are the corrected Eurovision results? 1. Netherlands (498 points) 2. Italy (472 points) 3. Russia (370 points) 4. Switzerland (364 points) 5. Sweden (334 points) 6. Norway (331 points) 7. North Macedonia (305 points) 8. Azerbaijan (302 points) 9. Australia (284 points) 10. Iceland (232 points) 11. Czech Republic (157 points) 12. Denmark (120 points) 13. Cyprus (109 points) 14. Malta (107 points) 15. Slovenia (105 points) 16. France (105 points) 17. Albania (90 points) 18. Serbia (89 points) 19. San Marino (77 points) 20. Estonia (76 points) 21. Greece (74 points) 22. Spain (54 points) 23. Israel (35 points) 24. Belarus (31 points) 25. Germany (24 points) 26. United Kingdom (11 points) Advertisement Though the top four remain unchanged by the correction, winner Duncan Laurence’s song Arcade gained six points for the Netherlands after the error was rectified. Norway had points deducted and dropped to sixth from fifth. Yesterday's revelation came after fans claimed online that Hartlepool-born Rice should have received an even lower score. Wily Twitter users theorised that Belarus's points were incorrectly allocated to the bottom 10 songs rather than the top 10. Professor Adrian Kavanagh, of Maynooth University in Ireland, said: 'I think this is more a case of "you had just one job" rather than a scandal. Just an absolute mess up.' According to the Eurovision website semi-finalists get allocated into six pots, based on historical voting patterns as calculated by the contest's official televoting partner Digame. They say: 'Drawing from different pots helps to reduce the chance of so-called neighbourly voting and increases suspense in the semi-finals.' Belarus was in the same 'pot' as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Russia but the points Belarus gave were in the exact opposite order to the rest of the pot's rankings. The other four nations put Malta at the top, but Belarus gave it zero points. Belarus also gave Israel the maximum of 12 points, despite the other four placing it bottom. Dr Kavanagh believes the UK's low score was the result of a perceived lack of effort, rather than politics, after Rice suggested that he was being punished for Brexit. He said: 'I don’t think the poor UK jury results in past years are a reflection on Brexit, more a reflection that other countries don’t think that the UK cares or tries at Eurovision. 'When the UK has made a concerted effort at Eurovision, they’ve done OK with the juries, even in the Brexit era – Lucie Jones finished 10th in the Eurovision Final Jury Vote in 2017 (despite this being in the wake of the Brexit vote) on the basis that the UK had done a really great job that year in terms of the selection and staging of their entry.' On the topic of Ireland's jury giving the UK zero points Dr Kavanagh said: 'While Ireland's jury gave no points to the UK in the Final (the UK jury likewise gave no points to Ireland in the semi final), it was not unusual in doing so - only six juries awarded the UK points (and most of these only awarded 1 or 2 points).' Wily fans on Twitter first spotted the mistake, as social media user @euro_bruno drew up a table showing how the points should have been allocated (see top 10 in the table) and how they were in reality (see bottom 10) Criticism: Madonna left fans disappointed on Saturday night with her poor performance of 1989 hit Like a Prayer at the 64th Eurovision Song Contest, which saw Holland triumph at the competition, held at the Tel Aviv Fairgrounds in Israel All five members of the Belarus jury flagrantly disobeyed the competition's rules as they openly discussed who they had voted for in the semi-final on May 16, before the grand final had taken place. The members were Anastasiya Tikhanovich, Anzhela Mikulskaya, Artsem Mikhalenka, Olga Rizhikova and Valeriy Prigun. All of them openly discussed who their favourite entries were ahead of the final on Saturday - which is strictly against Eurovision Song Contest rules. Michael Rice (pictured on stage in Tel Aviv, Israel, last night) performed the song 'Bigger Than Us' as he represented Great Britain and finished in last place Duncan Laurence of the Netherlands performs the song 'Arcade' during the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest grand final in Tel Aviv A Eurovision Song Contest spokesman said: 'The Belarussian jury voting was revealed in an interview contravening Eurovision Song Contest rules. 'In order to be compliant with the voting regulations, the European Broadcasting Union took action and dismissed the Belarussian jury from the Grand Final on Saturday. 'An aggregated result approved by the auditors was used in order to determine to whom the Belarussian votes would be allocated.' The final had already been dogged with criticism as fans expressed disappointment over the highly anticipated performance from Madonna. During her appearance, two of the Queen of Pop's dancers embraced while displaying Israeli and Palestinian flags on their backs. Iceland's contestants, Hatari, also flew the Palestinian flag as they sat backstage awaiting to hear the results of the competition.

The German anti-Semitism commissioner Felix Klein has warned members of the German Jewish community to not wear their Kippas everywhere in public, as anti-Semitic crimes are on the increase across Germany. The kippa, also known as the Yarmulke, is a traditional cap worn by some Jewish men to honor God. They are often worn in Jewish synagogues and other places of worship to show respect to the tenets of Judaism. Official recent government figures show that a total of 1,799 hate crimes were committed against Jews in Germany in 2018, an increase of almost 20% over the previous year. German Justice Minister Katarina Barley told the business newspaper Handelsblatt that the increase of anti-Semitic crimes were "shameful for our country." "We need to be careful and vigilant in light of the rise of anti-Semitic crimes," German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said. Israel President Reuven Rivlin said Klein's warning for German Jews not to wear the Kippa in public was "an admittance that once, again, Jews are not safe on German soil." The problem has because particularly troublesome in German schools. In 2017, anti-Semitic bullying from students of Arab and Turkish descent forced a Jewish student to leave from a school in Berlin. The rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party and nationalist movements has also been behind the rise of anti-Semitic attacks.

News article:
Just days after Germany’s anti-Semitism czar said that Jews would be ill-advised to wear kipot in public in some parts of the country, one of the nation’s leading dailies printed a “do-it-yourself kipah” cutout on its front page on Monday as an act of solidarity with the Jewish community. Ahead of the publication, which occupied about a quarter of the front page, Bild editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt wrote: “If only one person in our country cannot wear [a] kippah without endangering himself, the answer can only be that we all wear a kippah. The kippah belongs to Germany!” In an open letter printed next to the cutout, Reichelt called on Germans to embrace their Jewish compatriots. The paper’s online site also included a video of how to cut out the paper kipah. The gesture came in reaction to German anti-Semitism commissioner Felix Klein’s interview on Saturday, in which he warned that it was probably too risky to wear a kipah in public in the country. “My opinion has unfortunately changed compared with what it used to be on the matter,” said Klein. “I cannot recommend to Jews that they wear the skullcap at all times everywhere in Germany.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories He did not elaborate on when and where he thought doing so might be risky. The remark has drawn mixed reactions in Germany and in Israel. Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin said on Sunday that he was “shocked” by the statement. This article first appeared in Israel Hayom.

The event is often accompanied by a range of anti-Israeli rallies. Earlier, in an interview on 25 May, the commissioner had sparked indignation by saying he “cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere, all the time in Germany” due to spiralling anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish attacks in the country.

News article:
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has said German society must oppose anti-Semitism on a daily basis. His remarks came a day before a planned Quds Day march in Berlin protesting against Israel. Amid a public debate of Jews in Germany wearing yarmulkes in public, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Friday that anti-Semitism in Germany "is an attack on all of us." "We cannot accept it if Jews don't dare to wear kippas in our streets," Steinmeier said. "It is our civic duty to fight anti-Semitism in all forms. And it is the exceptional duty of the state to protect our fellow Jewish citizens and to step in when necessary — also and even during demonstrations and public events. "Anti-Semitism is always an attack on all of us, on our democracy and our open society," he added "An active civil society must oppose this on a daily basis. Only when Jews are completely at home in Germany is this country completely at home." Read more: Jews in Europe alarmed by rising anti-Semitism Al Quds day protest The remarks were part of a conversation between the German president and Josef Schuster, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, according to a press release circulated by the president's office. Schuster has called on Germany to ban the Al-Quds march in Berlin, an anti-Israel demonstration on Saturday. According to police, about 2,000 people have registered to take part in the protest. Al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem and means "the holy." Al-Quds day was proclaimed in 1979 and marks the occupation of East Jerusalem by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967.

The comments drew criticism from the Jewish community, with some saying it was his job to make sure Jews could wear kippas everywhere in Germany. Ahead of Saturday's Al-Quds march, Klein said all Germans should wear kippahs as a sign of solidarity and a counter-protest to the Quds demonstration. Read more: Poland and Israel at odds over Holocaust restitution In an interview with DW on Friday, Klein said both statements were meant to be provocative and start a conversation about anti-Semitism in Germany. "We have to show as citizens that we do not accept anti-Semitism and that it has no place in Germany," he told DW. "Many people in Germany and in Europe think that the kippa comes from somewhere else — it's not adherent to our culture. That's not true. The kippa always belonged to Germany and to Europe. It is part of the Jewish culture and Jewish culture is part of German culture," Klein added. In regards to Saturday's Al-Quds march, Klein said: "It's absolutely unacceptable that, in 2019, we hear anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish slogans in Germany. I think we should all stand up against that. We should unite as German society, saying we do not accept any form of anti-Semitism here." dv/sms (dpa, epd, KNA) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out against anti-Semitism in Germany, and said that police have to guard every synagogue, Jewish school and daycare center in her country. “We have always had a certain number of anti-Semites among us,” Merkel told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview aired on Tuesday. “Unfortunately, there is to this day not a single synagogue, not a single day care center for Jewish children, not a single school for Jewish children that does not need to be guarded by German policemen.” Merkel stressed a need to learn from her country’s troubled past. “We have to tell our young people what history has brought us and others and these horrors, why we are for democracy...why we stand up against intolerance.” Anti-Semitism is certainly on the rise in Germany. 2018 saw a near 20 percent rise in hate crimes against Jews and a near doubling of physical attacks compared to 2017, according to Interior Ministry figures. Meanwhile, the German government’s anti-Semitism commissioner Felix Klein told local media over the weekend that he “can’t recommend Jews to wear kippahs anywhere at any time in Germany,” earning him a rebuke from Israeli President Reuven Rivlin for “capitulation to anti-Semitism.” We acknowledge and appreciate moral position of the government of #Germany and its commitment to the #Jewish community that lives there, but fears about the security of German Jews are a capitulation to #AntiSemitism and an admittance that, again, Jews are not safe on German soil — Reuven Rivlin (@PresidentRuvi) May 26, 2019 Amanpour questioned Merkel on anti-Semitism in the context of the surge in popular support for nationalist parties like the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). AfD finished in third place behind Merkel’s centrist coalition and the Green party in last weekend’s European Parliament elections. After several years of missing the threshold to enter Germany’s parliament, AfD finally won 94 seats in the Bundestag in 2017, riding a wave of popular anger at Merkel’s 2015 decision to let more than a million migrants enter Germany. The party has been accused of harboring racists and anti-Semites, but some accuse the new arrivals to Germany of bringing religious hatred of their own. From the Syrian migrant who beat a Jewish man with a belt in Berlin while shouting “Jew” in Arabic, to the group of suspected migrants who threw a firecracker at an Israeli journalist, to the mob who left a Syrian-Jewish boy with a head wound following a savage beating, a string of attacks began to build up a picture. Also on rt.com Beatings, harassment & bullying: Germany’s anti-Semitic hate crimes soar by 10% In a feature article titled ‘The New German Anti-Semitism’ last week, the New York Times describes a Germany in which Jewish parents encourage their children to keep their ethnicity to themselves at school, to avoid bullying from “Muslim students...who use the word ‘Jew’ as an insult.” In her CNN interview, Merkel suggested that anti-Semitism in Germany remains connected to the country’s Nazi past. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer also attributes the bulk of last year’s attacks to right-wing extremists. Anti-Semitism in Europe has traditionally been the preserve of the fringe right and fringe left. However, German Jewish community leaders have increasingly warned that Middle Eastern migrants are a new source of hatred. Last November, a group of these leaders requested that migrants be required to attend integration classes to combat the prevalence of anti-Semitic attitudes. With anti-Semitism coming from both new and traditional sources, Jews are increasingly feeling pressured to leave Germany. An EU-wide survey last year found that in 13 countries surveyed, Jews in Germany, France, and Belgium were most likely to consider emigrating to Israel. Think your friends would be interested?

News article:
(JNS)—Who could really be surprised by the story that grabbed the attention of the Jewish world this past weekend? When Felix Klein, Germany’s first Commissioner for Jewish Life in Germany and the Fight Against Anti-Semitism (yes, that’s his full title) warned Jews about the danger of wearing a kipah in public, it was hardly a shock that this would be the case in the country responsible for the Holocaust. Yet the alarming frankness of his admission has made it impossible to ignore the truth about the threat to Jews in Europe any longer. Some of the anger that Klein’s comment generated was directed at both him and the German government. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin was offended by the recommendation, viewing it as a form of “surrender” to the forces of hate. It’s easy to applaud Rivlin’s defiant response, which sums up the spirit of Zionism: “We will never submit, will never lower our gaze and will never react to anti-Semitism with defeatism—and expect and demand our allies act in the same way.” But perhaps Klein deserves some credit for telling the truth. Germany is far from the only European nation where Jews face routine violence in the streets. In the United States, we know that anti-Semitism comes from both the far right and the intersectional left. But many partisans prefer only to focus on the hate that can be blamed, whether fairly or not, on their political opponents and to turn a blind eye to that which can be linked to their allies. In Europe, threats to the Jewish population come from both from haters on the far right, as well as from the growing population of immigrants from Muslim nations. But too much of the commentary about this situation seems to be influenced by worries about the rise of right-wing nationalist parties, coupled with a refusal to confront the truth about Muslim hatred of Jews and Israel. Anti-Semitism from the some of its traditional sources on the right is fueling hostility to Jews. In Germany, that takes the form of resentment against its “culture of remembrance” of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, not only have that culture failed to eradicate the lingering impact of 2,000 years of anti-Semitic incitement; it has also resulted in widespread resentment at the Jews. All too many Germans don’t seem able to forgive the Jews for reminding them of their grandparents’ guilt. But that isn’t the only factor contributing to anti-Semitism. As it has in many other European countries, the recent massive influx of immigrants from Muslim and Arab countries has created a vast new constituency. There is a long tradition of contempt for Jews in Islamic culture that has only been exacerbated by their resentment about the creation of modern-day Israel. Muslim expressions of hatred for Israel and Jews are now indistinguishable from traditional European anti-Semitic invective. This has created a bizarre alliance between Muslims and leftist academics, in addition to other elites who engage in similar delegitimization of Israel, Zionism and Jews. However, much is being made of an official German government statistic that shows that most violent attacks on Jews come from right-wingers, rather than Muslims. However, as a New York Times Magazine report about German anti-Semitism published the week before Klein’s controversial comments, that statistic has been disputed by German Jewish leaders and is now largely discredited. German authorities routinely ascribe any attack for which they can’t or won’t assign a direct motive as the work of right-wing anti-Semites, whether there is any proof of their involvement or not. Polls of German Jews also show that a plurality of those who have experienced anti-Semitism say the person(s) responsible were Muslim extremists. Nevertheless, most Jews think that making alliances with right-wing Europeans who believe that the impact of Muslim immigration is eroding the national characters of their countries is inherently dangerous. Many of those involved in these parties have, at best, problematic histories when it comes to anti-Semitism. It’s hard for Jews to trust populist movements, whether in Germany, France or anywhere else in Europe, even when they now proclaim their support for Israel or a wish to defend Jewish communities. Those who are willing to engage in hate speech about Muslims are probably also likely to do so about Jews. It is axiomatic that Jewish security in any country is tied to the way all minorities are treated. But those who want to minimize one source of anti-Semitism—whether from the traditional right, the left or from Muslims—in order to focus on another threat that they feel more comfortable denouncing are doing Jews who are at risk no favor. At this juncture, the question of who the Jews should call their allies isn’t that significant. What is important is to realize that the sickness that once destroyed European Jewry has not only been revived, but that this virus has morphed into a new variant in which Israel has become the stand-in for traditional Jewish stereotypes and the excuse for a new wave of hate against all Jews. We must defend the right of Jews to live anywhere they want and to express their identity in the public squares of European nations. But if after 74 years since the fall of the Nazi regime the growing Jewish community in Germany is no longer safe to walk the streets, then it’s no use pretending that attitudes that are the product of age-old hatreds exacerbated by contemporary political incitement can be ameliorated by standard community-relations tactics. We should applaud those Germans who will now symbolically don kipot for a day or two in order to express their solidarity with the Jews. But the problem isn’t merely a matter of head coverings or educational programs focused on hate that have already clearly failed. It’s foolish to think that it’s possible to separate the routine delegitimization of Israel from the way Jews are treated. What’s happening in Europe is proving again that wherever anti-Zionism is legitimized, anti-Semitism grows and anti-Jewish violence follows. Jonathan S.

News article:
The Israel lobby is already on it, the Strategic Affairs Ministry is preparing a brief, the embassy in Berlin is disseminating it – a new bill to be brought before the Bundestag, the law of kowtowing. According to the bill, anyone saying the name Israel will have to incline his head and bow while uttering the explicit name. No mention of Israel without bowing, that’s the lesson to be drawn from the Holocaust. Violating the law will be deemed an anti-Semitic act. Mentioning Israel without prostration will be a criminal offense. Politicians, broadcasters and run-of-the-mill citizens will practice making the gestures. Just like in Thailand, where anytime the king enters everyone genuflects, so will it be when Israel is mentioned. Isn’t the country deserving of this gesture? Is there a more just response to anti-Semitism? Following Germany will be other countries, including many states in the U.S. Just imagine what a huge success for Israeli diplomacy. >> Mossad involved in anti-boycott activity, Israeli minister's datebooks reveal We’re not that far from this scenario. If the German government adopts the Bundestag resolution, which determined that the boycott movement against Israel is anti-Semitic, we’re there. The boycott, divestment and sanction movement will be outlawed, or at least prohibited from operating in public. On Tuesday, Noa Landau reported in Haaretz that Israel is employing its propaganda machinery to exert pressure on the German government to adopt this decision. It’s bound to yield, just like Germany’s parliament did when it adopted this delusional resolution. A non-violent struggle against war crimes will be declared illegal. The oppressor will be declared a victim. Freedom of expression will become a joke. There is nothing to equal this in any democracy. Just before Israel’s ambassador to Berlin, Jeremy Issacharoff – who called it “shameful” when Jewish intellectuals signed a petition against the bill – pops the cork and reports another of his achievements to Jerusalem, we must ask: Is this really a successful move? For Israel? For Jews? Will such aggressive and rapacious conduct not blow up in Israel’s face? Will these imaginary achievements, attained by not-quite legitimate means, based mainly on the emotional blackmailing of Germany and the rest of the world, using various organizations, some covertly, exerting various forms of pressure, not exact a price from Israel, which has been standing behind this indecent campaign? Israel has invented a scarecrow enemy for itself, one called Adolf BDS, and decided to wage war on it. The Palestinians have been beaten, the Arab states are busy with their own affairs, Iran is no longer enough of an existential threat, so Israel urgently needed another one. The boycott movement formed by Omar Barghouti fell like a ripe fruit into the lap of a few Israeli politicians and diplomats. Suddenly, Gilad Erdan is not just a public security minister dealing with demolishing the Bedouin village of Umm al-Hiran and with traffic violations; now he’s a strategic minister, with a hush-hush organization that’s inflated with self-importance, with huge budgets, a military style director-general and meetings with the Mossad chief. He couldn’t have wanted any more than this. Branding BDS as anti-Semitic, like any criticism of Israel, has turned out to be the most effective strategy of all. Fighting anti-Semitism solves any problems associated with explaining Israel’s actions. Just say “anti-Semitism” and the world is paralyzed. One can kill children in Gaza, then say “anti-Semitism!” and squelch any criticism. Europe is still vulnerable on this. Exploit it to the hilt. It’s hard to believe that the hundreds of Bundestag members who voted for this resolution, which defines a completely legitimate struggle as anti-Semitic, actually agreed with it. One may assume that deep inside, many harbor doubts if not opposition to a move that was imposed on them. It’s not only in Germany. In most European countries it’s difficult to criticize Israel without being accused of anti-Semitism. This is the biggest victory achieved by Israel’s propaganda machine. It could lead to its defeat one day. When it becomes too much to swallow, there will be courage to oppose it and not accept this fallacious equation. When the kowtowing law is passed and Germans have to genuflect in front of Israel and not just dance to its tune, perhaps some people will be there to stop this march of folly.

News article:
Berlin – The Berlin Jewish Museum, in the center of Germany’s capital, catches the eye with a zinc-plated, jagged facade that invokes a shattered Star of David. Now it is drawing attention for another reason: Its director, Judaic scholar Peter Schafer, stepped down last week – a year earlier than planned – after a tweet went badly wrong. The staff person who sent the tweet was summarily fired. But the tweet, which made it seem as if the museum was sympathetic to the anti-Israel boycott movement, or BDS, was merely the last straw in years of contention over the institution’s role and image. Critics in particular alleged it lacked neutrality on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This may be a case of an institution that got too far ahead of its stakeholders or, as critics charged, too far to the left of the communal consensus on Israel. Others see a museum trying to balance traditional roles with new demands for relevance. “Societies want museums to be more interesting, more involved and more vulnerable; we cannot avoid it,” Emile Schrijver, chair of the Amsterdam-based Association of European Jewish Museums, said in a telephone interview. The 30-year-old association has more than 60 members. Museums today play a democratizing role, said Daniela Eisenstein, director of the Jewish Museum of Franconia, in the German state of Bavaria. They “are important spaces of public debate,” where “all aspects of a topic may be openly and publicly discussed.” Are there any boundaries? An answer was provided by Schafer himself in an interview he gave to Spiegel magazine before he quit. “The Jewish Museum Berlin sees itself as a forum for discussions and conversations about socially relevant questions,” he said. “We want to offer ourselves, we want to moderate.” But, he added, “Our task is not to spread our own political opinions on these questions. … And in this case, it has gone very badly wrong.” Since it opened officially on Sept. 11, 2001, with a mandate to present nearly 2,000 years of Jewish history in Germany, the Berlin museum has developed a distinctive personality. Like the angular building designed by Daniel Libeskind, the museum tries to be edgy. It has been wildly popular, drawing more than 600,000 visitors per year. One of its best-known successes was its 2013 exhibit, “The Whole Truth,” which journalists nicknamed “Jew in a box” and featured a transparent in which special guests sat and answered visitors’ questions. A 2014 exhibition, “Snip It!” delved into circumcision and efforts in Germany and elsewhere to ban the practice. But the museum has come under fire — in 2011 for hosting anti-Zionist scholar Judith Butler for a talk on “tensions a globalized world creates for national identities”; mounting an exhibit about Jerusalem that some said favored a Palestinian narrative; and recently for welcoming an Iranian delegation to discuss a possible exhibit on Iranian Jewish culture. “It was stupid of me to receive them,” Schafer, who turns 76 later this month, told Spiegel last week. Though he hadn’t wanted to give the Iranians “a forum for political tirades,” that is what happened. “One cannot receive a delegation from Iran without being associated with the mullah regime and being instrumentalized by them,” Sigmount Koenigsberg, the commissioner on anti-Semitism for Berlin’s Jewish community, said in a telephone interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “The directorship of the Jewish museum had no antenna.” Then came the tweet. On June 6, the museum Twitter account shared an article from the left-wing daily newspaper Taz about opposition to a May 17 Bundestag resolution branding the BDS movement as anti-Semitic. The museum declared it a “must read.” The tweet also repeated a line from the article without using quote marks: “The decision by parliamentarians does not help in the fight against anti-Semitism.” That line “could have been read” as the museum’s opinion, Schafer acknowledged to Spiegel before stepping down to prevent further damage. Supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement — or even questioning efforts to fight it — has become taboo on the Jewish right and center. Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called the tweet “the last straw” and wondered whether the museum should even have the word “Jewish” in its name. The museum’s connection with official Jewish institutions appears thin. Some observers have pointed out that the museum is not even closed on most Jewish holidays and has a nonkosher restaurant. Following Schafer’s departure, Schuster commented to Taz that the museum needs more Jewish involvement – either in the person of a new director or some other manner. But Schrijver, the museum association’s chair, said Jewish museums are neither Jewish nor are they for (and by) Jews alone. He said they get public and private funding, input from Jews and non-Jews, and come in all shapes and sizes, from those with only a few thousand visitors per year to “large institutions where it is only natural that a tweet can get sent out without the director knowing about it.” Intentions are important, too, said Eisenstein of the Jewish Museum of Franconia. The “tweeted link was sent as a recommended read and not meant as a political statement,” she said. The role of European Jewish museums today has evolved far from what it was in the immediate postwar decades. The first ones to open were mainly reincarnations of prewar institutions created to preserve the memory of a Jewish world that was already disappearing before the war, explains Schrijver, who is also the director of Amsterdam’s Jewish Historical Museum and Jewish Cultural Quarter. The 1970s brought a sea change in Holocaust awareness, which led to the creation of Holocaust museums, many of them publicly funded. “There is pressure on European Jewish museums to be inclusive,” said Schrijver, who has faced questions “such as ‘why do you only deal with the Holocaust when there are also other genocides, what about today’s refugees who are in trouble too,’ etc. We will always have to deal with some sort of societal pressure, and that is not a negative issue, it is just a fact. I don’t mind; that is why we are there.” But “I am not interested in sharing my views on the State of Israel with the public,” he added. “People should [rather] speak about my programming with me.” It’s not just Jewish museums wrestling with questions of mission. In September, in Kyoto, Japan, the International Council of Museums will propose a new definition of the museum’s role at its General Conference. That role includes confrontation with today’s “global concerns and conflicts over climate change and the destruction of nature, over displacement and migration, over wars, inequality and de-colonisation,” as the council says on its website. The Berlin Jewish Museum has been a forerunner. “They have done a lot of good things, for example in the circumcision exhibition: It was both funny and historical,” Green Party politician Volker Beck said in a phone interview. But, he added, “I would say this museum has an orientation problem … a very negative attitude toward Israel.” The issue is not that the museum grapples with controversial subjects. Rather, Beck said, it is that “they give support to anti-Israeli attitudes.” Criticism has come from politicians, journalists — even from the Israeli government, which last year called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to withdraw funding from the Berlin museum and other institutions. Such tensions could have been prevented, lamented Koenigsberg, who has offered to talk with museum administration in the past. ”Somehow,” he said, “they are in their own bubble.”

News article:
Berlin – The Berlin Jewish Museum, in the center of Germany’s capital, catches the eye with a zinc-plated, jagged facade that invokes a shattered Star of David. Now it is drawing attention for another reason: Its director, Judaic scholar Peter Schafer, stepped down last week – a year earlier than planned – after a tweet went badly wrong. The staff person who sent the tweet was summarily fired. But the tweet, which made it seem as if the museum was sympathetic to the anti-Israel boycott movement, or BDS, was merely the last straw in years of contention over the institution’s role and image. Critics in particular alleged it lacked neutrality on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This may be a case of an institution that got too far ahead of its stakeholders or, as critics charged, too far to the left of the communal consensus on Israel. Others see a museum trying to balance traditional roles with new demands for relevance. “Societies want museums to be more interesting, more involved and more vulnerable; we cannot avoid it,” Emile Schrijver, chair of the Amsterdam-based Association of European Jewish Museums, said in a telephone interview. The 30-year-old association has more than 60 members. Museums today play a democratizing role, said Daniela Eisenstein, director of the Jewish Museum of Franconia, in the German state of Bavaria. They “are important spaces of public debate,” where “all aspects of a topic may be openly and publicly discussed.” Are there any boundaries? An answer was provided by Schafer himself in an interview he gave to Spiegel magazine before he quit. “The Jewish Museum Berlin sees itself as a forum for discussions and conversations about socially relevant questions,” he said. “We want to offer ourselves, we want to moderate.” But, he added, “Our task is not to spread our own political opinions on these questions. … And in this case, it has gone very badly wrong.” Since it opened officially on Sept. 11, 2001, with a mandate to present nearly 2,000 years of Jewish history in Germany, the Berlin museum has developed a distinctive personality. Like the angular building designed by Daniel Libeskind, the museum tries to be edgy. It has been wildly popular, drawing more than 600,000 visitors per year. One of its best-known successes was its 2013 exhibit, “The Whole Truth,” which journalists nicknamed “Jew in a box” and featured a transparent in which special guests sat and answered visitors’ questions. A 2014 exhibition, “Snip It!” delved into circumcision and efforts in Germany and elsewhere to ban the practice. But the museum has come under fire — in 2011 for hosting anti-Zionist scholar Judith Butler for a talk on “tensions a globalized world creates for national identities”; mounting an exhibit about Jerusalem that some said favored a Palestinian narrative; and recently for welcoming an Iranian delegation to discuss a possible exhibit on Iranian Jewish culture. “It was stupid of me to receive them,” Schafer, who turns 76 later this month, told Spiegel last week. Though he hadn’t wanted to give the Iranians “a forum for political tirades,” that is what happened. “One cannot receive a delegation from Iran without being associated with the mullah regime and being instrumentalized by them,” Sigmount Koenigsberg, the commissioner on anti-Semitism for Berlin’s Jewish community, said in a telephone interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “The directorship of the Jewish museum had no antenna.” Then came the tweet. On June 6, the museum Twitter account shared an article from the left-wing daily newspaper Taz about opposition to a May 17 Bundestag resolution branding the BDS movement as anti-Semitic. The museum declared it a “must read.” The tweet also repeated a line from the article without using quote marks: “The decision by parliamentarians does not help in the fight against anti-Semitism.” That line “could have been read” as the museum’s opinion, Schafer acknowledged to Spiegel before stepping down to prevent further damage. Supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement — or even questioning efforts to fight it — has become taboo on the Jewish right and center. Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called the tweet “the last straw” and wondered whether the museum should even have the word “Jewish” in its name. The museum’s connection with official Jewish institutions appears thin. Some observers have pointed out that the museum is not even closed on most Jewish holidays and has a nonkosher restaurant. Following Schafer’s departure, Schuster commented to Taz that the museum needs more Jewish involvement – either in the person of a new director or some other manner. But Schrijver, the museum association’s chair, said Jewish museums are neither Jewish nor are they for (and by) Jews alone. He said they get public and private funding, input from Jews and non-Jews, and come in all shapes and sizes, from those with only a few thousand visitors per year to “large institutions where it is only natural that a tweet can get sent out without the director knowing about it.” Intentions are important, too, said Eisenstein of the Jewish Museum of Franconia. The “tweeted link was sent as a recommended read and not meant as a political statement,” she said. The role of European Jewish museums today has evolved far from what it was in the immediate postwar decades. The first ones to open were mainly reincarnations of prewar institutions created to preserve the memory of a Jewish world that was already disappearing before the war, explains Schrijver, who is also the director of Amsterdam’s Jewish Historical Museum and Jewish Cultural Quarter.

News article:
This week’s meeting in Cairo between President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi and the chief of Sudan’s military council Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan could mark the beginning of wide-ranging cooperation between Cairo and Khartoum, says a senior Egyptian official. Saturday’s meeting is Al-Burhan’s first overseas trip. “Egypt’s relations with Sudan have gone through many ups and downs in the last 30 years. Now there is a feeling we might be seeing the beginning of solid relations on all fronts,” says the official. Government sources say this is not about the ascent of the military to power in Sudan — Omar Al-Bashir, they point out, was also a soldier — but about the determination to avoid a political vacuum in a country of direct national security interest to Egypt. An Egyptian source told Al-Ahram Weekly that “Cairo fears that political chaos would lead to a security chaos in Sudan.” The fact that the ruling military council is nearly in full control of Khartoum and Om Durman and its suburbs and not the rest of the country is pushing the major Arab governments for more support of the transitional ruling council. Following Al-Bashir’s assumption of power in the late 1980s relations between Egypt and Sudan were characterised more by squabbles than cooperation. In 1995 Cairo openly accused Khartoum of involvement in an attempt on the life of then president Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa after he arrived to take part in a summit of African leaders. The tensions never really cleared, even when Cairo showed solidarity with Al-Bashir during the last months of his rule. “Al-Bashir was always playing games, trying to ply one side against the other. Everybody knew this,” says Haitham Mekkawi, a member of Sudan’s Alliance of Freedom and Change. Speaking from Khartoum, Mekkawi argued undoing the damage Al-Bashir inflicted on the country’s foreign policy is an urgent issue for post-Bashir Sudan. “This is something that has to be done by the military and civilian political leaders and Egypt is clearly a priority given our historic ties and proximity.” According to the Cairo official, it is too early to predict the path of future relations but the overall picture seems promising. “The focus [of talks between Al-Sisi and Al-Burhan] was obviously on developments in Sudan but bilateral relations were also discussed,” the official added, and “joint security interests” would have topped the bilateral agenda. Since the days of Mubarak Cairo has been demanding Sudan stop offering refuge to militant Islamists, calls that expanded under Al-Sisi to include leading figures from the Muslim Brotherhood.Al-Burhan made no final promises, says the official, but was clearly committed to working with Egypt on security matters. Egypt and Sudan have a number of longstanding disagreements beyond security. There is Khartoum’s support for Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam, though in the last months of his rule Al-Bashir seemed to be readying for a U-turn on the issue. According to Cairo-based Western diplomats, during top level meetings between Egyptian officials and representatives from influential Western capitals Cairo continues to solicit support for its position on the dam. An official Sudanese source with knowledge of the decision-making process in Khartoum said this week that the initial willingness of Al-Burhan and his second in command, Hamdan Daglo, to pursue an alliance with the Cairo-Abu Dhabi-Riyadh axis suggests the future trajectory of Khartoum’s relations. Following his one-day visit to Cairo, Al-Burhan headed straight to meet Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed in Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, Daglo had already been to Riyadh to meet with Mohamed bin Salman. A Cairo-based European diplomat who follows Sudan closely says the overall message Khartoum is conveying is a willingness on the part of the “new military leaders of Sudan to pursue an alliance with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Turkey and Qatar, Al-Bashir’s traditional allies during the last decade”. It is noteworthy, says the diplomat, “that both Al-Burhan and Daglo already have established contacts with leaders in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE where they have a history of serving or else overseeing joint military cooperation.” Mekkawi argues “relations with Egypt inevitably constitute a different story to those with other Arab countries, even with Saudi Arabia and the UAE whose aim is to win Sudan to their side and undercut the heritage of Al-Bashir’s ties not just with Qatar and Turkey but also with Iran.” Like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Egypt is also keen to ensure the cooperation of Sudan over Red Sea security. During the last few years of Al-Bashir, Cairo had grown increasingly concerned about Khartoum’s willingness to allow Ankara and Doha access to the Red Sea. According to the Cairo official, furthering cooperation over Red Sea security was raised during Al-Burhan’s visit to Cairo. Then there is the longstanding dispute over Halayeb and Shalatin, the triangle of land on the Egyptian and Sudanese border that both countries claim. It was not, says the official, on the agenda of the Cairo talks between Al-Sisi and Al-Burhan. “We are working on consolidating relations not on disagreeing,” he said. “Sudan is going through a hard time and we want to make sure it regains stability.” To secure truly positive prospects for Egypt-Sudan relations, argues Mekkawi, it is important that Cairo takes into account the views of Sudan’s revolutionary leaders as well as its military council. “We understand that Egypt has followed its own path since the January Revolution and made its own choices. We hope it acknowledges the right of the Sudanese people to do the same.” Mekkawi was speaking on the eve of a general strike that revolutionary leaders had called to force the military council into agreeing to wider participation in managing the transitional phase. The general strike was not backed by some political opposition figures, including former premier Sadek Al-Mahdi who has close ties with Cairo. Speaking on Monday Al-Mahdi said that a general strike “is a weapon that should only be used after it has been agreed on by everybody”. Al-Mahdi returned from Egypt to Sudan days before the beginning of the demonstrations that eventually led to Al-Bashir’s fall and did not immediately join the calls for change. According to the European diplomat who spoke in Cairo, “it is very clear that Egypt’s priority on Sudan is to support the military council and the traditional opposition. But Cairo is also aware that it should not antagonise public opinion in Sudan which is why it is playing its cards very carefully.” Eddie Thomas, an expert on Sudan who has authored several volumes on the country, believes it is too early to make any final judgements on the path Sudan’s foreign policy — be it towards Egypt or any other country — is likely to take. The ouster of Al-Bashir, he says, stripped Sudan of its sole foreign policy-maker. Today leading members of the military council are on the side of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates but there are others on the council who might solicit alternative alliances. It is also significant, Thomas adds, that Sudan’s revolutionary leaders are seeking a different political path to the one that emerged in Egypt following the ouster of Mubarak. The situation is complicated, Thomas argues, by the fact that “the Islamists of Sudan” constitute the ruling class, created under Al-Bashir during the last 30 years. And at the end of the day, says Thomas, the military council is not yet in full control because the people are still on the streets. *A version of this article appears in print in the 30 May, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly under the headline: Seeking southern partners Search Keywords: Short link:

During the last few years of Al-Bashir, Cairo had grown increasingly concerned about Khartoum’s willingness to allow Ankara and Doha access to the Red Sea. According to the Cairo official, furthering cooperation over Red Sea security was raised during Al-Burhan’s visit to Cairo. Then there is the longstanding dispute over Halayeb and Shalatin, the triangle of land on the Egyptian and Sudanese border that both countries claim. It was not, says the official, on the agenda of the Cairo talks between Al-Sisi and Al-Burhan. “We are working on consolidating relations not on disagreeing,” he said. “Sudan is going through a hard time and we want to make sure it regains stability.” To secure truly positive prospects for Egypt-Sudan relations, argues Mekkawi, it is important that Cairo takes into account the views of Sudan’s revolutionary leaders as well as its military council. “We understand that Egypt has followed its own path since the January Revolution and made its own choices. We hope it acknowledges the right of the Sudanese people to do the same.” Mekkawi was speaking on the eve of a general strike that revolutionary leaders had called to force the military council into agreeing to wider participation in managing the transitional phase. The general strike was not backed by some political opposition figures, including former premier Sadek Al-Mahdi who has close ties with Cairo. Speaking on Monday Al-Mahdi said that a general strike “is a weapon that should only be used after it has been agreed on by everybody”. Al-Mahdi returned from Egypt to Sudan days before the beginning of the demonstrations that eventually led to Al-Bashir’s fall and did not immediately join the calls for change. According to the European diplomat who spoke in Cairo, “it is very clear that Egypt’s priority on Sudan is to support the military council and the traditional opposition. But Cairo is also aware that it should not antagonise public opinion in Sudan which is why it is playing its cards very carefully.” Eddie Thomas, an expert on Sudan who has authored several volumes on the country, believes it is too early to make any final judgements on the path Sudan’s foreign policy — be it towards Egypt or any other country — is likely to take. The ouster of Al-Bashir, he says, stripped Sudan of its sole foreign policy-maker. Today leading members of the military council are on the side of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates but there are others on the council who might solicit alternative alliances. It is also significant, Thomas adds, that Sudan’s revolutionary leaders are seeking a different political path to the one that emerged in Egypt following the ouster of Mubarak. The situation is complicated, Thomas argues, by the fact that “the Islamists of Sudan” constitute the ruling class, created under Al-Bashir during the last 30 years. And at the end of the day, says Thomas, the military council is not yet in full control because the people are still on the streets. *A version of this article appears in print in the 30 May, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly under the headline: Seeking southern partners Search Keywords: Short link:

CAIRO - 8 June 2019: President abdel Fatah al-Sisi will receive his Eritrean counterpart President Isaias Afwerki at Al-Ittihadya palace, according to a Saturday statement issued by presidential spokesman Bassam Rady. Erirean President arrived Saturday in Cairo for a two-day visit to the Egyptian capital. Afwerki is expected to meet a number of officials to discuss bilateral relations between the two countries, as well as the latest developments in Africa and issues of mutual concern. In January, the Eritrean President visited Egypt emphasized efforts to strengthen ties between the two countries. Egyptian-Eritrean relations After Eritrea had gained its independence from Ethiopia, following a long civil war on borders, on May 24, 1991, Egypt was among the top countries enhancing political, economic and diplomatic relations with Eritrea. In this regard, Cairo and Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, signed a Friendship and Cooperation Agreement on March 31, 2009, as well as a Protocol of Cooperation between the National Council for Youth in Egypt and National Union of Eritrean Youth and Students (NUEYS) on December 14, 2009. Since the June 30 revolution, which Eritrea has supported at the African Union level, President Afwerki visited Egypt several times; the most recent two visits were in 2014 and 2016 to further enhance the deep relations between the two countries. Delegations from Egypt and Eritrea have met several times over the last few years to intensify the coordination between them in various sectors, including agriculture, fisheries, infrastructure, trade, culture, education and health. The Egyptian delegation of the Agriculture Ministry visited Asmara in 2016 to meet with Eritrean Agriculture Ministry’s general director and head of poultry and research departments to discuss means of fostering bilateral relations in the agricultural field. During the meeting, the Egyptian delegation discussed establishing a joint model farm in Eritrea and signing a memorandum of understanding to bolster relations in research, training, developing crops and poultry fields. Moreover, in April 2017, an Egyptian delegation from the national company for fisheries and aquaculture headed to Eritrea. The delegation was welcomed by Afwerki and his economic adviser to discuss ways to put into effect the protocol on the cooperation in the field of fisheries, signed between the two states in Cairo in March 2017. Egypt and Eritrea also seek to activate the joint committee aiming to boost bilateral cooperation in all fields. It is also worth mentioning that the Egyptian Agency of Partnership for Development (EAPD) provides Eritrea with continuous technical assistance. Moreover, the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education has provided many scholarships to Eritrean students.

(MENAFN- Brazil-Arab News Agency (ANBA)) Isaura Daniel São Paulo – Businessmen on top of big companies and organizations from Brazil and Egypt are willing to work for the expansion of the relations between both countries. This was evident on Thursday (20) during Brazil-Egypt Economic Forum (pictured above), which took place in Cairo, featuring public and private sector representatives from both countries. Some of the representatives included Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) director-general André Pepitone da Nóbrega, Eicon CEO Luiz Alberto Rodrigues, São Paulo former governor Geraldo Alckmin, Eletrobras CEO Wilson Ferreira Junior,Arab Brazilian Chamber of Commercepresident Rubens Hannun and CEO Tamer Mansour, and others. The event was held byGlobal Council of Sales Marketing(GCSM) and Arab Brazilian Chamber. Hannun spoke at forum in Egypt 'Egyptians are very excited and so are Brazilians,' said Hannun about their willingness to work for Brazil-Egypt. This Thursday event was part of a larger schedule of the Brazilian delegation in Cairo, which includes GCSM'sWorld Company Award . An awarding ceremony will occur on Saturday (22). Egyptians authorities and business leaders at the forum left a good impression on Brazilians when they presented the steps Egypt has taken to ease deals and attract foreign companies and investments. Reducing bureaucracy, modernizing sectors, and streamlining how to start companies are some of the measures Egypt has taken and presented at the event. Brazilians also got to know the size of the market Egypt can encompass through their trade agreements with regions such as Africa and Europe. One of the speakers talking about Egypt's advancements was Elsewedy Electrometer Group chairman & CEO Emad Elsewedy, who is also president of the Egyptian side of Brazil-Egypt Business Council. Egypt's deputy minister of Investment and International Cooperation and General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) vice-president Mohamed Abdel Wahab also talked about the subject. Some of the big projects the Arab country has developed or implemented recently include Suez Canal expansion, the building of a new administrative capital and the creation of a new free zone. Alckmin was one of the speakers These ongoing works were mentioned in the speech given by Rubens Hannun, when he talked about the potential that Egypt represtents for Brazil in trade and investments thanks to factors such as its great population, the free trade agreement the country has with Mercosur, and the efforts Egypt has made in renovating infrastructure, creating jobs and boosting economy. 'The country now shows macroeconomic indicators that catch the eye of any investor,' he said. Hannun pointed out that, in 2018, Egypt was one of the main destinations of Brazilian exports in the Arab world, it is one of the largest buyers of Brazil's halal meat, and large Brazilian companies have subsidiaries there. 'We believe that Brazil-Egypt trade partnership should be seen by both governments as strategical. That is why we do everything we can to develop this bilateral relation even more,' he said. He described initiatives held by the Arab Brazilian Chamber to approximate both countries and the Arabs in general, such as the Brazil-Arab Countries Economic Forum in 2018, which received a large Egyptian delegation, and the promotion of Egyptian companies in food trade shows in Brazil. Hannun said that the next edition of Brazil-Arab Countries Economic Forum will be held in April 2020; and that a forum on logistics will be held in Alexandria, Egypt, by the Arab Brazilian Chamber and the Union of Arab Chambers in December. Arab Brazilian Chamber CEO Tamer Mansour gave a lecture presenting the current point of the economic relations between Brazil and Egypt, as well as the obstacles preventing trade to grow even more. According to him, Brazil's exports to Egypt reached USD 2.1 billion in 2018 and grew almost 50% over the last ten years. Egypt's sales to Brazil grew by 207% over a decade, reaching USD 270 million last year. Brazil's exports to Egypt are mainly beef, ore and corn, while Egyptians sell Brazilians fertilizers, olives and cotton. Mansour said that the main trade barriers between Brazil and Egypt are the difficult to access markets because of imports permissions, inspection requirements, as well as certification and package requirements. He suggested measures that could help solve some of these difficulties, including establishing bilateral technical committees, creating technical missions, encouraging a dialogue between regulatory and phytosanitary bodies from both countries, and developing an agenda about the topic on a business council. Event in Cairo brought together important business leaders Other recurring topic in the forum's discussions was energy. It was one of the themes Alckmin addressed. The speeches also talked about the future of Brazil-Egypt relations, the Egyptian role on the African economy, Egypt-Mercosur agreement, the new Brazilian economic geopolitics in the current global moment, and the regional development as a contributing factor for a country's growth. In addition to the lectures, there was a space for talks and networking. Other lectures and speakers included Axway Latin America CEO Marcelo Ramos, Brazil's ambassador to Cairo, Ruy Amaral, Egypt's Ministry of Commerce and Industry Bilateral Trade Agreements director-general Michael Kaddes, TV Cultura president and Spring Group president José Roberto Maluf, Grupo Articon CEO Reinaldo Papaiordanou, Global Forest Bond CEO Eduardo Marson Ferreira, and Brazilian Airforce Economy, Finances and Administration secretary Marcelo Kanitz Damasceno.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has praised Egypt as an "example of stability" in the Middle East thanks to its close ties with the Gulf countries, and reiterated his support for Egypt's efforts to fight militants in the Sinai Peninsula. Talks kicked off on Monday in Moscow between the defence and foreign ministers of both countries, signaling a deepening relationship between the two countries. Egypt and Russia have moved closer together since Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi assumed office in 2014. Exports to Russia have risen, as have arms sales from Moscow to Cairo and strategic cooperation between the countries' militaries. READ: Egypt, UAE send military support to Libya's Haftar Shoigu's comments come less than a month after Human Rights Watch published a report detailing Egypt's operation against Daesh affiliated groups in the province. Many of its tactics and methods amount to war crimes. Egyptian authorities have sought to justify the systematic and widespread arbitrary arrests, the enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions under the pretext that they are fighting terrorism. Both countries are said to support Commander Khalifa Haftar in Libya, who is bombarding the internationally recognised government in Triploli. During his trip to Russia Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri told Russia Today that Egypt and Russia are working together to achieve stability in the Gulf and on Syria. Both countries have called for the preservation of the Syria's national army and eliminating terrorist organisations. In October 2017 jointly brokered a ceasefire in southern Damascus, which gave Egypt a foothold in the country.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has praised Egypt as an "example of stability" in the Middle East thanks to its close ties with the Gulf countries, and reiterated his support for Egypt's efforts to fight militants in the Sinai Peninsula. Talks kicked off on Monday in Moscow between the defence and foreign ministers of both countries, signaling a deepening relationship between the two countries. Egypt and Russia have moved closer together since Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi assumed office in 2014. Exports to Russia have risen, as have arms sales from Moscow to Cairo and strategic cooperation between the countries' militaries. READ: Egypt, UAE send military support to Libya's Haftar Shoigu's comments come less than a month after Human Rights Watch published a report detailing Egypt's operation against Daesh affiliated groups in the province. Many of its tactics and methods amount to war crimes. Egyptian authorities have sought to justify the systematic and widespread arbitrary arrests, the enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions under the pretext that they are fighting terrorism. Both countries are said to support Commander Khalifa Haftar in Libya, who is bombarding the internationally recognised government in Triploli. During his trip to Russia Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri told Russia Today that Egypt and Russia are working together to achieve stability in the Gulf and on Syria. Both countries have called for the preservation of the Syria's national army and eliminating terrorist organisations. In October 2017 jointly brokered a ceasefire in southern Damascus, which gave Egypt a foothold in the country. The Syrian regime has killed thousands of civilians since the start of the war, and often justifies these death as a legitimate fight against terror.

Egypt stresses that it stands in an equidistant position regarding the Sudanese conflict, the country's envoy to Khartoum told a leading member of a key opposition alliance in the country. In an official statement, Egypt's foreign ministry said that its ambassador to Khartoum Hossam Eissa met on Monday with Ibrahim Taha Ayoub, a leading member of the opposition alliance Sudan Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF), where he said that Cairo will not spare any effort to achieve stability and security in Sudan. Eissa expressed Egypt's keenness to communicate with all representatives of the Sudanese people to achieve stability, peace and security in the country, adding that such a goal will only be achieved through sincere efforts exerted by leaders in the country. Ayoub discussed the developments in the ongoing negotiations over an African Union initiative pushed by Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed focused on transferring power to a civilian government in Sudan, as well as the framework for the transitional period. The Sudanese opposition leader said that most disagreements have been overcome. The meeting comes after tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Khartoum on Sunday demanding the transfer of power from the ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) in what was deemed the largest protests since a forced dispersal of the capital's main sit-in camp where more than a hundred protesters were killed. The massive protests came in response to the dispersal, and talks have repeatedly reached deadlock between the military council and opposition over the mechanism of power transfer to a civilian government since the ousting of strongman Omar Al-Bashir by the military in April following months of demonstrations against his 30-year rule.

Ayoub discussed the developments in the ongoing negotiations over an African Union initiative pushed by Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed focused on transferring power to a civilian government in Sudan, as well as the framework for the transitional period. The Sudanese opposition leader said that most disagreements have been overcome. The meeting comes after tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Khartoum on Sunday demanding the transfer of power from the ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) in what was deemed the largest protests since a forced dispersal of the capital's main sit-in camp where more than a hundred protesters were killed. The massive protests came in response to the dispersal, and talks have repeatedly reached deadlock between the military council and opposition over the mechanism of power transfer to a civilian government since the ousting of strongman Omar Al-Bashir by the military in April following months of demonstrations against his 30-year rule.

(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) Hesham Tawfik, minister of public enterprise sector, inaugurated today the conference of "Bridges of Foreign Trade for the East and Central African Markets", in the presence of the Minister of Industry and Trade, Amr Nassar, and the Chairperson of the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI), Abd El Aziz Seif-Eldeen. Tawfik said that the ministry plans to launch an integrated and sophisticated chain of transport and logistics services to support the foreign trade system and provide bridges to Africa to boost bilateral trade. He explained that the most important incentives provided through the ministry, is the provision of shipping services from Ain Sokhna to East Africa at prices 20% lower than the market. Tawfik presented the vision of the ministry to develop an integrated system for foreign trade, discuss ways of cooperation with the export councils, and exchange views and ideas. This is through its holding companies for maritime, land, and insurance transport in order to launch an integrated and advanced chain of transport and logistics services, resulting in supporting the foreign trade system and providing bridges to Africa to promote intra-trade. In the first phase, the countries of East and Central Africa are targeted. The supply chain includes shipping, land, freight forwarding services, local and foreign warehousing, and insurance and business development services to access foreign markets and marketing Egyptian products. The company will manage this integrated chain, as well as another brokerage and marketing company in partnership with the private sector. He also explained that that the ministry will operate a regular maritime transport line from Ain Sokhna port to East Africa starting next October. He added that the ministry plans to establish a brokerage and marketing company in partnership with the private sector, and is currently in negotiations with some private companies to have majority stake in the new company. He also said the ministry would contract with a global operator to manage trade services for three years, and would also contract with private sector investors to participate in the warehouse management to be established in Zambia and Uganda. <>

News article:
Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat An Egyptian court sentenced Monday two convicts to three-year imprisonment in the “Returnees from Libya” case. They were convicted of involvement in acts of violence and terrorism outside Egyptian territory and planning to target facilities inside the country. Cairo Criminal Court sentenced Mohammed Farouk and Ashraf al-Sayyed to three years in prison and awarded them criminal costs. In February 2015, the Attorney General referred them both to criminal prosecution after being arrested at Salloum port on their return from Libya. The prosecution accused them of receiving military training by al-Qaeda in Libya, joining a group established contrary to the provisions of law, impeding the constitution’s provisions, preventing state institutions and public authorities from carrying out their work, attacking people’s freedom, and harming national unity and social peace. “They used terrorism as a means to achieve their purposes, and they participated and others in assaulting people, using force and violence against each other and carrying firearms,” it said. The two convicts were sentenced by a different criminal court, ranging from execution to life imprisonment. They appealed these sentences to the Court of Cassation, which accepted the appeal and ordered their retrial before a different criminal court. In another case, the country’s Court of Cassation has commuted a death sentence against a defendant convicted in the case of storming Kerdasa police station in Giza on July 2013 following an appeal filed by the defendant. It also rejected appeals by three defendants sentenced to life in prison and seven others sentenced to 15 years in the same case. The prosecution had charged the defendants with premeditated murder, attempted murder, possession of firearms and ammunition and attacks on police officers. Monday’s Court of Cassation verdict comes more than a year after the defendants were handed jail terms by a Giza criminal court in a retrial in May 2018.

News article:
(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) The streets of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, were partially deserted during the first day of a massive civil and political disobedience called by protest leaders to end the military council rule. Photos circulating on social media showed that shops, restaurants, and other businesses shut down in response to the strike calls. The Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF) also published similar photos showing empty streets with shops, businesses, and even houses closed. Meanwhile, the hashtag #totalcivildisobedience has been trending on Twitter and is being circulated by users and Sudanese activists. The DFCF clarified that a number of workers have been arrested because of their commitment to the general strike, according to the BBC. Some users published photos of Khartoum International airport on Saturday and claimed that the flights were suspended due to the strike. However, the Sudanese news agency (SUNA) reported that air traffic is normal at the capital's airport and they also added that Egyptian and Ethiopian flights are operating normally. EgyptAir also resumed its flights to Sudan after a few days of suspension in light of the political crisis in the country. Early on Sunday, the Sudanese Military Transitional Council described shutting down streets and setting up barriers as a "full-fledged crime," which violates international and humanitarian laws. The military council held the protest group, the DFCF, responsible for these "unsound practices". The council further asserted that it sided with the Sudanese people's will from the beginning and refused the old regime's plans to suppress opposition and protesters. Last week, Sudanese security forces stormed the sit-in held outside the military headquarters in Khartoum. The crackdown killed dozens of protesters and injured hundreds. Protest leaders accused a militia belonging to the military council of killing protesters in a bloody dispersal of their sit-in. According to the Central committee of Sudan doctors (CCSD), a part of the Sudanese Professionals Association, 118 people were killed since last Monday, four of them were killed on the first day of civil disobedience. The CCSD added that 40 of the casualties were allegedly retrieved from the Nile river. However, the Sudanese Ministry of Health stated that only 46 people were killed that Monday. In the aftermath of the military council crackdown against the Khartoum sit-in, the DFCF called for a massive civil and political disobedience starting from Sunday this week to end the military council rule and form a civilian-led government. The alliance called on people to stay home and abstain from work as a part of the civil and political disobedience to protect their colleagues and fulfil their aspiration until the Military Transitional Council is dissolved and becomes a civilian-led government. Since December of last year, Sudanese people, from a wide spectrum of society, swept into the streets in large numbers to initially protest against the high increase in the cost of living. Then, they demanded the toppling of Omar Al-Bashir and his regime, who has been in power since 1989. Al-Bashir was eventually removed by his military generals and he is currently in prison.

In the aftermath of the military council crackdown against the Khartoum sit-in, the DFCF called for a massive civil and political disobedience starting from Sunday this week to end the military council rule and form a civilian-led government. The alliance called on people to stay home and abstain from work as a part of the civil and political disobedience to protect their colleagues and fulfil their aspiration until the Military Transitional Council is dissolved and becomes a civilian-led government. Since December of last year, Sudanese people, from a wide spectrum of society, swept into the streets in large numbers to initially protest against the high increase in the cost of living. Then, they demanded the toppling of Omar Al-Bashir and his regime, who has been in power since 1989. Al-Bashir was eventually removed by his military generals and he is currently in prison.

News article:
Lacking all standards of logic and neutrality, HRW gave no evidences for its allegations against the Egyptian forces CAIRO – 14 June 2019: The Human Rights Watch (HRW), which has long been accused of poor research methods and relying on unverified stories that serve a number of devious schemes, has proved, once again, utterly unprofessional. The HRW has assumed its – anonymous testimonials - reflect a real situation, even when it comes to a fierce battle against cold-blooded murders and terrorists, who killed hundreds of civilians in Sinai, and still even willing to kill more. Ignoring facts According to 2016 official data from the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), the population of North Sinai reaches 445.811 people, and the population of South Sinai is 169.822; however, HRW decided to ignore these numbers and reflect the reality of what is taking place in Sinai through interviews with only 54 North Sinai residents between 2016 and 2018, as claimed in the report, neglecting all officials sources and recent terrorist attacks. Lacking all standards of logic and neutrality, HRW gave no evidences for its allegations against the Egyptian forces, narrating one-sided opinion for the events, with no credible sources or documents. “Everyone knows they are politically-biased, and not related to human rights”, Ayman Aqeel, head of Maat Foundation for Peace, Development and Human Rights said in statements to privately-owned channel Extra-News on Tuesday. He added that HRW recognized the existence of terrorism in Sinai, but at the same time does not want the army to intervene or take action, considering its efforts to maintain the country’s stability are equal to the terrorists abuses and violations. Other veteran politicians, including chairperson for Al-Wafd party Bahaa al-Dien Abu Shoka, deeply condemned and criticized the report, describing the report as ‘inaccurate and false’. Abu Shoka added that HRW report aims at resisting Egypt’s efforts against terrorism. He added that HRW has been attacking Egypt and suspect all of its efforts in ‘unjustified’ way during the past years. Politically-biased HRW The HRW had faced continuous barrage of criticism over being politically-biased. Since it has been established in 1978, several countries and government have accused HRW of following specific agendas aiming at destabilize the country’s security for other country’s benefits. In October 2009, HRW founder Robert Bernstein accused the organization of poor research methods and relying on “witnesses whose stories cannot be verified and who may testify for political advantage or because they fear retaliation from their own rulers." Bernstein said that the organization had “lost critical perspective on events in the Middle East". Also, according to The Times, HRW “does not always practice the transparency, tolerance and accountability it urges on others." The Times accused HRW of imbalance, alleging that it ignores human-rights abuses in certain regimes while covering other conflict zones (notably Israel) intensively. Although HRW issued five reports on Israel in a 14-month period. In their correction issued on 4 April 2010, The Times said HRW had published nine articles about the conflict in Kashmir and one report about the post-election abuses in Iran in February 2010. A source told The Times, “Iran is just not a bad guy that they are interested in highlighting. Their hearts are not in it. Let's face it, the thing that really excites them is Israel.” The newspaper quoted Noah Pollak, a HRW critic, who said HRW cares if Israel maltreats Palestinians but “is less concerned if perpetrators are fellow Arab.” Other evidences have been published widely indicates that HRW have been adopting biased prospective during covering several conflicts including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and conflicts in Latin America, especially in Venezuela. In September 2008, Venezuela’s government expelled two HRW staff members accused of “anti-state activities”. Then Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said, “These groups, dressed up as human rights defenders, are financed by the United States. They are aligned with a policy of attacking countries that are building new economic models”. In an article published by journ¬al¬ist and author Garry Leech in the critical legal thinking website, he said that “Over the past thirty years, HRW has become one of the most recognized non-governmental organizations in the world due to its global promotion of human rights. But despite its claims to be an advocate of international human rights law, the reports issued by HRW over the past decade have increasingly exhibited a bias towards certain rights over others. More precisely, HRW repeatedly focuses on political and civil rights while ignoring social and economic rights.” On May 21, 2019, Egypt-based Forum for Development and Human Rights Dialog said that the reports issued by the Human Rights Watch are mostly politicized and biased, adding that Human Rights Watch's reports lack professionalism and reference to international conventions. Relying on flase information HRW relies on some extremist activists in Egypt who provide false information about the human rights situation, the forum's head Saeed Abdel Hafez said. He described slamming these reports as “very easy,’ as ‘we only need [to adopt] systematic and human rights responses, away from the language of attacks and insult.” Egypt slammed many reports for the HRW attacking Egypt for alleged violations of human rights since the ousting of Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated President Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Egypt’s public prosecution issued a statement in January over Human Rights Watch report that alleges Egypt witnesses human rights violations, saying that the report is irrelevant to the truth. The prosecution urged the organization to be accurate when publishing data on human rights in Egypt.

News article:
While attending a court session on a charge of treason, Egypt's first democratically-elected president Mohammed Morsi was asked to speak. But Morsi collapsed, falling unconscious and died shortly afterwards on his way to hospital. His death comes six years after he was overthrown by the military after his one-year rule. The incident has prompted reactions and messages of condolence all across the globe, with world leaders expressing their shock for his sudden death. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was one of the first to react, offering his condolences to Morsi's family and the people of Egypt. Speaking to the reporters in Istanbul, Erdoğan said current Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sissi overthrew freely-elected Morsi, executing 50 other Egyptians and putting democracy aside. "Unfortunately, the incident took place in the court room. I first of all I wish God's mercy for our martyred brother Morsi," Erdoğan said. "The West has always been silent in the face of these executions by Sissi. EU member states forbidding execution unfortunately accepted an invitation by this murderer Sissi to attend a meeting in Egypt," Erdoğan said, branding the EU as "hypocrites". Mustafa Şentop, chairman of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, also expressed condolences to "the people of Egypt, the Islamic world and oppressed nations all over the world." Stating that he had received the news of his death with deep sorrow, Şentop said on Twitter that he believed the life and struggle of Morsi would guide those who follow in his footsteps. "What happened in Egypt and to Muhammad Morsi, who struggled for the freedom and welfare of his people, is exemplary for it reveals the true nature and functioning of coup plotters targeting legitimate governments, and unveiling the true face of some of the Western apostles," he said. Declaring Mursi and his friends as winners on the scales of justice and before history, Şentop said the coupists were the real losers and praised Morsi for being a great leader who had the courage to stand on the side of legitimacy. Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also offered condolences after the demise of Morsi. "The coup took him away from power, but his memory will not be erased from our hearts. The Ummah will not forget his firm stance! Rest in peace Morsi," he wrote on Twitter. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party)'s acting chairman Numan Kurtulmuş also called Morsi a "martyr" who had been elected by the legitimate votes of Egyptian people. He also extended condolences over Morsi's death. "Egypt's first elected President Mohammed Morsi, was being tried in courtrooms under the control of the junta after an immoral and unlawful coup. He was martyred in the courtroom," AK Party spokesman Ömer Çelik said, joining other Turkish officials. "Those who raised their voices to the coup and searched for ways of appealing fulfilled and are trying to fulfill their duty. But the so-called democratic world could not pass this test. They were silent against the executions and laid the red carpet to the putschists. This shame will always be written on their forehead," he said. Qatar's ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani expressed his "deep sorrow" following the "sudden death" of Morsi. "We received with deep sorrow the news of the sudden death of former president Dr. Mohamed Morsi. I extend to his family and to the Egyptian people brotherly condolences," Al-Thani wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, Mohammed Sudan, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in London, said Morsi's death was the equivalent of "premeditated murder" saying that the ousted leader, in jail since 2013, was banned from receiving medicine or visits and there was little information about his health condition. Sudan added that Morsi during his trial "has been placed behind glass cage. No one can hear him or know what is happening to him. He hasn't received any visits for a months or nearly a year. He complained before that he doesn't get his medicine." A leading rights group said Morsi's death was tragic but also "predictable" given Egyptian authorities' "failure" to allow medical care. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director with the Human Rights Watch, tweeted that Morsi's death was "terrible but entirely predictable" given the government "failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits." Morsi since his overthrow appeared only in court, almost always in a soundproof cage. His family said the 67-year-old Morsi suffered from ill health due to harsh conditions, including years of solitary confinement.

Cairo – Egypt’s former president, Mohammed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood leader who rose to office in the country’s first free elections in 2012 and was ousted a year later by the military, collapsed in court during a trial and died Monday, state TV and his family said. The 67-year-old Morsi had just addressed the court, speaking from the glass cage he is kept in during sessions and warning that he had “many secrets” he could reveal, a judicial official said. A few minutes afterward, he collapsed in the cage, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. In his final comments, he continued to insist he was Egypt’s legitimate president, demanding a special tribunal, one of his defense lawyers, Kamel Madour told the Associated Press. State TV said Morsi died before he could be taken to the hospital. The Brotherhood accused the government of “assassinating” Morsi through years of poor prison conditions during which he was often kept in solitary and barred from visits. Egypt’s chief prosecutor said a team of forensic experts would examine Morsi’s body to determine the cause of his death. It was a dramatic end for a figure who was central in the twists and turns taken by Egypt since its “revolution” — the pro-democracy uprising that in 2011 ousted the country’s longtime authoritarian leader, Hosni Mubarak. Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s most powerful Islamist group, dominated the elections held after Mubarak’s fall, considered the first free votes the country had seen. First, they gained a majority in parliament, then Morsi squeaked to victory in presidential elections held in 2012. Critics accused the Brotherhood of seeking to monopolize power and using violence against opponents, and soon massive protests grew against their rule. In July 2013, the military — led by then-Defense Minister, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi — ousted Morsi, dissolved parliament and eventually banned the Brotherhood as a “terrorist group.” El-Sissi was elected president and re-elected in 2018 in votes human rights groups sharply criticized as undemocratic. He was waged a ferocious crackdown that crushed the Brotherhood but also almost all other dissent, arresting tens of thousands, banning protests and silencing most criticism in the media, while the military has come to dominate politics behind the scenes. Since his ouster, Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders have been in prison, undergoing multiple trials. Morsi was sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of ordering Brotherhood members to break up a protest against him, resulting in deaths. Multiple cases are still pending. Monday’s session was part of a retrial, being held inside Cairo’s Tora Prison, on charges of espionage with the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Morsi was held in a special wing in Tora nicknamed Scorpion Prison. Rights groups say its poor conditions fall far below Egyptian and international standards. Morsi was known to suffer from diabetes. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director with the Human Rights Watch, said in a tweet that Morsi’s death was “terrible but entirely predictable” given the government “failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits.” Morsi’s son, Ahmed, confirmed the death of his father in a Facebook post, saying, “We will meet again with God.” Mohammed Sudan, leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in London, said Morsi was banned from receiving medicine or visits and there was little information about his health condition. “This is premeditated murder. This is slow death.” Freedom and Justice, the Brotherhood’s political arm, said in a statement on its Facebook page that prison conditions led to Morsi’s death in what amounted to “assassination.” “They placed him in solidarity confinement throughout his detention which exceeded 5 years, prevented medicine and provided poor food,” it said. “They prevented doctors and lawyers and even communicating with his family. They deprived him from the simplest human rights.” The judicial official said Morsi had asked to speak to the court during Monday’s session. The judge permitted it, and Morsi gave a speech saying he had “many secrets” that, if he told them, he would be released, but he added that he wasn’t telling them because it would harm Egypt’s national security. Madour, the defense lawyer, said Morsi spoke for around five minutes before collapsing inside the cage. “He was very calm and organized. He summarized our argument in three to five minutes. He insisted on a special tribunal as he is the president of the republic,” Madour said. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry did not answer calls seeking comment. Morsi, an engineer who studied at the University of Southern California, was an unlikely figure to be thrust into Egypt’s central stage. He was never considered a major thinker in the Brotherhood and instead rose through its ranks as an efficient, if lackluster, loyalist. The group only put him forward as its presidential candidate in 2012 after a more prominent and powerful figure, Khairat al-Shater, was declared ineligible to run. When elected, he made gestures toward the secular pro-democracy activists who led the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. But over the course of the year, opponents accused his Brotherhood of hijacking the revolution and using elections to entrench their own control. Major protests erupted, particularly over the process of writing a new constitution in which critics said the Brotherhood was sidelining other factions and allowing Islamists to write a charter largely on their terms. Brotherhood supporters cracked down violently on some protests. Still, the Brotherhood never managed to control all levers of power, facing opposition within courts and in the powerful security forces. As protests grew, the military stepped in: Army commandos took him and other Brotherhood leaders into custody. The subsequent crackdown has all but completely dismantled the Brotherhood, with hundreds killed and thousands imprisoned, with most other active figures fleeing abroad. Throughout his trials, Morsi insisted he remained Egypt’s legitimate president. In early court sessions he gave angry speeches until judges ordered him kept in a glass cage during sessions where they could turn off his audio. In audio leaked from a 2017 session of one of his trials, Morsi complained that he was “completely isolated” from the court, unable to see or hear his defense team, his eyes pained by lighting inside the cage. “I don’t know where I am,” he is heard saying in the audio. “It’s steel behind steel and glass behind glass. The reflection of my image makes me dizzy.”

News article:
Egypt‘s former President Mohamed Morsi has died after appearing in court in the capital, Cairo, according to authorities. The public prosecutor said the 67-year-old collapsed in a defendants’ cage in the courtroom and was pronounced dead in hospital at 4:50 pm local time (02:50 GMT) on Monday. A medical report showed no apparent recent injuries on his body, the prosecutor said. Mohamed Morsi, ousted president of Egypt, dies suddenly https://t.co/TcAMHWDOHz — The Guardian (@guardian) June 17, 2019 A presenter with Egypt’s state TV said: “Morsi died today while attending a session in his trial on espionage charges. During the session, he was granted permission to address the judge. After the session was adjourned, the former president blacked out and then died. His body was taken to a hospital.” Morsi had a history of health issues, including diabetes and liver and kidney disease. He had suffered from medical neglect during his imprisonment, compounded by the poor conditions in jail. Even if Morsy wasn't murdered, he has suffered deliberate negligence and kept in cruel conditions – denied medication and hospital visits, kept in 23 hrs a day solitary, etc. – which amount to torture. See this from last year: https://t.co/70M51E4nug — Mohamed El Dahshan (@eldahshan) June 17, 2019 There have been various reports over the years that Morsi had been mistreated and tortured in jail, with activists saying on Monday his death should be seen in the context of the Egyptian authorities’ systematic isolation and mistreatment of political detainees. Human Rights Watch called the news of Morsi’s death “terrible” but “entirely predictable”, citing the government’s “failure to allow him adequate medical care”. Morsi became Egypt’s first democratically elected president in 2012, one year after the Arab Spring uprising saw the end of President Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule. Mohamed Morsi has dead & it is great sorrow. I send my condolences to Morsi's family, his party Muslim B and Egyptian people. Morsi became Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2012, after one year of arab spring. He was a great leader, may Allah grant Him in Jannah pic.twitter.com/d7e3Px3Ucl — Abdurezak Mohamed (@sayidcade2011) June 17, 2019 He was then deposed in July 2013 following mass protests and a military coup led by Egypt’s current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and was immediately arrested. Morsi served just one year of a four-year term, while the organization to which he belonged, the Muslim Brotherhood, has since been outlawed. Morsi, who was facing at least six trials, had been behind bars for nearly six years and was serving a 20-year prison sentence for a conviction arising from the killing of protesters during demonstrations in 2012. He was also serving a life sentence for espionage in a case related to the Gulf state of Qatar. BREAKING: Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi dies after court appearance, according to state TV. Read more: https://t.co/0T7h7AMkTf https://t.co/FtbUd18Oeq — Al Jazeera News (@AJENews) June 17, 2019 Other charges against the former president included jailbreak, insulting the judiciary and involvement in “terrorism”. His supporters say the charges against him were politically motivated. In November 2016, the Court of Cassation scrapped the life imprisonment sentence for Morsi and 21 other defendants, including some who had received the death penalty in the same case, and ordered a retrial. Throughout his imprisonment, Morsi was only allowed three visits from his family. “The fact that Egypt’s only democratically-elected president ‘collapsed in a defendant’s cage’ as he was being tried for trumped-up charges tells us volumes about the dismal state of democracy and human rights in Egypt, and frankly in much of the Arab world as well,” said Palestinian author and commentator, Ramzy Baroud. “The death of Mohammed Morsi should represent the death of the illusion that the Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and similar corrupt Arab rulers – with Sudan being the latest example – have any good intentions towards the revolutionary and democratic currents that are still alive and well in the region,” Baroud also said. “The tragic death of Morsi however is not the end of the story, but rather the beginning of a new phase of struggle in Egypt,” he added.

News article:
Egypt's first and only democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi collapsed in court during a trial and died Monday. The 67-year-old Morsi had just addressed the court, speaking from the glass cage he is kept in during sessions and warning that he had "many secrets" he could reveal, a judicial official said. A few minutes afterward, he collapsed, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. State TV later said Morsi died from a heart attack. In his final comments, he reiterated he was Egypt's only legitimate and freely-elected president, demanding a special tribunal, one of his defense lawyers, Kamel Madour told the Associated Press. Morsi has been in prison undergoing multiple trials ever since the military ousted him in July 2013 and launched a massive crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood. Monday's session was part of a retrial, being held inside Cairo's Tura Prison, on charges of espionage with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas. Morsi's son, Ahmed, confirmed the death of his father in a Facebook post. He had been serving a seven-year sentence for falsifying his candidacy application for the 2012 presidential race. The Muslim Brotherhood accused Egyptian authorities of being responsible for Morsi's "deliberate slow death." The Egyptian authorities "put him in solitary confinement... they withheld medication and gave him disgusting food... they did not give him the most basic human rights," the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party said in a statement published on its website. Senior Muslim Brotherhood official Amr Darrag called for an international expert team to examine Morsi's body. Amnesty International also called for a fair, transparent and comprehensive Egyptian investigation into Morsi's death. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, calling Morsi a "martyr," extended condolences to his family and the Egyptian people. "Unfortunately, the incident took place in the court room. I first of all I wish God's mercy for our martyred brother Morsi," he said. "The West has always been silent in the face of these executions by (Abdel Fattah) el-Sissi. The EU member states forbidding execution unfortunately accepted an invitation by this murderer Sissi to attend a meeting in Egypt," he said, criticizing the EU for being "hypocrites" and calling Sissi a "tyrant" who took power in a "coup" and who has trampled on democracy. Erdoğan has on many occasions strongly denounced Morsi's ouster and called for the release of Muslim Brotherhood prisoners in Egypt. Mustafa Şentop, chairman of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, also expressed condolences to "the people of Egypt, the Islamic world and oppressed nations all over the world." Stating that he had received the news of his death with deep sorrow, Şentop said on Twitter that he believed the life and struggle of Morsi would guide those who follow in his footsteps. "What happened in Egypt and to Muhammad Morsi, who struggled for the freedom and welfare of his people, is exemplary for it reveals the true nature and functioning of coup plotters targeting legitimate governments, and unveiling the true face of some of the Western apostles," he said. Declaring Mursi and his friends as winners on the scales of justice and before history, Şentop said the coupists were the real losers and praised Morsi for being a great leader who had the courage to stand on the side of legitimacy. Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also offered condolences over Morsi's death. "The coup took him away from power, but his memory will not be erased from our hearts. The Ummah will not forget his firm stance! Rest in peace Morsi," he wrote on Twitter. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party)'s acting chairman Numan Kurtulmuş also called Morsi a "martyr" who had been elected by the legitimate votes of Egyptian people. He also extended condolences over Morsi's death. "Egypt's first elected President Mohammed Morsi, was being tried in courtrooms under the control of the junta after an immoral and unlawful coup. He was martyred in the courtroom," AK Party spokesman Ömer Çelik said, joining other Turkish officials. "Those who raised their voices to the coup and searched for ways of appealing fulfilled and are trying to fulfill their duty. But the so-called democratic world could not pass this test. They were silent against the executions and laid the red carpet to the putschists. This shame will always be written on their forehead," he said. In 2013, Morsi was removed from power in a military coup led by current leader el-Sissi. The jailed former leader was facing an array of charges in multiple court cases.

Morsi's son, Ahmed, confirmed the death of his father in a Facebook post. He had been serving a seven-year sentence for falsifying his candidacy application for the 2012 presidential race. The Muslim Brotherhood accused Egyptian authorities of being responsible for Morsi's "deliberate slow death." The Egyptian authorities "put him in solitary confinement... they withheld medication and gave him disgusting food... they did not give him the most basic human rights," the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party said in a statement published on its website. Senior Muslim Brotherhood official Amr Darrag called for an international expert team to examine Morsi's body. Amnesty International also called for a fair, transparent and comprehensive Egyptian investigation into Morsi's death. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, calling Morsi a "martyr," extended condolences to his family and the Egyptian people. "Unfortunately, the incident took place in the court room. I first of all I wish God's mercy for our martyred brother Morsi," he said. "The West has always been silent in the face of these executions by (Abdel Fattah) el-Sissi. The EU member states forbidding execution unfortunately accepted an invitation by this murderer Sissi to attend a meeting in Egypt," he said, criticizing the EU for being "hypocrites" and calling Sissi a "tyrant" who took power in a "coup" and who has trampled on democracy. Erdoğan has on many occasions strongly denounced Morsi's ouster and called for the release of Muslim Brotherhood prisoners in Egypt. Mustafa Şentop, chairman of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, also expressed condolences to "the people of Egypt, the Islamic world and oppressed nations all over the world." Stating that he had received the news of his death with deep sorrow, Şentop said on Twitter that he believed the life and struggle of Morsi would guide those who follow in his footsteps. "What happened in Egypt and to Muhammad Morsi, who struggled for the freedom and welfare of his people, is exemplary for it reveals the true nature and functioning of coup plotters targeting legitimate governments, and unveiling the true face of some of the Western apostles," he said. Declaring Mursi and his friends as winners on the scales of justice and before history, Şentop said the coupists were the real losers and praised Morsi for being a great leader who had the courage to stand on the side of legitimacy. Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also offered condolences over Morsi's death. "The coup took him away from power, but his memory will not be erased from our hearts. The Ummah will not forget his firm stance! Rest in peace Morsi," he wrote on Twitter. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party)'s acting chairman Numan Kurtulmuş also called Morsi a "martyr" who had been elected by the legitimate votes of Egyptian people. He also extended condolences over Morsi's death. "Egypt's first elected President Mohammed Morsi, was being tried in courtrooms under the control of the junta after an immoral and unlawful coup. He was martyred in the courtroom," AK Party spokesman Ömer Çelik said, joining other Turkish officials. "Those who raised their voices to the coup and searched for ways of appealing fulfilled and are trying to fulfill their duty. But the so-called democratic world could not pass this test. They were silent against the executions and laid the red carpet to the putschists. This shame will always be written on their forehead," he said. In 2013, Morsi was removed from power in a military coup led by current leader el-Sissi. The jailed former leader was facing an array of charges in multiple court cases.

Egypt's first and only democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi collapsed in court during a trial and died Monday. The 67-year-old Morsi had just addressed the court, speaking from the glass cage he is kept in during sessions and warning that he had "many secrets" he could reveal, a judicial official said. A few minutes afterward, he collapsed, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. State TV later said Morsi died from a heart attack. In his final comments, he reiterated he was Egypt's only legitimate and freely-elected president, demanding a special tribunal, one of his defense lawyers, Kamel Madour told the Associated Press. Morsi has been in prison undergoing multiple trials ever since the military ousted him in July 2013 and launched a massive crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood.

News article:
CAIRO (Reuters) - Former Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi, the first democratically elected head of state in Egypt’s modern history, died on Monday from a heart attack after collapsing in a Cairo court while on trial on espionage charges, authorities and a medical source said. The 67-year-old Mursi, a top figure in the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, had been in jail since being toppled by the military in 2013 after barely a year in power, following mass protests against his rule. His death is likely to pile up international pressure on the Egyptian government over its human rights record, especially conditions in prisons where thousands of Islamists and secular activists are held. The public prosecutor said Mursi had collapsed in a defendants’ cage in the courtroom shortly after addressing the court, and was pronounced dead in hospital at 4:50 p.m. (1450 GMT). It said initial checks had shown no signs of recent injury on his body. The Muslim Brotherhood described Mursi’s death as a “full-fledged murder” and called for masses to gather at his funeral in Egypt and outside Egyptian embassies around the world. Mursi’s family previously said his health had deteriorated in prison and that they were rarely allowed to visit. A medical source said Mursi died of a heart attack. The source said Mursi, who was diabetic and suffered from high blood pressure, had received medical treatment at a private hospital and at the police hospital in Cairo, denying that he was deprived from medical attention. Mursi’s son, Abdullah Mohamed Mursi, told Reuters that the family had not been contacted about the details of the burial and were only communicating through their lawyers. Abdullah said earlier that authorities were refusing to allow Mursi to be laid to rest in the family burial grounds in his native Nile Delta province of Sharqiya. “We know nothing about him and no one is in touch with us, and we don’t know if we are going to wash him or say a prayer to him or not,” he said. Amnesty International called for an “impartial, thorough and transparent” investigation into Mursi’s death. “Egyptian authorities had the responsibility to ensure that, as a detainee, he had access to proper medical care,” the group said in a statement. A British member of Parliament, Crispin Blunt, who had led a delegation of UK lawmakers and lawyers last year in putting out a report on Mursi’s detention, slammed the conditions of Mursi’s incarceration. “We want to understand whether there was any change in his conditions since we reported in March 2018, and if he continued to be held in the conditions we found, then I’m afraid the Egyptian government are likely to be responsible for his premature death,” he said in remarks to the BBC. DECADES OF REPRESSION After decades of repression under Egyptian autocrats, the Brotherhood won a parliamentary election after a popular uprising toppled Hosni Mubarak and his military-backed establishment in 2011. Mursi was elected to power in 2012 in Egypt’s first free presidential election, having been thrown into the race at the last moment by the disqualification on a technicality of millionaire businessman Khairat al-Shater, by far the Brotherhood’s preferred choice. Slideshow ( 10 images ) Mursi’s victory marked a radical break with the military men who had provided every Egyptian leader since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1952. He promised a moderate Islamist agenda to steer Egypt into a new democratic era in which autocracy would be replaced by transparent government that respected human rights and revived the fortunes of a powerful Arab state long in decline. But the euphoria that greeted the end of an era of presidents who ruled like pharaohs did not last long. The stocky, bespectacled engineer, born in 1951 in the dying days of the monarchy, told Egyptians he would deliver an “Egyptian renaissance with an Islamic foundation.” Instead, he alienated millions who accused him of usurping unlimited powers, imposing the Brotherhood’s conservative brand of Islam and mismanaging the economy, all of which he denied. Slideshow ( 10 images ) STATE OF ALERT Security sources said the Interior Ministry had declared a state of alert on Monday, notably in Sharqiya. Mursi had been in court for a hearing on charges of espionage emanating from suspected contacts with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which had close ties to the Brotherhood. A source who was in the court at the time told Reuters that Mursi spoke for around 15 minutes and concluded with a line of poetry about his love for Egypt, before collapsing as the other defendants began banging on the soundproof cage. His body was taken to the Tora prison hospital, state television reported. A heavy security presence was outside the prison on Monday night. Mursi’s lawyer said his health had been poor in jail. “We had put in several requests for treatment, some were accepted and others were not,” the lawyer, Abdel-Menem Abdel-Maqsood, told Reuters. Mursi was serving a 20-year prison sentence for a conviction arising from the killing of protesters during demonstrations in 2012, and a life sentence for espionage in a case related to the Gulf state of Qatar. He had denied the charges. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan mourned his fellow Islamist as a martyr. “Putting doubts aside, he has become a martyr today with the fulfilment of God’s order. ... Our prayers are with him,” Erdogan said. “Condolences to all my brothers who walked the same path as he did. Condolences to the people of Egypt. Condolences to his family and those close to him.” The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said Mursi had “served Egypt and the (Muslim) nation and the Palestinian cause.” Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, a backer of Mursi and his Brotherhood, tweeted his condolences to Mursi’s family “and to the brotherly Egyptian people.” Egyptian state media carried brief reports of Mursi’s death that made no mention of his former position as president.

CAIRO, June 17 (Reuters) - Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, offered condolences in a tweet on Monday to the family of former Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi "and the brotherly Egyptian people". Mursi, imprisoned since he was toppled by the military in 2013, collapsed in a cage during a court session on Monday and died shortly afterward, Egypt's public prosecutor said. Mursi, a top figure in the Muslim Brotherhood who became Egypt's first freely elected president in 2012, was overthrown after mass protests against this rule. Qatar strongly backs the Muslim Brotherhood, which since Mursi's fall has been outlawed in Egypt with many of its leading figures imprisoned.

CAIRO, June 17 (Reuters) - Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, offered condolences in a tweet on Monday to the family of former Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi "and the brotherly Egyptian people". Mursi, imprisoned since he was toppled by the military in 2013, collapsed in a cage during a court session on Monday and died shortly afterward, Egypt's public prosecutor said. Mursi, a top figure in the Muslim Brotherhood who became Egypt's first freely elected president in 2012, was overthrown after mass protests against this rule.

News article:
ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey took to the streets of capital Ankara and Istanbul on Tuesday to mourn former Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi, with some chanting slogans blaming Cairo authorities for his death. People attend a symbolic funeral prayer for the former Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi at the courtyard of Fatih Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey, June 18, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer Mursi, a leading member of the Islamist group which is now banned in Egypt, died on Monday after collapsing in a Cairo court while on trial on espionage charges. The 67-year-old - the first democratically elected head of state in Egypt’s modern history - had been in jail since the army commanded by Egypt’s current president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi toppled him in 2013 after barely a year in power following mass protests against his rule. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s Islamist-rooted AK Party supported Mursi’s short-lived Egyptian government, and many Brotherhood members and supporters have fled to Turkey since its activities were banned in Egypt. Speaking after afternoon prayers at a mosque in Istanbul’s conservative Fatih district as part of a commemoration, Erdogan called Mursi a “martyr” and said he doubted that Mursi had died of natural causes. “It makes one think if this is a normal march (to God) or if there is another situation. Personally, I do not believe that is a normal death,” he said. “Long live hell for tyrants.” Earlier in the day, he condemned western countries, saying they had “watched Mursi taken down in a coup and tortured in a prison cell”. Slideshow ( 6 images ) About 500 people in Ankara prayed in a central street halting traffic outside the Egyptian Embassy, and in Istanbul hundreds of people attended a symbolic funeral in the conservative Fatih district. By contrast, in central Cairo on Tuesday morning there were no signs of protests. Egypt has cracked down on Islamist groups since Mursi’s ousting. “MARTYR MURSI” Members of the Ankara crowd chanted: “Murderer Sisi, martyr Mursi” and held up banners reading “Putschists will be defeated”, a reference to Mursi’s overthrow. “We will take back our country from the military coup, and that day, we will go to the tomb of Muhammed Mursi and pray to thank him for staying in prison for six years to free our country of tyrants,” said Mumin Ashraf, 25, an Egyptian man studying in Ankara. Rights groups have called for an investigation into Mursi’s death and raised questions about his treatment in prison. Egypt’s government has dismissed accusations that he was badly treated. The Brotherhood says it is a non-violent movement and denies any relationship to violent insurgencies waged by al Qaeda and Islamic State. Brotherhood spokesman Talaat Fahmi blamed the Egyptian government for Mursi’s death. “Those coup leaders have ... implemented an incremental killing process throughout six years,” he told Reuters in an interview in Istanbul. “They did not allow anyone to witness the funeral. They did not allow anyone to see the body.”

News article:
Egypt on Tuesday slammed tweets by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) on the circumstances of the death of Mohamed Morsi, the country's first freely-elected president, during a court session a day earlier, as reported by Anadolu Agency. Morsi was buried in eastern Cairo early Tuesday amid tight security, hours after he collapsed and died during a court appearance on espionage charges. HRW's Middle East and North Africa Director Sarah Leah Whitson described Morsi's death as "entirely predictable" due to his ill-treatment by the Egyptian authorities. "This is terrible but ENTIRELY predictable, given govt failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits," she said on Twitter. She said the Egyptian government deliberately singled out Morsi for especially harsh treatment and isolation. "…there is a very strong case to be made that this was criminal negligence, deliberate malfeasance in providing #Morsi basic prisoner rights. He was very obviously singled out for mistreatment." #Egypt https://t.co/o2gSNnG622 — Sarah Leah Whitson (@sarahleah1) June 17, 2019 But the State Information Service (SIS) described Whitson's tweets as "lies" and a "political exploitation in the name of human rights". READ: World reacts to the death of Mohammed Morsi In a statement, SIS said Whitson's tweets "contained nothing but false claims that reaffirm HRW's tradition of circulating lies". A leading member of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood group, Morsi won Egypt's first free presidential election in 2012. Following only one year in office, however, he was ousted and imprisoned in a military coup led by Egypt's then defence minister and current president, Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi. At the time of his death, Morsi faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with numerous human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated. A special report by Reuters shows that more than 100 people died of medical neglect since Sisi took control of Egypt.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday stated that former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi was 'killed.' The Turkish leader also slammed Egyptian officials for not taking any measures to save the ex-president. "Morsi was struggling on the floor in the courtroom for 20 minutes. Authorities unfortunately did not intervene to save him," Erdogan said. "Morsi was killed, he did not die of natural causes." Morsi, who was removed from power in 2013 amid a wave of popular discontent caused by the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood* movement, reportedly suffered a heart attack on Monday. He died aged 67 during a court hearing on an espionage case in Cairo.

Egypt's first democratically elected president and top Muslim Brotherhood official Mohammed Morsi did not die of natural causes but instead was murdered, Turkey's leader claimed Wednesday. At an election rally in Istanbul, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed he was murdered, citing evidence the deposed Egyptian president allegedly "flailed" in a Cairo courtroom for 20 minutes on Monday and nobody assisted him. "Unfortunately, Mohammed Morsi was on the ground of the courtroom flailing for 20 minutes," he told the crowd. "No official there intervened. Morsi did not (die) naturally, he was killed." EGYPT'S OUSTED PRESIDENT MOHAMMED MORSI DEAD AFTER COLLAPSING IN COURT Morsi, 67, hailed from Egypt's largest Islamist group, the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and was elected president in 2012 in the country's first free elections following the Arab Spring and ouster of longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. The military, however, toppled Morsi in 2013 after massive protests and crushed the Brotherhood in a major crackdown, arresting him and many others of the group's leaders. The 67-year-old was buried on Tuesday under heavy security a day after his dramatic death inside the courtroom. Morsi's family attended funeral prayers in the mosque of Cairo's Tora prison, followed by the burial at a cemetery in the Egyptian capital's eastern district of Nasr City, Abdul-Moneim Abdel-Maqsoud, a member of Morsi's defense team, told the Associated Press. Morsi's son Ahmed said security agencies refused to allow Morsi to be buried at the family's cemetery in his hometown of Adwa in Sharqia province, and instead had him interred at a Cairo cemetery dedicated to prominent Islamists. Dozens of people performed the absentee funeral prayer amid tight security in Adwa, according to residents and videos circulated online. EGYPT AGREES TO PAY ISRAEL $500 MILLION TO END GAS DISPUTE During his years in prison, Morsi, who was known to have diabetes, was often held in solitary confinement and was largely barred from receiving visitors. His family was only allowed to visit three times. While in detention, Morsi continued to appear in court on a range of charges. Morsi's Brotherhood has accused the government of "assassinating" him through years of poor prison conditions. The group demanded an international investigation into Morsi's death on Monday and called on Egyptians to protest outside Egyptian embassies across the world. Late on Monday, Egypt's chief prosecutor said Morsi's body would be examined to determine the cause of his death. State TV, citing an unnamed medical source, said he died after suffering a heart attack. Erdogan said Wednesday that Turkey would do everything in its power to ensure Egypt faces trial in Morsi's death. He also called on the Islamic Cooperation Organization to "take the necessary action" over Morsi's death." An Egyptian judicial official told the Associated Press that Morsi had just addressed the court, speaking from the glass cage he is kept in during sessions and warning that he had "many secrets" he could reveal before collapsing minutes later. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called Tuesday for a "prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation" into Morsi's death. Human Rights Watch also criticized Egyptian authorities for failing to provide adequate medical care for Morsi as "horrific." "At the very least, the Egyptian government committed grave abuses against Morsi by denying him prisoners' rights that met minimum standards," the New York-based group's Sarah Leah Whitson said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Egypt's state information service later said Whitson's statements were "nothing but false claims" that reaffirm what it called HRW's tradition of "circulating lies." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Egypt’s authorities are panning Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director with the Human Rights Watch, for criticizing the Egyptian government’s “failure to allow [Mohamed Morsi] adequate medical care, much less family visits.” Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected president ousted by the military in 2013, collapsed during a trial session on Monday and died. Egypt’s state information service says Whitson’s statements were “nothing but false claims” and reaffirm what it called HRW’s tradition of “circulating lies.” The service added that a court had approved Morsi’s request in November 2017 asking that he be “treated at his own expense.” — AP

News article:
Cairo (AFP) - Egypt accused the United Nations on Wednesday of seeking to "politicise" the death of the country's first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi by calling for an "independent inquiry". Foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Hafez said he condemned "in the strongest terms" the call by the spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, for an independent investigation into Morsi's death during a court hearing on Monday. Hafez said it was a "deliberate attempt to politicise a case of natural death." Colville called Tuesday for a probe into whether the conditions Morsi faced during his nearly six years in custody had contributed to his death. "Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death," he said. "Concerns have been raised regarding the conditions of Mr. Morsi's detention, including access to adequate medical care, as well as sufficient access to his lawyers and family," Colville added. He said the investigation must "encompass all aspects of the authorities' treatment of Mr. Morsi to examine whether the conditions of his detention had an impact on his death." Morsi was toppled by then army chief, now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in 2013 after a single divisive year in power. He was later charged with an array of offences including espionage. Since his ouster, authorities have waged an ongoing crackdown on dissent of all kinds that has seen thousands of Brotherhood supporters jailed and hundreds facing death sentences. A group of British parliamentarians in March 2018 warned Morsi's detention conditions, particularly inadequate treatment for his diabetes and liver disease, could trigger "premature death".

GENEVA: The UN human rights office called Tuesday for an “independent inquiry” into the death of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, who died in state custody. “Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death,” said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Chair of UK detention panel calls for Morsi probe: A British lawmaker who led a review last year of the detention of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi said Tuesday there should be an independent international probe into his death. “Dr Morsi’s death in custody is representative of Egypt’s inability to treat prisoners in accordance with both Egyptian and international law,” Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said. He said Cairo “has a duty to explain his unfortunate death and there must be proper accountability for his treatment in custody”. “The only step now is a reputable independent international investigation,” he said. Thousands in Istanbul pray for ex-Egyptian president Morsi: Thousands joined in prayer in Istanbul on Tuesday for former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi who died the previous day after collapsing during a trial hearing in a Cairo court. The prayers, called by Turkey’s religious authority Diyanet, took place in the city’s Fatih mosque. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a close ally of Morsi, is due to attend afternoon prayers there. Ankara’s relations with Cairo deteriorated after the Egyptian military, then led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, ousted Morsi in 2013. Sisi then became president. Erdogan on Monday called Morsi a “martyr” and blamed Egypt’s “tyrants” for his death. Turkey has strongly denounced Morsi’s ouster, with Erdogan calling it a “coup”. On Tuesday, the Turkish leader lashed out at the West for “merely watching Morsi’s toppling and his suffering in a one-room cell”. Morsi quietly buried in Cairo: Egypt’s first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi was buried Tuesday, as calls mounted for an independent investigation into the causes of his death after he collapsed in a Cairo courtroom. The Islamist leader, who was overthrown in 2013 after a year of divisive rule and later charged with espionage, was buried at a cemetery in eastern Cairo’s Medinat Nasr, one of his lawyers said. Abdel Moneim Abdel Maksoud said family members had washed Morsi’s body and prayed the last rites early Tuesday morning at the Leeman Tora Hospital. That lies near the prison where Egypt’s first civilian president, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood member, had been held for six years in solitary confinement and deteriorating health.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Wednesday that Turkey will follow up on the case of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first president elected through a popular vote, after he died Monday during a trial in a courtroom, in the international scene. "Mohammed Morsi unfortunately struggled on the floor in the courtroom for 20 minutes, but authorities did not intervene. That's why I'm saying Morsi did not die of natural causes, but was killed," Erdoğan told the crowd during an inauguration ceremony in Istanbul's Sancaktepe district. "We are urging the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to act, and do what's necessary," Erdoğan said, adding that he will bring up the issue at the G20 summit in Japan scheduled for June 28 and 29. "We'll follow up on the process and do whatever is necessary to make sure Egypt is tried in international courts," he added. Morsi was elected president in 2012 but was ousted in a military coup a year later. The military, then led by incumbent President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, crushed the Muslim Brotherhood movement in a major crackdown, arresting Morsi and many others of the group's leaders, who have been in prison undergoing multiple trials ever since the coup. Morsi reportedly died from a heart attack Monday during a court session. The country's state television reported early Tuesday that Morsi was "suffering from a benign tumor, had continuous medical attention and his death was caused by a heart attack." He was buried in Nasr City, east of Cairo, early Tuesday morning. Amnesty International and other rights groups have called for a fair, transparent and comprehensive investigation into Morsi's death and raised questions about his treatment in prison. Egypt's government has dismissed accusations that he was badly treated. French lawyer accuses West of double standards The silence of Western countries, including France and the European Union, on the death of Morsi is a clear indicator of a double standard, said French lawyer Gilles Devers. Gilles Devers, a French lawyer and academic who has represented the Palestinian Authority before the International Court of Justice, said that they applied to the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC) to launch an investigation about the death of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi. Speaking to Anadolu Agency (AA), Devers criticized France and the EU for remaining silent about Morsi's death: "France and the EU revealed their double standard. If this happened in another country, their reactions would be different. This double standard is unacceptable." He added that he, as a French citizen, is disturbed by double standards in French media. Devers said that they had applied to the U.N. and ICC for an investigation into Morsi's suspicious death, with the support of nine international organizations. They also demanded experts to conduct medical examinations in Egypt. Saying that Morsi did not get necessary medical treatment in prison for six years, Devers added: "Morsi's death is not a normal one. No one can claim the opposite." "Health problems that could cause Morsi's death did not occur suddenly," said Devers adding Egypt must give information about Morsi's health condition records. "I believe that Morsi lost his life due to bad treatment in prison," he added, stating that an official investigation into the causes of Morsi's death is necessary. Meanwhile, the EU offered condolences in a message to Morsi family, according to information received by the Delegation of the European Union to Turkey. Bakir Izetbegovic, the Bosniak member of the tripartite Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was another politician who released a condolence message in the wake of Morsi's sudden death. "I offer my condolences to the people of Egypt and Morsi's family. Morsi first lost his freedom. Now, he lost his life during his struggle for the freedom of the people of Egypt," he stated.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Wednesday that Turkey will follow up on the case of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first president elected through a popular vote, after he died Monday during a trial in a courtroom, in the international scene. "Mohammed Morsi unfortunately struggled on the floor in the courtroom for 20 minutes, but authorities did not intervene. That's why I'm saying Morsi did not die of natural causes, but was killed," Erdoğan told the crowd during an inauguration ceremony in Istanbul's Sancaktepe district. "We are urging the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to act, and do what's necessary," Erdoğan said, adding that he will bring up the issue at the G20 summit in Japan scheduled for June 28 and 29. "We'll follow up on the process and do whatever is necessary to make sure Egypt is tried in international courts," he added. Morsi was elected president in 2012 but was ousted in a military coup a year later. The military, then led by incumbent President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, crushed the Muslim Brotherhood movement in a major crackdown, arresting Morsi and many others of the group's leaders, who have been in prison undergoing multiple trials ever since the coup. Morsi reportedly died from a heart attack Monday during a court session. The country's state television reported early Tuesday that Morsi was "suffering from a benign tumor, had continuous medical attention and his death was caused by a heart attack." He was buried in Nasr City, east of Cairo, early Tuesday morning. Amnesty International and other rights groups have called for a fair, transparent and comprehensive investigation into Morsi's death and raised questions about his treatment in prison. Egypt's government has dismissed accusations that he was badly treated. French lawyer accuses West of double standards The silence of Western countries, including France and the European Union, on the death of Morsi is a clear indicator of a double standard, said French lawyer Gilles Devers. Gilles Devers, a French lawyer and academic who has represented the Palestinian Authority before the International Court of Justice, said that they applied to the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC) to launch an investigation about the death of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi. Speaking to Anadolu Agency (AA), Devers criticized France and the EU for remaining silent about Morsi's death: "France and the EU revealed their double standard. If this happened in another country, their reactions would be different. This double standard is unacceptable." He added that he, as a French citizen, is disturbed by double standards in French media. Devers said that they had applied to the U.N. and ICC for an investigation into Morsi's suspicious death, with the support of nine international organizations. They also demanded experts to conduct medical examinations in Egypt. Saying that Morsi did not get necessary medical treatment in prison for six years, Devers added: "Morsi's death is not a normal one. No one can claim the opposite." "Health problems that could cause Morsi's death did not occur suddenly," said Devers adding Egypt must give information about Morsi's health condition records. "I believe that Morsi lost his life due to bad treatment in prison," he added, stating that an official investigation into the causes of Morsi's death is necessary. Meanwhile, the EU offered condolences in a message to Morsi family, according to information received by the Delegation of the European Union to Turkey. Bakir Izetbegovic, the Bosniak member of the tripartite Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was another politician who released a condolence message in the wake of Morsi's sudden death. "I offer my condolences to the people of Egypt and Morsi's family. Morsi first lost his freedom. Now, he lost his life during his struggle for the freedom of the people of Egypt," he stated.

News article:
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Thursday urged the U.N. to launch an official investigation into the death of Egypt's first and only democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi. Speaking to journalists at a media event, Erdoğan said Egyptian authorities did not intervene while Morsi suffered for more than 20 minutes before he fell unconscious, and eventually died. Morsi reportedly died from a heart attack Monday during a court session. The country's state television reported early Tuesday that Morsi was "suffering from a benign tumor, had continuous medical attention and his death was caused by a heart attack." He was buried in Nasr City, east of Cairo, early Tuesday morning. "They didn't make the slightest intervention as the country's first democratically elected president suffered for more than 20 minutes. They didn't deliver his remains to his family or let him be buried in his hometown per his will," Erdoğan said, blaming Abdel Fattah el-Sissi for Morsi's death. "Sissi is a tyrant, not a democrat," Erdoğan said. "I hope the U.N., which found Turkey's stance on Jamal Khashoggi's murder right, will also handle the suspicious death of Morsi," Erdoğan said. "We won't allow Morsi's death to be forgotten just as we have not allowed late Jamal Khashoggi's death to be forgotten," he added. Erdoğan said Turkey would also use every available resource within the confines of international law to shed light onto Morsi's death. Morsi was elected president in 2012 but was ousted in a military coup a year later. The military, then led by incumbent President Sissi, crushed the Muslim Brotherhood movement in a major crackdown, arresting Morsi and many others of the group's leaders, who have been in prison undergoing multiple trials ever since the coup. According to his family, Morsi had diabetes and kidney disease and had not been provided with proper medical treatment. Amnesty International and other rights groups have called for a fair, transparent and comprehensive investigation into Morsi's death and raised questions about his treatment in prison. Egypt's government has dismissed accusations that he was badly treated.

The Egyptian authorities have blocked Turkey's TRT Arabi and Anadolu Agency websites, the Ankara-based International Association for Media and Communication (IAMCR) announced yesterday. "As part of the ongoing censorship on media in Egypt, TRT Arabi and Anadolu Agency were blocked by the Egyptian regime," IAMCR said, condemning what it described as "a coup attempt against media freedom." IAMCR explained that the move had come following the websites' coverage of the death of the former Egyptian first freely-elected president, Mohamed Morsi. The former president of Egypt was kept in a cell for 23 hours a day since his overthrow in 2013 and consistently denied medical attention for his diabetes, kidney and liver disease. Turkey: Protesters at Egypt Embassy over Morsi's death Morsi collapsed during a court session on Monday, was denied first aid for up to 30 minutes, then taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Expressing its resentment, IAMCR added that the "undemocratic practices in Egypt have crossed the red lines." The media group called on the Western world "to publicly acknowledge the existence of media censorship in Egypt." In recent years, the Egyptian authorities have blocked hundreds of websites and news sources in what local and international human rights groups describe as part of "a wider policy to restrict freedom, repress dissent, and limit access to information." The number of blocked platforms and websites in Egypt is on the rise, with over 500 banned websites. The ban list includes news websites, blogs, as well as VPN and proxy service providers offering unrestricted and secure access to the internet without fear of surveillance.

News article:
Few rulers in history have presented themselves as gods. The best examples were the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, which was home to the most sophisticated civilization of its era. For about 3,000 years, pharaohs ruled the fertile Nile basin pretending to be sacred kings. Dynasty after dynasty, king after king, the status quo never changed in Egypt until the military chiefs of the imperialist period gained some significance. In Egypt's history, ancient or modern, military chiefs as well as the men of God have always had a say in politics. Since Alexander the Great's invasion of Egypt, armies and clergymen have stood side by side. Sometimes, they collaborated to perpetuate the status quo. However, in numerous occasions throughout history, religious scholars and philosophers have been detained, tortured and even killed. Whenever a man of piety, a Moses against the pharaoh, threatened the status quo of the terrestrial "gods" in Egypt, the hierarchical system always found a way to oust him through methods such as exile, imprisonment or execution. Modern Egyptian history is no different. After the "Free Officers" movement overthrew King Farouk, Egypt has been ruled by military pharaohs. From 1953 to 2012, four military chiefs, namely Mohammed Nagib, Gamal Abd al-Nasser, Anwar al-Sadat and Hosni Mubarek, ruled the country pretending to be gods in human bodies. When the Arab Spring began in 2011 and heavy protests in Cairo and elsewhere targeted Mubarek's 30 years of severe rule, everybody waited for the decision of the army chiefs, who ended up not backing the old tyrant, and he fell. While most thought Egyptians really "did it" and that the country's democratic path could not be reversed, the army took an ambiguous position on the political situation, which held the door open for free elections for the first time in Egypt's history. When Mohammed Morsi was elected as the fifth, democratically the first, president of Egypt, many commentators were speaking about the Tahrir protests that helped overthrow Mubarek as the first phase of a possible democratic revolution in the Arab world. Unfortunately, the Arab Spring was suppressed again by a martial act, and the first democratically elected president of Egypt, who died suspiciously in court on June 17, 2019, was imprisoned for the sake of a junta rule headed by Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who was appointed as the chief of military staff by Morsi. Early life Mohammed Morsi was born Muhammad Mohammed Mursi Issa al-Ayyat on Aug. 20, 1951 as the son of a local farmer in Sharqiyyah governorate on the east side of the Nile delta. He studied engineering at Cairo University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1975 and a master's degree in engineering metallurgy in 1978. After that, he moved to the United States for further studies and earned a Ph.D. degree in engineering from the University of Southern California in 1982. For three years, he taught engineering at California State University before he returned to Egypt and began working as a professor of engineering at Zagazig University, a position he held until 2010. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood Like many of his cultivated peers, Morsi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He joined the brotherhood in 1977 and received duties beginning in 1979. He crossed over to the political wing of the movement and rose through the ranks. He was elected to the Youth Committee in 1995. In 2000, he was elected to the People's Assembly, where he held his seat independently since the Muslim Brotherhood was politically banned in Egypt. During his term in Parliament, Morsi pressed the government for political reforms, including the lifting of oppressive measures that gave police abnormal authority to detain, arrest and interrogate anyone they wished. Morsi was an active politician in the assembly and introduced himself as a social conservative. He acted as the spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood in the People's Assembly. Morsi lost his seat in the assembly after the 2005 elections since the Mubarak administration used electoral fraud to reverse the Muslim Brotherhood's gains in the previous elections. After that, he was appointed to the Guidance Bureau, the highest executive body of the Muslim Brotherhood organization. He joined protests in 2006 and 2011, for which he was arrested and spent more than seven months in the jail. As president After Mubarak was ousted, members of the Muslim Brotherhood entered the open political arena as legitimate actors. They formed the Freedom and Justice Party and selected Morsi as their presidential candidate after Khayrat al-Shater, the original candidate, was disqualified from running. He defeated his rivals in both rounds of the presidential elections and was elected as the first democratic president of Egypt on June 17, 2012. However, he took on the presidency under problematic circumstances since the Supreme Constitutional Court dissolved the People's Assembly led by the Muslim Brotherhood, and the interim military government made a constitutional declaration, both of which limited Morsi's authority as a president from the start. Morsi tried to use his legitimate power and preserve political strength through progressive moves. He forced seven members of the military council to retire and helped establish a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. After that, he removed the authority of the Supreme Court over the presidency and the Constituent Assembly until a permanent constitution was created and enacted. In other words, he tried to establish the superiority of the presidency over the military and the judiciary. Though Morsi thought this move would help Egypt's transition to a powerful democracy, mass demonstrations were held against his decisions. Moses against the pharaoh Meanwhile, the Christian and secularist members of the Constituent Assembly began boycotting, and both Morsi opponents and supporters held massive rallies in different squares in Cairo. Tahrir was the usual place for the opponents, while Rabia Square became the sign of the people rallying to support the president. The constitutional referendum and the approval of the draft constitution by the voters did not help ease the severity of the situation. On July 1, 2013, el-Sissi, the head of the Egyptian armed forces, declared that the army was ready to intervene. Just two days later, el-Sissi led a military coup, arrested Morsi and killed 3,533 of his supporters and arrested myriads of others. El-Sissi outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood once again. The courts gave numerous death penalties to young members of the Brotherhood, and many of them were executed immediately. Mohammed Morsi was sentenced to death in 2015, which was overturned by another court in 2016. The court ordered a retrial. Unfortunately, the el-Sissi junta administration treated Morsi harshly in prison. He was never allowed to have proper healthcare, of which he was in dire need. Besides, there are also allegations that the junta gave him poison to cause a slow death instead of the death penalty, which they thought would influence the public to portray Morsi as a hero. Yet, his attitude as a political prisoner was always heroic. As a cultivated member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi never allowed his opponents to place him in an inferior position. He always stood as the leader of a suffering nation and for the people's rights. Mohammed Morsi died on June 17, 2019 under suspicious circumstances. The junta declared that he collapsed in court and soon died at the hospital, which leaves opaque questions about his death.

During his term in Parliament, Morsi pressed the government for political reforms, including the lifting of oppressive measures that gave police abnormal authority to detain, arrest and interrogate anyone they wished. Morsi was an active politician in the assembly and introduced himself as a social conservative. He acted as the spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood in the People's Assembly. Morsi lost his seat in the assembly after the 2005 elections since the Mubarak administration used electoral fraud to reverse the Muslim Brotherhood's gains in the previous elections. After that, he was appointed to the Guidance Bureau, the highest executive body of the Muslim Brotherhood organization. He joined protests in 2006 and 2011, for which he was arrested and spent more than seven months in the jail. As president After Mubarak was ousted, members of the Muslim Brotherhood entered the open political arena as legitimate actors. They formed the Freedom and Justice Party and selected Morsi as their presidential candidate after Khayrat al-Shater, the original candidate, was disqualified from running. He defeated his rivals in both rounds of the presidential elections and was elected as the first democratic president of Egypt on June 17, 2012. However, he took on the presidency under problematic circumstances since the Supreme Constitutional Court dissolved the People's Assembly led by the Muslim Brotherhood, and the interim military government made a constitutional declaration, both of which limited Morsi's authority as a president from the start. Morsi tried to use his legitimate power and preserve political strength through progressive moves. He forced seven members of the military council to retire and helped establish a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. After that, he removed the authority of the Supreme Court over the presidency and the Constituent Assembly until a permanent constitution was created and enacted. In other words, he tried to establish the superiority of the presidency over the military and the judiciary. Though Morsi thought this move would help Egypt's transition to a powerful democracy, mass demonstrations were held against his decisions. Moses against the pharaoh Meanwhile, the Christian and secularist members of the Constituent Assembly began boycotting, and both Morsi opponents and supporters held massive rallies in different squares in Cairo. Tahrir was the usual place for the opponents, while Rabia Square became the sign of the people rallying to support the president. The constitutional referendum and the approval of the draft constitution by the voters did not help ease the severity of the situation. On July 1, 2013, el-Sissi, the head of the Egyptian armed forces, declared that the army was ready to intervene. Just two days later, el-Sissi led a military coup, arrested Morsi and killed 3,533 of his supporters and arrested myriads of others. El-Sissi outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood once again. The courts gave numerous death penalties to young members of the Brotherhood, and many of them were executed immediately. Mohammed Morsi was sentenced to death in 2015, which was overturned by another court in 2016. The court ordered a retrial. Unfortunately, the el-Sissi junta administration treated Morsi harshly in prison. He was never allowed to have proper healthcare, of which he was in dire need. Besides, there are also allegations that the junta gave him poison to cause a slow death instead of the death penalty, which they thought would influence the public to portray Morsi as a hero. Yet, his attitude as a political prisoner was always heroic. As a cultivated member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi never allowed his opponents to place him in an inferior position. He always stood as the leader of a suffering nation and for the people's rights. Mohammed Morsi died on June 17, 2019 under suspicious circumstances. The junta declared that he collapsed in court and soon died at the hospital, which leaves opaque questions about his death.

News article:
Few rulers in history have presented themselves as gods. The best examples were the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, which was home to the most sophisticated civilization of its era. For about 3,000 years, pharaohs ruled the fertile Nile basin pretending to be sacred kings. Dynasty after dynasty, king after king, the status quo never changed in Egypt until the military chiefs of the imperialist period gained some significance. In Egypt's history, ancient or modern, military chiefs as well as the men of God have always had a say in politics. Since Alexander the Great's invasion of Egypt, armies and clergymen have stood side by side. Sometimes, they collaborated to perpetuate the status quo. However, in numerous occasions throughout history, religious scholars and philosophers have been detained, tortured and even killed. Whenever a man of piety, a Moses against the pharaoh, threatened the status quo of the terrestrial "gods" in Egypt, the hierarchical system always found a way to oust him through methods such as exile, imprisonment or execution. Modern Egyptian history is no different. After the "Free Officers" movement overthrew King Farouk, Egypt has been ruled by military pharaohs. From 1953 to 2012, four military chiefs, namely Mohammed Nagib, Gamal Abd al-Nasser, Anwar al-Sadat and Hosni Mubarek, ruled the country pretending to be gods in human bodies. When the Arab Spring began in 2011 and heavy protests in Cairo and elsewhere targeted Mubarek's 30 years of severe rule, everybody waited for the decision of the army chiefs, who ended up not backing the old tyrant, and he fell. While most thought Egyptians really "did it" and that the country's democratic path could not be reversed, the army took an ambiguous position on the political situation, which held the door open for free elections for the first time in Egypt's history. When Mohammed Morsi was elected as the fifth, democratically the first, president of Egypt, many commentators were speaking about the Tahrir protests that helped overthrow Mubarek as the first phase of a possible democratic revolution in the Arab world. Unfortunately, the Arab Spring was suppressed again by a martial act, and the first democratically elected president of Egypt, who died suspiciously in court on June 17, 2019, was imprisoned for the sake of a junta rule headed by Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who was appointed as the chief of military staff by Morsi. Early life Mohammed Morsi was born Muhammad Mohammed Mursi Issa al-Ayyat on Aug. 20, 1951 as the son of a local farmer in Sharqiyyah governorate on the east side of the Nile delta. He studied engineering at Cairo University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1975 and a master's degree in engineering metallurgy in 1978. After that, he moved to the United States for further studies and earned a Ph.D. degree in engineering from the University of Southern California in 1982. For three years, he taught engineering at California State University before he returned to Egypt and began working as a professor of engineering at Zagazig University, a position he held until 2010. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood Like many of his cultivated peers, Morsi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He joined the brotherhood in 1977 and received duties beginning in 1979. He crossed over to the political wing of the movement and rose through the ranks. He was elected to the Youth Committee in 1995. In 2000, he was elected to the People's Assembly, where he held his seat independently since the Muslim Brotherhood was politically banned in Egypt.

News article:
Egypt's ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi was in custody for nearly six years prior to his death, much of it in solitary confinement, and there have been allegations that his lack of access to proper medical care contributed to his death Egypt accused the United Nations on Wednesday of seeking to "politicise" the death of the country's first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi by calling for an "independent inquiry". Foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Hafez said he condemned "in the strongest terms" the call by the spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, for an independent investigation into Morsi's death during a court hearing on Monday. Hafez said it was a "deliberate attempt to politicise a case of natural death." Colville called Tuesday for a probe into whether the conditions Morsi faced during his nearly six years in custody had contributed to his death. "Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death," he said. "Concerns have been raised regarding the conditions of Mr. Morsi's detention, including access to adequate medical care, as well as sufficient access to his lawyers and family," Colville added. He said the investigation must "encompass all aspects of the authorities' treatment of Mr. Morsi to examine whether the conditions of his detention had an impact on his death." Morsi was toppled by then army chief, now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in 2013 after a single divisive year in power. He was later charged with an array of offences including espionage. Since his ouster, authorities have waged an ongoing crackdown on dissent of all kinds that has seen thousands of Brotherhood supporters jailed and hundreds facing death sentences. A group of British parliamentarians in March 2018 warned Morsi's detention conditions, particularly inadequate treatment for his diabetes and liver disease, could trigger "premature death".

Abdullah, son of late Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, has accused incumbent President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and a number of officials of "killing" his father, Anadolu Agency reports. Morsi, the first democratically elected president, died on Monday after falling into a coma inside his soundproof glass cage during his trial on "espionage" charges. In a Thursday tweet, the late president's son named a number of officials whom he called "partners" of al-Sisi "in killing the martyr president". He particularly accused incumbent and former interior ministers Mahmoud Tawfiq and Magdy Abdel Ghaffar, respectively. The names also included judges Shirin Fahmy, Shaaban al-Shami and Ahmed Sabry as well as Attorney General Nabil Sadek and Abbas Kamel, head of intelligence service. READ: Egypt denies family visits to prison in wake of Morsi's death Egyptian authorities have yet to comment on claims by Morsi's son. Morsi, a leading member of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, won Egypt's first free presidential election in 2012. After only a year in office, however, he was ousted and imprisoned in a military coup led by then-Defense Minister Sisi. At the time of his death, Morsi faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with numerous human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated.

News article:
Egyptian authorities on Tuesday detained a leader of the 2011 uprising that unseated long-time president Hosni Mubarak, accusing him and others of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to bring down the government of President Abdel Fattah El Sisi. Former politician Zyad El Elaimy, a prominent member of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party and spokesman for the since-dissolved January 25 Revolution Coalition, was held along with at least seven others who the ministry described as loyal to the Brotherhood. The organisation has been outlawed in Egypt and several other countries in the region, including the UAE. The ministry said Mr El Elaimy and others arrested, including the economist Omar El Shenety and journalists Hossam Monis and Hisam Fouad, were collaborating with wanted Brotherhood members in Turkey to plot violence and riots on the anniversary this week of the June 30 mass protests that led to the military’s removal of Islamist president Mohammed Morsi in 2013. The plan was to “carry out violent and disorderly acts against state institutions simultaneously with [the aim of] creating a state of revolutionary momentum”, the ministry said. It accused five people outside Egypt, including former presidential candidate Ayman Nour and prominent TV personalities Moataz Matar and Mohamed Nasser, of involvement in the alleged plot. The ministry said Mr El Elaimy and the seven other suspects it named were the most prominent figures detained, but did not say how many others were arrested. It said it had also identified and targeted 19 companies and “economic entities” run via “secret methods” by Brotherhood leaders and the “provocateur elements” loyal to the organisation. Footage broadcast on Egyptian television showed police officers raiding the firms in the capital Cairo and the cities of Alexandria and Ismailia. A total of 250 million Egyptian pounds (Dh55m) was seized in the raids, according to a ministry video. Mr El Elaimy’s mother, Ekram Youssef, told Agence France-Presse her son was visiting a friend in the Cairo suburb of Maadi when he was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday. “Some people grabbed him so he started shouting to his friend. He eventually cooperated with them once the friend came,” she said. Mr El Elaimy’s party was one of the main protest groups during the January 2011 uprising that toppled Mr Mubarak, but it strongly opposed the rule of Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader who became Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2012. Morsi was overthrown a year later by the military, led at that time by Mr El Sisi, and jailed on charges including espionage and involvement in killing protesters. He died after a court appearance last week. Gamal Eid, a founder of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, who is representing Mr El Elaimy, said the interior ministry description of those arrested as “provocateur elements” was a term routinely used during the tenure of Mr Mubarak’s last interior minister, Habib Al Adly. “It seems to me that it was difficult for them to describe the detainees as terrorist elements because most of them are leftists,” he said.

The organisation has been outlawed in Egypt and several other countries in the region, including the UAE. The ministry said Mr El Elaimy and others arrested, including the economist Omar El Shenety and journalists Hossam Monis and Hisam Fouad, were collaborating with wanted Brotherhood members in Turkey to plot violence and riots on the anniversary this week of the June 30 mass protests that led to the military’s removal of Islamist president Mohammed Morsi in 2013. The plan was to “carry out violent and disorderly acts against state institutions simultaneously with [the aim of] creating a state of revolutionary momentum”, the ministry said. It accused five people outside Egypt, including former presidential candidate Ayman Nour and prominent TV personalities Moataz Matar and Mohamed Nasser, of involvement in the alleged plot. The ministry said Mr El Elaimy and the seven other suspects it named were the most prominent figures detained, but did not say how many others were arrested. It said it had also identified and targeted 19 companies and “economic entities” run via “secret methods” by Brotherhood leaders and the “provocateur elements” loyal to the organisation. Footage broadcast on Egyptian television showed police officers raiding the firms in the capital Cairo and the cities of Alexandria and Ismailia. A total of 250 million Egyptian pounds (Dh55m) was seized in the raids, according to a ministry video. Mr El Elaimy’s mother, Ekram Youssef, told Agence France-Presse her son was visiting a friend in the Cairo suburb of Maadi when he was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday. “Some people grabbed him so he started shouting to his friend. He eventually cooperated with them once the friend came,” she said. Mr El Elaimy’s party was one of the main protest groups during the January 2011 uprising that toppled Mr Mubarak, but it strongly opposed the rule of Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader who became Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2012. Morsi was overthrown a year later by the military, led at that time by Mr El Sisi, and jailed on charges including espionage and involvement in killing protesters. He died after a court appearance last week. Gamal Eid, a founder of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, who is representing Mr El Elaimy, said the interior ministry description of those arrested as “provocateur elements” was a term routinely used during the tenure of Mr Mubarak’s last interior minister, Habib Al Adly. “It seems to me that it was difficult for them to describe the detainees as terrorist elements because most of them are leftists,” he said.

(Adds number of arrests, political analyst quote) By Amina Ismail and Mohamed Abdellah CAIRO, June 25 (Reuters) - Egypt detained a leading opposition figure and allies on Tuesday on charges of plotting to bring down the government, but opposition groups said the arrests aimed to stymie their preparations for parliamentary elections next year. Zyad Elelaimy, a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party and the Civil Democratic Movement, was held along with at least seven others, the interior ministry said in a statement. Elelaimy, who was also a leading member of the 2011 protests that unseated long time ruler Hosni Mubarak, was arrested minutes after leaving a friend's house in Cairo's Maadi district around 2:20 a.m., eyewitnesses said. "About two minutes after he left we heard him calling us. We looked from our balcony and we saw him being pushed into a civilian car by a large number of people in civilian clothes," a friend, Soha Bayoumi, told Reuters. "It seems that they were waiting for him, it was an ambush," Bayoumi added, saying that the people who arrested Elelaimy identified themselves as national security agents. The interior ministry accused Elelaimy and seven others of involvement in a plan fomented and financed through Muslim Brotherhood leaders abroad "to carry out violent and disorderly acts against state institutions simultaneously with creating a state of revolutionary momentum." The Civil Democratic Movement (CDM), a coalition of Egyptian opposition parties and figures, denied Elelaimy and the others arrested had any connections with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was banned and declared a terrorist organization in Egypt in 2013. One of Elelaimy's colleagues said he believed the arrest was linked to the coalition's move to seek more members to prepare for parliamentary elections next year. "We have nothing to do with the Brotherhood ... I am truly astonished and I don't know why security would be upset that we want to take part in the elections in the framework of the law and constitution," said CDM member Khaled Dawoud, adding that the group has had only one meeting and was planning for another soon. Human rights lawyer Gamal Eid, who is representing some of the defendants, said at least 10 people were arrested in recent days and were being questioned at state security prosecution headquarters on Tuesday. Eid said the charges include financing a terrorist organization and publishing false news. Eid said the case is "fabricated" and aims at "spreading fear" among the opposition ahead of the anniversary of the June 30, 2013 uprising that toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Last week, Mursi suffered a fatal heart attack https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-mursi/egyptian-ex-president-mursi-buried-in-cairo-as-islamists-mourn-idUSKCN1TJ0CE in court at a Cairo prison, authorities said. The Muslim Brotherhood described Mursi's death as "full-fledged murder." Opposition figures and activists Hisham Foad, Hossam Moeness, Omar el-Shenety, Ahmed el-Akabawy and Hassan al-Barbarry were among those who had been arrested in recent days. Since becoming president in 2014, former army chief President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has overseen a crackdown that has swept up Islamists and liberal opponents. At least 60,000 people have been jailed, according to Human Rights Watch. Sisi has denied holding political prisoners and his backers say the measures were necessary to stabilise Egypt. "They regularly arrest people to scare anyone else who consider challenging them, even according to the highly restrictive rules they've set as through the parliament," said Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. "They want to destroy any hope in the public that they have a place in Egypt's political life," Kaldas said.

News article:
Egyptian police - Reuters KUWAIT CITY, June 26 (MENA) - Kuwaiti newspapers out Wednesday highlighted Egyptian authorities' success in foiling a plot by Muslim Brotherhood to target state facilities during celebrations of June 30 revolution anniversary. Headlined "Egypt foils MB plot to target Egyptian economy", Al Seyassah newspaper said the Egyptian Interior Ministry succeeded in targeting 19 economic entities run by MB leaderships secretly to harm national economy. The ministry released a videotape shedding light on these companies and some Egyptian figures, including former lawmakers and fugitive MB leaderships. Al Nahar newspaper also talked about the MB scheme known as "Al Amal Plan". The scheme is based on uniting the ranks of the members of the terrorist group and providing them with the financial support they need from the revenues and profits of some economic entities that are run by the group's leaders and their affiliates to target the state's facilities and institutions during the celebrations. Information received by the National Security Service revealed that the plan is focused on establishing routes for the financial funds sent illegally from abroad by some hostile countries to work on carrying out violent and riot acts across the country to disrupt celebrations of the revolution's anniversary. The scheme aimed at launching inciting campaigns in the media and through the social media and satellite TV channels that are broadcast from outside the country. The Interior Ministry's statement identified some of the MB leaders who are involved in the plan including Mahmoud Hussein, Ali Bateekh, anchor Moataz Matar, Mohammed Nasser as well as the fugitive leader of El Ghad Party Ayman Nour.

News article:
The children of high-profile Muslim Brotherhood members being detained in the same prison as Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi, before his sudden death last week, say that they fear for their parents' health. Morsi, 67, died after collapsing during a court appearance at Cairo's Tora prison complex. He had been in prison undergoing multiple trials since the military led by then-Defense Minister and Chief of Staff Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi ousted him in July 2013 and launched a massive crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters. Other senior Brotherhood members are jailed in Tora's maximum-security "Scorpion" wing, often in solitary confinement. The families of four detainees, all at Tora, said their relatives were being held under extremely poor conditions, deprived of adequate health care. As Reuters reported, an Interior Ministry spokesman and Egypt's State Information Service, which handles relations with the foreign media, did not respond to several calls and messages seeking comment about the families' accounts, including accusations that some of their relatives needed surgery for abuse suffered in detention. Egyptian officials have previously denied mistreating prisoners or neglecting their health. The Egyptian authorities "put Morsi in solitary confinement... they withheld medication and gave him disgusting food... they did not give him the most basic human rights," the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party said in a statement published on its website. The death of Morsi on June 17 has caused massive backlash from the international community as it was widely speculated that his death was the result of mistreatment rather than natural causes. Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a 68-year-old former presidential candidate who ran for election against Morsi in 2012, is being held in Tora's Al Mazra wing. Arrested in February 2018, he is being held in pretrial detention over alleged connections with the now-banned Brotherhood. He denies the charges, according to his son Ahmed. Aboul Fotouh has diabetes, hypertension, heart and respiration problems, which require him to sleep with an oxygen machine that he brought with him but does not work properly in the high temperatures of the prison cell, Ahmed told Reuters. "The doctor said he has to undergo a prostate operation but they are not allowing it," he said. "They are deliberately not protecting his health... If they continue treating him like this, it will lead to the same result as Morsi," he added. Former Morsi aide Essam al-Haddad has been in solitary confinement since his arrest six years ago and was moved to a solitary cell in the Tora hospital complex after having several heart attacks, his son Abdullah said. "His health has deteriorated significantly," Abdullah said. Another of Haddad's sons, Gihad, a Brotherhood spokesman, is held in Scorpion, where he suffered physical abuse after writing an opinion piece defending the movement for The New York Times in 2017, Abdullah said. "He was beaten and physically tortured," he continued, adding that: "He says that his knee feels numb and he isn't getting any therapy... he is on the verge of losing his leg." A Cairo court overturned life sentences for espionage against Essam and Gihad in 2016, but both men are being retried. According to one Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimate published in 2017, at least 60,000 people have been detained on political grounds since 2013. Liberal opposition figures swept up in el-Sissi's crackdown on dissent are also being held in the Tora prisons. Morsi was being held in Tora's al-Molhaq prison and had been in solitary confinement since his arrest in 2013, according to his family. He had previously fainted during hearings, suffered diabetic comas, developed a condition in his left eye, and had back and neck pain from sleeping on the bare floor of his cell, according to statements from HRW, citing Morsi's court testimony and the rights group's interviews with relatives. His family was only allowed to visit three times in six years, his son Abdullah told Reuters, accusing authorities of "gross medical negligence." The State Information Service said last week that Morsi's last official health request in November 2017, to be treated at his own expense, had been approved, and that an official report from the same year found he was suffering from diabetes but otherwise healthy. A year later, a panel of British members of Parliament that reviewed evidence about Morsi's detention conditions in 2018 at the request of Morsi's family found he was receiving "inadequate medical care," including for diabetes and liver disease, and that this was what "likely led to premature death."

News article:
Muslim Brotherhood supporters in the United States continue to mourn former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi’s death last week. Morsi suffered an apparent heart attack during a court proceding where he faced espionage charges. Some supporters say it took more than 20 minutes for Morsi to receive medical attention. Human Rights Watch claims he died after “years of government mistreatment, prolonged solitary confinement, inadequate medical care” and more. Morsi had served one year as president before the Egyptian army, responding to massive street protests, toppled his Muslim Brotherhood-led government in 2013. His supporters accuse Egypt of murdering Morsi, implying harsh conditions in the country’s jails triggered an apparent heart attack. Somehow, though, mourners at a memorial service last Wednesday in New Jersey, found a way to make Morsi’s death about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The event was almost entirely in Arabic, videos posted to YouTube show. The Investigative Project on Terrorism translated what was said. “Dr. Mohamed Morsi was killed because he challenged the world order and said ‘No, we will not leave Gaza alone. We will not leave Gaza alone,'” said Hani Elkadi, president of the Brotherhood-supporting Egyptian Americans for Freedom and Justice (EAFJ). Elkadi’s consistent Brotherhood support includes social media posts mourning the death of a leader who spun off two terrorist branches and encouraging Egyptian youth to wage jihad against the military government. Morsi had been out of power six years when he died last week. His thoughts on Gaza were relevant for a relatively brief time. Elkadi also placed Morsi among the Brotherhood’s most revered martyrs – Sayyid Qutb, who was executed by Egypt in 1966 for plotting against the Nasser government, and Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna, who was assassinated in 1949. Morsi’s image dominated a giant poster at the service, which drew about 50 people to a meeting hall in North Bergen, N.J. “Condolences and absentee funeral prayer of Dr. Mohamed Morsi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt,” the poster said in Arabic. It claimed to speak for “The Muslim Community in the United States of America.” Said Abbasy, vice president of the Egyptian Americans for Democracy and Human Rights (EADHR), a group similar to Elkadi’s EAFJ, also spent part of his eulogy making up a story about Israel’s glee over Morsi’s passing and issuing a threat. “An Israeli Zionist report came out today from the tombs,” Abbasy said. “They are happy that President Mohamed Morsi is lying in a tomb. They are telling Israel it is safe now. By Allah, you will not be safe. By Allah, you will not be safe as, Allah willing, the blood of the martyr President Mohamed Morsi will be a curse upon you, and upon all the criminals and the hypocrites, and we will pursue our revolution, as revolutionists, as freemen, we will continue the path.” Morsi did reopen the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but never took aggressive action against Israel. He left Egypt’s 1978 peace treaty with Israel intact. Many Egyptians, especially those who marched against him, believed that Morsi spent his time in office trying to entrench the Muslim Brotherhood’s control at the expense of economic and quality of life needs of Egyptians. He pushed a theocratic constitution and tried to seize emergency powers over the courts. He was a fallback candidate, chosen as the Brotherhood’s presidential nominee only after the Brotherhood’s original presidential choice was disqualified. In death, however, the New Jersey activists elevated him to a hero of the Palestinian cause. Across the country, the Islamic Center of Southern California (ICSC) allegedly prohibited Khaled Abou El Fadl from talking about Morsi during a sermon El Fadl was invited to give after Friday prayer. El Fadl blasted the mosque and its leaders during a 50-minute video posted on YouTube. The mosque prefers to avoid divisive political discussions after prayer unless they directly affect American Muslims, El Fadl said he was told. That’s tantamount to censoring him, he said, calling the action “authoritarian and despotic garbage.” Mosque leaders are “ignorant idiots” who don’t represent Islam, El Fadl said. “You are an embarrassment to Islam.” He wasn’t a Morsi supporter, he said, but he did want to talk about Egypt’s human rights record. The New Jersey mourners also blasted Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s government, but their support for Morsi and the Brothers repeatedly was made clear. Mohammad Qatanani, a Hamas-supporter who serves as imam at the Islamic Center of Passaic County, said Morsi was “known for his love for Egypt, and his love to humanity, and his love of truth, his love for democracy, and for his love to support the oppressed in Syria, in Palestine, and everywhere. He was truly a human being, he did not lose anything. He gained martyrdom, but Egypt lost him, the Muslim ummah [nation] lost him, the pious men on earth lost him, Palestine lost him and Syria lost him.” Morsi’s love of democracy appeared limited, given the anti-democratic acts he took in office and his failure to protect Egypt’s Coptic Christian minority. Qatanani, meanwhile, called for a new intifada – a violent Palestinian uprising – during a 2017 rally in New York: “Our message to the Palestinian authority, you have to stop all kinds of peace process, no peace process and negotiation with the occupation in Palestine. Oslo has to be stopped and to be finished. We have to start a new intifada. Intifada, intifada!” Morsi, Syrian doctor Fahmy Khairullah said at last week’s memorial, was no “regular man nor a passerby. But rather, we are sorrowful and aching to mourn a man who is equal to a whole nation, a man who has revived his nation that has been engulfed by the beasts of ZioCrusades. And, by the way, many people refrain from mentioning Zionism and Crusaders claiming, ‘oh brother, it’s not right.’ But I will call things by their names. He has renewed hope for people who have been engulfed by the beasts of ZioCrusades and by the moral and religious decay in the time of fake modernization.” Morsi, he said, “has joined the ranks of martyrs. He will gladly meet with his lord. He must have joined the leaders of the ummah today with the omnipotent God, such as [Hamas spiritual leader] Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, may Allah rest his soul.” Morsi’s American mourners follow groups that have “freedom,” “justice” and “democracy” in their names. But the groups’ rhetoric consistently shows a hatred for Israel and support for political violence, by Egyptians, Palestinians and more. Their sadness over Morsi’s death was no exception.

Many Egyptians, especially those who marched against him, believed that Morsi spent his time in office trying to entrench the Muslim Brotherhood’s control at the expense of economic and quality of life needs of Egyptians. He pushed a theocratic constitution and tried to seize emergency powers over the courts. He was a fallback candidate, chosen as the Brotherhood’s presidential nominee only after the Brotherhood’s original presidential choice was disqualified. In death, however, the New Jersey activists elevated him to a hero of the Palestinian cause. Across the country, the Islamic Center of Southern California (ICSC) allegedly prohibited Khaled Abou El Fadl from talking about Morsi during a sermon El Fadl was invited to give after Friday prayer. El Fadl blasted the mosque and its leaders during a 50-minute video posted on YouTube. The mosque prefers to avoid divisive political discussions after prayer unless they directly affect American Muslims, El Fadl said he was told. That’s tantamount to censoring him, he said, calling the action “authoritarian and despotic garbage.” Mosque leaders are “ignorant idiots” who don’t represent Islam, El Fadl said. “You are an embarrassment to Islam.” He wasn’t a Morsi supporter, he said, but he did want to talk about Egypt’s human rights record. The New Jersey mourners also blasted Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s government, but their support for Morsi and the Brothers repeatedly was made clear. Mohammad Qatanani, a Hamas-supporter who serves as imam at the Islamic Center of Passaic County, said Morsi was “known for his love for Egypt, and his love to humanity, and his love of truth, his love for democracy, and for his love to support the oppressed in Syria, in Palestine, and everywhere. He was truly a human being, he did not lose anything. He gained martyrdom, but Egypt lost him, the Muslim ummah [nation] lost him, the pious men on earth lost him, Palestine lost him and Syria lost him.” Morsi’s love of democracy appeared limited, given the anti-democratic acts he took in office and his failure to protect Egypt’s Coptic Christian minority. Qatanani, meanwhile, called for a new intifada – a violent Palestinian uprising – during a 2017 rally in New York: “Our message to the Palestinian authority, you have to stop all kinds of peace process, no peace process and negotiation with the occupation in Palestine. Oslo has to be stopped and to be finished. We have to start a new intifada. Intifada, intifada!” Morsi, Syrian doctor Fahmy Khairullah said at last week’s memorial, was no “regular man nor a passerby. But rather, we are sorrowful and aching to mourn a man who is equal to a whole nation, a man who has revived his nation that has been engulfed by the beasts of ZioCrusades. And, by the way, many people refrain from mentioning Zionism and Crusaders claiming, ‘oh brother, it’s not right.’ But I will call things by their names. He has renewed hope for people who have been engulfed by the beasts of ZioCrusades and by the moral and religious decay in the time of fake modernization.” Morsi, he said, “has joined the ranks of martyrs. He will gladly meet with his lord. He must have joined the leaders of the ummah today with the omnipotent God, such as [Hamas spiritual leader] Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, may Allah rest his soul.” Morsi’s American mourners follow groups that have “freedom,” “justice” and “democracy” in their names. But the groups’ rhetoric consistently shows a hatred for Israel and support for political violence, by Egyptians, Palestinians and more. Their sadness over Morsi’s death was no exception.

Compiled photo, from left: HishamFouad, Omar al-Shenety, Zyad al-Elemy CAIRO – 2 July 2019: The number of defendants accused of joining the so-called Al-Amal (Hope) Plan cell, believed to be formed by the Muslim Brotherhood group, has increased to 18 people, legal sources revealed, 13 of whom were imprisoned, and five are runaways. The Muslim Brotherhood has been designated by the Egyptian state as a terrorist group since late 2013, following violent clashes between their supporters and the police forces in August of the same year. The defendants are accused of joining and funding a terrorist group that was unlawfully established, and also using social media platforms to disseminate fake news. This comes after Taqwa Abdel Rady and Lo’yaSabry, two female defendants in the case were detained for 15 days pending investigation. Moreover, the State Security Prosecution ordered seizing the funds of a number of defendants including politicians and economy figures in the case. It also ordered banning the defendants from travelling outside the country. Defendants in the case include Moustafa Abdel Mo'ez, Osama al-Akabawi, Omar al-Shenety, Hossam Mo'nis, Zyad al-Elemy, Hisham Fouad, Hassan Barbari, Ahmed Tammam, Khaled Abu Shadi, Lo'ya Sabry and Taqwa Abdel Rady. The runaways are Ayman Nour, owner and manager of pro-Muslim Brotherhood Al-Sharq TV; pro-Muslim Brotherhood TV presenters Mo'taz Matar and Mohamed Nasser; and Muslim-Brotherhood-affiliated figures Mahmoud Hussein and Ali Bateekh. Security authorities also ordered moving the defendants, including Qassem Abdel Kafi, to Cairo's Tura Prison, after the prosecution had ordered detaining the defendants for 15 days pending investigations. Hope Plan, according to a security statement, is a terrorist plot by Muslim Brotherhood leaders to target the state facilities institutions. The arrested figures are believed to be Muslim Brotherhood operatives. According to a statement by the Interior Ministry, the scheme worked on uniting the Brotherhood group members, funding them from the revenues of some economic entities as they sought to topple the state and its institutions on the June 30 Uprising anniversary. Information received by the National Security Service revealed that the plan is focused on establishing routes for the financial funds sent illegally from abroad by some hostile countries to work on carrying out violent acts across the country to disrupt celebrations of the revolution's anniversary, the statement said. The statement also noted that the scheme aimed at launching "inciting" campaigns in the media and on the social media and satellite TV channels that are broadcast from outside the country. Acting on such information, security forces, in coordination with the High State Security Prosecution, targeted 19 economic entities which are secretly run by the MB leaders and seized documents, amounts of money and electronic devices that were in their possession, the statement added.

News article:
(MENAFN- The Peninsula) ANKARA: Six years ago, the Egyptian army's tanks gathered close to the well-known Al-Tahrir square announcing an end of the only one-year-long Egyptian democracy. However, this year's anniversary comes amid extreme grief filling the pro-uprising figures after their iconic leader Mohammed Morsi passed away during a court appearance. Following 18 days of unabated protests, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for three decades, was eventually forced to step down and relinquish power to the Egyptian military. Morsi was elected as the first ever democratically elected president in the Egyptian history by winning the first post-revolution presidential election in 2012. In 2013, Morsi said the Egyptian uprising that broke out in Jan. 25, 2011 "achieved -- and will continue to achieve -- its goals. However, he went on to warn the public of covert attempts to "steal" the uprising and subvert its goals. Only after a year in power, Egypt witnessed army-backed protests before then Egyptian defense minister and current President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi overthrew him in a military coup. On June 30, 2013, tens of thousands of people -- egged on by the media -- took part in anti-Morsi demonstrations, while Morsi's followers hit the streets in support of the embattled president. Three days later, the army ousted and imprisoned Morsi in a coup led by al-Sisi. The following year, al-Sisi was elected president. Following Morsi's ouster, the Egyptian authorities launched a relentless crackdown on political dissent, killing or imprisoning thousands of Morsi's supporters and members of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood. Dozens of youth were also slapped with death penalty for "politically-motivated" charges and violence took place after the coup. Fake and politically motivated charges Morsi was abducted and imprisoned, facing a host of charges many believed they were totally "fake and politically motivated." There were six charges against the former leader, including "jailbreak, murder, spying for Qatar, spying for Hamas and Hezbollah, insulting the judiciary and involvement in terrorism". Morsi's family along with local and international organizations repeatedly complained about his worsening health conditions in prison and his solitary confinement. All of these appeals were ignored by the Egyptian authorities. Abdel-Monem Abdel-Maqsoud, a lawyer for the former president, announced Morsi's death on June 17 during a court appearance, saying that the "mistreatment and the medical neglect" led to his martyrdom. Morsi was labelled by many observers and analysts as the "icon of the Egyptian revolution," after his steadfastness and insistence on the uprising principles against the "counter-revolution bids to thwart its goals". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Morsi "a martyr who died struggling for his cause", saying history will never forget the tyrants who caused his martyrdom. Shireen Mazari, Pakistan's minister for human rights, said: "Morsi's incarceration & amp; death symbolize the tragedy of democracy struggling under shadow of Uncle Sam. What promise the Arab Spring held & amp; how it was destroyed - is similar to what happened to Allende & amp; other democratic nationalist forces around the world inimical to the powerful!" Abderrazak Makri, the leader of Algeria's largest Islamic party Movement for the Society of Peace, described Morsi the "oppressed legitimate Egyptian president". Tunisia's Ennahda Movement wished that may Morsi's death becomes "a reason to put an end to the suffering of thousands of political prisoners in Egypt" and for starting dialogue for a new democratic political life. In Libya, Mohamed al-Amari, a member of the UN-recognized Libyan Presidential Council, described Morsi as a martyr, adding he had "set an example with his patience, steadfastness and adherence to his principles".

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirms that Israelis will be present at the Bahrain economic peace workshop being held next week, and says Israel has secret ties with “most” Arab countries. “In the open or in secret, we are in contact with many leaders from the Arab world and there are prodigious ties between Israel and Arab countries — with most Arab countries,” Netanyahu says at a memorial for those killed in the 1948 bombing of the Altalena arms ship. He adds that he praises the US “for trying to bring a better future to the region” and calls the Bahrain meeting very important. The US said Monday that no Israeli officials would be invited to the conference to keep it apolitical. On Tuesday former general Yoav Mordechai said he was invited and would attend the conference. Netanyahu also plays up a meeting in Jerusalem next week between Israeli National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat and his US and Russian counterparts John Bolton and Nikolay Patrushev. “This is an extremely important summit for ensuring the stability of the region,” he says.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting at his Jerusalem office December 2, 2018. Gali Tibbon/Pool via REUTERS Tel Aviv - Asharq Al-Awsat Former general Yoav Mordechai, who served as Israel's chief liaison officer, will be one of the top Israeli businessmen attending the upcoming US-led workshop in Bahrain next week, held for the Palestinian economy. The ex-general, who stepped down as head of Israel's military-run COGAT liaison agency in 2018, now heads Novard, an international consultancy. Known for his far-reaching ties with some Arab countries, Mordechai has great command of the Arabic language. He will be attending the workshop next to an entourage of other Israeli businessmen. No official political figure was invited to the event. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, refused downplaying the importance of Israel’s participation. “An important conference will soon be held in Bahrain and Israelis will of course participate,” Netanyahu said at an event in Tel Aviv. “We welcome American attempts to provide regional solutions for a better future,” he added. The White House had decided not to involve the Israeli government in the workshop, and announced that the Trump administration wanted to focus on the economic aspect solely, and avoid the conference having a political motif. Washington has refrained from inviting an official Israeli representative given the Palestinian Authority boycotting the conference, which is planned to promote economic cooperation between Israel and the PA without involving politics. The conference is slated for June 25-26 in Manama. It is supposed to be a prelude to a diplomatic initiative for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Washington has refrained from inviting an official Israeli representative given the Palestinian Authority boycotting the conference, which is planned to promote economic cooperation between Israel and the PA without involving politics. The conference is slated for June 25-26 in Manama. It is supposed to be a prelude to a diplomatic initiative for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

News article:
Bahrain will allow journalists from six different Israeli media outlets to enter the country next week to cover the U.S.-sponsored economic workshop in Manama, Channel 13 News reported on Wednesday. Bahrain reportedly approved the entry of the Israelis at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. It was an unprecedented move by Bahrain, a country that does not have diplomatic ties with Israel, which for the first time will allow Israeli journalists to report from its soil. U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt confirmed the report and tweeted: “There are those working to improve the lives of Israelis, Palestinians & others in the region, and to see if peace can be achieved. Bahrain is one such country. The USA very much appreciates Bahrain’s efforts.” As previously reported, neither Israeli nor Palestinian political leaders will be attending the June 25-26 event. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Greenblatt emphasized the apolitical nature of the “workshop,” saying that since the Palestinian Authority had chosen to boycott event, Israeli government officials would not be invited either, nor would other world leaders or foreign ministers. In addition to Israel and the Palestinians, Russia and China will also not be attending. The European Union will only send a “technical level official” to Bahrain, said E.U. High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, who met with Kushner last week in advance of the conference. Nevertheless, several Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, have said that they will attend. The two-day workshop will include keynote speeches, while delegations will hear plans to improve the economic situation and quality of life for Palestinians in Judea and Samaria, and Gaza. Additionally, work teams will sit down together for discussions, including the Israeli team with its Arab counterparts. The Israeli delegation will include Maj. Gen. (ret.) Yoav Mordechai, who has developed influential ties in the Arab world over the years. Mordechai, who is fluent in Arabic, stepped down last year as head of Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories unit and now heads Novard, an international consultancy firm. Israel Radio said a hospital director and several social activists were also expected to participate. This article originally appeared in Israel Hayom.

(MENAFN- Kashmir Observer) JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israelis will take part in a conference in Bahrain next week that is part of the United States' Middle East peace plan. 'An important conference will soon be held in Bahrain and Israelis will of course participate,' Netanyahu said at an event in Tel Aviv. US President Donald Trump's administration organised the conference, which is to be held on June 25 and 26 in Manama, Bahrain for the unveiling of the economic component of the US peace plan. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been drafting the long-awaited plan, but it has been rejected in advance by the Palestinians, who expect the proposals to heavily favour Israel. The plan is aimed at providing economic opportunities for the Palestinians, but Kushner has hinted it will not endorse international calls for the creation of a Palestinian state. 'We welcome American attempts to provide regional solutions for a better future,' Netanyahu said. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Monday that Israel would be represented at the conference, without giving further details. US allies the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have announced they will take part in the conference. The White House has also said that Egypt, Jordan and Morocco will attend, although these three countries have yet to confirm this. The Palestinian leadership has said it will boycott the US-led peace conference, and a number of prominent Palestinian businessmen have also rejected invites. The Palestinians have boycotted the US administration since Trump broke with decades of consensus and recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. They consider the eastern part of the city the capital of their own future state. Media reports in Israel on Tuesday said the country would only be represented by private businessmen.

Following mediation by Jared Kushner, adviser and son-in-law of US President Donald Trump, Bahrain announced, on Wednesday, that it would allow six Israeli media outlets to cover the US-led “Bahrain Workshop,” scheduled for next week. Bahrain does not have official diplomatic relations with Israel, and, for the first time, allows an Israeli media delegation to enter. According to Haaretz newspaper, Bahrain agreed to allow the entry of Israeli journalists following the request of the White House staff responsible for the “Deal of the Century,” headed by Kushner, knowing that Haaretz was among Israeli media allowed to cover the Economic ‘Workshop’ in Manama, in order not to “turn it into a political one.” The Israeli delegation was supposed to be headed by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, but was suspended after the White House announcement. On the other hand, the White House invited Israeli businessmen to participate, but their names have yet to be officially published. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday, announced the participation of Israelis in the workshop, without specifying the names of those invited to participate. “We welcome US initiatives that include regional solutions for a better future,” Netanyahu said. “We have clear and hidden relations with many Arab leaders, and there are wide-ranging relations between Israel and most of the Arab countries.” According to the PNN, Reuters quoted a source familiar with the list of Israeli invitees as saying that the former coordinator of the Israeli government’s occupation of the occupied territories in 1967, Yoav Mordechai, who currently heads Novard International Consulting, will participate in the economic workshop. The source added that Mordechai would attend the Manama conference, with his partner, in Novard. The source refused to mention the second man because he had also worked, for a long time, in the Israeli security services.

News article:
The United States is set to co-chair a two-day conference in Bahrain from Tuesday focusing on the economic aspects of President Donald Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.The workshop in Manama will bring together government, civil society and business leaders, according to a joint statement by the two organising countries, with the declared aim of achieving Palestinian prosperity.The Bahrain conference could see large-scale investment pledges for the Palestinian territories but is unlikely to focus heavily on the political issues at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The Palestinians confirmed in May they will not participate in the conference, adding they were not consulted beforehand."Palestine will not attend the Manama meeting," a statement on the Palestine Liberation Organisation's (PLO) website said."This is a collective Palestinian position, from President Mahmud Abbas and the PLO Executive Committee to all Palestinian political movements and factions, national figures, private sector and civil society."Abbas reiterated his position on Saturday as the US unveiled details of the plan, saying a political solution must come before any discussion of economic issues.The Palestinians have boycotted the US administration since Trump broke with decades of consensus and recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017.They consider the eastern part of the city the capital of their future state and have opposed the proposed US peace plan, which they fear will be heavily biased in favour of Israel.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israelis will attend."An important conference will soon be held in Bahrain and Israelis will of course participate," he said this week.However, it was unclear whether Israel would be represented by government officials or business leaders.Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last month welcomed the economic conference.Riyadh said it would dispatch Economy and Planning Minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri to the meeting.It added the participation reaffirms the kingdom's "firm position to support the Palestinian people to achieve their stability and growth", according to the official Saudi Press Agency.Abu Dhabi's foreign ministry said it would send a delegation, while reiterating that it supports the establishment of a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.It remains unclear whether Qatar - isolated by regional former allies, including Bahrain, in a long-running diplomatic dispute - will attend the conference.Doha, a close US ally, said it "has followed the call by the United States" to hold a workshop in Manama, according to a foreign ministry statement.It added it will "spare no effort" to address challenges facing the Arab region but did not say whether Qatar will be represented at the meeting.Kuwait and Oman have not confirmed if they will attend.The White House said on June 12 that Egypt, Morocco and Jordan have agreed to attend the workshop.The three US allies "informed us that they will be attending the workshop," a senior White House official told AFP on condition of anonymity.Jordan and Egypt - the only Arab countries to have signed peace deals with Israel - finally confirmed their attendance on June 22.The treaty in Jordan, however, is overwhelmingly opposed by the people - more than half of whom are of Palestinian origin.The United Nations announced on June 12 that it would send its deputy Middle East coordinator Jamie McGoldrick to the event.

Jordan and Egypt have said they will send officials from their finance ministries to take part in an economic conference in Bahrain on a U.S.-led Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Hafez told AFP that Cairo will send a delegation headed by a deputy finance minister to the meeting - due to take place in Manama on June 25 and 26 - without specifying the name. In Jordan, foreign ministry spokesman Sufyan al-Qudah confirmed to journalists that his country will dispatch the secretary general to the finance ministry, again without giving a name. Qudah insisted however that "no economic proposal could replace a political solution that ends the occupation" of Palestinian territories by Israel. The White House said on June 12 that Egypt, Morocco and Jordan have agreed to attend the workshop. But Jordan and Egypt -- the only Arab countries to have signed peace deals with Israel -- did not immediately confirm they would take part in the Bahrain meeting. Morocco has not yet confirmed its intentions. The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the two-day conference -- dubbed the Peace to Prosperity Workshop -- charging that pro-Israel U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to buy the Palestinians and deprive them of an independent state. The U.S. said Saturday that its Middle East peace plan aims to raise more than $50 billion (44 billion euros) for the Palestinians and create one million jobs for them. In a move likely to deepen its rift with the Palestinians, the White House said that money would be administered by a multinational development bank -- not the Palestinian Authority -- as a way to ensure better governance and prevent corruption.

(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) By Rola Al-Riyashi WASHINGTON, June 24 (KUNA) -- Bahrain will host on Tuesday (tomorrow) an economic workshop entitled "from peace to prosperity" to discuss economic prospects of Palestinian people and the region's nations that could lead to a peace between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. However, Palestine announced its boycott of the workshop, which will only include some Israeli businesspersons. The economic part of the US peace plan known as "the deal of the century" is expected to announce during the workshop that aims to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Last May, Bahrain and the United States announced in a joint statement that Manama would host the two-day workshop, on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the statement, the workshop constitutes a pivotal chance to bring together leaders of governments and civil society, and businesspersons in order to share ideas and discuss strategies as well as mobilize support for possible economic initiatives and investments that could be achieved through a peace deal. Both Bahrain and the US considered that the workshop aims to facilitate talks on an applicable vision and a framework for a prosperous future for Palestinian people and the region's nations, including improving economic governance, developing human capital and facilitating rapid growth of the private sector. If this vision is achieved, it will change radically lives of peoples and make a brighter future for the region. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he is looking forward to "these important talks" regarding providing new and exciting chances to Palestinian people that could enable them to achieve at the maximum level. The workshop gathers leaders from the Middle East region to enhance economic growth and create opportunities for peoples in this key region, he added. Meanwhile, Bahrain's Minister of Finance and National Economy Sheikh Salman Bin Khalifa Al-Khalifa said that the workshop would shed light on the strategic partnership between the United States and Bahrain, and their keenness on creating economic chances to benefit the region. However, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Palestinian Authority's spokesman, said on June 18 that "any meeting, whether in Bahrain or elsewhere and without the legitimate Palestinian endorsement, proves that Washington cannot and will not succeed on its own in achieving anything". In reply to Abu Rudeineh's statement, President Donald Trump's Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt wrote on his Twitter account that Abu Rudeineh misunderstood the US stance, adding Washington understands that a peace deal will not be achieved without the Palestinian leadership. However, if a peace deal is not be achieved, it will be a loss to the Palestinians not to the Americans, he noted. "The PA (Palestinian Authority) is asking for more money from the Arab countries, but they won't come to a workshop which is designed to improve their economy & taper off endless aid. I think we all have to recognize that the endless aid (& rewarding terrorists) has to end. Time for a new paradigm," he tweeted. "The PA is calling for demonstrations against the Bahrain workshop. Tells you everything you need to know about their priorities & intentions. Their leadership is happy w/ the status quo & would rather Palestinians suffer than at least explore a different path for a better future," he wrote. The Palestinian side announced its boycott of the workshop, stressing its firm demand on finding a political solution to the Palestinian cause through ending the Israeli occupation, and establishing an independent state on 1967 borders and in accordance with the international legitimacy's resolutions.(end) rsr.hm MENAFN2406201900710000ID1098677136

News article:
CHICAGO: Although the fractious Palestinian leadership will not be present, President Donald Trump unveiled details of his “Peace to Prosperity” plan that will be the focus of workshops and meetings in Bahrain this week attended by representatives from the Arab world and America. In a statement on Sunday, Trump announced: “Today, the United States Government announced ‘Peace to Prosperity,’ a new vision for the Palestinians and the broader Middle East region. Through its supporting programs and projects, ‘Peace to Prosperity’ aspires to empower the Palestinian people to build a prosperous and vibrant Palestinian society. The economic plan consists of three initiatives that will support distinct pillars of the Palestinian society: the economy, the people, and its governance.” “With the potential to facilitate more than $50 billion in new investment over 10 years, ‘Peace to Prosperity’ represents the most ambitious and comprehensive international effort for the Palestinians to date.” Surprisingly, and despite criticism that the Bahrain conference is intended as a eulogy for Palestinian rights, the documents released by the Trump White House seem to emphasize at every turn the requirement to address the “needs” of the Palestinians. “Generations of Palestinians have lived without knowing peace, and the West Bank and Gaza have fallen into a protracted crisis,” the introduction to the plan begins. “Yet the Palestinian story will not end here. The Palestinian people continue their historic endeavor to realize their aspirations and build a better future for their children.” The plan envisions a goal of providing up to $50 billion in financial support to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to build a prosperous and vibrant Palestinian society upon three initiatives to support “the economy, the people, and the government.” The $50 billion will be divided among Palestinian needs but also support programs for Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon, according to the plan. Palestinians are to receive nearly $28 billion while Jordan will get $7 billion, Egypt $9 billion and Lebanon $6 billion. The White House document, which will be delivered by Trump’s son-in-law and special Middle East representative, Jared Kushner, and special Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, during meetings with representatives from countries including the UAE, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, predicts it will empower Palestinians “to build the society that they have aspired to establish for generations.” Writing on Twitter, Greenblatt said: “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confirms that His Excellency Minister of Economy and Planning Mohammed Al-Tuwaijri will participate in the ‘Peace to Prosperity’ workshop organized by the Kingdom of Bahrain in partnership with the USA.” FAST FACT The plan envisions a goal of providing up to $50 billion in financial support to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to build a prosperous and vibrant Palestinian society upon three initiatives to support the economy, the people, and the government. But the plan clearly carries a caveat: “Ultimately, however, the power to unlock it lies in the hands of the Palestinian people. Only through peace can the Palestinians achieve prosperity.” Trump said that the Israeli government was not invited to the conference in Bahrain only because no officials from the Palestinian National Authority and government of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would be attending. Although the US has frozen most grant funds to the Palestinians during the past year, in response to the refusal of Palestinians to participate in peace talks with Israel, the plan appears to be a basis for the delivery of a new funding system for Palestinian needs. The plan is outlined on a website launched by the White House at www.whitehouse.gov/peacetoprosperity/. Most of the funds will come from grants ($13 billion), loans ($26 billion) and private capital ($12 billion). A key focus of the plan is the expansion of transportation services to Palestinians in both the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Israeli-controlled Gaza Strip. Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 but has since established an oppressive embargo. The 95-page document also details goals for business development, health care, building government civil service operations, a legal and tax system, defining property rights, “judicial independence,” creating international trade and foreign direct investment, and a system of accountability and government transparency. In addition, it calls for supporting arts and culture, sports, education and training. The goal, according to the plan, is to “empower the Palestinian people.” Not discussed in the plan are the current Israeli military controls over Palestinians, the Israeli policy of confiscating Arab-owned land to build Jewish-only settlements, and Israel’s policies of extrajudicial killing and the targeting of individuals it asserts are engaged in violence.

News article:
The United States is holding an international conference – in reality an economic workshop – in Bahrain on June 25-26 to launch the Middle East peace plan by encouraging investment and economic promises in the Palestinian territory. The Bahrain conference, which will bring together government and business leaders from different countries, is the first part of U.S. President Donald Trump's regional peace plan, the so-called "Deal of the Century." The Trump administration will attempt to start the economic plan and then continue with political proposals. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Trump's regional representative, Jason Greenblatt, are the masterminds behind the conference and the plan. Trump's negotiation team wants to outline economic components of their regional peace plan with this conference. They want to persuade regional actors through economic promises. However, it seems that the conference is destined to fail for several reasons. First, Palestinians are boycotting the gathering. All major Palestinian actors, including the Palestinian Authority, Fatah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, are strongly against the conference. Palestinian officials and the public believe that the U.S. efforts are heavily biased in favor of the Israeli state and that the Trump administration ignores Palestinian needs. Palestinians claim that the Trump administration – who unilaterally declared the united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, cut aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and recognized the Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights – cannot be a mediator or power broker anymore. Second, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's failure to establish a coalition government has led to political instability in Israel, which must renew general elections in next September. The future of the Israeli government is uncertain. Furthermore, since Bahrain still does not recognize Israel, Israeli officials will not attend the conference. Only some Israeli business leaders will participate as representatives of their country. Third, the conference is only another one of Trump's unilateral attempts and it is supported by regional and global actors. That is, many regional actors and global powers are against Trump's perspective on the region. On a regional level, Iran and Turkey, two strong regional powers and two game-changers in the Middle East, remain insistently against the unilateral American attempts in the region. On the other hand, many Arab countries are reluctant to participate in the conference. For instance, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman are unwilling to participate. Jordan and Egypt were hesitant to participate; however, after heavy pressure from the United States and Saudi Arabia, they decided to attend. There is a strong opposition and unwillingness on a global level. The European Union still supports a two-state solution. Russia and China continue to strongly oppose Trump's projections for the region. While the conference mainly promises economic benefits and attempts to solve the Palestinian-Israeli and Arab-Israeli issues by providing economic benefits, many state officials and observers think otherwise. Although the stated purpose of the conference is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Trump administration is seeking to buy off Palestinians and deprive them of an independent state. Still another purpose of the conference is to create an opportunity to improve the Gulf states and Israeli state relations and to bolster the anti-Iranian coalition in the region. Ultimately, the Bahrain conference can be evaluated in terms of the most recent paradigm shift in the foreign policy approaches of the Gulf powerhouses, namely the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. Most Arab countries have been instrumentalizing and exploiting the Palestinian issue since the establishment of the Israeli state. For decades, Arab regimes have exploited the Palestinian issue for domestic consumption and for political legitimacy. In the past, authoritarian Arab regimes were afraid of their people, and therefore tried to satisfy their demands regarding the Palestinian issue and accordingly exaggerated the Israeli threat. However, recently, there has been a shift in the exploitation of the Palestinian issue in most Arab states. The authoritarian Arab regimes nowadays are afraid of external powers, namely Israel and the U.S., and are accordingly trying to satisfy their demands regarding the region. Therefore, Arab states have begun to use the Palestinian issue in negotiations with regional and global actors, namely with Israel and the U.S. Lastly, it is ridiculous to expect that the Bahrain conference, which attempts to solve the long-standing Palestinian-Israeli conflict, will be successful without Palestinian and Israeli participation and without the support of regional and global powers. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which includes not only economic but also religious, cultural, political and strategic dimensions, cannot be solved through economic means. All other aspects of the conflict must be taken into consideration.

The United States is holding an international conference – in reality an economic workshop – in Bahrain on June 25-26 to launch the Middle East peace plan by encouraging investment and economic promises in the Palestinian territory. The Bahrain conference, which will bring together government and business leaders from different countries, is the first part of U.S. President Donald Trump's regional peace plan, the so-called "Deal of the Century." The Trump administration will attempt to start the economic plan and then continue with political proposals. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Trump's regional representative, Jason Greenblatt, are the masterminds behind the conference and the plan. Trump's negotiation team wants to outline economic components of their regional peace plan with this conference. They want to persuade regional actors through economic promises. However, it seems that the conference is destined to fail for several reasons. First, Palestinians are boycotting the gathering. All major Palestinian actors, including the Palestinian Authority, Fatah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, are strongly against the conference. Palestinian officials and the public believe that the U.S. efforts are heavily biased in favor of the Israeli state and that the Trump administration ignores Palestinian needs.

The first stage of President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan will be launched on Tuesday at a conference the White House touts as a bid to begin drumming up $50 billion in investment but which Palestinians deride as an "economy first" approach doomed to fail. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter The two-day international meeting in Bahrain, led by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been billed as the first part of Washington's long-delayed broader political blueprint to revive the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which will be unveiled at a later date. Jare Kushner (Photo: Reuters) There will be close scrutiny as to whether attendees such as Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states show any interest in making actual donations to a U.S. plan that has already elicited bitter criticism from Palestinians and many others in the Arab world. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Photo: AP) Bahrain, a close American ally and home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, has been making preparations for weeks. Although the conference is supposed to focus on economics, Gulf Arab states hope their presence will also show their solidarity with the Trump administration over its hardline against Iran, a senior Gulf diplomat said on condition of anonymity. Under the plan, donor nations and investors would contribute about $50 billion over 10 years, with $28 billion going to the Palestinian territories - the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip - as well as $7.5 billion to Jordan, $9 billion to Egypt and $6 billion for Lebanon. Among 179 proposed infrastructure and business projects is a $5 billion transport corridor to connect the West Bank and Gaza. "I laugh when they attack this as the ˜deal of the century," Kushner told Reuters, referring to the lofty nickname that Trump' peace plan has assumed over the past two years. "This is going to be the ˜opportunity of the century" if they have the courage to pursue it." Kushner, a senior Trump adviser who like his father-in-law comes from the world of New York real estate, is presenting his plan in a pair of pamphlets filled with graphs and statistics that resemble an investment prospectus. But pushing back against critics who accuse Kushner of trying to forge a strictly â€œeconomic peace,â€ he told Reuters last week: "A lot of past attempts have failed. Calm down ... and keep an open mind". Even so, expectations for success are low. The Trump team concedes that the economic plan - billed "Peace to Prosperity" - will be implemented only if a political solution to one of the world's most intractable conflicts is reached. Any such solution would have to settle long-standing issues such as the status of Jerusalem, mutually agreed borders, satisfying Israel's security concerns and Palestinian demands for statehood, and the fate of Israel's settlements and military presence in territory Palestinians want to build that state. In an interview with Al Jazeera set to air on Tuesday, Kushner offered a rare glimpse into the possible political contours of the plan, saying a deal would not adhere to the Arab Peace Initiative, a Saudi-led plan that has been the Arab consensus on the necessary elements for a Palestinian deal since 2002. "I think we all have to recognise that if there ever is a deal, it's not going to be along the lines of the Arab Peace Initiative. It will be somewhere between the Arab Peace Initiative and between the Israeli position," Kushner told Al Jazeera. The Arab Peace Initiative offers Israel normal ties with the Arab world in exchange for a Palestinian state drawn along borders that predate Israel's capture of territory in a 1967 war and a fair solution for Palestinian refugees. Israel has rejected some of the initiative's main provisions. Hanging over the entire initiative are persistent questions about whether the Trump team plans to abandon the "two-state solution," a long-standing principle of Middle East peacemaking that involves creation of an independent Palestinian state. But the Trump team has consistently refused to commit to it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Photo: Eli Mendelbaum) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a close Trump ally, has his own domestic problems, facing an election, and possible corruption charges after a long-running police investigation. He denies any wrongdoing. "We'll hear the American proposition, hear it fairly and with openness," Netanyahu said on Sunday. Although no Israeli government ministers will attend, an Israeli business delegation is expected. Palestinian leaders have boycotted the workshop, and are refusing to engage with the White House - accusing it of pro-Israel bias after a series of recent Trump decisions. Kushner told Reuters that "some" Palestinian businessmen would be present. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was scathing about its prospects of success. "Money is important. The economy is important. But politics are more important. The political solution is more important," he said. Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, has found itself in rare agreement with its arch-rival Abbas. "The Palestinian people only and no one else can represent the Palestinian cause," Hamas official Mushir al-Masri said. Kushner insists, however, that the economic plan is intended to help draw Palestinians back to the negotiating table by showcasing the benefits a peace deal could bring. Kushner said that even without the Israeli and Palestinian governments represented, the presence of Israeli business executives and journalists with their Arab counterparts would be significant at a time of rising tensions with Iran. "People realize that the real threat to that region is Iran and their aggression, and Israel and a lot of the other Arab states have a lot more in common today than they did before," he said. David Makovsky, a Washington-based Middle East expert, agreed that although the principal focus of the event was the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, "Iran is higher on the chain of interest right now." However, Makovsky, whom the White House has invited as an observer, said of the Trump-Kushner plan: "No one believes you can solve this thing economically without addressing the political issues."

The economy is important. But politics are more important. The political solution is more important," he said. Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, has found itself in rare agreement with its arch-rival Abbas. "The Palestinian people only and no one else can represent the Palestinian cause," Hamas official Mushir al-Masri said. Kushner insists, however, that the economic plan is intended to help draw Palestinians back to the negotiating table by showcasing the benefits a peace deal could bring. Kushner said that even without the Israeli and Palestinian governments represented, the presence of Israeli business executives and journalists with their Arab counterparts would be significant at a time of rising tensions with Iran. "People realize that the real threat to that region is Iran and their aggression, and Israel and a lot of the other Arab states have a lot more in common today than they did before," he said. David Makovsky, a Washington-based Middle East expert, agreed that although the principal focus of the event was the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, "Iran is higher on the chain of interest right now." However, Makovsky, whom the White House has invited as an observer, said of the Trump-Kushner plan: "No one believes you can solve this thing economically without addressing the political issues."

WASHINGTON (JTA) — Jason Greenblatt, President Donald Trump’s top Middle East negotiator, led Jewish prayer services at a synagogue in Bahrain this week during the conference there that rolled out the economic portion of the Trump administration’s peace plan. Greenblatt mustered an Orthodox minyan — a quorum of ten adult Jewish males — for morning services Wednesday at the synagogue, which dates to the 19th century. Participants were among the businessmen, officials, journalists and think-tank employees attending the conference. Houda Nonoo, the former Bahraini ambassador to the United States and a member of the country’s Jewish community of 35 or so people, said minyans were rare in the synagogue, tending to take place more at cemeteries and in people’s homes. “It was an amazing experience to see everybody here together,” she told i24, an Israel-based news channel. She could not remember the last time the synagogue had shacharit, or the morning prayer service. Greenblatt posted a picture of the service on Twitter. “A special opportunity to daven (pray) this morning with a minyan (quorum) in a synagogue in Bahrain,” he said. “Great way to start today. I was asked what I prayed for — two things: my family, who I miss deeply and of course for peace. This is an example of the future we can all build together.” The conference wrapped up on its second day without news of whether Jared Kushner, the peace team’s boss and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, had extracted the $50-70 billion in pledges he is seeking to seed the infrastructural changes he says the Palestinian economy needs as a predicate for peace. The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the conference, in part because Trump has favored Israel by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and because Trump and Congress have cut off all U.S. funding to the Palestinians. “The overall consensus is that this is a very executable plan if we’re able to get a political solution and if we have the right governing structure in place,” Kushner said in a video recapping the conference that the White House posted on Twitter. The same day the conference opened, on Tuesday, officials of the United Nations Work and Relief Agency, which administers aid to Palestinian refugees and their descendants, garnered $113 million in pledges to help make up for the $360 million the Trump administration had cut in funding for the agency. “I think the situation is extremely precarious when you think of a million people not receiving food assistance in Gaza,” UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl told the Associated Press. The Bahrain conference, while inconclusive in its immediate goals — Kushner says he will roll out the political component of his plan later this year — was yet another signal of growing acceptance of Israel in the Arab world. Bahrain for the first time allowed Israeli journalists to enter to cover the conference. Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, the Bahraini foreign minister, said that Israel was now a given in the region. “Israel is part of this heritage of this whole region, historically,” the foreign minister said. “The Jewish people have a place amongst us.”

News article:
MANAMA: Jared Kushner’s “workshop” aimed at securing economic prosperity for Palestine closed with optimistic forecasts from President Donald Trump’s special adviser that it could be the basis for a forthcoming political deal with Israel. Kushner told journalists at a post-event briefing: “I think that people are all leaving very energized, very pleasantly surprised at how many like-minded people they see. It is a solvable problem economically, and the reason why we thought it was important to lay out the economic vision before we lay out the political vision is because we feel we need people to see what the future can look like. “The Palestinian people have been promised a lot of things over the years that have not come true. We want to show them that this is the plan, this is what can happen if there is a peace deal.” The next stage, before a political deal is attempted, will be to get feedback from the event and agree to commitments for the $50 billion package for Palestine and other regional economies. “I think you need $50 billion to really do this the right way, to get a paradigm shift,” Kushner added. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said: “I could not be happier how this has gone,” adding that he was “highly confident we will soon have the first $4 billion. It’s going to be like a hot initial public offering.” Most of the attendees at the event in Manama, Bahrain, gave Kushner’s economic proposals a serious hearing and agreed it was a useful exercise. Mohammed Al-Shaikh, Saudi minister of state, said: “Can it be done? Yes it can, because it was done before. In the mid-1990s to about the year 2000 there was a global coordinated effort by the US and other countries. I was at the World Bank at the time. I saw it. If we could do it then with significantly less money we can do it again.” Others warned, however, that there was still a long way to go on the political aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship. Tony Blair, the former British prime minister and Middle East peace envoy, said a political deal was essential. “This is an economic plan that, if it is implemented, is going to do enormous good for the Palestinian people. But it isn’t a substitute for the politics. There will be no economic peace. There will be a peace that will be a political component and an economic component. The economy can help the politics and the politics is necessary for the economy to flourish. “The politics has got to be right in this sense as well. The obvious sense people talk about is how do you negotiate the contours of the boundaries of a Palestinian state in a two state solution,” Blair said. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, highlighted the work the fund has done in conflict situations. “We had an exceptional result in Rwanda, and a good economic outcome in Mozambique,” she said. But she contrasted this with disappointing results in other African conflicts. Lagarde said that the aim of the economic plan should be to create jobs. “The focus should be on job-intensive industries, like agriculture, tourism and infrastructure.” Willem Buiter, special economic adviser to US banking giant Citi, said there were obstacles to the Kushner plan succeeding. “Necessary conditions for any progress are peace, safety and security. And there must be high-quality governance and the rule of law in Palestine,” he said. HIGHLIGHTS • Jared Kushner believes the conflict is a ‘solvable problem economically.’ • The senior adviser vows to lay out political plans at the right time. • Expert urges external funding in the form of grants or equity, rather than loans. He also suggested external funding should be in the form of grants or equity, rather than loans. “We should not burden a country trying to escape from its past with high debts,” he added. Some attendees warned of the risks to investor funds in the current political situation in the Middle East. But Khalid Al-Rumaihi, chief executive of the Bahrain Economic Development Board, said: “Risk is not new to the region. We’ve tackled it for the past 30 to 40 years, but that has not stopped investment flowing in. “Investors trade risk for return, and the Middle East has learned to cope with risk and conflict. There are pockets where the risk is high and Palestine is one of them. But I remain positive. The return in the region is higher to compensate for the risk,” he added. At a session of regional finance ministers, Mohammed Al-Jadaan of Saudi Arabia said: “The region is in desperate need of prosperity and hope. There is a way forward, but you need political commitment.” UAE Finance Minister Obaid Al-Tayer added: “We are decoupling politics from economics. If it’s the only initiative on the table we should all give it a chance.”

Oman's foreign ministry announced it will open an embassy on the West Bank on Wednesday. The diplomatic mission will be located in the West Bank city of Ramallah. "The Sultanate [of Oman], which continues its support of the brotherly Palestinian people, has approved to open a new Omani diplomatic delegation at the level of an embassy in Palestine," Oman's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a tweet. "A delegation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will travel to Ramallah to start with the opening procedures." The step coincides with the US-led economic workshop in Bahrain to unveil a Middle East peace plan, which is not expected to recognise an independent Palestinian state. The UAE, Jordan and Morocco all have diplomatic missions in Ramallah. Last year, the US downgraded its mission to Palestine, merging it with their embassy to Israel, which they moved to Jerusalem. In Bahrain, Jared Kushner, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has been selling his plan for Middle East peace that seeks US$50 billion (Dh184bn) in investment in the form of more than 150 projects. It has been criticised for failing to tackle tough political and statehood issues.

News article:
Attending the Manama conference does not mean Egypt approves of Washington’s Middle East plan Both Cairo and Moscow agree the Palestinian-Israeli conflict can only be resolved on the basis of a two-state solution, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri told Russia Today in an interview during his visit to Moscow on Monday. On the eve of the economic conference held in Manama and spearheaded by the US, Shoukri said both countries support the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and recognise the need to reach a permanent and just solution and establish a Palestinian state on the borders of 4 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The conference was an attempt to evaluate the proposed $50 billion “Peace to Prosperity” plan presented by US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner as part of a wider deal to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Stressing that Egypt’s participation in the conference does not mean it approves the proposal, Shoukri said: “It is important for Egypt to participate, to listen to this proposition and evaluate it, but the final decision lies with the main stakeholder, the Palestinian Authority.” Several Arab states, including Egypt, received Kushner’s proposals with caution. Washington said the political aspect of the deal would be unveiled later. The two-track approach prompted rejection not only from the Palestinians but in Arab countries with which Israel seeks to normalise relations. Commenting on claims of Gaza’s expansion into north Sinai, Shoukri said that Cairo would not cede a single grain of Sinai sand, and that the Palestinians would not accept living on land that does not belong to them. On the Syrian crisis Shoukri said Cairo and Moscow both wanted to ease the suffering of the Syrian people and eliminate terrorist organisations which directly threaten regional stability. While Shoukri praised the efforts of the UN envoy to Syria, he underlined that Security Council Resolution 2254 was the most appropriate framework for resolving the Syrian crisis. He also stressed the importance of dialogue between the Syrian government and opposition parties, away from terrorist organisations, in reaching a common vision for the future of Syria based on democracy and good governance. Shoukri pointed to Egypt’s strong relations with Gulf countries and the importance of Gulf security to Cairo. He said Cairo considers Gulf security part and parcel of Egyptian security and rejects not just Iranian, but any non-Arab interference in Arab national security. He called for an end to the policies of hegemony, exploitation and proxy conflicts. Shoukri stressed the consensus between Russia and Egypt over the importance of developing bilateral relations, especially economic ties, and added that both countries were committed to relieving regional tension. Shoukri’s interview with Russia Today came during a one-day official visit to Moscow. He headed to the Russian capital with Minister of Defence Mohamed Zaki to hold 2+2 talks with their Russian counterparts. Shoukri and Zaki also met with senior officials at Russia’s Ministry of Defence and discussed the growing partnership and cooperation between the armed forces of both countries. The two top officials also discussed preparations for the first Russian-African summit, scheduled to be held in Sochi in October. The current round of 2+2 consultations is the fifth to be held since 2013. *A version of this article appears in print in the 27 June, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly under the headline: Pursuing partnerships Search Keywords: Short link:

The conference was an attempt to evaluate the proposed $50 billion “Peace to Prosperity” plan presented by US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner as part of a wider deal to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Stressing that Egypt’s participation in the conference does not mean it approves the proposal, Shoukri said: “It is important for Egypt to participate, to listen to this proposition and evaluate it, but the final decision lies with the main stakeholder, the Palestinian Authority.” Several Arab states, including Egypt, received Kushner’s proposals with caution. Washington said the political aspect of the deal would be unveiled later. The two-track approach prompted rejection not only from the Palestinians but in Arab countries with which Israel seeks to normalise relations. Commenting on claims of Gaza’s expansion into north Sinai, Shoukri said that Cairo would not cede a single grain of Sinai sand, and that the Palestinians would not accept living on land that does not belong to them. On the Syrian crisis Shoukri said Cairo and Moscow both wanted to ease the suffering of the Syrian people and eliminate terrorist organisations which directly threaten regional stability. While Shoukri praised the efforts of the UN envoy to Syria, he underlined that Security Council Resolution 2254 was the most appropriate framework for resolving the Syrian crisis. He also stressed the importance of dialogue between the Syrian government and opposition parties, away from terrorist organisations, in reaching a common vision for the future of Syria based on democracy and good governance. Shoukri pointed to Egypt’s strong relations with Gulf countries and the importance of Gulf security to Cairo. He said Cairo considers Gulf security part and parcel of Egyptian security and rejects not just Iranian, but any non-Arab interference in Arab national security. He called for an end to the policies of hegemony, exploitation and proxy conflicts. Shoukri stressed the consensus between Russia and Egypt over the importance of developing bilateral relations, especially economic ties, and added that both countries were committed to relieving regional tension. Shoukri’s interview with Russia Today came during a one-day official visit to Moscow. He headed to the Russian capital with Minister of Defence Mohamed Zaki to hold 2+2 talks with their Russian counterparts. Shoukri and Zaki also met with senior officials at Russia’s Ministry of Defence and discussed the growing partnership and cooperation between the armed forces of both countries. The two top officials also discussed preparations for the first Russian-African summit, scheduled to be held in Sochi in October. The current round of 2+2 consultations is the fifth to be held since 2013. *A version of this article appears in print in the 27 June, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly under the headline: Pursuing partnerships Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
MANAMA, Bahrain — Bahrain sees the US-led economic workshop taking place in Manama this week as a possible “gamechanger” tantamount in its scope to the 1978 Camp David peace agreement between Israel and Egypt, the Gulf state’s foreign minister said Wednesday, also firmly backing Israel’s right to exist. “We see it as very, very important,” Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa told The Times of Israel on the sidelines of the “Peace to Prosperity” workshop. Khalifa also stressed that his country recognizes Israel’s right to exist, knows that it is “there to stay,” and wants peace with it. He said the US-organized conference here, which is focused on the economic aspects of the Trump administration’s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, could be like Egyptian president Anwar Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem in 1977, which helped pave the way to the Camp David Accords and the normalizing of relations between Egypt and Israel. “As much as Camp David 1 was a major gamechanger, after the visit of President Sadat — if this succeeds, and we build on it, and it attracts attention and momentum, this would be the second gamechanger,” Khalifa said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In an interview in his suite at Manama’s posh Four Seasons hotel, Khalifa did not commit to normalizing diplomatic ties with Israel in the near future, but unequivocally affirmed Israel’s right to exist as a state with secure borders. “Israel is a country in the region… and it’s there to stay, of course,” he said. “Who did we offer peace to [with] the [Arab] Peace Initiative? We offered it to a state named the State of Israel, in the region. We did not offer it to some faraway island or some faraway country,” Khalifa continued, referring to a Saudi-backed peace framework. Advertisement “We offered it to Israel. So we do believe that Israel is a country to stay, and we want better relations with it, and we want peace with it.” While Bahrain might be only Arab state, besides Egypt and Jordan, to publicly acknowledge Israel’s right to exist, “we know our brothers in the region do believe in it” as well, he said. Khalifa pointed to the Arab Peace Initiative as the blueprint for normalizing ties with Israel. Israel’s rejection of the plan is a “missed opportunity,” he lamented, but Jerusalem can always rethink its position. He encouraged Israelis to approach Arab leaders about any issues they may have with the proposal. “Come and talk to us. Talk to us about it. Say, guys, you have a good initiative, but we have one thing that worries us,” he said. Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, said this week that the White House’s proposal for Israeli-Palestinian peace will not follow the contours of the Arab Peace Initiative, but be closer to Israel’s position. Advertisement Turning to Trump’s peace plan, Khalifa said he has not yet seen the political part of the US administration’s two-pronged proposal, but sounded cautiously optimistic about it. “We have to wait. I cannot talk about something that I don’t know. But we hope that this political plan will also be attractive to everybody,” he said. “Look at the workshop. It’s very attractive. You don’t want to give an attractive offer and then come and bring something that could stall it. We want to see it continue on the same momentum. So we’ll see it.” Asked about which elements of a possible deal Bahrain could get behind, he replied: “Whatever you can agree on with the Palestinians.” Speaking Wednesday at the conference, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he would like the White House’s economic plan to be adopted by the international community. “This is a regional economic plan. Although Gaza and the West Bank are a major focus of this plan, it also includes Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon… it is very important that we focus on these economies as a whole,” he said. “Most importantly, we want an international consensus… We want this to become not a United States plan, we want this to become an international plan. Now that the plan is out there, we’re looking for changes, we’re looking for additions, we’re looking for buy-in, and really as a next step that this becomes a collective” plan, said Mnuchin. Mnuchin said: “This is a plan that can very much be accomplished.” “I know there is a lot of money in this room,” he said to the smiling audience. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.
