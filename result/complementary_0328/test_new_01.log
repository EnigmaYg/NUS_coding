News article:
ISLAMABAD: The case of convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav on Wednesday took another turn when India submitted its initial pleadings, known as ‘memorial’, to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. Pakistan’s Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf, while talking to Geo Television, said India had sought until December to file its pleadings but the court allowed it until September 13 to do so. The ICJ also set December 13 as the deadline for Pakistan to submit its counter-pleadings in the case. On May 18, the ICJ ordered Pakistan to halt the execution of Jadhav, an on-duty Indian Navy officer working for Indian spy agency RAW, who was arrested from Balochistan in March 2016, until a final decision in the proceedings. It may be mentioned here that Kalbushan Jhadev, alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, serving as Commander of Indian Navy, working with Indian intelligence agency RAW, was apprehended on March 3, 2016 after he illegally crossed over into Pakistan from the Pakistan-Iran border. He was found in possession of an Indian passport issued by government of India on May 12, 2015 and valid until May 11, 2024. He confessed that he is a resident of Mumbai, India, still serving in the Navy and his retirement is due in 2022. The videos of his confession are widely circulated in the media. He is responsible for espionage, sabotage and terrorism in Pakistan and has been tried according to the law of the land, in a fully transparent manner by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) under section 59 of Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 and Section 3 of Official Secret Act of 1923. He confessed before a magistrate and the court that he was tasked by RAW to plan, coordinate and organise espionage and sabotage activities aimed at destabilising Pakistan. Commander Jhadev was involved in both espionage and terrorist/sabotage activities resulting in the loss of many lives and damage to property. According to details, he sponsored and directed IEDs and grenade attacks in Gwadar and Turbat. He also directed attacks on the radar station and civilian boats in the sea, opposite Jiwani Port. He funded subversive secessionist and terrorist elements through Hawala/Hundi for turning Pakistani youth against the country, especially in Balochistan. He sponsored explosions of gas pipelines/ electric pylons in in Balochistan. He sponsored IED explosions in Quetta in 2015, causing massive damage to life and property, and attacks on Hazaras in Quetta and Shia Zaireen en route to and back from Iran. He abetted attacks through anti-state elements against LEAs/FC and FWO in areas of Turbat, Punjgur, Gwadar, Pasni and Jiwani during 2014-2015, killing and injuring many civilians and soldiers. He launched a website with subversive content in support of anti-Pakistan elements. Pakistan has repeatedly requested India for assistance in the investigation process but to no avail. Subsequently, India took the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which after the oral hearing ruled on 18 May to grant provisional measures halting the execution of the Indian spy pending a final judgment of the court. As per the directives of the ICJ, India was required to submit its memorial in the Court on 13th September, 2017 while Pakistan will submit its counter memorial on December 13, 2017.

News article:
It is the most repeated maxim in all the reporting on Afghanistan: “The Americans have the watches, the Taliban have the time”. Dead right! This is America’s longest war ever: 16 years and counting. President Donald Trump, admitting he was reversing his campaign call for pulling out, has now decided to stay in, sending another 3,900 troops to Afghanistan to reinforce the 8,400 there now. Trump does not claim it will do the job of defeating the Taliban. In fact, he lays out no long-term strategy at all; it is not difficult to imagine that in a decade the same stalemate will exist. President Barack Obama, blindsided by the generals, he confided later, pumped up the numbers to 100,000. Before very long, Obama came to realise that even if he did a Lyndon B. Johnson and sent in half a million troops, it would have ended up as it did in Vietnam, with stalemate. He ordered the troops numbers down to their present total, the minimum to secure Kabul and provide training for the Afghan army. Unanswered was why, after 16 years and more than $120 billion spent, the Afghan army was not trained already. (One could ask the same question in Iraq.) Meanwhile, the Taliban gain territory and the number of civilians killed rises, as does the number of Taliban. An affiliate of Daesh is now getting itself established. Kabul seems more vulnerable to attack. The government is unable to get on top of the country’s three curses: vicious infighting by the warlords, corruption and poppy growing for heroin manufacture (it is now at an historic high and is 95 per cent of the world’s traded opium). Last year, 580,000 people fled their homes. A thousand schools were closed because of security concerns — most of them the hard work of Western governments aid programmes and NGOs. The cynics wonder whether the US and its NATO allies hang in only because they have their eyes on the apparent $1 trillion worth of minerals waiting to be mined. Eventually, wearied by failure, Obama and his generals came to believe that the only hope was reconciliation — negotiation between the Taliban, the government and the US, to find a compromise. The Taliban showed what they thought of that idea when they sent a missile in the direction of the visiting secretary of state, John Kerry. It is the same as it was in Vietnam. If the insurgents are not losing, they are winning. This is their home. The US and NATO are far from home. This is what the Soviet army found in its war in the 1980s. Only when Mikhael Gorbachev became president did the Kremlin have the guts to order a retreat. If one wants to know how terrible things became for the Red Army soldiers, one should read Nobel Prize winning author Svetlana Alexievich’s book “Zinky Boys”. The US and NATO are being undercut by Iran, which is supplying the Taliban with weapons, funds and fighters. Trump’s hostility to Iran ensures that this will grow. Russia, which for so long has supported the Americans, even allowing war materials to be transported on its railways, is now hedging its bets and making overtures to the Taliban. Pakistan plays both ends against the middle. On one side it is the main logistics route for America. On the other it tolerates the Taliban operating in parts of its northern territory. This dualism reflects its obsession with the growing Indian influence in Afghanistan, which Trump has just added to by announcing what Richard Nixon would have called a “tilt” towards India. Currently, the US is at war in at least seven Muslim countries. Non-Muslims forces fighting on Muslim land angers even moderate Muslims. In Somalia, US support for the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia provoked the earth-scorching Islamist Al Shabab group whose influence has spread far and wide outside Somalia. In Yemen, US and Saudi Arabian bombing (with planes and armaments from the US and the UK) has increased the number of fighters recruited by Al Qaeda. The argument of the American high command is that if the US gets out, extremists will take over; that is exaggerated. The North Vietnamese were not extremists. In the 1980s, the US military was in Lebanon fighting Hizbollah. A truck bomb blew up the US barracks, killing 241 soldiers. Not long after, president Ronald Reagan, realising that his troops were not improving the situation, withdrew his force. Lebanon calmed as Syrian diplomats and troops took over, although infighting among Lebanon’s factions continued. If the US and NATO left Afghanistan, the Taliban would take over. As happened after the Red Army left, there would be internecine warfare, with warlords competing for territory. Maybe girls’ schools would be closed. But as before when the Taliban ruled, poppy production would be banned. Plus one and minus the other. Not a good or tidy solution, but is Trump’s?

News article:
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will demolish India’s “mischievous designs and motive”. India presented a memorial (petition) before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Wednesday, through which it is trying to divert the international community’s attention from the real issue, while trying to bring out the ‘humanitarian’ aspect in the case of its alleged spy Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has confessed to carrying out subversive and terrorist activities inside Pakistan. The government also found fault with Washington’s military sales to New Delhi which emboldens it to adopt aggressive military doctrines and even contemplate military adventurism in the region. Kulbhushan was arrested on March 3, 2016 through a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan’s Mashakel area. Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the Indian spy’s death sentence awarded by Field General Court Martial, after a trial for involvement in espionage and sabotage activities in Karachi and Balochistan. “Pakistan will submit its counter memorial to ICJ by December 13, 2017 and we should be mindful about the facts in which Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav is on record to have confessed to many terrorist attacks within Pakistan, which caused loss of many precious and innocent lives of Pakistanis and inflicted material losses. Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav and his accomplices caused immense sufferings to the Pakistani nation. We must be mindful of this fact while talking about him. India is trying to bring out the ‘humanitarian’ aspect of such a person”, spokesman at the Foreign Office told the media as Pakistan puts down its head to prepare its counter memorial. Visa request for the family of Kulbhushan to meet him has not been allowed by authorities here. “Many citizens also suffered from life threatening and lifetime injuries due to Commander Jadhav’s subversive activities. Therefore, we must be mindful of India’s mischievous designs and motive. Since India was caught red-handed with irrefutable evidence in a case in which its state institutions and state actors are involved in terrorism, terror financing and subversive activities in a sovereign state, it is trying to divert international community’s attention from the real issue”, the spokesman added. Pakistan also sent a warning to attempts by the US and India to create imbalances and undermine strategic stabilities in South Asia. In this regard, the spokesman recalled the visit of Prime Minister Modi to Washington in June where a major deal for sale of Guardian UAVs (submarine drones) was finalised. “We had expressed our concerns on the sale of advanced military technologies to India. We believe that such sales accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability in South Asia. This further emboldens India to adopt aggressive military doctrines and even contemplate military adventurism. Transfers of modern military hardware and technologies as well as repeated exceptions made for India have dis-incentivised India to engage in efforts to establish a strategic restrain regime and durable security architecture in the region”, he explained. Rounding up the recent visits of Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif to China, Iran and Turkey the spokesman said that these were successful in terms of convergence of interest and viewpoints on the situation in the region including Afghanistan. This was certainly by no means an easy task to find in these important regional countries echoing views held by Pakistan. The converging points included peace in Afghanistan is important for stability in the region; no military solution to Afghan conflict; regional solution to the situation in Afghanistan; Afghan-owned and Afghan-led dialogue for peace; Pakistan has contributed immensely in the fight against terrorism and has rendered unprecedented sacrifices, suffered human and economic losses; presence of terrorist outfits in Afghanistan and safe havens are a threat to regional countries; terrorism is a global phenomenon and hence warrants global cooperation; blame game serves no one’s interest and is counterproductive in the efforts to counter terrorism; for lasting regional peace, resolution to disputes like Kashmir is important; and Human rights violations in IHK are matters of serious concern and condemnable. “Conflict in Afghanistan is persisting for around four decades, which has created ungoverned spaces there, which have become safe havens for various terrorist outfits. India is also exploiting this situation there against Pakistan. We have raised this issue not only bilaterally with many countries, but also at the UN. We have submitted dossiers to the UN in the context of Indian state institutions’ involvement in perpetrating terrorism, terror financing and subversive activities in Pakistan. No one would endorse Indian activities of this nature”, the spokesman added.

News article:
president Abdel fatah al Sisi (left) Somali president mohamed abdullahi farmaajo (right) CAIRO – 20 August 2017: First official visit of Somalia’s new President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo to Cairo on Sunday marks long and historical relations between the Egyptian and Somali nations. Egypt has been backing Somali’s decisions since 1960, according to State Information Service (SIS) website. A long list of bilateral cooperation relations was stated underneath the Egyptian Somali relations report, which included several official visits, scientific and cultural relations, economic relations and humanitarian aids. Egypt was one of the first states which recognized the independence of Somalia in 1960 after World War II; in addition Egypt continued backing Somalia in all different fields during the period that followed its independence. Several educational missions were sent to Mogadishu. In March 2013, former Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr marked a first visit for an official Egyptian to Somalia within twenty years. The visit included several meetings and talks with former Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud along with both foreign and defense ministers. Former Somali President visited Cairo four times during 2014 and 2015, as many cases of mutual interests were discussed between Sheikh Mohamud and his Egyptian counterpart Abdelfatah al-Sisi. Former Somali president Sharif Sheikh Ahmed also visited Egypt two times in 2009 and 2010. Several agreements and cooperation protocols were signed since the announcement of Somalian independence in 1960 with Egypt; SIS however listed the major nine agreements including (two trade agreements on December 1961 and July 1978, a cultural cooperation deal in January 1961, an aviation agreement in 1974, an economic agreement in 1982 and a cooperation protocol between the two countries federal radio and television.) Egypt has sent several humanitarian aids to its African neighbor according to SIS, the latest were during 2015 and 2017 to ease the impact of the drought wave that hit Somalia. Commenting on Sisi’s meeting with Farmajo, Sunday, Member of Parliament Ayman Aboul Ela said in a formal statement that “it is extremely important for the Egyptian government to establish balanced relations with our African neighbors and to communicate with them and enhance our relations in all different fields.” Sunday morning, President of Somalia Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo has arrived in Cairo for his first formal visit since taking office in February 2017. According to a presidential statement, the visit is aiming to enhance the Egyptian-Somali relations, as several issues are expected to be discussed during the talks between Farmajo and President Abdelfatah al-Sisi. A formal reception ceremony has been held in the Ittihadia Presidential Palace. On August 14, Sisi embarked on a four-day African tour where he visited Tanzania, Rwanda, Gabon and Chad. This tour however is not considered to be a sudden move, as Sisi visited several African countries since taking the office in June 2014; participating in summits and conducting bilateral talks with the majority of African leaders. In June 2014, Sisi participated in the African Union Summit in the Equatorial Guinea as his first presidential visit within the continent, which was considered then a restoration of the African-Egyptian relations after years of neglect during Mubarak’s era. Several short visits during 2015 followed the African Union Summit participation including, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda per Yuri Museveni’s invitation in December 2016.

The National Defense Minister of Sudan Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf- Official Facebook Page CAIRO - 20 August 2017: The National Defense Minister of Sudan Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf paid visit to Egypt on Monday to discuss the recent international and regional developments. The Minister of Defence Sedki Sobhy welcomed his counterpart Ibn Auf at the General Secretariat of the Defence Ministry. Ibn Auf has stressed the strong relations between Egypt and Sudan referring that his country is keen on enhancing the partnership between the two states in different fields and exerting efforts for the common interests, according to the Army Spokesperson’s official Facebook page. They discussed how the recent international and regional developments affect the security and stability in the region besides the common files of the Armed Forces. He stressed that the two countries should cooperate together to face challenges in the region to preserve security and stability of the region. He praised Egypt’s efforts and stances to fight terrorism preserving peace and security of Africa. Both countries have had a good relationship for decades, but tension arose between them when pro-Egyptian regime activists demonstrated against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir after visiting Ethiopia, which is building a dam on the Nile, causing Sudan to impose entry visa requirements for Egyptians who are aged between 18 and 50 years.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and his Romanian counterpart Klaus Iohannis exchanged invitations to visit their respective countries in an effort to bolster ties, Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday. The invitations were relayed through Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, who concluded on Tuesday a visit to the Romanian capital Bucharest, where he spoke with President Iohannis.

The Romanian president invited El-Sisi to attend a presidential gathering on protecting youths against terrorism, which Romania is holding in September on the sidelines of a United Nations General Assembly meeting.

During the meeting in New York, Nasr called on companies to expand their investments in Egypt, stating that the Egyptian government is keen on resolving all issues facing U.S. investors in the country. In coordination with the American Chamber of Commerce, Egypt will organize an investment forum in 2018 to showcase investment opportunities to potential American investors, Nasr added. Companies that attended Nasr’s meeting included Capital Business USA, Concord International, Melville, Moon Capital Management and Victoria Capital Partners. Nasr is accompanying President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who headed to New York earlier this week to attend the United National General Assembly. During the visit, Sisi met a delegation of American companies, including Apache and Boeing, which expressed intention to expand its investment in Egypt. Chocolate’s manufacturer Mars also said they will start a new production line in their Egypt-based factory, “Mars exports 70% of its production from Egypt to the Arab world,” Nasr told local media earlier this week.

News article:
WASHINGTON: The international community should consider imposing a resolution to the conflict in Syria that does not involve President Bashar Assad retaining power, France’s foreign minister said Friday. A transition “cannot be done” with Assad, “who murdered part of his population and who has led millions of Syrians to leave” their homeland, Jean-Yves Le Drian said. “If we wait for the Syrians to agree, we will wait a long time and there will be thousands more dead.” Assad’s fate has hampered all international diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. “The shift in international attitudes toward the Syrian conflict has been shaped more by the failure of the opposition than their perception of Assad,” Syrian analyst Hassan Hassan told Arab News. “Even though the regime has won the strategic war, in that no country seriously seeks its downfall anymore, it’s unlikely to come out of the diplomatic cold anytime soon.” Joseph Bahout, a fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Arab News that the notion that Assad has “won” has become the dominant narrative in the West, and his inclusion in a transition should be expected. But “will this lead to a solution? Of course not.” Ibrahim Assil, a non-resident fellow at the Orient Research Center in Dubai, strongly cautioned the international community against turning a new page with Assad. “Holding war criminals like Assad accountable is crucial for international security,” he told Arab News. “Tyrants like Assad are watching, and the international community is sending them a message that it will accept them even if they crush their people militarily, commit war crimes and atrocities, and even use chemical weapons.” Le Drian told RTL radio: “He (Assad) cannot be part of the solution. The solution is to find with all the actors a calendar with a political transition that will enable a new constitution and elections.” While Britain has said Assad must go, diplomats say the administration of US President Donald Trump has yet to outline a vision for a political process in Syria and is focusing primarily on defeating Daesh and countering Iran, AFP reported. The UN Security Council has already adopted a Syria transition road map, and two diplomats said the latest French idea was to get the five permanent members of the council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the US — to agree first how to move forward. The Security Council would then bring into the fold the main regional powers, although diplomats said it was pointless without Iran’s involvement. There were also questions on how to win US support given the Trump administration’s staunch anti-Iranian position. Meanwhile, a new round of talks on the conflict in Syria will be held in Astana on Sept. 14-15, Kazakhstan announced Friday, with key powers looking to shore up safe zones on the ground. Russia and Iran, which back the Syrian regime, and opposition supporter Turkey will look to work out more details of the “de-escalation zones,” including the thorny issue of who will police the northern Idlib region, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “The participants also intend to confirm the maps of the de-escalation zones in the provinces of Idlib, Homs and Eastern Ghouta,” it said. The statement did not mention a fourth zone in the south of Syria, where Israel and the US have been wary about seeing Iran involved after a cease-fire was agreed between Moscow and Washington in July. Russia has already deployed military police to the zone in the south, in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, and in part of Homs under the safe zone deals. Moscow has been spearheading the Astana peace talks since the start of the year in a bid to pacify Syria after its game-changing intervention on the side of Assad. In another development, US-backed Syrian fighters ousted Daesh from Raqqa’s Old City on Friday, bringing them closer than ever to the terrorist bastion’s well-defended and densely populated heart. Backed by US-led coalition airstrikes, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) first broke into Raqqa in early June and penetrated its Old City a month later. On Friday, they successfully captured the entire historic district from militants, according to AFP. “Our forces today seized full control of the Old City in Raqqa after clashes with Daesh,” spokesman Talal Sello said.

News article:
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura predicted that Daesh strongholds in Syria could fall by the end of October, which, in his view, could prompt the international community to press for free and fair elections. “What we are seeing is, in my opinion, the beginning of the end of this war... what we need to make sure is that this becomes also the beginning of peace.” He admitted, however, that three locations remain contested: Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, where Daesh fighters are up against US-backed and Russian-sponsored Syrian forces, and Idlib province, which is controlled by Al Qaeda’s offshoot, Jabhat Fatah Al Sham. De Mistura appears overly optimistic. Although Daesh may lose its grip on territory, Daesh fighters will continue to threaten Syria, neighbouring Iraq, the region and Europe. Rival external powers who have mounted proxy wars in Syria will carry on with their dirty, deadly and destructive games. First, let us look at Raqqa, Daesh’s former “capital”. Raqqa is besieged by US-allied Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Once Daesh forces in the city capitulate, the SDF will have to expel surviving fighters from the rest of the province. Some are likely to cross the border into Iraq, where there are still Daesh-held pockets of territory. Baghdad, which has supported Damascus during the war, will not be pleased, but Daesh fugitives from Iraqi campaigns in Mosul, Tal Afar and other towns often fled to Syria. The SDF plans to establish provincial and municipal administrations once Daesh is expelled from Raqqa city and province. These administrations are to be linked to councils in the Kurdish region established by the SDF south of the Turkish border. The SDF’s political bosses have pledged that these bodies will remain within Syria under the Syrian government. Syria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad dismissed Kurdish plans and said Damascus will eventually reassert control over Raqqa. Since the government is fully supported by Russia and Iran, where does this leave the US, which has established bases in the Kurdish-held swath of territory? Damascus, Moscow and Tehran are unlikely to agree to a permanent US military presence in northern Syria, while Ankara, fearing Kurdish irredentism at home, has deployed Turkish troops and tanks, and Syrian takfiri militias in Syria, and has sworn to use force to erase the Kurdish self-rule region along the border. Second, the Syrian army and its Russian and Iranian allies have preempted an intended post-Raqqa US-backed SDF offensive against Deir Ezzor, the remaining major Daesh asset in Syria and refuge for Daesh commanders and fighters escaping the ongoing anti-Daesh campaigns in Syria and Iraq. Although Syrian forces have been engaged in this campaign since May, they only made major breakthroughs in recent weeks. The Syrian army is close to securing the Deir Ezzor garrison and adjoining quarters of the city besieged by Daesh since 2014. There are 7,000 Syrian soldiers and 90,000 civilians in the government-held area, and 10,000 civilians trapped in districts under Daesh rule. Once the whole of Deir Ezzor city is captured by Damascus’ forces, the government will restore its administration while the army and pro-government militias mop up Daesh throughout the province. Large tracts of land and the principal oilfield have already been captured by the Syrian army. The return to Damascus’ control of Deir Ezzor will be a major strategic victory for Syrian President Bashar Assad who, even former US ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford — the former self-styled “ambassador to the opposition” — now admits is set to remain in power. Third, Turkey could be a serious spoiler in any effort to make peace in Syria. Idlib could become a battleground between Ankara, which has organised anti-Assad takfiri factions into a “Syrian National Army”, and Damascus, Moscow and Tehran, which remain determined to rout Al Qaeda’s Jabhat as well as Daesh. Turkey seeks to convince Jabhat, which fought hard for possession of Idlib, to disband and let its fighters join other takfiri outfits taking shelter under the umbrella of the “Syrian National Army”, the rebranded shambolic “Free Syrian Army”. Rival and competing insurgent groups which have refused to unite and submit to central command and control since Turkey established the “Free Army” in 2011, are unlikely to capitulate now. Jabhat cannot be expected to dissolve itself shortly after achieving its objectives in Idlib. While the US and its coalition partners have focused on Daesh, both it and Jabhat are branded “terrorist” organisations by the UN, despite the fact that the US and its European and Arab allies have directly and indirectly supported Jabhat during battles against government forces. This has been a hypocritical and shortsighted policy. If Al Qaeda is safely based in Idlib, it could take over from Daesh as the main takfiri menace to the region, Asia, Africa and Europe. Al Qaeda and its offshoots have not surrendered their aims or ambitions. De Mistura’s suggestion that if Daesh is defeated in Raqqa and Deir Ezzor by the end of October, an election can be held after a year is also unrealistically optimistic. External powers that have waged proxy wars against the government and each other can be expected to interfere. Russia and Iran insist that Assad has to be involved in the transition, while Turkey and other countries that have sought his overthrow contend he has to stand down or be removed ahead of the transition. While Russia and Iran argue that Assad has to stay until Syria is stabilised, the regime change camp does not seem to care what will happen if he leaves power. There is no expatriate foreign-sponsored opposition figure that has support in Syria and can replace Assad, who commands the backing of the army, the intelligence services, the commercial class, the bureaucracy and millions of Syrians, some of whom may not like him but seek an end to war. The opposition camp also knows that if he remains through the transition, he will win any free and fair, UN-supervised election. This is why his antagonists want him out of the way before any transition begins. Eighty per cent of Syrians living in the country now dwell in government-controlled areas. Displaced persons have moved there from areas of conflict. They know that if Assad goes, the powers that have been fighting proxy wars in the country will begin new conflicts over who should be his successor. De Mistura should make a serious study of the situation before he issues optimistic statements.

The SDF plans to establish provincial and municipal administrations once Daesh is expelled from Raqqa city and province. These administrations are to be linked to councils in the Kurdish region established by the SDF south of the Turkish border. The SDF’s political bosses have pledged that these bodies will remain within Syria under the Syrian government. Syria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad dismissed Kurdish plans and said Damascus will eventually reassert control over Raqqa. Since the government is fully supported by Russia and Iran, where does this leave the US, which has established bases in the Kurdish-held swath of territory? Damascus, Moscow and Tehran are unlikely to agree to a permanent US military presence in northern Syria, while Ankara, fearing Kurdish irredentism at home, has deployed Turkish troops and tanks, and Syrian takfiri militias in Syria, and has sworn to use force to erase the Kurdish self-rule region along the border. Second, the Syrian army and its Russian and Iranian allies have preempted an intended post-Raqqa US-backed SDF offensive against Deir Ezzor, the remaining major Daesh asset in Syria and refuge for Daesh commanders and fighters escaping the ongoing anti-Daesh campaigns in Syria and Iraq. Although Syrian forces have been engaged in this campaign since May, they only made major breakthroughs in recent weeks. The Syrian army is close to securing the Deir Ezzor garrison and adjoining quarters of the city besieged by Daesh since 2014. There are 7,000 Syrian soldiers and 90,000 civilians in the government-held area, and 10,000 civilians trapped in districts under Daesh rule. Once the whole of Deir Ezzor city is captured by Damascus’ forces, the government will restore its administration while the army and pro-government militias mop up Daesh throughout the province. Large tracts of land and the principal oilfield have already been captured by the Syrian army. The return to Damascus’ control of Deir Ezzor will be a major strategic victory for Syrian President Bashar Assad who, even former US ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford — the former self-styled “ambassador to the opposition” — now admits is set to remain in power. Third, Turkey could be a serious spoiler in any effort to make peace in Syria. Idlib could become a battleground between Ankara, which has organised anti-Assad takfiri factions into a “Syrian National Army”, and Damascus, Moscow and Tehran, which remain determined to rout Al Qaeda’s Jabhat as well as Daesh. Turkey seeks to convince Jabhat, which fought hard for possession of Idlib, to disband and let its fighters join other takfiri outfits taking shelter under the umbrella of the “Syrian National Army”, the rebranded shambolic “Free Syrian Army”. Rival and competing insurgent groups which have refused to unite and submit to central command and control since Turkey established the “Free Army” in 2011, are unlikely to capitulate now. Jabhat cannot be expected to dissolve itself shortly after achieving its objectives in Idlib. While the US and its coalition partners have focused on Daesh, both it and Jabhat are branded “terrorist” organisations by the UN, despite the fact that the US and its European and Arab allies have directly and indirectly supported Jabhat during battles against government forces. This has been a hypocritical and shortsighted policy. If Al Qaeda is safely based in Idlib, it could take over from Daesh as the main takfiri menace to the region, Asia, Africa and Europe. Al Qaeda and its offshoots have not surrendered their aims or ambitions. De Mistura’s suggestion that if Daesh is defeated in Raqqa and Deir Ezzor by the end of October, an election can be held after a year is also unrealistically optimistic. External powers that have waged proxy wars against the government and each other can be expected to interfere. Russia and Iran insist that Assad has to be involved in the transition, while Turkey and other countries that have sought his overthrow contend he has to stand down or be removed ahead of the transition. While Russia and Iran argue that Assad has to stay until Syria is stabilised, the regime change camp does not seem to care what will happen if he leaves power. There is no expatriate foreign-sponsored opposition figure that has support in Syria and can replace Assad, who commands the backing of the army, the intelligence services, the commercial class, the bureaucracy and millions of Syrians, some of whom may not like him but seek an end to war. The opposition camp also knows that if he remains through the transition, he will win any free and fair, UN-supervised election. This is why his antagonists want him out of the way before any transition begins. Eighty per cent of Syrians living in the country now dwell in government-controlled areas. Displaced persons have moved there from areas of conflict. They know that if Assad goes, the powers that have been fighting proxy wars in the country will begin new conflicts over who should be his successor. De Mistura should make a serious study of the situation before he issues optimistic statements.

News article:
Many observers might concur with the solemn declaration by former United States ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, last week that Syrian President Bashar Al Assad has won and that he is staying in power, and that he may never be held accountable for crimes committed by his regime during the past seven years. While this conclusion is based on a close reading of the political and military developments of the past nine months, particularly the retaking of Aleppo after a brutal siege and bombardment in December, those celebrating Al Assad’s victory might want to pause and look ahead. It is true that Russia’s military intervention in Syria in 2015 was a major game changer; one that was met with deliberate recoil from the country’s civil war by the administration of former US president Barack Obama. A regime that was losing control over most of northern, eastern and southern Syria, was able to regroup and refocus its efforts — thanks to an overwhelming Russian air power and crucial intelligence capabilities. In addition, Iranian-backed militias, both homegrown and foreign, became the spearhead of the Al Assad regime’s military power. While the US-led coalition concentrated its air strikes on Daesh (the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) positions, Russian and Syrian government forces were focused on dislodging rebel enclaves in Homs, Aleppo, Idlib, the Damascus countryside and Darra. The US restricted its military support to Syrian Kurdish fighters, the SDF/YPG, and by the time US President Donald Trump took office, the CIA’s training and support programme for so-called moderate groups had come to a halt. The sobering reality is that anti-Al Assad regional players, including Qatar and Turkey, were backing radical groups that had no interest in embracing the political opposition’s goals of building a free, secular and democratic Syria. The lofty objectives of the Syrian uprising had long been toppled; replaced by a common platform by militant groups to create an Islamic state in Syria. With Moscow now the main power-broker in Syria, the political strategy it followed was simple and straightforward: To discredit a divided and ineffective political opposition in exile, while giving the world a stark choice between a secular regime, under Al Assad for now, or a fragmented Syria ruled by rival jihadist groups. All other players, including Turkey and Iran, the US, Israel and Europe, had to concede that Russia held all the winning cards when it came to the future of Syria. With the regime making important breakthroughs on the ground, the question of AAl ssad’s fate quickly became sidelined; leaving the political opposition in disarray. The de-escalation zones, backed by Russia, the US, Turkey and Iran—each for its own reasons—became the only realistic vehicle to putting an end to the fighting. Extremist groups were allowed to evacuate to Idlib while Daesh was now surrounded in Raqqa and Deir Al Zour. The Syrian government army was gaining ground in eastern Syria and extending its control to most of the country’s borders with Iraq. In the south a trilateral — US, Russian and Jordanian — agreement to enforce a truce and allow the Syrian regime to take control of the borders with Jordan was still holding, paving the way for further implementation in other parts of the country. What the world should admit is that Russia’s decisive intervention in Syria has almost certainly prevented the fragmentation of the country and the geopolitical chaos that it would have led to. After seven years of war resulting in hundreds of thousands of casualties, millions displaced and an unimaginable level of destruction, the Syrian crisis has reached a crucial point: The future of Syria as a country. Still it would be naive to believe that the regime’s apparent victory will translate into going back to the political realities that preceded the March 2011 uprising. Even Moscow believes that the status quo ante is untenable anymore. The future of Al Assad will have to be decided by the Syrian people, following a transitional phase that should lead to the adoption of a new constitution that enshrines democratic principles. Al Assad will be persuaded to adopt such a process that may extend for years. But there are hard questions that the world cannot ignore. What about all the evidence of human rights violations, war crimes and crimes against humanity that the regime and Al Assad have allegedly committed? Certainly, a political process that does not take these issues into consideration will be doomed to fail. In fact, international law itself will be compromised if the allegations of mass killings, torture, use of chemical weapons, summary justice, rape, ethnic and religious cleansing, among others, are not confronted at some stage. Russia, which backs a political process and will have tremendous influence over its outcome, now shares moral responsibility in delivering justice to the Syrian people. So while those celebrating the potential triumph of the regime have good reasons to do so, they should take into consideration that the future of Syria will hardly resemble its past.

News article:
By Margaret Kimberley The five-year long regime change effort in Syria may soon be over and the United States and its allies will be the losers. The Syrian Arab Army broke the siege of Deir Ezzor, which was one of the last Daesh strongholds in the country. The neocon plot for American hegemony was hatched during the George W. Bush administration but was happily continued by Barack Obama and his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. Fresh from their evil success in Libya, they thought the same combination of Arab monarchs and jihadists could dislodge Bashar al Assad and achieve the goal of destroying the few secular Arab governments still in power. But fortunately for humanity, Assad hung on long enough and the Russian Federation finally decided to back up their ally with military help. It is good news that this war may soon be over. The United States and its allies committed a terrible crime against the Syrian people and five million of them were forced to flee their country to escape this latest example of state sponsored terrorism. There is no downside to Assad making good on his promise to take back his country from American sponsored jihadists. The United States corporate media isn’t saying very much about Syria lately and that is a sure sign that victory is on the way. So is Israeli president Netanyahu’s meeting with Vladimir Putin. Things didn’t fall into place like the regime changers thought. Israel and others must move on to Plan B. Syria, Russia and Iran are the winners and that was not how things were supposed to play out. One can never say what is on Donald Trump’s mind but it appears that his administration isn’t going to fight for this particular lost cause. But one never knows. Another false flag chemical weapons attack may be in the offing and the response from the unpredictable president could reignite the fire that is going out. The losers did not undertake their scheme with a plan to lose and they may still pose dangers. But the moments of victory surely ought to be celebrated, as the people of Deir Ezzor did when they were freed from ISIS control. This should also be a moment for circumspection and honesty about the American government and the awful crime that was committed with bipartisan and international support. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should be vilified for the rest of their lives for what they did in Libya and Syria. Obama should not be given a pass because he has better manners than his boorish successor. Not only was Syria very nearly destroyed, but its people were scattered all over the world in an effort to escape warfare in their homeland. The disruption to European governments came about because they chose to stand with their partner in crime and parrot “Assad must go” instead of standing up to the hegemon. They even paid Turkish president Erdogan, one of the instigators of the crime, $3 billion to keep refugees from using his country as an escape route. His double dealing certainly paid off. A Syrian victory is to be applauded as it will make the United States think twice about trying the same thing anywhere else. The defeat also weakens Saudi Arabia and its campaign of terror against Yemen or any other country it should choose to target. The consequence of trying to strengthen America’s hand had the opposite effect. Russia is more engaged in the world, not less. China and Russia are closer. Iran and Hezbollah are stronger. All of the parties declared as enemies or adversaries or the axis of evil have emerged as the winners. Those on the left who are resolute in their condemnation of American aggression are the rhetorical winners. Let there be no confusion in the future. The left must always oppose regime change and must always support the forces who fight against it as the Syrian government has done. There should be no confusion about “good” and “bad” targets of aggression. United States foreign policy must be opposed, especially when it claims a responsibility to protect, or fight genocide or declare any other excuse for its aggression. The pro regime change clique are only left with name calling. Labeling Assad a butcher is the substitute for victory they thought was certain. The United States government is fortunately not the only player on the world stage. The other actors do well when they unify and keep its awful plans in check.

But fortunately for humanity, Assad hung on long enough and the Russian Federation finally decided to back up their ally with military help. It is good news that this war may soon be over. The United States and its allies committed a terrible crime against the Syrian people and five million of them were forced to flee their country to escape this latest example of state sponsored terrorism. There is no downside to Assad making good on his promise to take back his country from American sponsored jihadists. The United States corporate media isn’t saying very much about Syria lately and that is a sure sign that victory is on the way. So is Israeli president Netanyahu’s meeting with Vladimir Putin. Things didn’t fall into place like the regime changers thought. Israel and others must move on to Plan B. Syria, Russia and Iran are the winners and that was not how things were supposed to play out. One can never say what is on Donald Trump’s mind but it appears that his administration isn’t going to fight for this particular lost cause. But one never knows. Another false flag chemical weapons attack may be in the offing and the response from the unpredictable president could reignite the fire that is going out. The losers did not undertake their scheme with a plan to lose and they may still pose dangers. But the moments of victory surely ought to be celebrated, as the people of Deir Ezzor did when they were freed from ISIS control. This should also be a moment for circumspection and honesty about the American government and the awful crime that was committed with bipartisan and international support. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should be vilified for the rest of their lives for what they did in Libya and Syria. Obama should not be given a pass because he has better manners than his boorish successor. Not only was Syria very nearly destroyed, but its people were scattered all over the world in an effort to escape warfare in their homeland. The disruption to European governments came about because they chose to stand with their partner in crime and parrot “Assad must go” instead of standing up to the hegemon. They even paid Turkish president Erdogan, one of the instigators of the crime, $3 billion to keep refugees from using his country as an escape route. His double dealing certainly paid off. A Syrian victory is to be applauded as it will make the United States think twice about trying the same thing anywhere else. The defeat also weakens Saudi Arabia and its campaign of terror against Yemen or any other country it should choose to target. The consequence of trying to strengthen America’s hand had the opposite effect. Russia is more engaged in the world, not less. China and Russia are closer. Iran and Hezbollah are stronger. All of the parties declared as enemies or adversaries or the axis of evil have emerged as the winners. Those on the left who are resolute in their condemnation of American aggression are the rhetorical winners. Let there be no confusion in the future. The left must always oppose regime change and must always support the forces who fight against it as the Syrian government has done. There should be no confusion about “good” and “bad” targets of aggression. United States foreign policy must be opposed, especially when it claims a responsibility to protect, or fight genocide or declare any other excuse for its aggression. The pro regime change clique are only left with name calling. Labeling Assad a butcher is the substitute for victory they thought was certain. The United States government is fortunately not the only player on the world stage. The other actors do well when they unify and keep its awful plans in check.

News article:
By Neville Teller Devastated after years of conflict, Syria remains a huge battlefield, the scene of at least six separate military clashes. Still raging is the initial domestic battle between the Assad regime and Syrian opposition groups seeking a democratic alternative, both sides now bolstered by outside forces – Assad by Iran, Hezbollah and Russia; the opposition by Sunni Arab groupings. The second conflict is between Assad’s forces and those of Islamic State (IS), originally seeking to absorb the whole of Syria into its self-proclaimed caliphate. Thirdly there is the struggle between the 10-country US-led coalition against an IS which continues to be beaten back. Fourthly Turkey, while joining the fight against IS, mounts air strikes equally against the Kurdish Peshmerga troops – the Kurds and their campaign for autonomy are a long-standing source of friction within Turkey. The fifth conflict is the anti-IS campaign of the Peshmergas, the “boots on the ground” that the US coalition refused to place, and notably more successful than most of the other anti-IS activity. Finally, IS finds itself battling intermittently against a number of jihadist Sunni groups, including those pledged to al-Qaeda, that reject its claims to be the basis of an eventual world-wide caliphate. The maelstrom that is Syria has thrown up continuous attempts to resolve the fighting and settle the future of the country. Saudi Arabia has been involved in this effort from the very beginning, and is now taking a lead. The Syrian civil conflict was triggered during the so-called Arab Spring – that surprising manifestation of revolutionary zeal by the Arab masses, eager to throw off the authoritarian and often despotic rule which shackled so many of them. Saudi Arabia was, of course, no supporter of revolution, and in facing down its own potential Arab Spring it pursued a canny domestic policy. In essence the kingdom bought off its potential opposition by deploying its enormous wealth to enhance the incomes and social welfare of its population, spreading its largesse also among some of its fellow Gulf states. The one exception to Saudi’s support for the status quo in the Arab world was Syria. There Saudi sided with the revolution, providing vast financial aid and weapons to the forces opposing Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. At the heart of this policy lay the intense rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran for hegemony of the Muslim world. Syria had become an essential element in Iran’s effort to enhance and extend its Shia Crescent of influence, an effort which encompassed Hezbollah in Lebanon, and support for disruptive forces in many of the Gulf States, including Saudi itself, intent on substituting Shia for Sunni rule. Given that before millions fled the country, 74 percent of Syrians practiced Sunni Islam, the Saudi government wants to use its religious authority and economic resources to acquire influence over a post-Assad order. The last thing it wants to see is Iran taking over from IS as a dominant power in Syria. A variety of peace efforts, starting virtually at the beginning of Syria’s internal conflict, reached a degree of success in December 2015, when the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2254. This envisaged a Syrian-led, Syrian-owned political transition to end the conflict. That same month the foreign ministers of Iran, Turkey, and Russia agreed to hold Syrian peace talks in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, and since then peace has been pursued on a twin track – via the Astana route and by way of further Geneva peace talks under the auspices of the UN, though the Astana Process has the support of the UN’s special envoy, Staffan de Mistura. The Astana round in May 2017 resulted in the establishment of four “de-escalation zones” where combat operations were halted and conditions for humanitarian access provided. The deal was rejected by some rebel groups including the Democratic Union Party which believed the ceasefire zones were “dividing Syria up on a sectarian basis”. A fragile ceasefire agreed between Moscow and Washington in July 2017 covering a small area of south-western Syria, similarly did not meet with unified approval. In fact, division between the various Syrian groups opposed to Assad has been a bugbear of all peace efforts so far. Now Saudi Arabia is taking the initiative in trying to effect a reconciliation. The main body representing the Syrian opposition is known as the High Negotiations Committee (HNC). Currently two other groups, known as the Cairo and Moscow platforms, also claim to represent the Syrian opposition and have attended UN-brokered peace talks in Geneva alongside the HNC. Assad’s negotiators have not so far met directly with the opposition, on the grounds that there is no unified delegation. Now Saudi Arabia plans to host a meeting of all the main Syrian opposition groups in an attempt to “unite the ranks of the opposition”, in the words of Nasr Al Hariri, an HNC spokesman. The meeting is planned for October 2017. Even if Saudi Arabia succeeds, the biggest bone of contention in the UN Geneva-based peace process would remain the future of Bashar al-Assad. There is “no place for Assad in Syria’s future,” said a Saudi foreign ministry official on 7 August 2017. That was, until quite recently, also the position of the US. “Assad must go,” said ex-President Obama in October 2015. Following the poison gas attack in April 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said there was “no role” for Assad in Syria’s future and that “steps were under way” to remove him. There seems to have been a subtle shift in the US position. A US State Department official said on 7 August that while Washington “does not see Bashar al-Assad as having a role in the future of Syria … we believe the Syrian people must decide their own future through a political process that is credible, legitimate, and transparent.” This change of tone indicates that “we are definitely headed toward implicit acceptance of him staying for now in power,” said Faysal Itani, a resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. Itani believes the shift reflects the new military realities in Syria and a US desire to shift focus to Iran. Rex Tillerson said recently that “Iranian military forces inside of Syria must leave and go home.” Their departure from Syria was an “end state condition” for the US administration. While Saudi Arabia would doubtless approve of expelling Iranian forces, it would find the prospect of Assad remaining in power in a reconstituted Syria much less appealing. In this, it would be reinforced by a new unified Syrian opposition, if indeed it succeeds in welding it together, come October.

News article:
Syrian pro-government soldiers stand on a road on the outskirts of Deir Ezzor on Sunday as they continue to press forward with Russian air cover in the offensive against the Daesh group across the province (AFP photo) BEIRUT — Syria's President Bashar Assad appears to be winning the war against those who sought his overthrow, but he will preside over a ruined country with an economy in tatters. "Assad remains in charge of most of the population and most of the important territory, and I expect him to continue to rule most of Syria," said Aron Lund, a Syria expert with the Century Foundation think-tank. "The war goes on, but in the larger strategic sense he has defeated those who sought to depose him," Lund told AFP. The writing is on the wall even in the halls of the United Nations, where special envoy Staffan de Mistura last week bluntly urged Assad's opponents to be more pragmatic. "Will the opposition be able to be unified and realistic enough and realise that they did not win the war?" he asked. The comments drew ire from anti-government figures, who have long insisted that Assad must step down and cannot be part of any transitional government. The head of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, Nasr Al Hariri, called them "shocking and disappointing". But the opposition's demand for Assad's ouster looks increasingly unrealistic, as his regime finds itself in perhaps its strongest position since the eruption of the conflict in 2011. His army controls the country's main cities and possesses a considerable advantage in terms of firepower, thanks to the support of allies Iran and Russia. 'Completely destroyed' Over the past week, Syrian troops have made major advances in the east of the country, relieving two government-held enclaves in and around the city of Deir Ezzor that had been under siege by the Daesh extremist group since 2014. That leaves the government in control of half of Syria's territory and two-thirds of its population, more than any other side in the complex war. Kurdish-led forces hold around 23 per cent of its territory and Daesh 15 per cent, according to geographer and Syria expert Fabrice Balanche. Just 12 per cent is held by other armed groups, most of it by Syria's former Al Qaeda affiliate and its allies. But despite his territorial gains, Assad is likely to face low-level insurgencies for years to come, said Thomas Pierret, a Syria specialist at the University of Edinburgh. "Assad will stay in power for a long time — but with a strong probability that there will be ongoing, endemic armed insurrections," Pierret told AFP. "They will not threaten the central state directly, but they will be structurally threatening for a regime with other major weaknesses." Assad's regime will also need to pick up the pieces in a country that has been ravaged by six years of brutal conflict that have left more than 330,000 people dead, millions displaced and public infrastructure across much of the country in ruins. "He has definitely regained momentum and regained territory," said Maha Yahya of the Carnegie Endowment's Beirut-based Middle East Centre. "But frankly, he's regaining control of a country that's completely destroyed. I don't know what winning the war really means in a context like this." Problematic reconstruction According to the World Bank, the conflict has cost the Syrian economy some $226 billion — about four times the country's gross domestic product in 2010. The fighting has damaged or destroyed 27 per cent of Syria's housing stock and about half the country's medical and educational facilities. About 85 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and half are unemployed. "In the current state, I don't think there will be a rebuilding of the country," said Jihad Yazigi, author of the weekly Syria Report. With the cost of total reconstruction in Syria estimated to come to around $200 billion, Yazigi said it was more likely that medium-term rehabilitation would take place. "There will be a period of relative economic improvement lasting around 18 months to two years, as the electricity is repaired in certain areas and oil and gas extraction could resume," he said. Syria's financial institutions are not in a position to fund reconstruction efforts, as the assets of its 12 banks add up to a meagre $3.5 billion, according to Yazigi. And foreign bodies that could foot the bill will refuse to do so after years of accusing the Damascus government of atrocities and war crimes. "Those who could finance this reconstruction like Gulf states, the European Union, the World Bank — they have no intention of doing it," Yazigi said.

The writing is on the wall even in the halls of the United Nations, where special envoy Staffan de Mistura last week bluntly urged Assad's opponents to be more pragmatic. "Will the opposition be able to be unified and realistic enough and realise that they did not win the war?" he asked. The comments drew ire from anti-government figures, who have long insisted that Assad must step down and cannot be part of any transitional government. The head of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, Nasr Al Hariri, called them "shocking and disappointing". But the opposition's demand for Assad's ouster looks increasingly unrealistic, as his regime finds itself in perhaps its strongest position since the eruption of the conflict in 2011. His army controls the country's main cities and possesses a considerable advantage in terms of firepower, thanks to the support of allies Iran and Russia. 'Completely destroyed' Over the past week, Syrian troops have made major advances in the east of the country, relieving two government-held enclaves in and around the city of Deir Ezzor that had been under siege by the Daesh extremist group since 2014. That leaves the government in control of half of Syria's territory and two-thirds of its population, more than any other side in the complex war. Kurdish-led forces hold around 23 per cent of its territory and Daesh 15 per cent, according to geographer and Syria expert Fabrice Balanche. Just 12 per cent is held by other armed groups, most of it by Syria's former Al Qaeda affiliate and its allies. But despite his territorial gains, Assad is likely to face low-level insurgencies for years to come, said Thomas Pierret, a Syria specialist at the University of Edinburgh. "Assad will stay in power for a long time — but with a strong probability that there will be ongoing, endemic armed insurrections," Pierret told AFP. "They will not threaten the central state directly, but they will be structurally threatening for a regime with other major weaknesses." Assad's regime will also need to pick up the pieces in a country that has been ravaged by six years of brutal conflict that have left more than 330,000 people dead, millions displaced and public infrastructure across much of the country in ruins. "He has definitely regained momentum and regained territory," said Maha Yahya of the Carnegie Endowment's Beirut-based Middle East Centre. "But frankly, he's regaining control of a country that's completely destroyed. I don't know what winning the war really means in a context like this." Problematic reconstruction According to the World Bank, the conflict has cost the Syrian economy some $226 billion — about four times the country's gross domestic product in 2010. The fighting has damaged or destroyed 27 per cent of Syria's housing stock and about half the country's medical and educational facilities. About 85 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and half are unemployed. "In the current state, I don't think there will be a rebuilding of the country," said Jihad Yazigi, author of the weekly Syria Report. With the cost of total reconstruction in Syria estimated to come to around $200 billion, Yazigi said it was more likely that medium-term rehabilitation would take place. "There will be a period of relative economic improvement lasting around 18 months to two years, as the electricity is repaired in certain areas and oil and gas extraction could resume," he said. Syria's financial institutions are not in a position to fund reconstruction efforts, as the assets of its 12 banks add up to a meagre $3.5 billion, according to Yazigi. And foreign bodies that could foot the bill will refuse to do so after years of accusing the Damascus government of atrocities and war crimes. "Those who could finance this reconstruction like Gulf states, the European Union, the World Bank — they have no intention of doing it," Yazigi said.

News article:
The Russian military says the Syrian government has managed to liberate 85 percent of the country from the grips of terrorist groups, some two years after Moscow began a counterterrorism campaign in Syria at the official request of Damascus. Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lapin, the Russian chief of staff in Syria, announced the news in a press conference held at Hmeymim Air Base in Syria’s western province of Latakia on Tuesday. He added that Syrian forces must now clear the remaining 15 percent of the country, which amounts to 27,000 square kilometers, of terrorists. Lapin said Syrian troops continued the operation to free the eastern city of Dayr al-Zawr from Daesh Takfiri terrorist group, after they managed to break an almost three-year siege on the embattled city earlier this month. “Currently the operation to free the city is ongoing. The Syrian military will soon finish off” Daesh terrorists, who “used to occupy the city’s neighborhoods,” he added. Lapin stated that Kalibr cruise missiles, launched from the Black Sea escort vessel, Admiral Essen, had destroyed Daesh’s command posts and communication networks; an effective move that disrupted control of the terror group’s units in Dayr al-Zawr province. “Over 450 terrorists, five tanks and 42 pickups, with heavy machine guns, were liquidated during the operation,” he said. In a bid to aid the war-torn Arab nation in its war against foreign-sponsored terrorism, in September 2015, Russia started a campaign in Syria at an official request made by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russian warplanes, based in Hmeymim, have so far significantly aided the government troops in ridding Syria of the widespread militancy. One of the biggest breakthroughs in anti-terror offensives was made in December last year, when Syrian troops, backed by Russian air force, managed to gain full control of the city of Aleppo. A handout picture taken on March 16, 2016 and released by the Russian Defense Ministry shows a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 bomber taking off from Hmeymim military base in Latakia province, western Syria. (Photo by AFP) Moscow has also played a major role in co-sponsoring peace negotiations between the so-called armed opposition groups and Damascus to pave the way for implementing local ceasefires in the country and setting up de-escalation zones across Syria in an attempt to reduce fighting across the country. The sixth round of the intra-Syrian talks is scheduled to be held in the Kazakh capital city, Astana, to facilitate the creation of the fourth de-escalation zone in Syria’s western province of Idlib, where significant numbers of Takfiri terrorists, most notably from al-Nusra Front, are operating. The five previous rounds of such talks were also held in Astana, with Russia, Iran and Turkey serving as guarantor states. The United States and its allies have been bombarding what they call Daesh positions inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a United Nations mandate. The Syrian government has time and against expressed its strong opposition to the so-called military campaign. In early August, Damascus wrote similar letters to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the chairman of the UN Security Council, calling for the dissolution of the US-led coalition. According to a report by the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in August, 42,234 documented airstrikes in the country had resulted in a minimum estimate of some 7,000 civilians killed by the US-led coalition between 2014 and 2017. The UK-based group also reported on Tuesday that the so-called “coalition airstrikes killed 12 members of a single family, among them five children, in a village on the eastern banks of the Euphrates River,” in the village of al-Shahabat in Dayr al-Zawr province. Syria has been fighting different foreign-sponsored militant and terrorist groups since March 2011. The Damascus government has repeatedly blamed certain foreign countries for the spread of the devastating militancy.

News article:
Last week marked the lifting of the three-year Daesh siege of the city of Deir ez-Zor and the liberation of a local airfield , which had kept more than 1,000 Syrian troops locked in since January. However, the fighting to fully liberate the area is still underway. The successful Deir ez-Zor operation was the biggest breakthrough against Daesh since the terrorist group first launched an offensive in the province. The terrorists had been blockading Deir ez-Zor since 2014, with food and other supplies only being airlifted into the city. The group also took control over a large swath of the province of Deir ez-Zor and cut off roads to government-held districts. However, the operation to fully liberate the city of Deir ez-Zor and surrounding area from Daesh terrorists conducted by the Syrian army with the assistance of Russian warplanes is still underway. Earlier in the day, Russian submarines launched a strike on Daesh targets in the city with Kalibr cruise missiles to help fully free Deir ez-Zor. Safe Zones When commenting on the Astana-6 talks on the Syrian settlement, the Russian envoy said that the Syrian ceasefire guarantor states — namely Russia, Iran and Turkey — are ready to consider the participation of other countries in military policing of the safe zones in the country. "Observers, we are talking about the units of the Russian military police, which are already deployed in a number of areas of the de-escalation zones. They will be deployed also in the Idlib area, as they are now being deployed in the region of Homs and Eastern Ghouta. If there would be proposals from other countries on the use of their military contingents in the military police, we, representatives of the guarantor states, will consider them." He also said that the parties to Astana talks on Syria are "close" to finalizing an accord on the creation of four de-escalation zones, in particular in the country's northwestern province of Idlib, which is set to be observed by Russia, Iran and Turkey. Moreover, a commitee may be established to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire in safe zones.

Safe Zones When commenting on the Astana-6 talks on the Syrian settlement, the Russian envoy said that the Syrian ceasefire guarantor states — namely Russia, Iran and Turkey — are ready to consider the participation of other countries in military policing of the safe zones in the country. "Observers, we are talking about the units of the Russian military police, which are already deployed in a number of areas of the de-escalation zones. They will be deployed also in the Idlib area, as they are now being deployed in the region of Homs and Eastern Ghouta. If there would be proposals from other countries on the use of their military contingents in the military police, we, representatives of the guarantor states, will consider them." He also said that the parties to Astana talks on Syria are "close" to finalizing an accord on the creation of four de-escalation zones, in particular in the country's northwestern province of Idlib, which is set to be observed by Russia, Iran and Turkey. Moreover, a commitee may be established to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire in safe zones.

Russia Hopes Fight Against Daesh in Syria to End 'in Coming Months' Sputnik News 17:05 14.09.2017(updated 17:38 14.09.2017) Russia's presidential envoy for Syria has commented on the Syrian peace talks currently underway in Astana. He said he believes that Daesh terrorists in the country would be defeated soon due to the Syrian army's successful operation to free Deir ez-Zor, which resulted in the lifting of the three-year blockade of the city. ASTANA (Sputnik) – Moscow hopes that the fight against terrorists groups in Syria will be over in the coming months, the head of Russian delegation at Astana talks, Alexander Lavrentyev, who also serves as Special Presidential Envoy for Syria, told reporters during Astana talks on Syria. "In the past moths, there have been very positive developments on the ground, the Syrian government forces liberated Deir ez-Zor and successfully continue attacks on positions of the Islamic State [IS, Daesh, ISIS terrorist group, outlawed in Russia]. We hope that in the coming months the fight against these terrorist groups, including those supporting the IS, will be completed, and we will be able to talk about the need to fight against other groups, which pursue the overthrow of the current government in Syria," Lavrentyev said. He pointed out that Russia was seeking a peaceful solution to the political crisis in Syria. "But once again we hope that the opposition has common sense and that it will pursue a peaceful solution to the existing problems, search for common ground with the government on the issue," Lavrentyev said. Last week marked the lifting of the three-year Daesh siege of the city of Deir ez-Zor and the liberation of a local airfield, which had kept more than 1,000 Syrian troops locked in since January. However, the fighting to fully liberate the area is still underway. The successful Deir ez-Zor operation was the biggest breakthrough against Daesh since the terrorist group first launched an offensive in the province. The terrorists had been blockading Deir ez-Zor since 2014, with food and other supplies only being airlifted into the city. The group also took control over a large swath of the province of Deir ez-Zor and cut off roads to government-held districts. However, the operation to fully liberate the city of Deir ez-Zor and surrounding area from Daesh terrorists conducted by the Syrian army with the assistance of Russian warplanes is still underway. Earlier in the day, Russian submarines launched a strike on Daesh targets in the city with Kalibr cruise missiles to help fully free Deir ez-Zor. Safe Zones When commenting on the Astana-6 talks on the Syrian settlement, the Russian envoy said that the Syrian ceasefire guarantor states – namely Russia, Iran and Turkey – are ready to consider the participation of other countries in military policing of the safe zones in the country.

If there would be proposals from other countries on the use of their military contingents in the military police, we, representatives of the guarantor states, will consider them." He also said that the parties to Astana talks on Syria are "close" to finalizing an accord on the creation of four de-escalation zones, in particular in the country's northwestern province of Idlib, which is set to be observed by Russia, Iran and Turkey. Moreover, a commitee may be established to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire in safe zones. The main issue on the agenda of the Syrian peace talks in Astana is the creation of the fourth and last Syrian safe zone in the Idlib province. In July, Russia, Turkey and Iran, with help of Jordan and the United States as observers, tried to coordinate a whole range of specifics on the establishment of the four safe zones, but could not agree on all the details and sign the package of documents as a whole. The Astana meeting comes just after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan, where de-escalation on Syria presumably was on top of the agenda. More Astana Talks Observers Lavrentyev said that new observer nations to the Astana talks on Syria may be invited. "The Astana process is based on the work of the three guarantor states – Russia, Turkey and Iran. It will be possible to consider other countries' candidacies for the position of observers, among them such actors like China, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, if we receive their requests. We very carefully examine if a country meets criteria necessarily to let it act as an observer", Lavrentyev said. Commenting on the Astana-6 talks, he said that the results of the negotiations may be formalized within a UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutio, depending on the desire of the international community to support their outcome. "At this point several members of the international community do not want to see Iran in this process, that is why there is only a slight problem – to recognize the right of Iran to participate in the Syrian peace settlement, in the restoration of the destroyed economy and infrastructure of this country," the official concluded. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
The time has come for sharing spheres of influence and interests in Syria. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has emerged as a shrewd tactician now in possession of the keys to Syria’s new map. Lavrov’s however is not a Sykes-Picot style demarcation map. Rather, it officiates Russia’s suzerainty over Syria with the blessing and partnership of the United States; with practical reassurances to Israel headlined by the Golan Heights; with guaranteed influence for Iran and Turkey; and with assurances for Kurdish factions over self-rule. This Syria will be quasi demilitarized and unsovereign. Whether this is partition or sharing of influence, the Syria that we knew is gone. All talk of an Assad victory is invalidated by the fact that he allowed himself to be used in the war on terrorism, which the Syrian regime summoned and all foreign powers without exception exploited. The subsequent weakening of the power of the ruling Baath party will undermine and phase out the regime and the president himself, because the power of the Baath regime had stemmed from its monopoly over Syria, which is now history. All this is fine with the silent partner, who fully consents to turning Syria over to Russian tutelage, distributing territories and corridors as it pleases, because the United States wants a Syria with its teeth removed. In other words, we may as well bid farewell to the central state in Syria, because the continuation of that arrangement would render tomorrow’s Syria unstable, contrary to the desires of the Russian, US, European, Turkish, Iranian, and Israeli partners. To be sure, Lavrov’s map has redefined stability on the basis of sharing parts of Syria. And all the leaks about a US strategy to contain Iranian influence in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen is lip service meant to appease Arab ears. The US diplomacy, both civilian and military, is constantly consulting with the Russians behind the scenes on all regional issues. This is not odd itself, except that many of these consultations have been treated as a closely guarded secret even from the allies of the two sides in the Middle East. In reality, nothing has radically changed in terms of US-Russian accords on Arab conflicts after Donald Trump. He has followed in the footsteps of his predecessor Barack Obama for all intents and purposes, albeit he has escalated verbally and made empty promises that he quickly reneged on for ‘pragmatic’ reasons. Advertisement Those who believe that the US Congress will object to and obstruct Trump’s de-facto appeasement of Iran are adopting wishful thinking. Indeed, the priority of the Congress is Israel, and Israel is fine with the status quo. Indeed, the deals and accords have guaranteed for Tel Aviv control over Syria’s Golan Heights, as both a security buffer zone and de-facto annexed rather than occupied territories. Some may argue that UN resolutions and the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) preclude the annexation of the Golan, which Israel occupied 32 years ago. However, Lavrov’s map guaranteed for Israel a neutralized front with Russian, US, and international guarantees. It has also provided reassurances that no serious Syrian demand will henceforth be made for restoring the Golan Heights, because the old Syria is gone, and the new Syria now consists of spheres of Russian, US, Turkish, and Iranian influence without a significant central leadership. In other words, Syria will now be removed from the strategic equation with Israel, after Egypt was removed through the Camp David accords and Iraq through Bush’s invasion. Turkey has found a lifeline in the relationship with Russia. For this reason, it gave up Aleppo earlier, fully realizing that the city was the crucial linchpin of the future of Syria’s opposition. The Russian president Vladimir Putin has tamed his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and has managed to coax him into partially abandoning his sponsorship of the Muslim Brotherhood project, at least for now. Erdogan has discovered that the relationship with Russia is his best weapon with Europe, which has shunned Turkey and is almost regretful of having it as member of NATO. The two men share a hatred for the alliance now, although one sees it as an arch for and the other sees it as a necessary evil. The German chancellor Angela Merkel this week protested a Turkish-Russian arms deal, stressing that the contradiction between membership of NATO and purchasing Russian missile systems was not hypothetical. Merkel did not object to the Russian sponsorship of the Turkish-Iranian deal in Syria, which included Turkish military control in northern Syria, and an Iranian corridor from Tehran to Beirut via Syria and Iraq. To be sure, Germany in its own way is a sponsor of the Iranian projects in the name of safeguarding the nuclear deal no matter Tehran’s violations in other issues. Advertisement Turkey has guaranteed military presence in northern Syria indefinitely with US-Russian blessing. But it is not clear yet what Turkey will do with the Islamic State militants flooding to its gates, and what Turkey will do with the Muslim Brotherhood project, bearing in mind that the Russians are forging a special relationship with Egypt, and both issues deserve scrutiny at some point. At present, Moscow is keen for Egypt to play a role in Syria, but it continues to speak the language of the battlefield, where the priority remains for Turkey and Iran. The Russian-sponsored deal between Turkey and Iran would also allow Iran to control the area south of the Syrian capital to guarantee two main things: Preventing the independence of any Syrian government in Damascus, and the corridor crucial to Iran’s regional strategy. Here, Moscow may deliver on its promise of removing militias from Syria but only after the defeat of ISIS and the subduing of Syrian rebels of all backgrounds. Washington does not mind. All the US threats to Iran are folkloric now, part of the rhetoric on containing and reining in Iran’s expansionism in the Arab geography. This is the “last concern” of the Americans, however. All this rhetoric is calculated but certainly, the Trump administration will not abandon the nuclear deal with Iran no matter how much the US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley steps up her attacks on Iran, and the US-led international coalition will not stop Iran from seizing territories liberated from ISIS in Syria and Iraq. There won’t be any US steps to contain Iran’s influence in the two countries after operations against ISIS are concluded, when it will be too late any way. The Trump administration has reneged on its promises, and its promised new strategy is to avoid blame but will do little differently. The US deliberate absence has left the arena wide open to the Russians to draw Syria’s new map and beyond. Washington has turned the page on strategic, economic, and military rivalry with Moscow and has decided the time is ripe for accords and influence sharing with the Russians across the region. Advertisement In Iraq, where partition has become inevitable, both powers oppose the Kurdish hasty referendum for independence and secession. Practically, both realize that this scenario will not favor the Kurds, but will in fact benefit Iran, which has swept across Iraq’s sovereignty and geography to implement its Persian/Shia crescent project. Both powers understand what would be left for Iraq’s Sunnis, once the rulers of Iraq, is a bitter loss, and a state devoid of power and resources. Both have read well the Arab weakness and the Gulf’s priorities, and have promised new demarches in Yemen. There, both the US and Russia want Saudi Arabia to exit from the conflict, but while knowing the path to the solution they have not yet taken it. Indeed, the main knot in the Yemen crisis is Iran, and the US and Russia are not applying pressure there knowing fully well that Iran would not easily surrender a gateway to the Saudi border via the Houthi rebels. Here too, there are a lot of promises and but no real measures. In Lebanon, where Moscow and Washington agree on the priority of containment, both are reassured that the situation is under control, but they are not doing enough to sustain the country’s stability. The requests made by Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri during his visit to Russia this week included support for the army, another matter that both the US and Russia converge upon. However, regarding the other demand on the demarcation of Lebanese borders with Syria and Israel, the latter governed by the 1949 armistice agreement to the present day, there is an inexplicable reluctance by the Americans and Russians.

News article:
The time has come for sharing spheres of influence and interests in Syria. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has emerged as a shrewd tactician now in possession of the keys to Syria’s new map. Lavrov’s however is not a Sykes-Picot style demarcation map. Rather, it officiates Russia’s suzerainty over Syria with the blessing and partnership of the United States; with practical reassurances to Israel headlined by the Golan Heights; with guaranteed influence for Iran and Turkey; and with assurances for Kurdish factions over self-rule. This Syria will be quasi demilitarized and unsovereign. Whether this is partition or sharing of influence, the Syria that we knew is gone. All talk of an Assad victory is invalidated by the fact that he allowed himself to be used in the war on terrorism, which the Syrian regime summoned and all foreign powers without exception exploited. The subsequent weakening of the power of the ruling Baath party will undermine and phase out the regime and the president himself, because the power of the Baath regime had stemmed from its monopoly over Syria, which is now history. All this is fine with the silent partner, who fully consents to turning Syria over to Russian tutelage, distributing territories and corridors as it pleases, because the United States wants a Syria with its teeth removed. In other words, we may as well bid farewell to the central state in Syria, because the continuation of that arrangement would render tomorrow’s Syria unstable, contrary to the desires of the Russian, US, European, Turkish, Iranian, and Israeli partners. To be sure, Lavrov’s map has redefined stability on the basis of sharing parts of Syria. And all the leaks about a US strategy to contain Iranian influence in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen is lip service meant to appease Arab ears. The US diplomacy, both civilian and military, is constantly consulting with the Russians behind the scenes on all regional issues. This is not odd itself, except that many of these consultations have been treated as a closely guarded secret even from the allies of the two sides in the Middle East. In reality, nothing has radically changed in terms of US-Russian accords on Arab conflicts after Donald Trump. He has followed in the footsteps of his predecessor Barack Obama for all intents and purposes, albeit he has escalated verbally and made empty promises that he quickly reneged on for ‘pragmatic’ reasons. Advertisement Those who believe that the US Congress will object to and obstruct Trump’s de-facto appeasement of Iran are adopting wishful thinking. Indeed, the priority of the Congress is Israel, and Israel is fine with the status quo. Indeed, the deals and accords have guaranteed for Tel Aviv control over Syria’s Golan Heights, as both a security buffer zone and de-facto annexed rather than occupied territories. Some may argue that UN resolutions and the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) preclude the annexation of the Golan, which Israel occupied 32 years ago. However, Lavrov’s map guaranteed for Israel a neutralized front with Russian, US, and international guarantees. It has also provided reassurances that no serious Syrian demand will henceforth be made for restoring the Golan Heights, because the old Syria is gone, and the new Syria now consists of spheres of Russian, US, Turkish, and Iranian influence without a significant central leadership. In other words, Syria will now be removed from the strategic equation with Israel, after Egypt was removed through the Camp David accords and Iraq through Bush’s invasion. Turkey has found a lifeline in the relationship with Russia. For this reason, it gave up Aleppo earlier, fully realizing that the city was the crucial linchpin of the future of Syria’s opposition. The Russian president Vladimir Putin has tamed his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and has managed to coax him into partially abandoning his sponsorship of the Muslim Brotherhood project, at least for now. Erdogan has discovered that the relationship with Russia is his best weapon with Europe, which has shunned Turkey and is almost regretful of having it as member of NATO. The two men share a hatred for the alliance now, although one sees it as an arch for and the other sees it as a necessary evil. The German chancellor Angela Merkel this week protested a Turkish-Russian arms deal, stressing that the contradiction between membership of NATO and purchasing Russian missile systems was not hypothetical. Merkel did not object to the Russian sponsorship of the Turkish-Iranian deal in Syria, which included Turkish military control in northern Syria, and an Iranian corridor from Tehran to Beirut via Syria and Iraq. To be sure, Germany in its own way is a sponsor of the Iranian projects in the name of safeguarding the nuclear deal no matter Tehran’s violations in other issues. Advertisement Turkey has guaranteed military presence in northern Syria indefinitely with US-Russian blessing. But it is not clear yet what Turkey will do with the Islamic State militants flooding to its gates, and what Turkey will do with the Muslim Brotherhood project, bearing in mind that the Russians are forging a special relationship with Egypt, and both issues deserve scrutiny at some point. At present, Moscow is keen for Egypt to play a role in Syria, but it continues to speak the language of the battlefield, where the priority remains for Turkey and Iran. The Russian-sponsored deal between Turkey and Iran would also allow Iran to control the area south of the Syrian capital to guarantee two main things: Preventing the independence of any Syrian government in Damascus, and the corridor crucial to Iran’s regional strategy. Here, Moscow may deliver on its promise of removing militias from Syria but only after the defeat of ISIS and the subduing of Syrian rebels of all backgrounds. Washington does not mind. All the US threats to Iran are folkloric now, part of the rhetoric on containing and reining in Iran’s expansionism in the Arab geography. This is the “last concern” of the Americans, however. All this rhetoric is calculated but certainly, the Trump administration will not abandon the nuclear deal with Iran no matter how much the US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley steps up her attacks on Iran, and the US-led international coalition will not stop Iran from seizing territories liberated from ISIS in Syria and Iraq. There won’t be any US steps to contain Iran’s influence in the two countries after operations against ISIS are concluded, when it will be too late any way. The Trump administration has reneged on its promises, and its promised new strategy is to avoid blame but will do little differently. The US deliberate absence has left the arena wide open to the Russians to draw Syria’s new map and beyond. Washington has turned the page on strategic, economic, and military rivalry with Moscow and has decided the time is ripe for accords and influence sharing with the Russians across the region. Advertisement In Iraq, where partition has become inevitable, both powers oppose the Kurdish hasty referendum for independence and secession. Practically, both realize that this scenario will not favor the Kurds, but will in fact benefit Iran, which has swept across Iraq’s sovereignty and geography to implement its Persian/Shia crescent project. Both powers understand what would be left for Iraq’s Sunnis, once the rulers of Iraq, is a bitter loss, and a state devoid of power and resources. Both have read well the Arab weakness and the Gulf’s priorities, and have promised new demarches in Yemen. There, both the US and Russia want Saudi Arabia to exit from the conflict, but while knowing the path to the solution they have not yet taken it. Indeed, the main knot in the Yemen crisis is Iran, and the US and Russia are not applying pressure there knowing fully well that Iran would not easily surrender a gateway to the Saudi border via the Houthi rebels. Here too, there are a lot of promises and but no real measures. In Lebanon, where Moscow and Washington agree on the priority of containment, both are reassured that the situation is under control, but they are not doing enough to sustain the country’s stability. The requests made by Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri during his visit to Russia this week included support for the army, another matter that both the US and Russia converge upon. However, regarding the other demand on the demarcation of Lebanese borders with Syria and Israel, the latter governed by the 1949 armistice agreement to the present day, there is an inexplicable reluctance by the Americans and Russians.

News article:
During the last round of talks in Astana last week, Turkey, Russia and Iran agreed to set up de-escalation zones in parts of Syria for six months. The zones will include eastern Ghouta and the provinces of Idlib, Homs, Latakia, Aleppo and Hama. According to the agreement, the three countries will act as guarantors, while anti-government groups and forces loyal to the Syrian regime are supposed to respect the cease-fire. To supervise the process, Turkey, Iran and Russia will send 500 soldiers each to be deployed in the de-escalation zones. When you look at the map, you may notice that this new de-escalation zone, added to the formerly announced de-escalation zones in the Lebanon-Israel-Jordan border areas, includes quite an important part of Syria. All these de-escalation zones, from the North to the South, are to make sure that there will be no more fighting in Syria's Mediterranean provinces. The de-escalation zones are all strategically located in the hope of ending the fighting on the ground. This doesn't mean, however, that Syrian government forces will have full control over these areas once the fighting stops. In fact, these zones are not given either to the Syrian government nor the opposition, and their status remains to be decided later. It is reminiscent of the U.S.'s decision to impose a no-fly zone in northern Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War. Washington had hoped to make sure that Saddam Hussein wouldn't control these mainly Kurdish populated areas anymore, and indeed, Baghdad lost all authority over the region from that moment. Even after the fall of Saddam, the situation didn't really change. During all these years, the U.S. has seen local Kurdish leaders as its interlocutors and hinted that northern Iraq may one day become an independent entity, allied to Turkey and Israel, but an antagonist toward Iran. After a long period during which it has de facto acted independently of Baghdad, northern Iraq now wants to make the independence official and recognized by the international community through a referendum. Nevertheless, the region's main ally, namely the U.S., keeps saying that the timing is not right. Iraqi Kurdish leaders don't seem to be paying much attention to the warnings, however. This scenario may be repeated in Syria; that's why Turkey, Russia and Iran want to have boots on the ground simultaneously. The de-escalation zones are the result of a will for compromise, as these zones will not be ruled by Bashar Assad or any opposition group. These will be like international territories that are separate from the direct supervision of any single nation-state. The main motivation of the three involved countries is the U.S.'s relations with Syrian Kurds. They fear the U.S. may try to do in Syria what it did in Iraq; in other words: Push Syrian Kurds toward independence. First, no one is sure if Syria's dismemberment is a good idea; besides, no one can tell if the eventual Syrian Kurdish entity will be friendly toward Turkey and/or Iran. The position of Iraqi Kurds, however, was clear: They preferred to remain friends with Turkey and foes with Iran. As for an eventual Kurdish independent entity in Syria, it will apparently have only one friend: the U.S. All regional players are against it; thus, they are acting together to prevent it. Moreover, Israel doesn't seem to be complaining about the creation of de-escalation zones; so the U.S. can hardly find good arguments to oppose it. The U.S.'s hesitations in Syria have turned against it: It has lost the trust of its regional allies over the issue, while Russia has greatly benefited from the void. If the U.S. wants to reverse this failure, it would be wise to start by healing its relations with Turkey.

© Ali Hashisho / Reuters The incident near Deir ez-Zor during which US-backed opposition forces were allegedly injured by a Russian airstrike did not derail the US-Russia deconfliction agreement, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, adding that both countries remain committed to the process.Despite what was presented as a major setback in communication between Moscow and Washington in Syria last week,However, the deconfliction mechanism has not ceased to exist, Tillerson said at the meeting of the so-called Friends of Syria Group that took place on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York on Monday."The Secretary noted to the group we are working closely on deconfliction of operations in Deir ez-Zor and Euphrates valley area. We are confident that the deconfliction process can work and can succeed," US Acting Assistant Secretary of State David Satterfield said following the meeting, attended by Tillerson and the foreign ministers of about a dozen western and Arab counties, including France, Great Britain, Germany and Saudi Arabia.Tillerson was reportedly responding to a question by a reporter if he believes the incident put a nail in the coffin of the deconfliction agreement, adding that it has a considerable potential to freeze the hostilities.Satterfield said that Washington and Moscow are working together to prevent any further incidents."That's what we are committed to and that what our Russian counterparts tell us they are committed to," he said, as cited by Sputnik.Noting the decline in violence and in the number of displaced persons in Syria, Satterfield underscored the role of de-escalation zones, initiative, proposed by Russia and also brokered by Iran and Turkey. De-escalation zones are aimed at separating the extremist groups, including Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), former Al-Nusra Front, from the so-called moderate opposition. The boundaries of the final fourth de-escalation zone in Idlib were agreed Friday.The alleged bombing of the SDF was far from being the only incident related to the province of Deir ez-Zor, where the Syrian Army forces backed by Russian airstrikes have recently breached the three-year-long siege of the government-controlled city of Deir ez-Zor. On Sunday, the US-led coalition admitted to carrying out an airstrike that reportedly killed 12 civilians in the city of Mayadin, not confirming civilian casualties but saying that it will investigate. In September 2016, the US-led coalition planes bombed Syrian Army positions near the Deir ez-Zor Airport, killing more than 100 soldiers and injuring dozens of others. The coalition admitted that it targeted the Syrian forces by mistake but an internal probe "found no evidence of misconduct" in the picking of target. It has been revealed, however, that the US central command misinformed Russia about the precise location of the planned strike via the deconfliction hotline, resulting in the strikes going ahead.Meanwhile, the US continues to stress that it does not see deconfliction zones as a solution to the Syrian war, saying that only a political solution can pave the way for a stable and violence-free country."The reconstruction of Syria depends very much on that credible political process," Satterfield said, adding that major responsibility in achieving political settlement lies with the Geneva process and the United Nations.For its part, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Monday the establishment of de-escalation zones lay foundation for a political settlement envisioned in the UN resolutions, noting "positive processes," such as advances by the Syrian forces in the fight against terrorism.The implementation of the zones will also enable "more than a million Syrian refugees residing in Lebanon" get back home, the ministry said in a statement issued after Russia's Deputy FM Mikhail Bogdanov's meeting with Lebanese prime minister's Adviser for Russian Affairs George Shaaban.Tillerson was set to meet with Russia's Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov on Thursday at 21:00 GMT on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Announcing the summit, the State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that they were looking forward to the face-to-face meeting describing the US-Russia relationship as "an important one."

Daesh just filled the gap behind this crisis and I think the tripartite efforts are aimed at resolving this particular crisis,” Michael Flanagan continued. He added that he still fears that replacing the Assad government with the Muslim Brotherhood would be a bad thing for Syria, which could be plunged into a new civil war. “I believe that this scenario is being resisted. As for the future of Syria, I think that even though many are fairly satisfied with the Assad government, Assad himself probably has to go. Keeping the present government in place without Assad and without the Muslim Brotherhood being in charge would be the most hopeful and best future for Syria,” Michael Flanagan concluded. The United States, Britain and other anti-Assad countries will not support reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country until there’s a political transition, UK Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.

News article:
The EU has agreed a new package of measures to punish North Korea for its nuclear weapons programme Russia on Thursday clashed with the European Union over Syria, accusing the bloc of politicizing aid by linking reconstruction funds to a political transition that would end the war. The European Union in April secured pledges of $6 billion in aid for Syria, now in its seventh year of war, with over 330,000 people dead. At an EU-organized conference held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Russia's deputy foreign minister said aid was being used as a political tool to build pressure on Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. "The politicization of issues related to aid and the statements on the need to wait for the end of the political process are unacceptable," said Gennady Gatilov. European officials insist that aid will not flow to Syria until a credible political transition is agreed during UN-led negotiations to end the war. But Gatilov said aid was needed now "to rebuild schools, hospitals and critical infrastructure." US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could force Chinese banks or Russian importers to decide between doing business with North Korea or being blacklisted by the United States Britain argued that the Assad regime should not be rewarded with aid, while France accused Damascus of continuing to block humanitarian deliveries. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini announced that a second conference on reconstruction aid for Syria will be held in the spring of 2018. "We are ready to help even more, to see how we can help to bring back normal life in areas where violence has de-escalated, and to start working on reconstruction, only once a political agreement has been reached in Geneva," said Mogherini. The United Nations is planning to convene a new round of peace talks next month between Syria's government and the opposition even though past negotiations have failed to yield progress. With the rebel fighting position weakened, experts say the regime faces no pressure to make concessions at the negotiating table, and especially not over the question of Assad's future. The war in Syria has dropped off the top of the diplomatic agenda during this year's annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations, which instead has focussed heavily on the nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran.

News article:
By Mike Whitney The impending collapse of ISIS has touched off a race for territory in the oil-rich eastern part of Syria pitting US-backed forces against the Russian-led coalition of Syria, Iran and Hezbollah. This is the nightmare scenario that everyone wanted to avoid. Washington and Moscow’s armies are now converging on the same area at the same time greatly increasing the probability of a conflagration between the two nuclear-armed superpowers. The only way a clash can be avoided is if one party backs down, which seems increasingly unlikely. The situation can be easily explained. The vast swath of territory captured by ISIS is steadily shrinking due to the dogged perseverance of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) which has liberated most of the countryside west of the Euphrates River including the former ISIS stronghold at Deir Ezzor, a critical garrison at the center of the fighting. ISIS is also getting pressure from the north where the US-backed SDF is pounding their capital at Raqqa while deploying troops and tanks southward to the oil fields in Deir Ezzor province. Washington has made it clear that it wants its proxy-army to control the area east of the Euphrates establishing a soft partition between east and west. The US also wants to control Deir Ezzor’s vast oil resources in order to provide a reliable revenue stream for the emergent Kurdish statelet. Syrian President Bashar al Assad has said many times that he will never agree to the partitioning of the country. But the decision will not be made by Assad alone. His coalition partners in Moscow, Beirut and Tehran will also help shape the final settlement. As far as Putin is concerned, it seems extremely unlikely that he’d risk a protracted and bloody war with the United States simply to recapture every square inch of Syrian territory. The Russian president will probably allow the US to keep its bases in the northeast provided that critical areas are conceded to the regime. But where will the line be drawn, that’s the question? The US wants to control the area east of the Euphrates including the lucrative oil fields. This is why they deployed troops from the SDF southward even though they’re still needed in Raqqa. Earlier in the week, it looked like the Syrian Army had a leg up on the SDF as troops and armored vehicles crossed the Euphrates headed east to the oil fields. But reports that appeared late Thursday indicate that the SDF has beaten them to the punch. This is from South Front: “On Thursday, the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) …captured Tabiyeh and al-Isba oil fields in the northwestern Deir Ezzor countryside, according to pro-Kurdish sources. … If these reports are confirmed, the SDF will be in control over a half of Syria’s oil reserve. Moreover, that will mean that the SDF at least partly blocked the SAA way on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river.” (“Syrian Democratic Forces Capture Key Oil Fields In Deir Ezzor”, South Front) This is a major setback for the Russian coalition. It means that the SAA backed by the Russian Airforce will have to fight a group which, up to this point, has been an ally in the war against ISIS. Now it’s clear that the mainly-Kurdish SDF is no ally, it’s an enemy that wants to steal Syria’s resources and carve a state out of its eastern flank. The news about the SDF’s arrival at the oil fields came just hours after the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov issued a terse warning to the US and SDF that Russia would retaliate if SAA positions were attacked again by SDF mortar or rocket fire. Quote: “Russia unequivocally told the commanders of US forces in Al Udeid Airbase (Qatar) that it will not tolerate any shelling from the areas where the SDF are stationed (…) Fire from positions in regions [controlled by the SDF] will be suppressed by all means necessary.” In retrospect, it looks like the SDF had already decided to make a clean break with the government leaving no doubt of where they stood. Washington is using the SDF to seize the oil fields and to claim to the entire east side of the Euphrates for its own. There’s no doubt that these combat units of the SDF are accompanied by US Special Forces who are providing critical communications, logistic and tactical support. This operation has Washington’s fingerprints all over it. On Friday morning, loyalist forces led by the 5th Assault Corps ISIS Hunters, established full control over Khusham village on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River near Deir Ezzor city. The strategically-located village blocks a key road linking the area held by the SDF to the Omar oil fields. Get the picture? US-backed forces and Russian coalition members are now operating cheek-to-jowl in the same theatre trying to seize the same oil-rich scrap of land. This has all the makings of a major head-on collision. Putin is a cautious and reasonable man, but he’s not going to hand over Syria’s oil fields without a fight. Besides, Assad needs the oil receipts to finance the rebuilding of his decimated country. Equally important, he needs the territory east of Deir Ezzor to for an overland route connecting Beirut to Damascus to Baghdad to Tehran, the so-called Arab Superhighway. Putin’s job is to glue as much of the country together as needed to create a viable state. So while he may allow the SDF and US military to occupy parts of the northeast, he’s not going to surrender crucial resources or strategically-located territory. So what does it all mean? Does it mean that Russia will support Assad’s attempts to liberate the oil fields even if it could trigger a broader war with the United States? Yes, that’s exactly what it means. Putin doesn’t want a slugfest with Uncle Sam, but he’s not going to abandon an ally either. So there’s going to be a confrontation because neither party is willing to give up what they feel they need to achieve success. So there you have it. As the standoff begins to take shape in east Syria, the two rival superpowers are preparing themselves for the worst. Clearly, we have reached the most dangerous moment in the six year-long war.

News article:
UNITED NATIONS - Syria's foreign minister told world leaders Saturday that his country is "marching steadily" toward the goal of rooting out terrorism—and "victory is now within reach." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Walid Muallem pointed to "the liberation of Aleppo and Palmyra," the end to the siege of Deir ez-Zour by the Islamic State extremist group, "and the eradication of terrorism from many parts of Syria" by the Syrian army and its supporters and allies, including Russia and Iran. Russia's military said about two weeks ago that Syrian troops have liberated about 85 percent of the war-torn country's territory from militants, a major turn-around two years after Moscow intervened to lend a hand to its embattled long-time ally. Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Muallem (Photo: AFP) Muallem heaped praise on the army and the country's allies and looked ahead to victory, though fighting still continues in many areas of the country. "I am confident that when this unjust war on Syria is over, the Syrian army will go down in history as the army that heroically defeated, along with its supporting forces and its allies, the terrorists that came to Syria from many countries and received large support from the most powerful countries of the world," he said. Israel, he said, was one of the countries supporting the rebels. "It gave them various forms of support—money, equipment, weapons, means of communications—and even bombed Syrian army posts in aid of the terrorist plans," Muallem charged. "The unlimited Israeli aid to the terrorists does not surprise. They share interests and the goals." While the army and its supporting forces and allies "are making daily achievements, clearing out territories and uprooting terrorists," Muallem said, "the threat of this plague persists." On the political front, he said local reconciliation agreements have allowed tens of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees to return home. He said "Syria is determined to scale up reconciliation efforts, whenever possible." Syrian and Hezbollah forces (Photo: Reuters) Russia, Turkey and Iran have been negotiating separately for months in the Kazakh capital Astana to try to reduce violence on the ground by creating de-escalation zones across the country, although those talks do not cover a long-term political solution to the six-year civil war. Muallem said Syria is encouraged by talks in Astana and expressed hope that these talks "will help us reach an actual cessation of hostilities and separate terrorist groups" like ISIS from groups that have agreed to join the Astana process. Nevertheless, he said: "Syria reserves the right to respond to any violation by the other party. Syria also stresses that these zones are a temporary arrangement that must not violate the territorial unity of Syria." Earlier this month Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to deploy observers on the edge of a "de-escalation" zone in Syria's Idlib province, which is largely under the control of Islamist insurgents. The move falls under a broader deal in which they would set up four such zones across Syria. The de-escalation plan has eased fighting in parts of western Syria between rebel factions and government forces loyal to Assad. Assad has gained the military upper hand against an array of rebel groups, including some that have received backing from the United States, Turkey and Gulf monarchies. Critics have described the de-escalation plan as de facto partitioning of Syria after years of multi-sided conflict. Moscow, Tehran and Ankara deny this and say the zones will be temporary, although they could extend beyond the initial six-month term. Muallem reaffirmed the Syrian government's commitment to further progress in Geneva talks, which are aimed at establishing a transitional government, drafting a new constitution and holding elections in Syria. "This process has yet to bear fruit in the absence of a genuine national opposition that can be a partner in Syria's future," he said, "and as countries with influence over the other party continue to block any meaningful progress." Talks among Syrian opposition groups are expected to take place in early October in hopes of producing a unified delegation in Geneva.

The general believes that Washington has not abandoned its plans yet: the conflict is being exported to other regions — former Soviet Republics south of Russia, Myanmar, and Iraqi Kurdistan. Islam is being used as a smokescreen for the operations aimed at undermining Russia, Iran and the countries of the Middle Eastern region, according to the military expert. Syrian political scientist Akram al-Shilli echoed Brig. Gen. Abbas: Contrary to popular belief, terrorists are not isolated fighting groups, but a complicated organization with its own leadership and big aggressive states behind them, such as, for example, the United States. According to al-Shilli, the US had a hand in creating al-Qaeda, Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Nusra Front. Russia, Syria, Iran on Guard of Mid-East Territorial Integrity "Russia, Syria, Iran are the states that successfully resist this dangerous phenomenon," al-Shilli told Sputnik. The political scientist suggested that even though Washington's plan to tear the Middle East apart has largely failed, the focus has been shifted to Iraqi Kurdistan. Referring to the independence vote that took place on September 25 in the Iraqi autonomous region, al-Shilli called attention to the possible implications of the emergence of a sovereign entity on the territory of Iraq. "If Iraqi Kurdistan gets independence, then Kurdish enclaves in northern Syria will want to join this formation," al-Shilli pointed out. "In the future, this will cause divisions in the [Middle Eastern] region, which is exactly what US politicians want. Therefore, we can't assume that the US has abandoned its plans."

Abbas: Contrary to popular belief, terrorists are not isolated fighting groups, but a complicated organization with its own leadership and big aggressive states behind them, such as, for example, the United States. According to al-Shilli, the US had a hand in creating al-Qaeda, Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Nusra Front. Russia, Syria, Iran on Guard of Mid-East Territorial Integrity "Russia, Syria, Iran are the states that successfully resist this dangerous phenomenon," al-Shilli told Sputnik. The political scientist suggested that even though Washington's plan to tear the Middle East apart has largely failed, the focus has been shifted to Iraqi Kurdistan. Referring to the independence vote that took place on September 25 in the Iraqi autonomous region, al-Shilli called attention to the possible implications of the emergence of a sovereign entity on the territory of Iraq. "If Iraqi Kurdistan gets independence, then Kurdish enclaves in northern Syria will want to join this formation," al-Shilli pointed out. "In the future, this will cause divisions in the [Middle Eastern] region, which is exactly what US politicians want. Therefore, we can't assume that the US has abandoned its plans."

"After two years of Russia’s military operations in Syria, it is now clear that its results have been successful both in military and political terms. Russia has turned the tide of the conflict. Russia is now playing a key role in the Syrian settlement and its influence in the Middle East is beyond any doubt," Giampiero Venturi, Italian geopolitical analyst with the website Difesa Online, told Sputnik Italy. Moscow has been conducting an anti-terrorist operation in Syria since September 30, 2015. Unlike the operation by the US-led international coalition, the Russian efforts in Syria are fully legitimate since the campaign was launched at the request of Syrian President Bashar Assad. According to Venturi, the situation in Syria underscores the importance of global efforts against terrorism, especially against Daesh. Russia’s involvement has changed the political and military situation in Syria, but it also sheds light on the geopolitical balance in the Middle East, a region that has been the "victim of Western political mistakes" for the last two decades.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has reiterated Damascus' calls to "dissolve" the international coalition led by Washington in Syria, accusing the alliance of not fighting terrorists, but rather destroying the country and its people. "This coalition was created to annihilate ISIS [Islamic State/IS], but it annihilates the Syrian people and not ISIS," Muallem told RT in Sochi, where the minister held talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. The Syrian diplomat said that, contrary to its stated mission, the US-led alliance "protects ISIS," and that he saw no sense in so many countries being members of the coalition. Muallem also branded the 62-state alliance "froth," insisting that "it should cease to exist." "This international coalition has been committing crimes against the Syrian people. In the last two months, thousands of Syrian civilians, women and children mainly, have become the victims of these crimes," he said. During his talks with the Russian foreign minister, Muallem said Damascus would "insist on dissolution of the coalition in the strongest possible terms." Washington uses the anti-terrorist alliance as a "cover to destroy Syria" and its economic infrastructure in particular, he told Lavrov, adding that the US wants the war in Syria "to last as long as possible." The minister also lashed out at Ankara, claiming "there is a close connection" between Turkey and terrorist groups in Syria. "Turkey trains terrorists, arms them and facilitates their infiltration into the territory of Syria. This is why I can state that Turkey's presence in Syria is illegal," Muallem told RT. READ MORE: US-backed forces on collision course with Syrian Army in ‘race for Deir ez-Zor oilfields’ The Syrian Army has been fighting Islamic State, Al-Nusra Front and other terrorist groups on its territory for years. Moscow joined Damascus' efforts in September 2015, with Russia's anti-terrorist campaign launched at the request of the Syrian government. Moscow also initiated the Astana peace talks in Kazakhstan's capital, with the participation of Iran and Turkey. Several rounds of negotiations have resulted in the establishment of so-called de-escalation zones in Syria. Meanwhile, the US-led campaign in the region has long been dubbed "illegitimate" by Damascus. Demanding that the alliance's strikes in Syria stop, the government has sent official letters to the United Nations. The US and its allies must pay for the destruction of Syrian infrastructure and bear legal responsibility for "illegitimately" bombing civilian targets, Damascus says. On some occasions, the American forces in Syria, which are also backing a number of militia groups in the country, have come in direct military contact with Syrian forces. Earlier this year, the US military attacked troops loyal to Damascus for allegedly violating the borders of US-controlled zones. In August, Syrian President Bashar Assad said that no form of constructive dialogue with the West was possible, explaining that any rhetoric which claims that Western countries are fighting terrorism does not necessarily support the reality on the ground.

News article:
When the U.S. and its allies finally began their offensive to defeat the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) in the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor in August 2017, the Syrian battlefield looked very different to when the conflict began in 2011. Back then, President Barack Obama came out in support of rebels trying to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, in 2012, began arming them. In the years since, America's friends and foes have shifted, however, and its leading rival, Russia, stepped in to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad quell a nationwide rebellion and reclaim the lion's share of his country. Moscow's entrance to the conflict, along with growing jihadist influence among rebel groups, forced the U.S. to realign its position and settle on a new, informal goal: stopping Iran. The U.S., now led by maverick President Donald Trump, suspects Iran is seeking to establish a long-term foothold to build an international corridor of influence stretching from Tehran to Beirut and Washington is struggling to stop it. Related: Russia says Syria war will end soon with help from Turkey Taking advantage of eastern Syria's tribal roots, however, one team of analysts say the U.S. may have a chance to retain a stake in Syria. But doing so may take a level of clarity and commitment not yet seen by the U.S. in its approach to the six-year conflict and it may already be too late to do so. "This is a larger challenge in Deir Ezzor than any part of Syria for the coalition and for the Syrian Democratic Forces," Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, tells Newsweek. Beginnings of a Conflict in Tribal Deir Ezzor Heras teamed up with Bassam Barabandi, co-founder of anti-Assad activist group People Demand Change and a Deir Ezzor native, to research and map out the complex, yet vastly influential network of tribes that shape Deir Ezzor society. Their report, which was published in full last week, details not only the current state of what's become the most highly contested province of Syria, but how it became the latest focal point for violence in Syria. Prior to the 2011 uprising against Assad's government that precipitated the ongoing conflict in Syria, Deir Ezzor was in poor shape. The largely rural province was suffering the effects of years of urbanization, with younger Syrians choosing to live in larger cities like Damascus and Aleppo, and a crippling drought made worse by state mismanagement. Residents were bitter, but when demonstrations condemning government corruption, unemployment and lack of social freedoms devolved into armed clashes between security forces and what would ultimately become the Syrian opposition, Deir Ezzor was one of the last areas to turn to revolution. While tribesmen may have seen the growing rebellion as an opportunity to ditch the state, they were also very cautious not to back a losing faction and risk further chaos in a part of the country very rooted in tradition. In 2012, when the anti-Assad insurgency reached "critical mass" as Heras says, armed opposition groups composed mainly of tribal militias gained momentum against pro-government forces and ultimately expelled most of them from the city in 2013. The remainder would remain trapped for years to come. As the opposition fended off Syrian military attempts to regain the city, locals' fears of further bloodshed appeared validated as various rebel groups, including Al-Qaeda's Nusra Front, battled one another for control of the province's lucrative oil fields. The situation only got worse when a new, more powerful entity took advantage of the infighting to gain a foothold in Deir Ezzor. The Rise and Fall of ISIS After breaking off from Al-Qaeda in 2013 the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) spread across half of Iraq and into neighboring Syria. ISIS swarmed Deir Ezzor in summer 2014 and enlisted the support of the province's disillusioned tribal leaders by force and by presenting itself as the most stable, wealthy guarantor for locals. Most acquiesced and helped fuel what would become an economic and political hub for the jihadists' self-proclaimed caliphate. In the three years since, ISIS lost most of its ground across the border in Iraq and separate campaigns by the Russia-backed Syrian military and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Kurdish alliance of Arabs and ethnic minorities that's taken the place of rebels as the U.S.'s main ally in Syria, have begun closing in on what is now the jihadists' last major city. Both the Syrian government and Kurdish leaders are looking to oust ISIS, but they have different visions for Deir Ezzor once the militants are defeated. Once the competition to annihilate ISIS ends, they'll have to face off once again to appeal to locals to support their post-war plans. So far, Assad may have the upper hand. The Syrian leader, who once appeared poised to fall after withdrawing his military from most of the country early on in the war, has since been able to retake nearly every major population center. With the help of Russia and Iran, Assad has retaken up to half the city and pushed the jihadists back across the Euphrates. Assad's staying power leaves him a serious option for tribes, who may be reluctant to reconcile with the government, but also remain skeptical of the U.S.'s longevity in the conflict once ISIS is defeated. Many locals of Deir Ezzor have direct relations in Iraq's Anbar province, where the U.S. made a number of deals to secure local support against ISIS's previous incarnation, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, back in 2006. When ISIS ultimately took control of the region years later in 2014, Washington's promises did little to defend Iraqi tribesmen from the jihadist wrath. "In Deir Ezzor, Assad would have to play the long-term game rooted in the assumption that the Americans and their allies will eventually leave," Heras tells Newsweek. "[Local tribes] still trust that Assad will return and stay, assuming that the Americans won't stay for decades to come." Suspicious of U.S. and Iran's Intentions Heras describes the area as "much more anti-Iran than pro-America," which may actually present itself as an opportunity for the U.S. As little support the U.S., and much less the Kurds, has among residents of Deir Ezzor, local distrust of Iran may be greater. Tehran's campaign to expand its influence across the Middle East has proved an effective force against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, but it's also drawn the scorn of Sunni Muslims, who enjoy a solid majority in Deir Ezzor and many other parts of the region. Broken promises in Iraq may mar potential alliances between the U.S. and tribes in Syria, but Assad's proximity to Iran and its allies may have even greater consequences in the current scheme of things. With ISIS largely defeated in western Iraq, the largely Sunni Muslim Iraqi relatives of Deir Ezzor's tribes now fear retribution from the majority-Shiite Muslim Popular Mobilization Forces, known as Al-Hashd Al-Shaabi, backed by both Tehran and Baghdad. These militias and their fellow Iran-backed allies across the border in Syria have nearly completed a land route allowing pro-Iran elements to move freely between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Heras says the U.S.'s best chance of limiting Assad and Iran's influence in Deir Ezzor would be to back a powerful, representative military council whose structure mimics the Syrian Democratic Forces in the north, but remains independent enough as not to appear as a Kurdish takeover in a region still very much attached to Arab nationalism. Genevieve Casagrande, Syria research analyst at the Institute for the Study of War cautioned that any perceived connection to Kurdish groups would doom any plans to recruit these tribes for a self-ruling council. Such tensions plague similar councils in the Syrian cities of Manbij and Raqqa. "Even if you have this sort of Arab component to the Syrian Democratic Forces, there's a fear that a local government will be dependent and subordinate to the Kurdish governance project, which the population of Deir Ezzor will reject," Casagrande tells Newsweek. A Race for Oil With Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies steadily gaining in Deir Ezzor city, however, the U.S. and its Kurdish allies may have already abandoned efforts to take the regional capital. In fact, their southwestern advance against ISIS appears to indicate another target altogether, Syria's main oil fields located in rural Deir Ezzor. Syrian military affairs analyst Wael al-Hussaini says both the U.S. and Russia are vying for control over these lucrative oil and gas fields and that, although he believed U.S.-backed Kurds would succeed in securing a number of these strategic sites, they would ultimately be willing to return them to Assad as part of post-war agreement, potentially in return for greater autonomy in the north. Hussaini says that, after a Kurdish independence referendum drew condemnation from nearly every regional actor and was even rejected by the U.S., Syrian Kurds would try to avoid pushing for full statehood. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said last month that Damascus may be willing to negotiate "some sort of self-management" for Kurds in the north once ISIS was defeated and the Kurds may see Deir Ezzor's oil fields as bargaining chips in future talks. "If you don't have access to water and your neighbor can shut down its borders and your airspace can be closed also, then you won't be able to establish an independent state. So eventually they will have to talk to the Syrian government," Hussaini tells Newsweek. "Dramatically Outpaced" Reconciliation between the Syrian government and Kurds could provide Trump a defensible exit strategy from the conflict, but it still leaves the door open for Iran's eventual expansion. Only capitalizing on the remaining revolutionary and sectarian fervor of Deir Ezzor's Sunni Muslim tribal confederations ensures support in keeping Iran out, at least until a pro-U.S. autonomous leadership was formed in the city. Revitalizing these tensions, however, could ignite further bloodshed for years to come. Even if the U.S. did try to capitalize on local tensions to recruit tribal fighters, it appears that Assad and his allies have beaten Washington to it. Neil Hauer, lead analyst at the SecDev Group, says the U.S. has been "dramatically outpaced by Iran and the regime in terms of outreach to tribes." He explains that the Syrian government and Iran, having long planned the Deir Ezzor offensive, have already established pro-government networks. "Syrian and Iranian officials have been working hard to establish links with the tribes of Deir Ezzor for nearly a year now, with the knowledge that eventually they would be moving towards this area as clashes with rebels were largely frozen and efforts from all sides focused more on IS territory," Hauer tells Newsweek. "U.S. and Syrian Democratic Forces efforts pale in comparison, especially as the latter is increasingly viewed as a Kurdish nationalist project." "A Game of Great Powers" With the U.S. having essentially lost its foothold in eastern Syria, Iran may still encounter major obstacles to its long-term plans for the region. Aram Nerguizian, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that, as the U.S. concludes its anti-ISIS campaign and Assad reasserts control, observers would be most interested in examining how the strategic relationship between Iran and Russia plays out. The two powers formed an alliance of convenience in response to the conflict, but Russia's willingness to engage amicably with Iran's two greatest foes, Israel and Saudi Arabia, may erode Moscow and Tehran's tolerance of one another. China too, has a stake in the region as part of its greater "One Belt One Road" initiative, meaning post-war Syria will likely continue to be a theater for a number of major international powers. "How will the great powers agree to disagree on spheres of influence?" Nerguizian tells Newsweek. "It's still very much a game of great powers."

News article:
When the U.S. and its allies finally began their offensive to defeat the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) in the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor in August 2017, the Syrian battlefield looked very different to when the conflict began in 2011. Back then, President Barack Obama came out in support of rebels trying to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, in 2012, began arming them. In the years since, America's friends and foes have shifted, however, and its leading rival, Russia, stepped in to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad quell a nationwide rebellion and reclaim the lion's share of his country. Moscow's entrance to the conflict, along with growing jihadist influence among rebel groups, forced the U.S. to realign its position and settle on a new, informal goal: stopping Iran. The U.S., now led by maverick President Donald Trump, suspects Iran is seeking to establish a long-term foothold to build an international corridor of influence stretching from Tehran to Beirut and Washington is struggling to stop it. Related: Russia says Syria war will end soon with help from Turkey Taking advantage of eastern Syria's tribal roots, however, one team of analysts say the U.S. may have a chance to retain a stake in Syria. But doing so may take a level of clarity and commitment not yet seen by the U.S. in its approach to the six-year conflict and it may already be too late to do so. "This is a larger challenge in Deir Ezzor than any part of Syria for the coalition and for the Syrian Democratic Forces," Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, tells Newsweek. Beginnings of a Conflict in Tribal Deir Ezzor Heras teamed up with Bassam Barabandi, co-founder of anti-Assad activist group People Demand Change and a Deir Ezzor native, to research and map out the complex, yet vastly influential network of tribes that shape Deir Ezzor society. Their report, which was published in full last week, details not only the current state of what's become the most highly contested province of Syria, but how it became the latest focal point for violence in Syria. Prior to the 2011 uprising against Assad's government that precipitated the ongoing conflict in Syria, Deir Ezzor was in poor shape. The largely rural province was suffering the effects of years of urbanization, with younger Syrians choosing to live in larger cities like Damascus and Aleppo, and a crippling drought made worse by state mismanagement. Residents were bitter, but when demonstrations condemning government corruption, unemployment and lack of social freedoms devolved into armed clashes between security forces and what would ultimately become the Syrian opposition, Deir Ezzor was one of the last areas to turn to revolution. While tribesmen may have seen the growing rebellion as an opportunity to ditch the state, they were also very cautious not to back a losing faction and risk further chaos in a part of the country very rooted in tradition. In 2012, when the anti-Assad insurgency reached "critical mass" as Heras says, armed opposition groups composed mainly of tribal militias gained momentum against pro-government forces and ultimately expelled most of them from the city in 2013. The remainder would remain trapped for years to come. As the opposition fended off Syrian military attempts to regain the city, locals' fears of further bloodshed appeared validated as various rebel groups, including Al-Qaeda's Nusra Front, battled one another for control of the province's lucrative oil fields. The situation only got worse when a new, more powerful entity took advantage of the infighting to gain a foothold in Deir Ezzor. The Rise and Fall of ISIS After breaking off from Al-Qaeda in 2013 the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) spread across half of Iraq and into neighboring Syria. ISIS swarmed Deir Ezzor in summer 2014 and enlisted the support of the province's disillusioned tribal leaders by force and by presenting itself as the most stable, wealthy guarantor for locals. Most acquiesced and helped fuel what would become an economic and political hub for the jihadists' self-proclaimed caliphate. In the three years since, ISIS lost most of its ground across the border in Iraq and separate campaigns by the Russia-backed Syrian military and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Kurdish alliance of Arabs and ethnic minorities that's taken the place of rebels as the U.S.'s main ally in Syria, have begun closing in on what is now the jihadists' last major city. Both the Syrian government and Kurdish leaders are looking to oust ISIS, but they have different visions for Deir Ezzor once the militants are defeated. Once the competition to annihilate ISIS ends, they'll have to face off once again to appeal to locals to support their post-war plans. So far, Assad may have the upper hand. The Syrian leader, who once appeared poised to fall after withdrawing his military from most of the country early on in the war, has since been able to retake nearly every major population center. With the help of Russia and Iran, Assad has retaken up to half the city and pushed the jihadists back across the Euphrates. Assad's staying power leaves him a serious option for tribes, who may be reluctant to reconcile with the government, but also remain skeptical of the U.S.'s longevity in the conflict once ISIS is defeated. Many locals of Deir Ezzor have direct relations in Iraq's Anbar province, where the U.S. made a number of deals to secure local support against ISIS's previous incarnation, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, back in 2006. When ISIS ultimately took control of the region years later in 2014, Washington's promises did little to defend Iraqi tribesmen from the jihadist wrath. "In Deir Ezzor, Assad would have to play the long-term game rooted in the assumption that the Americans and their allies will eventually leave," Heras tells Newsweek. "[Local tribes] still trust that Assad will return and stay, assuming that the Americans won't stay for decades to come." Suspicious of U.S. and Iran's Intentions Heras describes the area as "much more anti-Iran than pro-America," which may actually present itself as an opportunity for the U.S. As little support the U.S., and much less the Kurds, has among residents of Deir Ezzor, local distrust of Iran may be greater. Tehran's campaign to expand its influence across the Middle East has proved an effective force against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, but it's also drawn the scorn of Sunni Muslims, who enjoy a solid majority in Deir Ezzor and many other parts of the region. Broken promises in Iraq may mar potential alliances between the U.S. and tribes in Syria, but Assad's proximity to Iran and its allies may have even greater consequences in the current scheme of things. With ISIS largely defeated in western Iraq, the largely Sunni Muslim Iraqi relatives of Deir Ezzor's tribes now fear retribution from the majority-Shiite Muslim Popular Mobilization Forces, known as Al-Hashd Al-Shaabi, backed by both Tehran and Baghdad. These militias and their fellow Iran-backed allies across the border in Syria have nearly completed a land route allowing pro-Iran elements to move freely between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Heras says the U.S.'s best chance of limiting Assad and Iran's influence in Deir Ezzor would be to back a powerful, representative military council whose structure mimics the Syrian Democratic Forces in the north, but remains independent enough as not to appear as a Kurdish takeover in a region still very much attached to Arab nationalism. Genevieve Casagrande, Syria research analyst at the Institute for the Study of War cautioned that any perceived connection to Kurdish groups would doom any plans to recruit these tribes for a self-ruling council. Such tensions plague similar councils in the Syrian cities of Manbij and Raqqa. "Even if you have this sort of Arab component to the Syrian Democratic Forces, there's a fear that a local government will be dependent and subordinate to the Kurdish governance project, which the population of Deir Ezzor will reject," Casagrande tells Newsweek. A Race for Oil With Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies steadily gaining in Deir Ezzor city, however, the U.S. and its Kurdish allies may have already abandoned efforts to take the regional capital. In fact, their southwestern advance against ISIS appears to indicate another target altogether, Syria's main oil fields located in rural Deir Ezzor. Syrian military affairs analyst Wael al-Hussaini says both the U.S. and Russia are vying for control over these lucrative oil and gas fields and that, although he believed U.S.-backed Kurds would succeed in securing a number of these strategic sites, they would ultimately be willing to return them to Assad as part of post-war agreement, potentially in return for greater autonomy in the north. Hussaini says that, after a Kurdish independence referendum drew condemnation from nearly every regional actor and was even rejected by the U.S., Syrian Kurds would try to avoid pushing for full statehood. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said last month that Damascus may be willing to negotiate "some sort of self-management" for Kurds in the north once ISIS was defeated and the Kurds may see Deir Ezzor's oil fields as bargaining chips in future talks. "If you don't have access to water and your neighbor can shut down its borders and your airspace can be closed also, then you won't be able to establish an independent state. So eventually they will have to talk to the Syrian government," Hussaini tells Newsweek. "Dramatically Outpaced" Reconciliation between the Syrian government and Kurds could provide Trump a defensible exit strategy from the conflict, but it still leaves the door open for Iran's eventual expansion. Only capitalizing on the remaining revolutionary and sectarian fervor of Deir Ezzor's Sunni Muslim tribal confederations ensures support in keeping Iran out, at least until a pro-U.S. autonomous leadership was formed in the city. Revitalizing these tensions, however, could ignite further bloodshed for years to come. Even if the U.S. did try to capitalize on local tensions to recruit tribal fighters, it appears that Assad and his allies have beaten Washington to it. Neil Hauer, lead analyst at the SecDev Group, says the U.S. has been "dramatically outpaced by Iran and the regime in terms of outreach to tribes." He explains that the Syrian government and Iran, having long planned the Deir Ezzor offensive, have already established pro-government networks. "Syrian and Iranian officials have been working hard to establish links with the tribes of Deir Ezzor for nearly a year now, with the knowledge that eventually they would be moving towards this area as clashes with rebels were largely frozen and efforts from all sides focused more on IS territory," Hauer tells Newsweek. "U.S. and Syrian Democratic Forces efforts pale in comparison, especially as the latter is increasingly viewed as a Kurdish nationalist project." "A Game of Great Powers" With the U.S. having essentially lost its foothold in eastern Syria, Iran may still encounter major obstacles to its long-term plans for the region. Aram Nerguizian, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that, as the U.S. concludes its anti-ISIS campaign and Assad reasserts control, observers would be most interested in examining how the strategic relationship between Iran and Russia plays out. The two powers formed an alliance of convenience in response to the conflict, but Russia's willingness to engage amicably with Iran's two greatest foes, Israel and Saudi Arabia, may erode Moscow and Tehran's tolerance of one another. China too, has a stake in the region as part of its greater "One Belt One Road" initiative, meaning post-war Syria will likely continue to be a theater for a number of major international powers. "How will the great powers agree to disagree on spheres of influence?" Nerguizian tells Newsweek. "It's still very much a game of great powers."

"Moreover, I don't rule out any surprises there, the Americans have given up on all restrictions in cooperation with the militants, if any," Klintsevich's press service quoted him as saying.Earlier reports said that the Russian Defense Ministry was forecasting an attempt to derail the peace process in the fourth (southern) de-escalation zone with the participation of the US."Considering such serious manpower reinforcements thanks to US benevolence and the creation of stocks of medicines with food supplies, one does not have to be an expert to forecast an attempt to disrupt the peace agreement now in the southern de-escalation zone as well." Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said earlier on Wednesday.Starting from May, four de-escalation zones have been in the process of being set up in Syria in line with an agreement reached in Astana by representatives of Russia, Iran and Turkey, the guarantors of the Syrian ceasefire. De-escalation zones including the Idlib province, some parts of its neighboring areas in the Latakia, Hama and Aleppo provinces north of the city of Homs, Eastern Ghouta, as well as the Daraa and al-Quneitra provinces in southern Syria. As of May 6, military activities and aircraft flights in the de-escalation zones are banned. The memorandum will remain in effect for six months and can be automatically extended for another six months.

© Activist Post "And we know that this was growing, we were watching, we saw that Daesh was growing in strength, and we thought Assad was threatened"... "(We) thought, however, we could probably manage that Assad might then negotiate. But instead of negotiating he got Putin to support him." In short, the DIA assessment indicates that the "wedge" concept was being given new life by the desire to pressure Assad in the wake of the 2011 insurgency launched against the Syrian state. "Supporting powers" effectively wanted to inject hydraulic fracturing fluid into eastern Syria (radical Salafists) in order to fracture the bridge between Iran and its Arab allies, even at the cost of this "fracking" opening fissures right down inside Iraq to Ramadi. (Intelligence assessments purpose is to provide "a view" - not to describe or prescribe policy. But it is clear that the DIA reports' "warnings" were widely circulated and would have been meshed into the policy consideration.) But this "view" has exactly come about. It is fact. One might conclude then that in the policy debate, the notion of isolating Hezbollah from Iran, and of weakening and pressurizing President Assad, simply trumped the common sense judgement that when you pump highly toxic and dangerous fracturing substances into geological formations, you can never entirely know or control the consequences. And once you go down this road, it is not easy to "walk it back," as it were: the toxicity is already suffused through the rocks. So, when the GCC demanded a "price" for any Iran deal (i.e. massing "fracking" forces close to Aleppo), the pass had been already partially been sold by the U.S. by 2012, when it did not object to what the "supporting powers" wanted . Russia has once again accused the US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria of facilitating the entry of Islamic State terrorists into Syria in order to hinder the advance of the Syrian Army and its allies. On Tuesday Russia's defense ministryin a way designed to put maximum pressure on Syrian and Russian front line defenses in Syria's east. Russian military spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said , "Everyone sees that the U.S.-led coalition is pretending to fight Islamic State, above all in Iraq, but continuing to allegedly fight Islamic State in Syria actively for some reason."The accusation comes a little over two weeks after Russia released aerial images allegedly showing ISIS, the SDF (US-backed "Syrian Democratic Forces"), and US special forces working side-by-side on the battlefield against Syrian and Russian forces in Deir Ezzor, Syria. While the previous charges implied some level of close coordination between US-backed forces and ISIS in the region, the new claims point to coalition air power intentionally facilitating and utilizing ISIS movements to its advantage: "The actions of the Pentagon and the coalition demand an explanation.

As the US State Department's own 2014 Country on Terrorism confirms, the rate of foreign terrorist entry into Syria over the past years has been unprecedented among any conflict in history: "The rate of foreign terrorist fighter travel to Syria - totaling more than 16,000 foreign terrorist fighters from more than 90 countries as of late December - exceeded the rate of foreign terrorist fighters who traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, or Somalia at any point in the last 20 years."Though Russian claims will be dismissed as outlandish by some, the latest accusations against the US are, which early in the war envisioned a Sunni "Islamic State" in Syria's east which could "isolate the Syrian regime" and pressure its regional ally Iran.One of the more shocking admissions of this strategy came in 2016, when then Secretary of State John Kerry was, which met on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly meeting,According to Kerry on the leaked audio ( 25:50 ):If the US coalition is indeed allowing ISIS in Iraq to "escape" into eastern Syria, it constitutes a clear continuation of the Obama era policy of "watching" and "managing" Daesh in order to put pressure on Assad and Iran. Former British spy, diplomat, and current Beirut-based Middle East analyst Alastaire Crooke has called this the "wedge concept" of ISIS origins. In previous commentary on the 2012 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) memo which first outlined the wedge concept, Crooke explained Crooke further explained that this policy path could not be easily walked back once committed to, as the latest developments in Deir Ezzor appear to demonstrate. While US presence in Syria is now ostensibly based on anti-terror and anti-ISIS operations, the following dynamics are still in play Just prior to Russia's latest charges against the US, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also said on Sunday that American forces were actively hindering the fight against ISIS: "The American air force in some areas prevents the Syrian army and its allies from advancing in areas controlled by Islamic State," he said in a televised speech. And added further,According to veteran Middle East journalist Elijah Magnier , who is reporting from the ground, the US is looking the other way while ISIS pours across the Iraq-Syria border:At minimum it should be clear by now to any objective observer that the US is not fundamentally motivated in its race for Deir Ezzor province by defeat of ISIS terrorism, but in truth byWhatever oil fields the SDF can gain control of in the wake of Islamic State's retreat will then used as powerful bargaining leverage in negotiating a post-ISIS Syria. The Kurdish and Arab SDF coalition which is advised by US special forces, for example, recently captured Tabiyeh and al-Isba oil and gas fields northeast of Deir Ezzor city.Though the US endgame is the ultimate million dollar question in all of this, it appears at least for now that this endgame has something to do with thethe best case scenario being permanent US bases under a Syrian Kurdish federated zone with favored access to Syrian oil doled out by Kurdish partners.And it appears that theto effect this outcome.

© Activist Post "And we know that this was growing, we were watching, we saw that Daesh was growing in strength, and we thought Assad was threatened"... "(We) thought, however, we could probably manage that Assad might then negotiate. But instead of negotiating he got Putin to support him." In short, the DIA assessment indicates that the "wedge" concept was being given new life by the desire to pressure Assad in the wake of the 2011 insurgency launched against the Syrian state. "Supporting powers" effectively wanted to inject hydraulic fracturing fluid into eastern Syria (radical Salafists) in order to fracture the bridge between Iran and its Arab allies, even at the cost of this "fracking" opening fissures right down inside Iraq to Ramadi. (Intelligence assessments purpose is to provide "a view" - not to describe or prescribe policy. But it is clear that the DIA reports' "warnings" were widely circulated and would have been meshed into the policy consideration.) But this "view" has exactly come about. It is fact. One might conclude then that in the policy debate, the notion of isolating Hezbollah from Iran, and of weakening and pressurizing President Assad, simply trumped the common sense judgement that when you pump highly toxic and dangerous fracturing substances into geological formations, you can never entirely know or control the consequences. And once you go down this road, it is not easy to "walk it back," as it were: the toxicity is already suffused through the rocks. So, when the GCC demanded a "price" for any Iran deal (i.e. massing "fracking" forces close to Aleppo), the pass had been already partially been sold by the U.S. by 2012, when it did not object to what the "supporting powers" wanted . Russia has once again accused the US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria of facilitating the entry of Islamic State terrorists into Syria in order to hinder the advance of the Syrian Army and its allies. On Tuesday Russia's defense ministryin a way designed to put maximum pressure on Syrian and Russian front line defenses in Syria's east. Russian military spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said , "Everyone sees that the U.S.-led coalition is pretending to fight Islamic State, above all in Iraq, but continuing to allegedly fight Islamic State in Syria actively for some reason."The accusation comes a little over two weeks after Russia released aerial images allegedly showing ISIS, the SDF (US-backed "Syrian Democratic Forces"), and US special forces working side-by-side on the battlefield against Syrian and Russian forces in Deir Ezzor, Syria. While the previous charges implied some level of close coordination between US-backed forces and ISIS in the region, the new claims point to coalition air power intentionally facilitating and utilizing ISIS movements to its advantage: "The actions of the Pentagon and the coalition demand an explanation. Is their change of tack a desire to complicate as much as they can the Syrian army's operation, backed by the Russian air force, to take back Syrian territory to the east of the Euphrates?" asked Konashenkov.

News article:
In Syria, hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost, millions of people remain displaced and countless souls are physically and psychologically scarred. Throngs of children are without families or homes, entire villages and farming communities no longer exist, and cities are in ruins. Fallout from the seismic Syrian civil war and upheaval besets the Middle East. Aggressor regimes and extremist groups have capitalized upon the chaos and despair. It will be very difficult at this late juncture to get America’s Syria policy right, but the moral and strategic stakes are too high to keep getting it wrong. Instead of slouching toward a fatally flawed paradigm, the Trump administration should conduct an urgent policy review, such as it did for North Korea and Iran. U.S. efforts in Syria are hampered by a narrow focus on defeating ISIS and corollary downplaying of the threat posed by the bloodthirsty Syrian regime and its allies; inadequate attention to atrocities and the plight of civilians; and failure to tackle the complexities and prepare for the future. Obama administration officials were mostly idle and mute as the civil war and the tragic human toll escalated out of control. They did little or nothing in response to the Bashar Assad regime’s slaughter, disappearances, systematized torture, starvation sieges, and use of barrel bombs, heavy artillery and chemical weapons on civilians. Even worse, the Obama administration deferred to Russian “peace plans” while resisting calls for strong sanctions on Syria, a humanitarian corridor and serious assistance for vetted pro-democracy rebels. This had the effect of buying the brutal President Assad time – often when time was running out for him. Worse still, the Obama administration continued to defer to Russia and to suggest a “constructive role” for Iran, even after Iranian militias and Russian air forces entered the war on Assad’s side. The vacuum created by U.S. and United Nations neglect allowed Iran and Russia – along with extremist groups from the al Quds unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, to al Nusra, to Hezbollah, to ISIS – to seize the day. As ISIS metastasized, the Assad regime and Russia shrewdly positioned themselves as the best alternative to Islamist terror, even though they left ISIS mostly alone while brutally assaulting non-ISIS rebels and civilians. By the time of President Trump’s inauguration, the wishful thinking of the Obama administration – that Russia could be a “partner” in fighting ISIS, that Iran could play a “constructive role” in Syria and Iraq, and that the Syrian people could “coexist” with a regime that caused so much horror and pain – were obvious delusions. Iran had already doubled down on its violent and destabilizing activities. Russia had worked against American interests and assisted Assad at every turn. The new Trump foreign policy and national security team at first seemed to chart a better course. It imposed significant new sanctions. It responded with limited military actions when pro-Assad forces used chemical weapons and threatened the American-led coalition. With clarity that departed from Obama administration relativism, the Trump administration emphasized that “there can be no peace, stability or justice as long as Assad remains in power” and that Russia and Iran “support his killing his own people.” But Russia again seized the day when it orchestrated the first Astana Conference, where it pushed a proposal for "de-confliction zones" to be enforced by Russia, Iran and Turkey. While skeptical about Russian intentions, the Trump administration didn’t provide alternatives. The Syrian opposition knew where this would lead. “Ceasefires” sponsored by the Obama administration and Russia had allowed Assad to consolidate military gains and regroup. After a convenient lull in the action, regime forces had attacked opposition forces that stood down, along with defenseless civilians. One need only look at "de-confliction zones” in Idlib and elsewhere to know that Astana conferences serve similar purposes. Assad has locked down victories in the west and turned to the north and east. Civilian casualties have soared as pro-government forces have launched bombing raids in areas designated for protection. Having mostly defeated the “Arab awakening” opposition, pro-Assad forces targeted ISIS, but with the goal of beating other powers to the punch in taking ISIS-held territory. Now that ISIS is on the run and Syrian Kurds and the U.S. coalition have driven ISIS out of Raqqa, we are likely to see Syrian regime forces turn on the Kurds, as Iran-embedded Iraqi forces did in Kirkuk. Populations fleeing ISIS in Syria and Iraq face serious abuses of Iranian and other militias. As the Hudson Institute’s Michael Pregent points out: “Iran has sold itself as a responsible actor in Iraq” and many Americans still downplay Iran’s significant and deleterious role in the Iraqi security forces, intelligence apparatus and ministries. Ultimately, Iran wants a contiguous land corridor from Tehran to Baghdad to Damascus to Beirut. Russia wants to capitalize on its success in saving Assad and its now major presence in the Middle East. Turkey’s and Jordan’s increasing cooperation with Russia are testimony to Russian boldness and leverage. Given all of this, the U.S. and U.N. need their own bold initiatives and assertion of leverage. Instead, there has been an increasing inclination to accept Assad as inevitable, and to view Russia and Iran as troublesome but necessary partners in the war against ISIS. Although President Trump is improving relations with Sunni states that can counter Iran, and just announced strong penalties on the Iranian Guard Corps, sound strategy for Syria is desperately needed. Accepting the status quo in Syria is a bad idea and will only make things worse, for nothing is stable in that land of suffering. Assad will find new ways to oppress, terrorize and murder opponents and civilians. Exhausted Sunni moderates, who we need on our side if we’re to defeat Sunni-Islamist terrorists, might once and for all lose faith in the “free world." In addition, Iranian Shiite proxies will gain new strongholds and moderate Shiites will be pressed to join them. Although diminished, disparate anti-regime forces will continue to fight. Let us not delude ourselves into believing that as long as we defeat ISIS we can find some kind of equilibrium. Early priorities of a new U.S. policy toward Syria should be: trying Assad for war crimes; deterring Russia and Iran; paying more attention to civilian suffering and casualties; forming safe zones; and pressing wealthy Gulf States to help refugees. It is far past time to consider the big picture and the long game.

Instead of slouching toward a fatally flawed paradigm, the Trump administration should conduct an urgent policy review, such as it did for North Korea and Iran. U.S. efforts in Syria are hampered by a narrow focus on defeating ISIS and corollary downplaying of the threat posed by the bloodthirsty Syrian regime and its allies; inadequate attention to atrocities and the plight of civilians; and failure to tackle the complexities and prepare for the future. Obama administration officials were mostly idle and mute as the civil war and the tragic human toll escalated out of control. They did little or nothing in response to the Bashar Assad regime’s slaughter, disappearances, systematized torture, starvation sieges, and use of barrel bombs, heavy artillery and chemical weapons on civilians. Even worse, the Obama administration deferred to Russian “peace plans” while resisting calls for strong sanctions on Syria, a humanitarian corridor and serious assistance for vetted pro-democracy rebels. This had the effect of buying the brutal President Assad time – often when time was running out for him. Worse still, the Obama administration continued to defer to Russia and to suggest a “constructive role” for Iran, even after Iranian militias and Russian air forces entered the war on Assad’s side. The vacuum created by U.S. and United Nations neglect allowed Iran and Russia – along with extremist groups from the al Quds unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, to al Nusra, to Hezbollah, to ISIS – to seize the day. As ISIS metastasized, the Assad regime and Russia shrewdly positioned themselves as the best alternative to Islamist terror, even though they left ISIS mostly alone while brutally assaulting non-ISIS rebels and civilians. By the time of President Trump’s inauguration, the wishful thinking of the Obama administration – that Russia could be a “partner” in fighting ISIS, that Iran could play a “constructive role” in Syria and Iraq, and that the Syrian people could “coexist” with a regime that caused so much horror and pain – were obvious delusions. Iran had already doubled down on its violent and destabilizing activities. Russia had worked against American interests and assisted Assad at every turn. The new Trump foreign policy and national security team at first seemed to chart a better course. It imposed significant new sanctions. It responded with limited military actions when pro-Assad forces used chemical weapons and threatened the American-led coalition. With clarity that departed from Obama administration relativism, the Trump administration emphasized that “there can be no peace, stability or justice as long as Assad remains in power” and that Russia and Iran “support his killing his own people.” But Russia again seized the day when it orchestrated the first Astana Conference, where it pushed a proposal for "de-confliction zones" to be enforced by Russia, Iran and Turkey. While skeptical about Russian intentions, the Trump administration didn’t provide alternatives. The Syrian opposition knew where this would lead. “Ceasefires” sponsored by the Obama administration and Russia had allowed Assad to consolidate military gains and regroup. After a convenient lull in the action, regime forces had attacked opposition forces that stood down, along with defenseless civilians. One need only look at "de-confliction zones” in Idlib and elsewhere to know that Astana conferences serve similar purposes. Assad has locked down victories in the west and turned to the north and east. Civilian casualties have soared as pro-government forces have launched bombing raids in areas designated for protection. Having mostly defeated the “Arab awakening” opposition, pro-Assad forces targeted ISIS, but with the goal of beating other powers to the punch in taking ISIS-held territory. Now that ISIS is on the run and Syrian Kurds and the U.S. coalition have driven ISIS out of Raqqa, we are likely to see Syrian regime forces turn on the Kurds, as Iran-embedded Iraqi forces did in Kirkuk. Populations fleeing ISIS in Syria and Iraq face serious abuses of Iranian and other militias. As the Hudson Institute’s Michael Pregent points out: “Iran has sold itself as a responsible actor in Iraq” and many Americans still downplay Iran’s significant and deleterious role in the Iraqi security forces, intelligence apparatus and ministries. Ultimately, Iran wants a contiguous land corridor from Tehran to Baghdad to Damascus to Beirut. Russia wants to capitalize on its success in saving Assad and its now major presence in the Middle East. Turkey’s and Jordan’s increasing cooperation with Russia are testimony to Russian boldness and leverage. Given all of this, the U.S. and U.N. need their own bold initiatives and assertion of leverage. Instead, there has been an increasing inclination to accept Assad as inevitable, and to view Russia and Iran as troublesome but necessary partners in the war against ISIS. Although President Trump is improving relations with Sunni states that can counter Iran, and just announced strong penalties on the Iranian Guard Corps, sound strategy for Syria is desperately needed. Accepting the status quo in Syria is a bad idea and will only make things worse, for nothing is stable in that land of suffering. Assad will find new ways to oppress, terrorize and murder opponents and civilians. Exhausted Sunni moderates, who we need on our side if we’re to defeat Sunni-Islamist terrorists, might once and for all lose faith in the “free world." In addition, Iranian Shiite proxies will gain new strongholds and moderate Shiites will be pressed to join them. Although diminished, disparate anti-regime forces will continue to fight. Let us not delude ourselves into believing that as long as we defeat ISIS we can find some kind of equilibrium. Early priorities of a new U.S. policy toward Syria should be: trying Assad for war crimes; deterring Russia and Iran; paying more attention to civilian suffering and casualties; forming safe zones; and pressing wealthy Gulf States to help refugees. It is far past time to consider the big picture and the long game.

An emerging deal between Iran and world powers won't prevent the Islamic republic from reaching nuclear weapon capacity, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, noting Arab states shared his concern. "I know I’m often portrayed as the nuclear party pooper, and that would be okay if I was the only voice against the impending deal with Iran," he said at a security conference at Herzliya near Tel Aviv. "But I speak with quite a few with our neighbors, more than you think. And I want to tell you that nobody in this region believes this deal will block Iran's path to the bomb.” Netanyahu's remarks came as a June 30 deadline looms for a deal that would row back Iran's nuclear program in return for relief from sanctions, which Israel has long opposed, causing friction with the White House. In a possible move to allay concerns, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey on Tuesday held meetings with his Israeli counterpart as well as Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, who praised the close coordination between the allies. "Israel and the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) have no greater friend on the face of the earth than the U.S. military," Dempsey told Israeli military chief of staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot. Dempsey's visit, his last to Israel as the top U.S. military officer, came as a report emerged that CIA chief John Brennan made a "secret" visit to Israel last week to discuss the Iran deal According to a report in Israel's Haaretz newspaper, Brennan met his counterpart Mossad chief Tamir Pardo and other intelligence officials, as well as Netanyahu. They discussed the emerging Iran deal and Tehran's "subversive" activities around the Middle East, Haaretz said. Netanyahu's staunch opposition to any agreement with Iran has helped bring his relations with U.S. President Barack Obama to an all-time low. In March, the Israeli premier controversially took his campaign to the U.S. Congress, calling on lawmakers to block any deal between the powers and the Jewish state's arch-foe.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused world powers on Sunday of stepping up concessions to Iran to enable a deal by June 30 on curbing its nuclear program even as Tehran balks at demands for heightened UN inspections. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Netanyahu has argued that the agreement in the works would not deny Iran, which says its nuclear projects are peaceful, the means of making a bomb, while granting it sanctions relief that could help bankroll its guerrilla allies in the region. "To our regret, the reports that are coming in from the world powers attest to an acceleration of concessions by them in the face of Iranian stubbornness," Netanyahu told his cabinet in broadcast remarks on Sunday. He did not offer further details. Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz and PM Benjamin Netanyahu (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) Netanyahu's point-man on the Iranian talks, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, said it appeared that world powers were prepared to accommodate Tehran's resistance to expanded, short-order UN nuclear inspections and demand to continue research and development of uranium centrifuges that make nuclear fuel. On Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country, in the name of protecting state secrets, could reject stepped-up inspections, even at the cost of missing the June 30 deadline. Western diplomats had sought the right to carry out inspections with as little as two hours' notice. But in a televised address on Sunday, Rouhani played up the benefits of easing Iran's international isolation and pledged to reach a deal that would end the hardship of sanctions. President of Iran Hassan Rouhani (Photo: AP) Steinitz, who was in Washington last week to discuss the Iran diplomacy, said the world powers - the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany - were considering a stop-gap whereby inspections would be decided on "by committee". "Such an arrangement might offer reassurance on paper, but in reality it would give Iran time to cover up illegal nuclear activity or even relocate it off-site," Steinitz told Reuters. He added that Israel saw no reason for world powers to allow Iran to continue research and development on uranium centrifuges "if this deal is indeed meant to freeze its program for years". On a visit to Israel last week, America's top general sought to reassure Israel, widely assumed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, of "unshakable" US military support. General Martin Dempsey said long-term prospects were "far better" with an Iran that was not a nuclear weapons power and that Washington would work to mitigate Iran-related risks, with or without a deal. Netanyahu urged world powers to hold off on a final accord. "From the outset, the agreement being put together looked bad. It looks worse and worse with each passing day," he said in his cabinet remarks. Asked to rate the chances of world powers deferring the deadline to renegotiate the deal, Steinitz said: "Fifty-fifty." The United States has said it stands by the end-June deadline for an agreement but other officials have indicated the date might be missed as negotiations about technical details drag on.

Israel accuses world powers of yielding to Iran for nuclear deal By Dan Williams JERUSALEM, June 14 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused world powers on Sunday of stepping up concessions to Iran to enable a deal by June 30 on curbing its nuclear programme even as Tehran balks at demands for heightened U.N. inspections.

News article:
Netanyahu Warns of 'Accelerating Concessions' with Iran by VOA News June 14, 2015 World powers attempting to broker a nuclear deal are 'accelerating concessions' with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. Facing a self-imposed deadline at the end of June, the six countries negotiating with Tehran have two weeks to finalize details on how Iran's civil nuclear program will be allowed to move forward. The Israeli leader has staunchly opposed the talks in Geneva, spearheaded by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. 'To our regret, the reports that are coming in from the world powers attest to an acceleration of concessions by them in the face of Iranian stubbornness,' Netanyahu said. 'From the outset, the agreement being put together looked bad. It looks worse and worse with each passing day. It's not too late to come to their senses, postpone this bad deal and insist on a better deal.' Iran's stance Netanyahu's statement comes a day after Iran's president says a final nuclear agreement is 'within reach' this month, provided that no new issues arise in the days ahead. Speaking to reporters in Tehran Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani said the long-running talks are making progress as the June 30 deadline for a complete agreement approaches, but some issues still remain. 'Our negotiators are seriously moving on this path [of negotiations], the Iranian president said, 'and if the other side also observes this framework and respects the rights of the Iranian nation and our national interests, and does not seek excessive demands, I think a deal is within reach.' Referring to a key issue that the United States and its European allies have emphasized - inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities - Rouhani said Iran will not allow inspections that would jeopardize its state secrets. ​​'Iran will absolutely not allow its state secrets to fall into the hands of foreigners,' President Rouhani said, under terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [and its so-called 'Additional Protocol'] or any other treaty. 'This is definite,' he added, 'and we will never let it happen.' The world powers who have been seeking an agreement about Iran's nuclear development program are the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. In exchange for limiting its future nuclear development, Iran would expect the lifting of international sanctions that have curtailed its economy. American and French diplomats have called for Iran to accept stringent measures, including inspection of its military facilities as well as nuclear inspections that could be set in motion with as little as two hours' notice.

Netanyahu Warns of 'Accelerating Concessions' with Iran by VOA News June 14, 2015 World powers attempting to broker a nuclear deal are 'accelerating concessions' with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. Facing a self-imposed deadline at the end of June, the six countries negotiating with Tehran have two weeks to finalize details on how Iran's civil nuclear program will be allowed to move forward. The Israeli leader has staunchly opposed the talks in Geneva, spearheaded by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. 'To our regret, the reports that are coming in from the world powers attest to an acceleration of concessions by them in the face of Iranian stubbornness,' Netanyahu said. 'From the outset, the agreement being put together looked bad. It looks worse and worse with each passing day. It's not too late to come to their senses, postpone this bad deal and insist on a better deal.' Iran's stance Netanyahu's statement comes a day after Iran's president says a final nuclear agreement is 'within reach' this month, provided that no new issues arise in the days ahead.

News article:
The June deadline may slip but it appears that President Obama will sign an agreement with Iran that Israel views as calamitous. Israel has repeatedly said that Iran poses an existential threat to the country and pro-Israel organizations have responded by calling for stricter sanctions and opposing the concessions the United States has reportedly made to placate the Iranians. The question now is whether American Jewry has the will and the capacity to mobilize sufficient opposition to prevent Israel from being endangered. For too long, the pro-Israel community, and many Israelis, have speciously believed that Congress can protect Israel from the sometimes ill-advised policies of the Executive Branch. This has never been true. Congress didn’t prevent Eisenhower from pressuring Israel to withdraw from Sinai after the 1956 War, failed to stop Reagan from selling AWACS to Saudi Arabia, was unable to fight George W. Bush’s linkage of loan guarantees and settlements and has been helpless to alter Obama’s hostile treatment of the Netanyahu government. Congress is now powerless to stop Obama from appeasing Iran. It is true that Congressional pressure did lead Obama to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, but the sanctions gambit has been a failure. Countries, including the United States, have cheated, and it was never realistic to expect Iran to give up the chance to become a nuclear power because of some temporary economic hardships. In fact, Iran has not given up its pursuit of the bomb while simultaneously advancing its regional hegemonic interests and intensifying its sponsorship of terrorism. Obama has stubbornly resisted calls to intervene in Iraq and Syria as those two countries implode, and made withdrawal of troops from the region a centerpiece of his policy, so the chance of him using force to stop Iran’s nuclear program is virtually zero. This is the most serious weakness in his bargaining position; the Iranians have no fear of Obama, see he is an amateur in the ways of the bizarre and believe they can get sanctions lifted without any serious concessions. If press reports are accurate, the proposed agreement will allow Iran to remain on the threshold of building nuclear weapons, to continue its advanced missile research, to continue uranium enrichment, to prevent inspections of military sites, to refuse to disclose information about its past nuclear activities and to continue to promote terrorism and the destabilization of the region. Such an agreement will have the opposite effect of the one intended: Once sanctions are lifted — and the idea they can be “snapped back” into place if Iran violates the agreement is laughable — Iran will have a windfall of tens of billions of dollars to spend on its nuclear program, on strengthening its army, on subverting its neighbors and on fostering global terrorism. This is in addition to provoking a nuclear arms race in the region that will further imperil Israel and the West. The legislation passed by Congress to allow it to review any agreement the president signed is toothless; Obama can ignore it and will if need be. Moreover, no matter how bad the deal is, it is unlikely Congress will try to stop its implementation. Even some of Israel’s closest friends have indicated they will not challenge the president. Opponents of the Iran framework have been unable to counter Obama’s false dichotomy of an agreement or war. The military option may be the best alternative; however, the pro-Israel community will not make that case out of fear that it will make Jews look like they are pushing the United States into a catastrophic conflict (a point Obama and others will undoubtedly make) and provoke an anti-Semitic backlash. Such a position would also alienate Israel’s traditional liberal allies. This leaves the pro-Israel community with only one good alternative and that is to adopt Prime Minister Netanyahu’s position that the alternative to a bad agreement is a good one. The question is: Who will challenge the president when he argues the deal he signs is the best we can get? The only hope of preventing a bad agreement is for the leaders of the pro-Israel community to mobilize the public the way they did in the heyday of the Soviet Jewry movement. It will not be easy, especially with leftist Jewish groups backing Obama against the government and the people of Israel. Still, after years of hearing people say that things would have been different in the 1940s if the lobby was as strong then as it is today, there can be no excuse for the failure to use all of our resources to prevent Israel from being placed at risk. Dr. Mitchell Bard is the author/editor of 24 books including The Arab Lobby, Death to the Infidels: Radical Islam’s War Against the Jews and the novel After Anatevka: Tevye in Palestine.

Skip to comments. US rebuffs Israel’s last-ditch bid for nuclear constraints in Iran accord DEBKAfile ^ | June 21, 2015, 7:52 PM (IDT) Posted on by Dave346 Israels National Security Adviser Yossi Cohen was invited to join two top US officials for dinner in Washington on June 15 to try and make Israels case for amending the disastrous nuclear accord taking shape in Vienna between the six world powers and Iran, before it was too late. This meeting is reported here by debkafile for the first time. It was hosted by US National Security Adviser Susan Rice and senior US nuclear negotiator Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman. The occasion was arranged by CIA Director John Brennan at the end of his visit to Jerusalem in the first week of June. He had come to offer senior Israelis, led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, a behind-the-scenes briefing on the provisions the Obama administration had accepted for the final nuclear accord with Iran due to be signed by June 30. This briefing was greeted in Jerusalem with shock and alarm. Very few of the conditions for a deal stipulated by the US upon embarking on the negotiations had survived: Iran would continue to enrich uranium, be allowed to bar international inspections of military facilities suspected of hosting nuclear research activity (where were Obama's "intrusive inspections?) and - Israeli officials heard this for the first time - the Iranian UCF facility at Isfahan would be expanded. This plant is engaged in the conversion of yellow cake to enriched nuclear material. They also discovered that President Obama, who had originally promised the deal would provide for snapping sanctions back in the event of violations, had assured Tehran that once sanctions were lifted, they would not be re-imposed. Netanyahu asked Brennan for time to digest the full extent of the Obama administrations retreat in the face of Irans nuclear aspirations. He then asked for his national security adviser to be given a chance to propose changes that would allay some of Israels concerns. Brennan quickly set up a date for Cohen to be received in Washington. debkafiles Washington sources reveal that at the dinner in Washington, the Israeli official tried a new tack with his hostesses, Rice and Sherman. On the understanding that the main clauses of the nuclear accord had been finalized and gone past the stage of amendment, he nonetheless suggested a number of insertions in the various clauses that would make it a better deal for American as well as Israeli security. Rice and Sherman politely allowed him to finish talking and then turned his proposals down flat. US and Israeli official sources agree that the invitation to Cohen had not been intended for any serious discussion between the two governments on the Iranian nuclear issue. The two top American officials dealing with the nuclear question barely heard a word that Cohen said. His journey to Washington was a complete waste of time.

News article:
Israel wants Iranian recognition before it ratifies an international ban on nuclear bomb tests, an Israeli official said on Wednesday, in a rare public discussion of terms for upgrading from signatory status, Reuters reported. Negotiated in the 1990s, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) enjoys wide global support but must be ratified by eight more nuclear technology states -- among them Israel, Iran, Egypt and the United States -- to come into force. Signing the CTBT -- while stopping short of ratifying it -- has allowed Israel to engage in anti-proliferation monitoring and exercises, some involving delegates from enemy states, even as it resists foreign pressure to open up on its suspected nuclear arsenal. "The CTBT is a treaty that Israel intends to ratify. It will do when the time is ripe, when certain considerations are met," Merav Zafary-Odiz, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency in Vienna, told Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies in a speech.

How can any country be expected to join an arms control arrangement with a country that doesn't even recognize its right to exist?" Iranian ideological hostility to Israel is among factors spurring world powers to curb Tehran's disputed nuclear program. Negotiators are working toward a June 30 deadline for a deal under which Iran would roll back projects with bomb-making potential in exchange for sanctions relief. Lassina Zerbo, executive secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), said in April that Iran could shore up its credibility by ratifying the treaty. But, he told Reuters, "their approach is that diplomacy is always one step at a time".

Israel wants Iranian recognition before it ratifies an international ban on nuclear bomb tests, an Israeli official said on Wednesday, in a rare public discussion of terms for upgrading from signatory status, Reuters reported. Negotiated in the 1990s, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) enjoys wide global support but must be ratified by eight more nuclear technology states -- among them Israel, Iran, Egypt and the United States -- to come into force.

News article:
TEL AVIV (JTA) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that concessions to Iran are increasing as it approaches the deadline for its nuclear talks with world powers. Netanyahu referred to the June 30 deadline addressing the 163rd Pilots Course Graduation Ceremony on Thursday at the Hatzerim Israel Air Force base in Israel’s south. “The foremost threat that endangers our security is Iran’s effort to arm itself with nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu said. “Concessions to Iran are increasing as we approach the date that has been determined between the major powers and Iran for achieving the goals. These concessions are whetting Iran’s appetite.” Whatever happens, Netanyahu said, “Israel will always defend itself and in this the air force will play a major part.” Talks between six world powers — the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany – and Iran entered the homestretch ahead of the Tuesday deadline as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry led a 19-person team to Vienna to try to bridge significant gaps remaining on the deal. His French and Iranian counterparts, Laurent Fabius and Mohammad Javad Zarif respectively, were also expected to travel to the Austrian capital for talks. On Friday, the AFP news agency reported that an unnamed U.S. official had said that talks may continue past the June 30 deadline. U.S. President Barack Obama said in April that the interim framework agreement achieved then is “a good deal” that “meets our core objectives, including strict limitations on Iran’s program and cutting off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.” Netanyahu and other critics of the deal – which would gradually lift sanctions on Iran — say elements of the emerging deal that would allow Iran to continue a degree of uranium enrichment woul allow it to creep toward nuclear offensive capabilities. Iran has denied that it is seeking such arms. In a speech Tuesday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected a long-term freeze on nuclear research and insisted that Iran will only sign a deal if international sanctions are lifted first. “Every day [Iran] raises its demands in order to extort even more concessions,” Netanyahu said in Thursday’s speech. “This agreement is fundamentally flawed. It leaves Iran with a path to achieve an arsenal of nuclear bombs within a decade.”

With some two days to the deadline for the nuclear negotiations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it’s not too late for the West to make additional demands. The prime minister, speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, refers to the recent State Department report condemning Iran’s human rights record and says the West is “turning a blind eye” to Tehran’s actions. “In practice, there is no demand that Iran change its behavior and there is a total disregard for its violations, its radical demands, and the concessions to Iran are growing,” he says. “We see before our very eyes that the world powers are retreating from the red lines they set for themselves recently and publicly. There is no reason to rush to sign this bad deal, which becomes worse every day. It’s not too late to go back and make demands that will really prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and will prevent it from receiving funds that will sponsor its aggression, its expansion, and the terror attacks that it carries out all over the world.” Netanyahu condemns the weekend terror attacks in Tunisia, France, and Kuwait, adding that the attacks are minor compared to the day-to-day activities of an Iran-backed Syria. “While the world is dismayed, and rightly so, by the terror attacks that were carried out last weekend by radical Islam, at the same time, in three countries and three continents, one must remember that Iran assists the Assad regime to carry out a slaughter similar to [the weekend attacks] daily,” he says.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted Tuesday that the deal being negotiated between world powers and Iran would allow it to develop nuclear weapons, hours before a deadline to reach an accord expired. Netanyahu has consistently condemned the proposed deal with Iran and has not ruled out the use of military force to keep it from acquiring atomic weapons. Iran denies its nuclear program is aimed at achieving military abilities. "We believe that it is a fundamental mistake to enable such a terrorist regime to get to nuclear weapons, which is what the proposed agreement will give them," the prime minister said ahead of a meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni. "It will give them a definite pathway to nuclear bombs -– not a bomb, but nuclear bombs." Netanyahu added that the lifting of sanctions against Iran would allow it to "replenish their coffers with many billions -- actually perhaps up to hundreds of billions of dollars -- to enable them to continue their terrorism and aggression." "This is something that is wrong," he said. "It is dangerous. It is dangerous for Israel, for Italy, for Europe, for the United States, for the world." The deadline of midnight (2200 GMT) for an accord ending a dangerous 13-year standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions was widely expected to be extended, but only for a few more days. Iran has been negotiating with the so-called P5+1 powers -- the United States, Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany. A Russian-based security firm has said a computer worm widely linked to Israel has been used to spy on the negotiations. Swiss and Austrian investigators have launched probes into alleged spying in hotels hosting the delicate nuclear talks, with Israel denying its secret services were involved. Israel is believed to be the only country in its region with atomic bombs, although it has never confirmed its nuclear military capacity.

Why would anyone consider giving the Islamic State of Iran, which is a lot more powerful than ISIS and acts with much greater power than ISIS to have additional power of nuclear weapons?” Advertisement The deadline of midnight for an accord ending a 13-year standoff over Iran’s nuclear ambitions was widely expected to be extended, but only for a few more days.

WASHINGTON -- Iran is like the Islamic State, only bigger and more powerful, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “No one would dream of allowing the Islamic State of ISIS to have nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu said Tuesday, using another name for the militant organization. “Why would anyone consider giving the Islamic State of Iran, which is a lot more powerful than ISIS and acts with much greater power than ISIS, to have additional power of nuclear weapons?” Advertisement Shortly after Netanyahu’s remarks, a Twitter account associated with the prime minister shared a cartoon video imagining how dangerous the Islamic State would be if it were building atomic bombs. “Well, maybe it’s not that hard to imagine,” the video’s narrator says. “The Islamic State of Iran. Like ISIS, just much bigger.” WATCH AND RETWEET: The Islamic State of Iran - like ISIS. Just much bigger.https://t.co/1b3YCsEyxy — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) June 30, 2015 Netanyahu’s comments come as Iran, the U.S. and five other nations are in the final stages of hammering out a nuclear agreement under which Iran would significantly curtail its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Negotiators extended their self-imposed deadline of Tuesday another week, until July 7. If they fail to reach an agreement by July 9, the time that the U.S. Congress has allotted itself to review the deal will double from 30 days to 60 days, further delaying implementation of the deal. Netanyahu argues that any sanctions relief provided to Iran as part of a nuclear agreement will lead to Iran’s further support of Syrian President Bashar Assad and terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. The Israeli prime minister has repeatedly invoked the Islamic State comparison in his efforts to persuade President Barack Obama to walk away from the nuclear talks, ramp up sanctions and demand further concessions from Iran. Advertisement “To defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war,” Netanyahu warned in his address last September to the United Nations General Assembly. This past March, one month before a critical benchmark in the nuclear talks, Netanyahu traveled to Washington to speak to Congress in a similar vein. "Iran and [the Islamic State] are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State," he told lawmakers during his highly controversial speech. "Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterates that the nuclear deal with Iran will pave the road to “many” nuclear bombs by the “terror regime” in Tehran. Speaking at the beginning of a meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Netanyahu says the agreement will enrich Iran by hundreds of billions of dollars and will enable the Islamic Republic to continue funding terrorism throughout the world. The world is justifiably concerned about Islamic State, Netanyahu says, but allows Iran, which is much stronger and a much greater sponsor of global terrorism, to acquire nuclear weapons.

News article:
Israel's former ambassador to Washington, Michael Oren, is on a crusade to discredit President Obama and derail a possible nuclear deal with Iran -- and his new memoir contains interesting information about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's real thoughts on how to stop the Iranians getting a nuclear weapon. In TV interviews and Op-eds to publicize his book (Ally: My Journey Across the American-Israeli Divide), Oren has argued that the main problem in U.S.-Israeli relations since President Obama took office has been a lack of trust -- and he puts the blame almost exclusively on Obama. In an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN on Sunday, he said: The President is coming to the people of Israel and saying 'trust me.' So we have to address the question of whether that trust has been built up over the course of the last five plus years of the Obama administration. And having lived through that period, I have to say emphatically 'no'. But trust is a two-way street and Oren's book has some disturbing information that should color how we should understand Netanyahu's real intentions In his book, Oren indicates that both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who was in office until 2012, wanted President Obama to launch a military strike against Iran. Oren summarizes Netanyahu's view in these words: Netanyahu held that the military action would discredit the ayatollahs, much as the Entebbe raid had helped bring down Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. The president (Obama) reasoned that air strikes could not destroy Iran's nuclear knowledge, while the prime minister countered that without centrifuges, that know-how was useless - 'a pilot without a plane can't fly,' he said. (In 1976, Israeli commandos mounted a raid to free hostages from a hijacked Air France plane being held in Entebbe, Uganda. Netanyahu's brother Yonatan was killed in the raid. The Ugandan leader Idi Amin was overthrown by Tanzanian troops three years later after he launched an invasion of neighboring Tanzania.) Advertisement Oren says Barak advocated a military strike to US officials more than once with the argument that "one night of strategic bombing will restore your lost prestige in the Middle East. The Iranian nightmare is a full-blown American attack," he quotes Barak as saying and adds, "But the response Barak received was silence." Netanyahu told the American people when he addressed a joint session of Congress in March that he did not favor military action against Iran -- but merely a better deal. "We're being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That's just not true. The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal," Netanyahu said. Now Oren tells us that Netanyahu and Barak actually wanted U.S. military action against Iran. That ought to have an important bearing on the political struggle that is about to unfold if the United States and its five international partners strike a deal with Iran by the newly-extended deadline of July 7. Supporters of the deal will argue that congressional action to derail the agreement by preventing President Obama from implementing it will lead inevitably to collapse of the international sanctions regime against Iran. The United States, and not Iran, will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy and be put back in a position where the only way to delay Iran's progress toward a bomb -- not to destroy, but merely delay for a few years -- would be military action. Advertisement Opponents of the deal, led by Netanyahu and Republican lawmakers, say a better deal was there to be had and could still be achieved if the United States and its partners would only take a tougher stance with the Iranians. They deny that their intention is to create a situation where the United States is forced to take military action. That's where the Oren quotes of Netanyahu and Barak are so important because they give us insight into the actual thinking of these Israeli leaders. We learned in Iraq that the consequences of military action in the Middle East are impossible to predict. The consequences of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion are still playing out in a region that has been totally destabilized, partly as a result of that war. One thing is certain: hundreds of thousands of people have died and millions have been uprooted by that invasion.

News article:
The prospective nuclear deal with Iran would empower it to take over the Middle East and trigger a regional nuclear arms race, a senior Israeli official warned in an interview published Friday. Ram Ben Barak, director general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry and a leading candidate to be the next head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, told the Makor Rishon newspaper that “the deal which is about to be signed will allow Iran to decide by itself when it will be nuclear [armed], and that is the most problematic.” He said the lifting of sanctions would give Tehran “an ocean of money,” allowing it to buy influence across the Middle East and “advance to a position where no one will be able to threaten it and it will acquire control wherever it pleases.” Ben Barak noted that there is “almost no area in the Middle East today where Iran remains uninvolved: Iraq, where Iranian interests are in line with US interests, Lebanon, where Hezbollah is effectively an Iranian division, and Yemen, which was mostly conquered by Iran.” “Think what happens if in coming years Iran will receive billions of dollars. They will have no limitations,” he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Ben Barak is one of three candidates vying for the coveted position of Mossad chief, contending with current National Security Council chair Yossi Cohen and an unnamed deputy to current Mossad chief Tamir Pardo. Pardo is slated to step down in January 2016. Ben Barak has only been directing the Strategic Affairs Ministry since December 2014. He began working with the Mossad in 1991 and rose through the ranks before taking on his current post. As director general of the ministry, Ben Barak defined his role as “being the eyes and ears of the prime minister.” Advertisement The Iran dossier, he said, “is one of the most important things we deal with. The Iranian issue has great influence, beyond the fact that a nuclear Iran is not something, in Israel’s view, which can be tolerated.” Like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ben Barak believes that “if the Americans would insist and press more, a much better agreement could be achieved. There is no doubt a good deal is preferable to war. Everyone understands this, from the prime minister to the last citizen on the street. But a bad deal can have really serious implications.” Ben Barak said he shared the view that countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia were almost certain to enter a nuclear arms race to counterbalance Iran’s nuclear aspirations. “Almost certainly, this process will occur. The Saudis and Gulf states are concerned by an Iranian takeover of the region no less than we are. There are, at the end of the day, many natural resources there, and we have already seen in the past an Iraqi attempt to take over Kuwait because of its oil reserves,” he said, referring to the First Gulf War. The Iranian nuclear race, he said, is compounded by the grander Sunni-Shiite war in the Middle East. “Money is not lacking in the Gulf States, they can buy anything. As soon as they see the Iranians enter a corridor which ends with nuclear capability, they will enter this corridor too, and the entire region will be in an arms race.” All Gulf states apart from Iran have a majority of Sunni Arabs, whereas Iran is overwhelmingly Shiite and non-Arab Persian. Advertisement Ben Barak said he preferred “not to go into details” of the opportunities the geostrategic situation offers Israel in terms of alliances with moderate Sunni states. “You can see the common interest with Egypt, and I assume there are other” shared interests with other Sunni states. Sunni states, he said, were “fighting a double fight. On the one hand there is the Shiite axis headed by Iran… and on the other side they have Sunni radicals, who see their nation-states as heretical.” Ben Barak said Iran’s proxy, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, may lose its war in Syria against the Islamic State, one instance where the Sunni-Shiite conflict rages closer to Israel. “There are Shiite militias there brought by the Iranians, and many Hezbollah fighters, but they do not succeed in holding back the rebels.” “The Shiites are no more concerned with radical [Sunni] Islam than with the Jews. In four or five years, there may be a new reality in southern Lebanon. In the Golan Heights it is already happening. The Syrian Army there is non-existent. Tomorrow we could have terror attacks on the [Golan Heights’] border fence,” he added. Asked whether the West and the international community could affect the Syrian civil war, Ben Barak responded negatively: “This conflict is stronger than the influence of the [world] powers. It’s a Sunni-Shiite conflict, the Russians and the Americans do not function in it. They have some leverage with [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, but he is only one player among many. The Islamic State and [al-Qaeda affiliated] Nusra Front don’t care about the powers-that-be.” Ben Barak also said an analysis which considers Israel to be at an advantage because its enemies are battling another is “an immature view.” “Wars end and then there is a new reality. Hezbollah without Syria will be crippled, because then it will have trouble getting Iranian assistance and this is important for us, but it’s not clear that the alternative will be better. During the Iran-Iraq War they also said it’s the best outcome for the Jews, and look where we are today. The war in Syria will stabilize, and then the common enemy will again be us. We need to prepare for this.”

News article:
The prospective nuclear deal with Iran would empower it to take over the Middle East and trigger a regional nuclear arms race, a senior Israeli official warned in an interview published Friday. Ram Ben Barak, director general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry and a leading candidate to be the next head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, told the Makor Rishon newspaper that “the deal which is about to be signed will allow Iran to decide by itself when it will be nuclear [armed], and that is the most problematic.” He said the lifting of sanctions would give Tehran “an ocean of money,” allowing it to buy influence across the Middle East and “advance to a position where no one will be able to threaten it and it will acquire control wherever it pleases.” Ben Barak noted that there is “almost no area in the Middle East today where Iran remains uninvolved: Iraq, where Iranian interests are in line with US interests, Lebanon, where Hezbollah is effectively an Iranian division, and Yemen, which was mostly conquered by Iran.” “Think what happens if in coming years Iran will receive billions of dollars. They will have no limitations,” he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Ben Barak is one of three candidates vying for the coveted position of Mossad chief, contending with current National Security Council chair Yossi Cohen and an unnamed deputy to current Mossad chief Tamir Pardo. Pardo is slated to step down in January 2016. Ben Barak has only been directing the Strategic Affairs Ministry since December 2014. He began working with the Mossad in 1991 and rose through the ranks before taking on his current post. As director general of the ministry, Ben Barak defined his role as “being the eyes and ears of the prime minister.” Advertisement The Iran dossier, he said, “is one of the most important things we deal with. The Iranian issue has great influence, beyond the fact that a nuclear Iran is not something, in Israel’s view, which can be tolerated.” Like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ben Barak believes that “if the Americans would insist and press more, a much better agreement could be achieved. There is no doubt a good deal is preferable to war. Everyone understands this, from the prime minister to the last citizen on the street. But a bad deal can have really serious implications.” Ben Barak said he shared the view that countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia were almost certain to enter a nuclear arms race to counterbalance Iran’s nuclear aspirations. “Almost certainly, this process will occur. The Saudis and Gulf states are concerned by an Iranian takeover of the region no less than we are. There are, at the end of the day, many natural resources there, and we have already seen in the past an Iraqi attempt to take over Kuwait because of its oil reserves,” he said, referring to the First Gulf War. The Iranian nuclear race, he said, is compounded by the grander Sunni-Shiite war in the Middle East. “Money is not lacking in the Gulf States, they can buy anything. As soon as they see the Iranians enter a corridor which ends with nuclear capability, they will enter this corridor too, and the entire region will be in an arms race.” All Gulf states apart from Iran have a majority of Sunni Arabs, whereas Iran is overwhelmingly Shiite and non-Arab Persian. Advertisement Ben Barak said he preferred “not to go into details” of the opportunities the geostrategic situation offers Israel in terms of alliances with moderate Sunni states. “You can see the common interest with Egypt, and I assume there are other” shared interests with other Sunni states. Sunni states, he said, were “fighting a double fight. On the one hand there is the Shiite axis headed by Iran… and on the other side they have Sunni radicals, who see their nation-states as heretical.” Ben Barak said Iran’s proxy, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, may lose its war in Syria against the Islamic State, one instance where the Sunni-Shiite conflict rages closer to Israel. “There are Shiite militias there brought by the Iranians, and many Hezbollah fighters, but they do not succeed in holding back the rebels.” “The Shiites are no more concerned with radical [Sunni] Islam than with the Jews. In four or five years, there may be a new reality in southern Lebanon. In the Golan Heights it is already happening. The Syrian Army there is non-existent. Tomorrow we could have terror attacks on the [Golan Heights’] border fence,” he added. Asked whether the West and the international community could affect the Syrian civil war, Ben Barak responded negatively: “This conflict is stronger than the influence of the [world] powers. It’s a Sunni-Shiite conflict, the Russians and the Americans do not function in it. They have some leverage with [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, but he is only one player among many. The Islamic State and [al-Qaeda affiliated] Nusra Front don’t care about the powers-that-be.” Ben Barak also said an analysis which considers Israel to be at an advantage because its enemies are battling another is “an immature view.” “Wars end and then there is a new reality. Hezbollah without Syria will be crippled, because then it will have trouble getting Iranian assistance and this is important for us, but it’s not clear that the alternative will be better.

Israel slams possible lifting of Iran sanctions Posted on by Dave346 Israel denounced Saturday a possible decision to lift sanctions on Iran if a nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers is reached. As soon as sanctions will be lifted, tens or hundreds of billions of dollars are going to fuel the Iranian economy, a statement released by the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu read, according to Agence France Presse. There will be no possibility to go back, the statement added. The Iranian terror machine that is active in the entire world will become stronger. World powers and Tehran are in the midst of negotiations to finalize a deal aimed at preventing Iran from using its nuclear energy program to develop atomic weapons, in exchange for an easing of sanctions.

News article:
Diplomatic sources in Israel said Sunday that the forthcoming deal between world powers and Iran is much worse than the initial framework agreement signed fourth months ago in Lausanne, and claim that since then there have been even more concessions. Under the assumption that a deal will be signed, Jerusalem is preparing for its next battle: preventing congressional approval for the deal. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Secretary of State John Kerry held a press conference in Vienna Saturday, in which he stated that he agrees with Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif's sentiment that a deal has "never been closer". Kerry said that "the right choices" could lead to a deal being signed this week. Mohammed Zarif (Photo: AP) Kerry went on to mention, however, that gaps still remained with Iran on major issues. Officials in Israel were unfazed by reports of disagreements in the Vienna talks, suggesting the aleged issues where purposely leaked in preparation signing a final accord. According to information obtained by officials in Jerusalem, the powers have agreed to further concessions on the number of centrifuges, as well as centrifuge research and development. Additionally, the western powers havve apparently made concessions on the issue of sanctions relief. John Kerry at the talks (Photo:AP) Israeli officials were still pushing for last-minute amendments to the deal, even if chances of implementing them remained slim. Energy and Infrastructure Minister Yuval Steinitz had spoken with representatives of Germany, France, and the UK in recent days, calling their attention to weak points in the deal. In anticipation of a final deal, officials in Jerusalem are preparing to exert pressure on the US Congress to prevent it from signing off. If a deal is submitted to Congress before July 9, the vote would be held within 30 days due to the upcoming congressional recess. On the other hand, if the deal were to be submitted after July 9, the vote would only take place after 60 days. If a majority votes against the Iran deal in Congress, President Obama can veto the move. If the president does use his veto, however, it would allow him to decide when to return the motion for a revote in Congress -- in which case a two-thirds majority in both houses would be needed to bypass the presidential veto. Israel's goal: Bypassing the veto Israel is pressuring Congress members to scuttle the deal in the first vote. If the deal goes to the floor, Israel will make a concerted diplomatic effort to achieve a two-thirds majority in order to bypass a possible veto. Officials in Jerusalem estimate that Obama will have enough support to approve the measure in the first vote, thanks to fear among members of Congress that denying the measure while other powers begin trading with Iran will come at a great economic cost to US industry. There are, however, officials in Israel who believe the battle is not over yet, and that with the right work a majority can be achieved against the measure in the first vote. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Photo:AFP) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself is already preparing to battle for the hearts and minds of Congress members, and opened this week's government meeting with fierce criticism of the possible deal. "The deal being formed in Vienna is not a breakthrough, it’s a breakdown," Netanyahu said. He warned that it "would pave the way for Iran to produce multiple nuclear weapons, and will bring it hundreds of billions of dollars, which Iran will use to further aggression and terrorist exploits, both in the region and around the world. "It’s a bad deal. It's not any better, and is even worse, than the deal made with North Korea, which led to a nuclear arsenal in North Korea. But here we are talking about both an unconventional and large conventional threat to Israel, the region's states, and the world as a whole." Meanwhile, diplomatic officials within Israel have leveled heavy criticsm against Netanyahu, protesting the fact that he has not resumed talks with the US government on the size of Israel's security aid package in the wake of a deal with Iran. The same officials said that unlike Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf nations understood that a deal with Iran is a pre-determined fact and are already deep in negotiations with the Americans on the size of the conciliatory defense aid package they will receive. These officials said that Israel should have entered into defense aid package talks with Washington before the deal, because then Obama would have been more generous than an agreement is signed, especially if Israel is going to campaign against the deal in Congress.

In anticipation of a final deal, officials in Jerusalem are preparing to exert pressure on the US Congress to prevent it from signing off. If a deal is submitted to Congress before July 9, the vote would be held within 30 days due to the upcoming congressional recess. On the other hand, if the deal were to be submitted after July 9, the vote would only take place after 60 days. If a majority votes against the Iran deal in Congress, President Obama can veto the move. If the president does use his veto, however, it would allow him to decide when to return the motion for a revote in Congress -- in which case a two-thirds majority in both houses would be needed to bypass the presidential veto. Israel's goal: Bypassing the veto Israel is pressuring Congress members to scuttle the deal in the first vote. If the deal goes to the floor, Israel will make a concerted diplomatic effort to achieve a two-thirds majority in order to bypass a possible veto. Officials in Jerusalem estimate that Obama will have enough support to approve the measure in the first vote, thanks to fear among members of Congress that denying the measure while other powers begin trading with Iran will come at a great economic cost to US industry. There are, however, officials in Israel who believe the battle is not over yet, and that with the right work a majority can be achieved against the measure in the first vote. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Photo:AFP) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself is already preparing to battle for the hearts and minds of Congress members, and opened this week's government meeting with fierce criticism of the possible deal. "The deal being formed in Vienna is not a breakthrough, it’s a breakdown," Netanyahu said. He warned that it "would pave the way for Iran to produce multiple nuclear weapons, and will bring it hundreds of billions of dollars, which Iran will use to further aggression and terrorist exploits, both in the region and around the world. "It’s a bad deal. It's not any better, and is even worse, than the deal made with North Korea, which led to a nuclear arsenal in North Korea. But here we are talking about both an unconventional and large conventional threat to Israel, the region's states, and the world as a whole." Meanwhile, diplomatic officials within Israel have leveled heavy criticsm against Netanyahu, protesting the fact that he has not resumed talks with the US government on the size of Israel's security aid package in the wake of a deal with Iran. The same officials said that unlike Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf nations understood that a deal with Iran is a pre-determined fact and are already deep in negotiations with the Americans on the size of the conciliatory defense aid package they will receive. These officials said that Israel should have entered into defense aid package talks with Washington before the deal, because then Obama would have been more generous than an agreement is signed, especially if Israel is going to campaign against the deal in Congress.

PM mourns Operation Protective Edge fallen, sends warning to Israel’s enemies Prime Minister Netanyahu says at the ceremony to mark one year since Operation Protective Edge that “Hamas was beaten the worst ever since its establishment. We are closely monitoring occurrences in the south and are prepared to act with force when necessary. “I say to all enemies of Israel — Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and the Islamic State, too — whoever tries to harm us, their blood is upon their heads,” he adds. Netanyahu then quotes from the Lament of David (2 Samuel, 1), a biblical text also recited during Memorial Day ceremonies: “The bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.” Netanyahu also says his government will not spare “any effort” to bring home the bodies of Shaul Oron and Hadar Goldin, two soldiers who fell in battle and whose remains are held by Hamas. He also speaks of Daniel Tragerman, a toddler who was killed by the mortar shell at the end of the war. “There is no end to our yearning, there is no limit to our pride. May the memory of our soldiers, of our sons, the heroes of Israel, and of our citizens, from the toddler, 4-year-old Daniel, to the eldest — may their memory forever be cherished by the heart of the nation,” he concludes. After the ceremony, the prime minister and his wife, Sara, remain for 20 minutes at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl, speaking to families who lost loved ones during the campaign. According to Ynet, the prime minister’s security guards allow the crowd to come near him, something that rarely occurs. One of those who approaches the prime minister is Ella Bar, the girlfriend of Paz Eliyahu, who died in a battle inside the Gaza Strip. She talks with Netanyahu about the issue of girlfriends of fallen soldiers, who are not recognized by the Defense Ministry as part of Israel’s community of the bereaved. Netanyahu and his wife say they will examine the issue and check whether the existing situation can be changed. The prime minister instructs one of his aides to note down Bar’s request. Speaking later to Ynet, Bar says: “I thank the prime minister for mentioning the partners of the fallen in his speech. I think more can be done on this, but I was moved to hear this mention as a kind of recognition of us, the girlfriends.” Asked by another person how he feels a year after the battles, Netanyahu answers: “I think we achieved something great.”

News article:
Ever since nuclear negotiations between the administration of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and P5+1 - the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany - began, and especially after the Lausanne Accord was announced in April, the opponents of the nuclear agreement and in particular Israel have been trying to demonize Iran. The phenomenon is nothing new, but has taken on new dimensions as the foes of the agreement have been claiming that Iran and Iranians are anti-Semites, and thus cannot be trusted with any agreement. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have been hard at work to present a demonic image of Iran with the hope that it will convince the public that Iran must be attacked militarily. Their goal is to goad the United States to undertake such attacks, and in order to justify them, they have been making two grandiose claims, namely that, The Islamic Republic of Iran is an anti-Semitic regime, and Iranians too have been and are anti-Semitics. Netanyahu has repeatedly claimed that Iran intends to destroy Iran by creating another Holocaust, and has likened Iran to the Nazi regime; see for example here, here, and here. In his most recent speech to a joint session of the United States Congress, Netanyahu spoke about a, "powerful Persian viceroy named Haman" who "plotted to destroy the Jewish people some 2,500 years ago. But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther, exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies." Advertisement The vast majority of stories in the Torah and the Quran are mythical, not reports of actual historical events. But, if Netanyahu intends to transform them to historical facts, he must also accept the fact that, according to the Torah, Jews committed genocide during that historical era, massacring 75,000 Iranians. Indeed, they have celebrated this event throughout history (Esther 9: 5-16). But, Netanyahu censors this part of the myth, because he is neither a theologian nor a man interested in the truth. He is after preventing a nuclear agreement with Iran and attacking that nation, and to achieve his goal he is willing to do whatever it takes. When Netanyahu and other Israeli officials create such an anti-Iran atmosphere, Israel's lobby and supporters "theorize" what they say in order to prepare the public for militarily attacks on the "demonic" Iran. The important question is what is the truth? Are Iranian Jews not being discriminated against? Are they not being oppressed similar to their Muslim (both Sunni and Shiite) Iranian compatriots? Are Iranians, or at least the Islamic Republic's leaders, not anti-Semitic? The Historical Facts about anti-Semitisms Anti-Semitism is a European phenomenon. There were many laws in Europe in the past that allowed systematic discrimination against the Jews, violating their rights. Anti-Semitism was considered "moral" and practiced by both European governments and their peoples. In order to teach his son about what was being done to the Jews in Vienna, Austria, Sigmund Freud's father told him a story about what had happened to him Advertisement " When I was a young man," my [Sigmund's] father said, "I went for a walk one Saturday. I was well dressed, and had a new fur cap on my head. A Christian came up to me and with a single blow knocked off my cap into the mud and shouted: 'Jew!'" And what did you do, I asked. "I picked up my cap," was his quiet reply." (Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume IV, p. 147), During World War II, many polish Jews escaped the Nazi occupation and moved to Iran. Abdol-Hossein Sardari, a diplomat in Iran's embassy in Paris, issued Iranian passports and visa for many of the Jews, so that they could escape to Iran. He is referred to as the "Iranian Schindler." Iranians were very hospitable to such Jews, and provided a comfortable life for them. But, during the first half of the 20th century Jews from all over the world moved to Palestine and founded the state of Israel. Israel presents itself as the "Jewish state" for the Jews' tribe, has occupied the Palestinians' lands at least since 1967, and has committed crimes against them that the United Nations' Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has referred to them as war crimes. The Meaning of Anti-Semitism Words have no meaning other than their applications. At the same time, in using words one cannot have double standards. The word "anti" should have exactly the same meaning when used in anti-Semitism, anti-Islam, anti-Arab, anti-Iran, anti-Israel, anti-American, etc. To prevent any criticism of what they do, Netanyahu and other Israeli officials claim that any criticism of Israel is tantamount to anti-Semitism. Netanyahu even accused the UNHRC of anti-Semitism, because the Council accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza. In his speech to the UN General Assembly on 29 September 2014, Netanyahu said, Advertisement "The [UN Human Right] Council's biased treatment of Israel is only one manifestation of the return of the world's oldest prejudices. We hear mobs today in Europe call for the gassing of Jews. We hear some national leaders compare Israel to the Nazis. This is not a function of Israel's policies. It's a function of diseased minds. And that disease has a name. It's called anti-Semitism." If criticizing Israel is anti-Semitism, then criticizing Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and other Islamic nations is also anti-Islam and spreading Islamophobia. But, in fact, criticizing any government does not imply being against any religion. Thus, one must differentiate between criticizing Israel and anti-Semitism. In an interview with The Atlantic on May 21, President Barak Obama took up this issue. He said that some people have reduced Judaism to what Israel does, so that if anyone criticizes Israel, he is considered an anti-Semite. The President added, "If you are questioning settlement policy, that indicates you're anti-Israeli, or that indicates you're anti-Jewish. If you express compassion or empathy towards Palestinian youth, who are dealing with checkpoints or restrictions on their ability to travel, then you are suspect in terms of your support of Israel. If you are willing to get into public disagreements with the Israeli government, then the notion is that you are being anti-Israel, and by extension, anti-Jewish. I completely reject that." Thus, we must move toward defensible meanings for words. If we hold the United States, or Iran, or Israel, or Saudi Arabia responsible for all the problems in the world or in the Middle East, then we are being anti-America, anti-Israel, anti-Iran, etc. If we attribute everything immoral to Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or Baha'ism, then we are being anti-Semite, anti-Christianity, anti-Islam or anti-Baha'ism. Such a discourse that separates "us" from "them" and tries to dehumanize "them" eventually leads to eliminating "them" from humanity. Research by the Anti-Defamation League has shown that, in the entire Middle East (except Israel obviously), anti-Semitism is the least in Iran, and that Iran is not even among the top 20 countries in the world when it comes to anti-Semitism. One of the questions that the researchers asked the people of the Middle East, as well as Americans, was whether the Jews speak about the Holocaust too much. 16% of Yemenis, 18% of Iranians, 22% of Americans, 22% of the Saudis, 23% of Egyptians, 24% of Kuwaitis, 26% of Lebanese, 29% of Jordanians, 33% of Iraqis, 42% of Omanis, 45% in the United Arab Emirates, 51% of Bahrainis, 52% of Qataris, and 64% of the Palestinians living in the West Bank responded affirmatively. So, even the Americans believed in the issue more strongly than Iranians. Advertisement Of course, the criteria that are used for identifying anti-Semitism are central to reducing or increasing the spread of the phenomenon. Suppose, for example, that one criterion is whether the Jews have won more Nobel Prize than any other people. If someone responds positively to the question, would he/she be an anti-Semite? Netanyahu tells anyone who is willing to listen that anyone who opposes Israel's Jewish Settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is anti-Semite. Is that a valid argument? Let us consider another statistics, those on hate crimes in the United States. A 2013 report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation showed that, of all the hate crimes only 17.4% were religion-related. Surprisingly, 60.3% of the victims were Jews, 13.7% were Muslim, 6.1% were Catholic, 3.8% were Protestant. Thus, in the United States, the most important ally of Israel, Jews are by far the largest group of victims of hate crimes. Does that mean that the U.S. is a strongly anti-Semitic nation?

News article:
Ever since nuclear negotiations between the administration of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and P5+1 - the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany - began, and especially after the Lausanne Accord was announced in April, the opponents of the nuclear agreement and in particular Israel have been trying to demonize Iran. The phenomenon is nothing new, but has taken on new dimensions as the foes of the agreement have been claiming that Iran and Iranians are anti-Semites, and thus cannot be trusted with any agreement. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have been hard at work to present a demonic image of Iran with the hope that it will convince the public that Iran must be attacked militarily. Their goal is to goad the United States to undertake such attacks, and in order to justify them, they have been making two grandiose claims, namely that, The Islamic Republic of Iran is an anti-Semitic regime, and Iranians too have been and are anti-Semitics. Netanyahu has repeatedly claimed that Iran intends to destroy Iran by creating another Holocaust, and has likened Iran to the Nazi regime; see for example here, here, and here. In his most recent speech to a joint session of the United States Congress, Netanyahu spoke about a, "powerful Persian viceroy named Haman" who "plotted to destroy the Jewish people some 2,500 years ago. But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther, exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies." Advertisement The vast majority of stories in the Torah and the Quran are mythical, not reports of actual historical events. But, if Netanyahu intends to transform them to historical facts, he must also accept the fact that, according to the Torah, Jews committed genocide during that historical era, massacring 75,000 Iranians. Indeed, they have celebrated this event throughout history (Esther 9: 5-16). But, Netanyahu censors this part of the myth, because he is neither a theologian nor a man interested in the truth. He is after preventing a nuclear agreement with Iran and attacking that nation, and to achieve his goal he is willing to do whatever it takes. When Netanyahu and other Israeli officials create such an anti-Iran atmosphere, Israel's lobby and supporters "theorize" what they say in order to prepare the public for militarily attacks on the "demonic" Iran. The important question is what is the truth? Are Iranian Jews not being discriminated against? Are they not being oppressed similar to their Muslim (both Sunni and Shiite) Iranian compatriots? Are Iranians, or at least the Islamic Republic's leaders, not anti-Semitic? The Historical Facts about anti-Semitisms Anti-Semitism is a European phenomenon. There were many laws in Europe in the past that allowed systematic discrimination against the Jews, violating their rights. Anti-Semitism was considered "moral" and practiced by both European governments and their peoples. In order to teach his son about what was being done to the Jews in Vienna, Austria, Sigmund Freud's father told him a story about what had happened to him Advertisement " When I was a young man," my [Sigmund's] father said, "I went for a walk one Saturday. I was well dressed, and had a new fur cap on my head. A Christian came up to me and with a single blow knocked off my cap into the mud and shouted: 'Jew!'" And what did you do, I asked. "I picked up my cap," was his quiet reply." (Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume IV, p. 147), During World War II, many polish Jews escaped the Nazi occupation and moved to Iran. Abdol-Hossein Sardari, a diplomat in Iran's embassy in Paris, issued Iranian passports and visa for many of the Jews, so that they could escape to Iran. He is referred to as the "Iranian Schindler." Iranians were very hospitable to such Jews, and provided a comfortable life for them. But, during the first half of the 20th century Jews from all over the world moved to Palestine and founded the state of Israel. Israel presents itself as the "Jewish state" for the Jews' tribe, has occupied the Palestinians' lands at least since 1967, and has committed crimes against them that the United Nations' Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has referred to them as war crimes. The Meaning of Anti-Semitism Words have no meaning other than their applications. At the same time, in using words one cannot have double standards. The word "anti" should have exactly the same meaning when used in anti-Semitism, anti-Islam, anti-Arab, anti-Iran, anti-Israel, anti-American, etc. To prevent any criticism of what they do, Netanyahu and other Israeli officials claim that any criticism of Israel is tantamount to anti-Semitism. Netanyahu even accused the UNHRC of anti-Semitism, because the Council accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza. In his speech to the UN General Assembly on 29 September 2014, Netanyahu said, Advertisement "The [UN Human Right] Council's biased treatment of Israel is only one manifestation of the return of the world's oldest prejudices. We hear mobs today in Europe call for the gassing of Jews. We hear some national leaders compare Israel to the Nazis. This is not a function of Israel's policies. It's a function of diseased minds. And that disease has a name. It's called anti-Semitism." If criticizing Israel is anti-Semitism, then criticizing Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and other Islamic nations is also anti-Islam and spreading Islamophobia. But, in fact, criticizing any government does not imply being against any religion. Thus, one must differentiate between criticizing Israel and anti-Semitism. In an interview with The Atlantic on May 21, President Barak Obama took up this issue. He said that some people have reduced Judaism to what Israel does, so that if anyone criticizes Israel, he is considered an anti-Semite. The President added, "If you are questioning settlement policy, that indicates you're anti-Israeli, or that indicates you're anti-Jewish. If you express compassion or empathy towards Palestinian youth, who are dealing with checkpoints or restrictions on their ability to travel, then you are suspect in terms of your support of Israel. If you are willing to get into public disagreements with the Israeli government, then the notion is that you are being anti-Israel, and by extension, anti-Jewish. I completely reject that." Thus, we must move toward defensible meanings for words. If we hold the United States, or Iran, or Israel, or Saudi Arabia responsible for all the problems in the world or in the Middle East, then we are being anti-America, anti-Israel, anti-Iran, etc. If we attribute everything immoral to Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or Baha'ism, then we are being anti-Semite, anti-Christianity, anti-Islam or anti-Baha'ism. Such a discourse that separates "us" from "them" and tries to dehumanize "them" eventually leads to eliminating "them" from humanity. Research by the Anti-Defamation League has shown that, in the entire Middle East (except Israel obviously), anti-Semitism is the least in Iran, and that Iran is not even among the top 20 countries in the world when it comes to anti-Semitism. One of the questions that the researchers asked the people of the Middle East, as well as Americans, was whether the Jews speak about the Holocaust too much. 16% of Yemenis, 18% of Iranians, 22% of Americans, 22% of the Saudis, 23% of Egyptians, 24% of Kuwaitis, 26% of Lebanese, 29% of Jordanians, 33% of Iraqis, 42% of Omanis, 45% in the United Arab Emirates, 51% of Bahrainis, 52% of Qataris, and 64% of the Palestinians living in the West Bank responded affirmatively. So, even the Americans believed in the issue more strongly than Iranians. Advertisement Of course, the criteria that are used for identifying anti-Semitism are central to reducing or increasing the spread of the phenomenon. Suppose, for example, that one criterion is whether the Jews have won more Nobel Prize than any other people. If someone responds positively to the question, would he/she be an anti-Semite? Netanyahu tells anyone who is willing to listen that anyone who opposes Israel's Jewish Settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is anti-Semite. Is that a valid argument? Let us consider another statistics, those on hate crimes in the United States. A 2013 report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation showed that, of all the hate crimes only 17.4% were religion-related. Surprisingly, 60.3% of the victims were Jews, 13.7% were Muslim, 6.1% were Catholic, 3.8% were Protestant. Thus, in the United States, the most important ally of Israel, Jews are by far the largest group of victims of hate crimes. Does that mean that the U.S. is a strongly anti-Semitic nation?

News article:
With yet another deadline expired to seal a final nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that the Islamic Republic is planning to “take over the world.” During a memorial service in Jerusalem marking 111 years since the death of modern Zionism visionary Theodor Herzl, Netanyahu said, “Iran’s growing aggression is several times more dangerous than that of IS, which is dangerous enough.” “And this aggression, which aims to reach every corner of the world, has the ultimate true aim of taking over the world,” he added. Netanyahu criticized the emerging nuclear deal between the P5+1 and Iran, in which he said weakened world powers are capitulating to too many Iranian demands. “Iran, which is the greatest patron of terror in the world, is extorting from world powers more and more concessions,” he claimed. “Iran is the greatest threat to world peace. The capitulation agreement that Iran is about to get from world powers is paving the way for it to arm itself with nuclear weapons and to carry them further with the missiles that it continues to develop, and of course to spread terror.” Officials from the P5+1 nations – US, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany – extended nuclear talks with Iran for the second time in a week on Tuesday, giving themselves until Friday to reach an agreement. A Western official told AFP that there remains “very, very, very tough” issues. Over the last two years, western and Iranian diplomats have been attempting to broker a deal revolving around Iran’s nuclear program, ending a 13-year standoff. “Removing the remaining brackets [in the text of the agreement], this seems to be very, very, very tough,” the official stated. “It’s difficult to see why and how we could go any longer,” a second official said. “Either this works in the next 48 hours or it doesn’t.” White House Spokesman Josh Earnest suggested on Tuesday that the US is unlikely to walk away from talks despite missed deadlines. Regarding the possibility of open-ended negotiations, he stated, “We’ve got some bipartisan agreement that this is an available approach that could benefit the United States and our negotiating partners in a way that continues to keep the pressure on Iran to reach a final agreement.” The US “won’t walk away from the table as long as the negotiations continue to be useful,” he added. The US is rushing to finalize a deal in order to push it through Congress on an express approval route. Should US Secretary of State John Kerry fail to hand over a deal to US lawmakers by Thursday, Congress would have 60 days instead of 30 to review the agreement.

The American negotiating team at the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna has not updated Israel on developments in the talks in nearly two weeks, Israeli and American officials acknowledged Tuesday. The officials did not agree on the reasons for the failure, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported. In a briefing to reporters in Vienna, senior American officials said that Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, who has led the Iran talks for the US, tried to contact Israel’s National Security Adviser Yossi Cohen three times over the past ten days, but scheduling conflicts prevented the calls from going through. A senior official in Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office confirmed that the last update from Sherman took place 12 days ago, but insisted, “we have not declined any offers for further updates.” High-level contact between the Obama and Netanyahu administrations has all but ceased as the Iran negotiations entered their critical final phases in recent weeks, the newspaper reported. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not spoken once with US Secretary of State John Kerry since the latest round of talks began in Vienna. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The result, according to Israeli officials, is that Israel has only a very partial understanding of what is taking place in the negotiating room. American officials said Sherman intends to attempt to update Cohen again in the coming days. Netanyahu has been an outspoken critic of the Iran talks in recent months, angering the American administration with his March trip to Washington to speak in Congress against the deal that US President Barack Obama considers a cornerstone of his foreign policy. Advertisement The prime minister spoke out again against the deal Tuesday, calling Iran “the greatest threat to world peace” and insisting world powers were caving in to Tehran’s demands. “Iran, which is the greatest patron of terror in the world, is extorting from world powers more and more concessions,” Netanyahu said at a memorial ceremony at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem that marked 111 years since the death of Zionist movement founder Theodor Herzl. “Iran is the greatest threat to world peace. The capitulation agreement that Iran is about to get from world powers is paving the way for it to arm itself with nuclear weapons and to carry them further with the missiles that it continues to develop, and of course to spread terror,” Netanyahu said. Ministers from the US, Britain, France, Russia, China, and Germany — the so-called P5+1 nations — further extended nuclear talks with Iran Tuesday after missing a second deadline in a week. The deadline was the latest to have been set for a comprehensive pact that would replace the interim deal world powers and Iran reached in November 2013. That package was extended three times, most recently on June 30. The deal, aimed at ending a 13-year-old standoff over Iran’s nuclear program, would build on a framework accord reached in April in Switzerland.

The target date has passed and Iran and the world powers have failed to reach an agreement yet, but the eagerness of the United States increases the chances that an agreement will be reached soon. Regardless of whether an agreement is signed or not – the outcome will be dangerous for Israel. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter If an agreement is signed, we will face an Iran whose nuclear project may have been frozen, but the billions which will flow in following the removal of the sanctions will boost its strategic strength and its support of terror and subversion. If an agreement is not signed, Iran will speed up its attempts to reach a nuclear weapon and regional hegemony. Nuclear Deal Obama playing poker against a hostile Congress Orly Azoulay Analysis: If the world powers reach an agreement with Iran, the US president will have to bring his poker secrets into the internal political field in order to deal with a theatrical Congress during an election year; the Republicans, meanwhile, are preparing the show of a lifetime for him. Obama playing poker against a hostile Congress The first command is creating a proper military response, both defensive and offensive. The defensive response must reinforce the home front defense against tens of thousands of missiles and rockets that are directed at the home front today. The current defense layout is still insufficient, both quantitatively and qualitatively, against Hezbollah's rocket arsenal in Lebanon. The offensive response should give Israel the possibility to act against the Iranian nuclear weapon project on its own. In the new situation which could be created, this choice may be the last one left in our hands, and Israel must not remain helpless and depend on the mercy of foreigners under such difficult circumstances.

The second command is changing Israel's international standing. Even without a direct conflict between Israel and Iran, a conflict with its emissaries – Hezbollah and Hamas – is inevitable in the coming years. The results of such conflicts, in Lebanon and Gaza, are largely determined by the timing of their cessation. The international community, through the Security Council, determines the length of the IDF's operation and whether it managed to achieve its goals. Israel won't be able to fight its enemies properly with the occupation hump on its back. As the policy aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state continues, the diplomatic isolation will grow and Israel's military freedom of action will be limited. The second command, therefore, is launching peace negotiations as soon as possible with the purpose of ending the conflict and establishing a demilitarized Palestinian state on one-fifth of the Land of Israel. The implementation of these two actions will allow the fulfillment of the third command – creating a regional alliance of Arab states with Israel. I am referring to Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and most of the Gulf states. The purpose of the regional alliance is to curb the ayatollah regime, thwart its intentions and speed up its internal overthrow. Israel, as a regional power which no longer prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state, will be a wanted and important member of this alliance. The fourth command is restoring the special relationship between the Israeli government and the administration in Washington. These four commands are intertwined, and the implementation of each of them strengthens the other three. But the key for successfully dealing with Iran in this new reality can actually be found in the second command, which is under a serious internal dispute in Israel. Creating the regional alliance and restoring the relationship with the US depend on a change in Israel's international standing. It has to do with changing the Israeli policy regarding to basic question – two states in the Land of Israel or one state. In order to face Iran, this question must be determined. This is a decision everyone has managed to evade for nearly two decades. Brigadier-General (res.) Dr. Ephraim Sneh is a former deputy defense minister and the current chairman of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Strategic Dialogue at the Netanya Academic College.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the world powers are caving in to Iran’s demands, even as Tehran rails against the US and Israel. “The ruler of Iran, Khameini, is quoted as saying that Iran needs to plan to fight the US regardless of whether there is an agreement,” Netanyahu says at the weekly cabinet meeting. “The president of Iran, Rouhani, stands at the head of the march of hatred in the streets of Tehran, in which US and Israeli flags were burned, and in which many chanted ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel.'” Netanyahu is referring to Friday’s annual al-Quds day, which drew millions of protesters in Iran. “All of this is happening as the parade of concessions to Iran continues in Vienna, concessions even on issues that had been marked as red lines in the Lausanne package, which is a bad deal in its own right. It paves Iran’s way to many nuclear bombs and gives it hundreds of billions of dollars for its terrorism and conquest machine, thereby endangering the peace of the entire world. “Iran does not hide its intention to continue its murderous aggression even against those with whom it is negotiating. Perhaps there is someone among the great powers who is prepared to capitulate to this reality that Iran is dictating, which includes its unending calls for the destruction of Israel – we will not pay the price for this,” Netanyahu says.

News article:
For six years, Israelis have lived under governments led by PM Binyamin Netanyahu. In four electoral campaigns he has prioritized security and the need to stop Iran advancement toward nuclear weapons, promising Israel will be safe if he is elected. For more than 20 years he has been talking about stopping Iran’s nuclear plans inside and outside of Israel, in television shows and in newspapers. The US and the West are about to sign a deal with Iran, which Netanyahu claims is a bad deal. What did we get from all of his rhetoric? Nothing. And what has he done to avoid reaching this point? Effectively nothing. It is very photogenic to literally draw red lines in the United Nations General Assembly podium or to give beautifully crafted speeches in the US Congress without the approval of the White House. But it would have been more helpful to us to have less show and more working behind the scenes to influence the outcome of these negotiations. But Netanyahu did the opposite. He alienated the relations with President Obama and the American administration, which simultaneously isolated Israel furthermore from the west. But let us not give all credit to Netanyahu. Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon titled US Secretary of State as “messianic”; and Ron Dermer — our ambassador in Washington DC — is making of Israel a partisan issue in the US, which is the worst possible diplomatic outcome of any Israeli administration ever. But here is the reality as I see it: Netanyahu could have had stopped a bad deal, by being more of a statesman and less of a populist. Israel has often had to choose between the right and the smart thing to do. Maybe the right thing is, indeed, to openly challenge our allies for signing a bad deal, and even risking destroying our long-standing alliances. But the smart thing (and more effective strategy) is to work behind the camera and not in front of it and to do good and smart diplomacy with the US and the west for two reasons. First, so that Israel would be kept in the loop of the negotiations. Second, perhaps more importantly, so that Israel would have bargaining power on these negotiations to avoid a deal that is harmful to Israel’s security. Most Israelis, on both sides of the political spectrum, are very worried –and legitimately so — of a deal with Iran that could pave the way to legitimize their nuclear ambitions. I don’t know if Netanyahu is in reality as concerned as he says he is, but it must be clear now for everybody that he definitely has not delivered what he promised. And thus, if this deal is signed, he is the one to blame.

News article:
After Iran nuclear deal, Israel eyes Congress and counter-measures By Dan Williams and Luke Baker JERUSALEM, July 14 (Reuters) - Having failed to prevent an international nuclear deal with Iran, Israel plans to ramp up its lobbying of the U.S. Congress, and look for any sign that Iran is violating the agreement, in the hope of getting sanctions reimposed, officials said. Responding within minutes to news that six world powers had agreed to lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, Israel's prime minister and other senior officials condemned the pact. "This is a bad mistake of historic proportions," said Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described Iran as akin to the militants of Islamic State. "Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world." Iran does not recognise Israel and has in the past said it should be wiped off the map, leading the small Jewish state, widely assumed to possess the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal, to portray Iran as a threat to its existence. Having spent months trying to stall the deal and expose its perceived frailties, Israeli officials said they would now focus on persuading the U.S. Congress to reject it, while monitoring Iran meticulously to catch violations. U.S. lawmakers have 60 days to review the deal, with President Barack Obama seeking bipartisan support for an agreement that would be a central plank of his legacy. Even if the review goes against Obama, he could overrule Congress by veto, although that would tarnish the achievement. "HOLES IN THE AGREEMENT" "Israel must focus and explain all of the holes in this agreement, which will just intensify terrorism and increase Middle East chaos," Gilad Erdan, minister of public security and a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, told Israel's Army Radio. "Hopefully the Congress and Senate will see the truth." Netanyahu's relations with the White House are already rocky, not least because he addressed a joint session of Congress in March to criticise the emerging deal, and some in Israel have questioned the value of lobbying Congress again. But confidants of Netanyahu said he was as determined as ever to have his views heard. "Why shouldn't we go all out in Congress?" one person close to Netanyahu said. "Even if we don't garner all the votes we need, and even if Obama exercises a presidential veto to get the Iran deal ratified, it will still have symbolic value for us." Dore Gold, director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry and a veteran Netanyahu adviser, saw no need to "feel ashamed" about arguing against the nuclear deal in the United States - which he insisted could be done without aggravating Obama personally. Gold said open communications were needed to report and act on any attempt by Iran to violate the agreed curbs on its nuclear programme, an allusion to increased Israeli monitoring. Under the agreement reached on Tuesday, international sanctions on Iran could be reimposed within 65 days if Tehran violates any part of the agreement, diplomats said. "ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE" "Possibly the most important thing is to get a real picture of whether they are honouring the deal, and also to talk about this with the international community," Gold told Army Radio. Israeli planners have made little secret of the fact that they are expanding intelligence capabilities which, many experts believe, have spotted or helped sabotage Iranian nuclear efforts in the past. Netanyahu has also beefed up Israel's armed forces, which have been tasked with preparing last-ditch strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites - though such a prospect has little support domestically and is seen as highly unlikely. Erdan, however, said war had not been ruled out: "Israel is keeping all options on the table, diplomatic or otherwise." Washington, which gives Israel $3 billion in annual defence grants and has signalled that it is open to increasing that, has tried to stay its ally's hand with joint missile defence projects designed to reduce the risk from any future Iranian attack. At the same time, the United States has increased defence support to other allies in the region who have concerns about the deal with Iran, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the Gulf states.

After Iran nuclear deal, Israel eyes Congress and counter-measures By Dan Williams and Luke Baker JERUSALEM, July 14 (Reuters) - Having failed to prevent an international nuclear deal with Iran, Israel plans to ramp up its lobbying of the U.S. Congress, and look for any sign that Iran is violating the agreement, in the hope of getting sanctions reimposed, officials said. Responding within minutes to news that six world powers had agreed to lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, Israel's prime minister and other senior officials condemned the pact. "This is a bad mistake of historic proportions," said Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described Iran as akin to the militants of Islamic State. "Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world." Iran does not recognise Israel and has in the past said it should be wiped off the map, leading the small Jewish state, widely assumed to possess the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal, to portray Iran as a threat to its existence. Having spent months trying to stall the deal and expose its perceived frailties, Israeli officials said they would now focus on persuading the U.S. Congress to reject it, while monitoring Iran meticulously to catch violations. U.S. lawmakers have 60 days to review the deal, with President Barack Obama seeking bipartisan support for an agreement that would be a central plank of his legacy. Even if the review goes against Obama, he could overrule Congress by veto, although that would tarnish the achievement. "HOLES IN THE AGREEMENT" "Israel must focus and explain all of the holes in this agreement, which will just intensify terrorism and increase Middle East chaos," Gilad Erdan, minister of public security and a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, told Israel's Army Radio. "Hopefully the Congress and Senate will see the truth." Netanyahu's relations with the White House are already rocky, not least because he addressed a joint session of Congress in March to criticise the emerging deal, and some in Israel have questioned the value of lobbying Congress again. But confidants of Netanyahu said he was as determined as ever to have his views heard. "Why shouldn't we go all out in Congress?" one person close to Netanyahu said. "Even if we don't garner all the votes we need, and even if Obama exercises a presidential veto to get the Iran deal ratified, it will still have symbolic value for us." Dore Gold, director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry and a veteran Netanyahu adviser, saw no need to "feel ashamed" about arguing against the nuclear deal in the United States - which he insisted could be done without aggravating Obama personally. Gold said open communications were needed to report and act on any attempt by Iran to violate the agreed curbs on its nuclear programme, an allusion to increased Israeli monitoring. Under the agreement reached on Tuesday, international sanctions on Iran could be reimposed within 65 days if Tehran violates any part of the agreement, diplomats said. "ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE" "Possibly the most important thing is to get a real picture of whether they are honouring the deal, and also to talk about this with the international community," Gold told Army Radio. Israeli planners have made little secret of the fact that they are expanding intelligence capabilities which, many experts believe, have spotted or helped sabotage Iranian nuclear efforts in the past. Netanyahu has also beefed up Israel's armed forces, which have been tasked with preparing last-ditch strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites - though such a prospect has little support domestically and is seen as highly unlikely. Erdan, however, said war had not been ruled out: "Israel is keeping all options on the table, diplomatic or otherwise." Washington, which gives Israel $3 billion in annual defence grants and has signalled that it is open to increasing that, has tried to stay its ally's hand with joint missile defence projects designed to reduce the risk from any future Iranian attack. At the same time, the United States has increased defence support to other allies in the region who have concerns about the deal with Iran, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the Gulf states.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday evening said it was “absurd” to suggest that his relationship with US President Barack Obama had any bearing on the nuclear deal. In his third statement to the press in a single day, the prime minister said that without Israel’s efforts to thwart Iran’s nuclear ambitions, Tehran would have already broken out to the bomb. Israel will continue to work to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, he vowed. Netanyahu made a brief statement after exiting a security cabinet meeting, during which the ministers voted unanimously to reject the Iran deal “and determined that Israel is not bound by it,” according to a press release. “The claim by political sources that my personal relationship with Obama had an effect on the nuclear deal is absurd,” he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Several opposition Knesset members, including Zionist Union party leader Isaac Herzog and Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid, had charged that Netanyahu’s strained ties with the US president compromised Israel’s negotiating position. The US administration was set on “normalizing ties with Iran” even “before I entered my position,” Netanyahu said. “Afterwards, the US opened secret negotiations with Iran that were later made public. Obviously, the desire to reach a deal led to this outcome.” Netanyahu hailed Israeli efforts to thwart Iran’s nuclear efforts, while maintaining that he had spared no effort during the past 20 years to stop Tehran. Advertisement “On the other hand, in the past two decades, even when I wasn’t prime minister and later when I was elected, I did everything, everything in my power, everything in the power of Israel, to prevent Iran from arming itself with a nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu said. “The pressure we applied and the operations we carried out for years have stopped Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons. I can say that without Israel’s actions, Iran would have long received nuclear arms.” The prime minister urged a united political front in Israel to combat the nuclear deal. “We have one goal — to ensure that it won’t arm itself in the future,” he added. “And at this time, facing this task, we cannot occupy ourselves with petty politics and false accusations.” Earlier Tuesday, Netanyahu spoke on the phone with Obama, expressing Israel’s concerns over the Iranian nuclear deal and maintaining that the Islamic Republic would obtain nuclear weapons with or without the agreement. “The prime minister emphasized that the deal raises two main dangers: It will allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons — if it keeps to the deal, at the end of the 10-15 years, if it breaks it, before then,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office said. Advertisement “It addition, it will pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the Iranian terror and war machine which threatens Israel and the entire world,” the statement quoted Netanyahu as telling Obama. Obama told the skeptical prime minister that the freshly sealed Iran nuclear deal was in Israel’s “national security interest” and dispatched his secretary of defense to the Jewish state for talks. The White House said Ashton Carter would travel to Israel next week. “The president told the prime minister that today’s agreement on the nuclear issue will not diminish our concerns regarding Iran’s support for terrorism and threats toward Israel,” the White House said. On Tuesday afternoon, Netanyahu slammed the world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran as a “stunning historic mistake,” while maintaining that Israel was under no obligation to adhere to it. “Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran because Iran continues to seek our destruction. We will always defend ourselves,” Netanyahu told foreign media reporters in Jerusalem. The prime minister lashed out at world powers for easing sanctions against the Islamic Republic without requiring it to cease support for militant movements in the region, and for not requiring Tehran to dismantle its facilities as part of the agreement. “By not dismantling Iran’s nuclear program, in a decade this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorism regime the capacity to produce many nuclear bombs; in fact an entire nuclear arsenal, with the means to deliver it,” he said. “What a stunning historic mistake.”

Iran nuclear deal 'historic mistake': Israeli PM People's Daily Online (Xinhua) 17:33, July 14, 2015 JERUSALEM, July 14 -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed on Tuesday the nuclear deal reached between the world powers and Iran, calling it a 'historic mistake.' 'The deal is a bad mistake of historic proportions,' Netanyahu said at the beginning of his meeting with visiting Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders in Jerusalem on Tuesday morning, just after news of the agreement broke out. 'When you are willing to have an agreement at any price, this is the result ... In all fields in which they (P5+1) were supposed to prevent Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons, far-reaching concessions were made,' Netanyahu said. The Israeli prime minister has voiced his objection to the outline of the nuclear talks presented in Lausanne, Switzerland, in April between Iran and the P5+1 countries, China, France, the United States, Britain, Russia plus Germany, and Iran. He said that Iran will also receive hundreds of billions of dollars as a result of the removal of the economic sanctions, which, he claimed, could 'fuel its terror machine' and the Islamic country's aggression across the Middle East. Hitting back on some of his critics in Israel who slammed him for not preventing the agreement, Netanyahu said that he 'couldn't prevent an agreement, as those negotiating were willing to make more and more concessions.' 'We did make an obligation to prevent Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons and we will stick with this commitment,' he added, possibly alluding to a preemptive Israeli airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities which he had hinted at in the past. The P5+1 countries and Iran started negotiating on the latter's nuclear program in mid-2013 and reached an interim agreement, which Netanyahu also referred to as a historic mistake, on November2013. In April, the parties introduced the outline of a final agreement and announced the final deal will be signed by June 30. After two extensions, news broke out on Tuesday morning that a deal has been reached. According to reports, after long negotiations in Vienna, both sides agreed that the international community would remove the economic sanctions on Iran at the start of 2016; if Iran break the agreement, the sanctions would be reinstated within 65 days. Furthermore, the arms embargo on Iran will remain for five years and the Islamic state would allow supervision of all of its nuclear and military sites.

News article:
2009: Iran will become “a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs” The Israeli Prime Minister claimed that the Iranian regime consists of dangerous fanatics and warned against the nuclear armament of these ‘extreme forces.’ 2010: “Iran is, at most, one to three years away from having a breakout nuclear capability” Israel’s appeals to stop Iranian ‘destructive’ activities intensified, raising speculations about a possible military strike against the Islamic Republic. 2011: “The main problem in the Middle East is this tyrannical medieval regime, terrorist regime of Iran” Netanyahu demanded an increase in international pressure on Iran and harsher sanctions. He also blamed the international community for focusing on the Palestine issue and said that the main security challenge in the Middle East is Iran’s “fanatic ideology armed with nuclear weapons”. 2012: Iran is 90 percent of the way to building a bomb and will soon cross the “red line” During his address to the UN General Assembly, mostly known as his “red-line speech”, Netanyahu was holding a cartoon-like picture of a bomb. He drew a red line on the picture signifying the final stage of bomb development and called on the international community to immediately take military action against Iran. 2013: “Iran is building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach the American mainland in a few years” This statement was made by the Israeli Prime Minister during his interview with CBS. The mentioned ‘threat’ was considered a complete exaggeration by an overwhelming majority of experts and labelled as another part of excessive Israeli propaganda. 2014: Iran is “publically calling for the annihilation” of Israel Netanyahu called the Iranian regime “unrepentant” and “unreformed,” arguing that Iran’s main goal is Israel's eradication. 2015: An agreement with Iran is a "mistake of historic proportions" Netanyahu called the latest nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 a mistake of historic proportions. He also stated that Israel is not bound by this agreement and will defend itself in case of Iranian aggression.

2009: Iran will become “a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs” The Israeli Prime Minister claimed that the Iranian regime consists of dangerous fanatics and warned against the nuclear armament of these ‘extreme forces.’ 2010: “Iran is, at most, one to three years away from having a breakout nuclear capability” Israel’s appeals to stop Iranian ‘destructive’ activities intensified, raising speculations about a possible military strike against the Islamic Republic. 2011: “The main problem in the Middle East is this tyrannical medieval regime, terrorist regime of Iran” Netanyahu demanded an increase in international pressure on Iran and harsher sanctions. He also blamed the international community for focusing on the Palestine issue and said that the main security challenge in the Middle East is Iran’s “fanatic ideology armed with nuclear weapons”. 2012: Iran is 90 percent of the way to building a bomb and will soon cross the “red line” During his address to the UN General Assembly, mostly known as his “red-line speech”, Netanyahu was holding a cartoon-like picture of a bomb. He drew a red line on the picture signifying the final stage of bomb development and called on the international community to immediately take military action against Iran. 2013: “Iran is building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach the American mainland in a few years” This statement was made by the Israeli Prime Minister during his interview with CBS. The mentioned ‘threat’ was considered a complete exaggeration by an overwhelming majority of experts and labelled as another part of excessive Israeli propaganda. 2014: Iran is “publically calling for the annihilation” of Israel Netanyahu called the Iranian regime “unrepentant” and “unreformed,” arguing that Iran’s main goal is Israel's eradication. 2015: An agreement with Iran is a "mistake of historic proportions" Netanyahu called the latest nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 a mistake of historic proportions. He also stated that Israel is not bound by this agreement and will defend itself in case of Iranian aggression.

News article:
Israeli lawmakers voiced strong opposition to a landmark nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers Tuesday morning, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning the agreement was “a historic mistake.” Criticism of the deal came from both sides of Israel’s political spectrum as the pact, long feared in Israel as paving Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon, was clinched by the sides after years of talks. “From the initial reports we can already conclude that this agreement is an historic mistake for the world,” Netanyahu said at the start of a meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders. “Far-reaching concessions have been made in all areas that were supposed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability.” Echoing comments he made a day earlier, Netanyahu said the agreement was inevitable when the US was willing to cave to Iranian demands even as Tehran officials led public calls of “Death to America.” “I would like to say here and now – when you are willing to make an agreement at any cost, this is the result.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu, who has lobbied incessantly against the emerging agreement, said he never opposed the deal, but rather Iran’s ability to obtain a nuclear weapon. “We knew very well that the desire to sign an agreement was stronger than anything, and therefore we did not commit to preventing an agreement. We did commit to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and this commitment still stands,” he said. Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely slammed the deal as a “historic agreement of surrender by the West to the axis of evil led by Iran.” Advertisement “The implications of the agreement in the foreseeable future are very bad. Iran will continue sending terror cells in all directions, will continue to inflame the Middle East and worst of all – will take a huge step toward becoming a nuclear threshold state,” Hotovely said. She said that Israel would use any diplomatic means necessary to prevent the confirmation of the agreement by the US Congress. According to diplomats, the deal, which seeks to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief, will place limits on the amount of nuclear work Iran can do over the next 10 to 15 years in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions. It will still need to be ratified by Congress in Washington, and Israeli officials have indicated they will continue to fight for a stronger deal. Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan told Army Radio the “details of the agreement matter little, so long as they [the Iranians] can ultimately acquire nuclear weapons.” Erdan expressed hope that Congress would listen to Israel’s concerns and carefully scrutinize the agreement in the allotted 60 review period. Advertisement Netanyahu called on all Israeli leaders to set aside political differences and unite behind what he called the most fateful issue for Israel’s future and security. Most opposition politicians, though slammed the prime minister’s handling of the US-led diplomatic initiative. Speaking to Israel Radio, Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog said that had Netanyahu not feuded with the Obama administration, Israel would be receiving a military assistance package as “compensation” for the deal. “If you go to a deal, as bad as it may be, the way to minimize its damage is by arriving at an agreement with the US on a very significant security package,” Herzog said, pointing to similar agreements negotiated by the US-aligned Sunni Gulf states. “Israel is avoiding doing this and is not negotiating with the US.” Zionist Union co-chair Tzipi Livni lamented the fact that Israel had no influence on the terms of the deal. It is “a dramatic agreement, and Israel is not there,” she said. “If anything is clear it is that Netanyahu is ineffective,” she said. While criticizing the deal, opposition politicians seemed to rule out working with the coalition to thwart it. “The Labor Party must not be a partner to the attempts to circumvent the US administration by way of Congress. It has become undoubtedly clear that the bitter confrontation with the Americans was an utter failure that will be taught in history books,” said Zionist Union MK Shelly Yachimovich, a member of the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Advertisement Former foreign minister and Yisrael Beytenu MK Avigdor Liberman, also in the opposition, likened the deal to the infamous 1938 agreement that appeased Nazi Germany and the US’s nuclear disarmament agreement with North Korea. The deal to be announced in Vienna Tuesday is a “complete capitulation to terrorism,” he said. “A black flag waves over this agreement and it will be remembered as a black day for the free world,” Liberman added. Calling the deal a danger for the entire free world, Technology Minister Danny Danon said the money the agreement will bring Iran will “fuel terrorism in the streets of Jerusalem, Washington and London.” The Likud lawmaker called on Israel’s allies to reject the agreement. Likud Minister of Tourism Yariv Levin lambasted what he called “a very bad agreement, setting a path that in ten years will allow Iran to have a large arsenal of nuclear weapons with the approval and consent of world powers.” Levin said the agreement would enable Tehran to continue its support of terrorism across the region. Likud Minister Miri Regev said the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers gives the Islamic Republic a “license to kill.” Regev called the deal “bad for the free world (and) bad for humanity,” and said lobbying against the deal reached in Vienna should continue.

News article:
Israel Rejects, UN Hails Nuclear Deal by VOA News July 14, 2015 The news that major world powers and Iran reached a historic deal aimed at ensuring that Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb was met with condemnation by Israel but hailed by the United Nations and Tehran's regional neighbors. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Tuesday's nuclear deal with Iran 'stunning historic mistake.' Netanyahu, speaking in English to reporters in Jerusalem said his country is not bound by the international nuclear pact with Iran and that Israel reserves the right to defend itself. 'Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran, and Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran because Iran continues to seek our destruction,' Netanyahu told reporters. Israel's first course of action looks to be an intense lobbying effort in the U.S. Congress to oppose the deal. 'Historic agreement' United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated negotiators in Vienna on finalizing an agreement in a statement Tuesday. 'I warmly welcome the historic agreement in Vienna today and congratulate the P5+1 and Iran for reaching this agreement. This is testament to the value of dialogue,' Ban said in the statement. 'I hope – and indeed believe – that this agreement will lead to greater mutual understanding and cooperation on the many serious security challenges in the Middle East. As such it could serve as a vital contribution to peace and stability both in the region and beyond,' the statement said. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin said, with the nuclear agreement, the world can breathe a sigh of relief, and that the negotiating countries made hard choices for stability and cooperation. The European Union hailed it as a new chapter of hope for the world. Regional governments The ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, sent a note of congratulations to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani Tuesday, the UAE's official news agency WAM reported. The statement contained the first official comment by Gulf Arab countries toward a deal many of them privately fear will encourage Iran to back their enemies across the Middle East more forcefully. The Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan governments released statements welcoming the nuclear agreement. The spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the nuclear deal will be 'a catalyst for regional stability.' Saad al-Hadithi said the agreement, designed to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, is 'an important step' and will lead to better unity in the fight against terrorism. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in a statement, 'welcomed any efforts that result in expansion of political and economic relations between states as well as consolidation and strengthening of peace and stability in the region.' Pakistan, in a statement, said it 'has consistently maintained that the Iran nuclear issue should be peacefully resolved through dialogue. As a neighboring country, we have also reiterated that reciprocal confidence-building measures relating to Iran's nuclear program auger well for peace and security in our region.' Pakistani defense analyst Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general, told Islamabad PTV News the agreement 'will bring an extraordinary change. Its positive effects will include improvement in relations between Iran and the Western world, particularly the United States, and gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on it. 'Moreover ... it is also likely to change the balance of power between Iran and the Arab countries in the Middle East, something Iran has been striving for,' Masood said. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, whose government has received military and financial support during from Tehran during its four-year civil war, praised the agreement. Widely criticized in Israel However, reaction was critical across the political spectrum in Israel, where concern is high the country's arch enemy has duped the world and will acquire nuclear weapons to use against Israel. Iran already backs militant groups that attack Israel and its leaders frequently have referred to Israel's destruction in the past. Netanyahu has been at the forefront of global opposition to the deal and has openly clashed with the Obama administration and other Western powers that have been pushing for an easing of sanctions in return for greater restrictions on its nuclear program. Speaking in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israel's 'concern is that the militant Islamic state of Iran is going to receive a short path to nuclear weapons. 'Many of the restrictions that were supposed to prevent it from getting there will be lifted. And, in addition, Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza, of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world,' he added. He concluded by saying Israel would continue to have to defend its way of life, freedoms and security. Israel received an official copy of the Iran nuclear agreement Tuesday, according to the Haaretz website. 'Lies and deciet' On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon told The Jerusalem Post that the agreement was built on 'lies and deceit.' Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said Israel 'will employ all diplomatic means to prevent confirmation of the agreement.' Netanyahu's coalition partners angrily criticized Tuesday's agreement. Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads the hawkish Jewish Home party, said July 14 will be remembered a 'dark day for the free world.' Cabinet Minister Miri Regev said the agreement gave Iran a 'license to kill.' The cascade of criticism crossed party lines, reflecting the widespread opposition to the deal in Israel. 'This is a regime based in deceit, and now they are going to do what they did for the last 20 years, which is trying to get themselves nuclear weapons behind the back of the world,' Yair Lapid, the head of the opposition Yesh Atid Party, told The Associated Press. 'Now they are going to do it with the help of the international community.' 'Nuclear route' At Tel Aviv's Institute for National Security Studies, Emily Landau, the head of its arms control and regional security program said Tuesday that 'if there's a sense in the region that the international actors ... have not provided mechanisms for preventing [Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons], then definitely there will be additional motivation in the region to go down the nuclear route.' Noting that acquiring nuclear weapons capability is 'irreversible,' she added that the 'sunset provision' allowing the agreement to expire after some years would allow Iran eventually to pursue legally a nuclear weapons program. Finally, Landau said the accord "does not change the Iranian narrative," which is to expand its status and influence across and beyond the Middle East.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday evening spoke on the phone with US President Barack Obama, expressing Israel’s concerns over the Iranian nuclear deal and maintaining that the Islamic Republic will obtain nuclear weapons with or without the agreement. “The prime minister emphasized that the deal raises two main dangers: It will allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons — if it keeps to the deal, at the end of the 10-15 years; if it breaks it, before then,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office said. “In addition, it will pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the Iranian terror and war machine which threatens Israel and the entire world,” the statement quoted Netanyahu as telling Obama. Obama told a skeptical Netanyahu that the freshly sealed Iran nuclear deal was in Israel’s “national security interest” and dispatched his secretary of defense to the Jewish state for talks. The White House said Ashton Carter would travel to Israel next week. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The president told the prime minister that today’s agreement on the nuclear issue will not diminish our concerns regarding Iran’s support for terrorism and threats toward Israel,” the White House said. Earlier, Netanyahu slammed the world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran as a “stunning historic mistake,” while maintaining that Israel was under no obligation to adhere to it. “Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran because Iran continues to seek our destruction. We will always defend ourselves,” Netanyahu told foreign media reporters in Jerusalem. Advertisement The prime minister lashed out at world powers for easing sanctions against the Islamic Republic without requiring it to cease support for militant movements in the region, and for not requiring Tehran to dismantle its facilities as part of the agreement. “By not dismantling Iran’s nuclear program, in a decade this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorism regime the capacity to produce many nuclear bombs; in fact an entire nuclear arsenal, with the means to deliver it,” he said. “What a stunning historic mistake.” Netanyahu said world powers were “gambling” that Iran would change in the coming decade, “while removing any incentive to do so.” The deal “will reward Iran… with hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said. This “cash bonanza will fuel Iran’s terrorism worldwide, its aggression in the region, and its efforts to destroy Israel, which are ongoing.” The prime minister also maintained that the nuclear agreement “repeats the mistakes made with North Korea.” “And we all know how that ended,” he added wryly, referring to Pyongyang’s attainment of a military nuclear capacity. Advertisement Meanwhile, a US administration official said Tuesday that a UN Security Council resolution setting out timelines for Iran’s compliance with the deal could be introduced soon. The US-drafted resolution will come “probably as soon as next week” and already has the backing of UN veto-wielding members who took part in the Iran talks, the official said. The resolution is expected to authorize economic retaliation in response to any breach of the deal, but will likely stop short of any reference to military consequences. However, another senior administration official, also on condition of anonymity, did not rule out the possibility of US military action as a last resort. “Our clear preference is to resolve this diplomatically,” the official said. “Going forward, this or any future US president would have any option available to them including military action, if they felt that was necessary. “If Iran is complying with this deal we certainly believe that would not be necessary to address the nuclear issue,” the official said.

Earlier, Netanyahu slammed the world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran as a “stunning historic mistake,” while maintaining that Israel was under no obligation to adhere to it. “Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran because Iran continues to seek our destruction. We will always defend ourselves,” Netanyahu told foreign media reporters in Jerusalem. Advertisement The prime minister lashed out at world powers for easing sanctions against the Islamic Republic without requiring it to cease support for militant movements in the region, and for not requiring Tehran to dismantle its facilities as part of the agreement. “By not dismantling Iran’s nuclear program, in a decade this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorism regime the capacity to produce many nuclear bombs; in fact an entire nuclear arsenal, with the means to deliver it,” he said. “What a stunning historic mistake.” Netanyahu said world powers were “gambling” that Iran would change in the coming decade, “while removing any incentive to do so.” The deal “will reward Iran… with hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said. This “cash bonanza will fuel Iran’s terrorism worldwide, its aggression in the region, and its efforts to destroy Israel, which are ongoing.” The prime minister also maintained that the nuclear agreement “repeats the mistakes made with North Korea.” “And we all know how that ended,” he added wryly, referring to Pyongyang’s attainment of a military nuclear capacity. Advertisement Meanwhile, a US administration official said Tuesday that a UN Security Council resolution setting out timelines for Iran’s compliance with the deal could be introduced soon. The US-drafted resolution will come “probably as soon as next week” and already has the backing of UN veto-wielding members who took part in the Iran talks, the official said. The resolution is expected to authorize economic retaliation in response to any breach of the deal, but will likely stop short of any reference to military consequences. However, another senior administration official, also on condition of anonymity, did not rule out the possibility of US military action as a last resort. “Our clear preference is to resolve this diplomatically,” the official said. “Going forward, this or any future US president would have any option available to them including military action, if they felt that was necessary. “If Iran is complying with this deal we certainly believe that would not be necessary to address the nuclear issue,” the official said.

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli officials came out swinging against a nuclear deal with Iran even before any official announcement Tuesday. "Iran is going to receive a sure path to nuclear weapons," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before a meeting in Jerusalem. "Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world. This is a bad mistake of historic proportions." On Twitter, he added that Israel remained determined to stop Iran from developing a nuclear arsenal. "Giving the world's largest supporter of terrorism a free pass in developing nuclear weapons is like providing a pyromaniac with matches" "We knew that the will to sign an agreement is stronger than anything and that's why we never committed ourselves to stopping it," he said in Hebrew. "We did commit ourselves to stop Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons and that commitment still holds on." Netanyahu contends that Iran cannot be trusted with any sort of nuclear program, and says Tehran must be made to stop supporting militancy throughout the region. In March, he delivered a scathing speech to the U.S. Congress in an attempt to derail the process. Speaking to the Knesset on Monday, Netanyahu referred to huge marches held in Iran to celebrate Al-Quds day, a holiday in support of Palestinians, on July 10. "As Iran continued to receive more and more concessions at the negotiating table, Iranian President [Hassan] Rouhani led a march of hatred in the streets of Tehran in which the masses cried, 'Death to America! Death to Israel!'" he said. Iranian demonstrators burn symbolic structures depicting the flags of the U.S., Britain and Israel during a rally marking Al-Quds Day in Tehran on July 10. TIMA / Reuters Moshe Yaalon, the country's defense minister, condemned the deal and said it nade Iran more dangerous. "This agreement is a tragedy for all who aspire for regional stability and fear a nuclear Iran," he said in a tweet. "Instead of fighting terror with all its might, the free world has granted legitimacy to Iran's hateful, murderous ways." Israel's minister of science, technology and space, Danny Danon, also came out against the agreement. "We are disappointed, and very concerned, with the deal reached in Vienna. This agreement is not just bad for Israel, it's dangerous for the entire free world," he said. "Giving the world's largest supporter of terrorism a free pass in developing nuclear weapons is like providing a pyromaniac with matches." Danon added: "The money that is about to flow into Iran will undoubtedly be used to fund terrorism throughout the region, and the world." Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely tweeted that the "agreement is a capitulation of historic proportions by the West to the Iran-led axis of evil." Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett described the deal as an "eternal shame." "A state that has announced these days its aim to eliminate the State of Israel, stands to receive legitimacy to be a nuclear power," he said in the Knesset on Monday. Iran's increasing aggression is more dangerous than that of ISIS, and the true goal of this aggression in the end is to take over the world. — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) July 8, 2015 "Citizens of the Western world must understand: An agreement is going to be signed that will transfer half a trillion dollars to a new terrorist superpower, they are going to sign an agreement with the world's most dangerous country, and they are doing so with a country that wants to openly destroy nations and peoples." The Associated Press quoted Israeli Cabinet minister Miri Regev as saying the nuclear deal gives the Islamic Republic a "license to kill." Regev, a former military spokeswoman who serves as Israel's culture and sports minister, said Tuesday that the deal was "bad for the free world (and) bad for humanity." Saudi Arabia, another close American ally and an Iranian rival, has also opposed the deal but did not immediately issue a statement.

News article:
TEL AVIV (JTA) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decried an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program hundreds of times — most notably in a March speech to a joint session of Congress. Now that the agreement is signed, experts say Netanyahu has one way left to block it: Go to Congress again and persuade it to reject the deal. The agreement finalized Tuesday morning in Vienna will relieve Iran of crippling international sanctions in return for Iran limiting its uranium enrichment, ridding most of its stockpile of enriched uranium and submitting to agreed-upon inspections of its nuclear facilities. The deal stipulates that Iran freeze and store — but not dismantle — much of its nuclear infrastructure, and requires inspectors to request access to some Iranian facilities before entering. Sanctions are set to be lifted once Iran fulfills its commitments to deactivate centrifuges, restructure its nuclear facilities and transfer or dilute its uranium stockpile. Sanctions could be restored within 65 days if a committee of representatives from world powers and Iran determines that Iran has violated the agreement. Portions of the accord will expire between 10 and 25 years from the date the accord is adopted. The United Nations Security Council is expected to endorse the accord in a resolution. Netanyahu has made opposing Iran’s nuclear program the defining issue of his premiership, and has consistently criticized the potential agreement since negotiations began in 2013. On Tuesday, at a meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders ahead of the accord’s announcement, he called the agreement a “historic mistake for the world.” READ: Spoilers alert: Six guys to watch the day after an Iran deal “Far-reaching concessions have been made in all areas that were supposed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability,” Netanyahu said at a news conference. “In addition, Iran will receive hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its expansion and aggression throughout the Middle East and across the globe.” The agreement also was criticized by Israeli opposition leaders, and the Israeli public has long been skeptical of a deal. In February, an Israel Democracy Institute poll found that 61 percent of Jewish-Israelis thought President Barack Obama would sign a deal even if the Israeli government said it harms Israel’s security. Yair Lapid, chairman of the opposition centrist Yesh Atid party, said Israel should concentrate its criticism on the provision for inspecting Iran’s nuclear facilities. “We should focus on the inspections regime, which is the Achilles’ heel; it’s the weakest part of the deal,” Lapid said in a statement Monday. “I started discussing the issue during my visit to Washington last month and they’re willing to listen.” The only thing standing in the way of the deal’s implementation now is a vote in Congress. Senators and congressmen will have two months to parse the deal’s details, and will vote to accept or reject it when Congress reconvenes in September. Obama has promised to veto a rejection, and overriding that veto would require a two-thirds majority in both houses. That, analysts say, is what Israel’s government will lobby for. Jonathan Rynhold, a senior research associate at Bar-Ilan University’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, said Israel will need to build a broad coalition of the deal’s opponents — including former members of the Obama administration — if it is to convince enough lawmakers to reject the deal. “Israel can’t do this on its own, but if there’s a coalition of people who for their own reasons think it’s a bad deal, that could change things,” he said. “You’ve seen criticism by other people who used to be involved in policymaking by Obama.” Republicans have staunchly opposed a deal. But while some Democrats have also voiced skepticism about the agreement, reaching two-thirds would mean convincing a sizable chunk of the party to oppose its president’s signature foreign policy initiative. “The question is how much the Democrats will be willing to debate with the president,” said Ephraim Kam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies. “The Republicans will be able to debate. They don’t like the president, don’t like the agreement. The Democrats won’t want to come out against the president even if they don’t like the agreement.” Some experts said that Netanyahu’s March speech before Congress damaged the effort to fight the deal by forcing Democratic members of Congress to choose between backing Israel and supporting Obama. But Ephraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center, said that the speech may have helped galvanize opposition to the agreement by spelling out the dangers it poses. “I think Obama’s policy gave presence to Netanyahu’s speech,” he said. “They gave it a lot of attention, he got a lot of attention, and his claims sounded sensible in public opinion. Should the effort in Congress fail, some Israeli politicians have declared that there’s only one avenue left to prevent a nuclear Iran: a military strike. Netanyahu has floated the threat of a strike for years, saying that Israel has the right to defend itself by itself. Warnings of a strike built up until the nuclear talks began in 2013. Once America was engaged in negotiations with Iran, talks of an Israeli strike subsided somewhat. But now that America has signed the agreement, Lapid again hinted at the possibility of bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities. READ: Israeli leaders, some Jewish groups condemn final Iran nuclear deal “If it is signed, the world needs to know Israel holds all the options,” Lapid told JTA last week. “We need to understand what all the options are. Israel can’t allow a nuclear Iran.” Experts have assessed that an Israeli strike on Iran would not be able to destroy its nuclear program. And Kam said that Israel would be hard-pressed to launch a strike against the backdrop of a deal supported by the world’s major powers. “I think it’s in the fridge,” he said of plans for a strike. “It’s not an option right now. To go militarily against an agreement that’s initiated by the great powers is a tough move. It’s not impossible, but it’s hard.” But Inbar said a strike has grown more likely, as the deal has left Iran with the capability to enrich uranium, giving it the ability to produce a bomb. If that happens, he said, Israel will have no choice but to strike. “It obligates us to a path of military attack,” he said. “The Americans don’t care about our interests. There’s no choice. We can’t wait.”

Israeli leaders, and Jewish groups condemned the final Iran nuclear deal announced Tuesday. “When you are willing to make an agreement at any cost, this is the result,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday morning, before the details were officially announced. “From the initial reports we can already conclude that this agreement is an historic mistake for the world.” “We knew very well that the desire to sign an agreement was stronger than anything, and therefore we did not commit to preventing an agreement. We did commit to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and this commitment still stands,” Netanyahu said, calling on Israeli leaders to “put petty politics aside and unite behind this most fateful issue to the future and security of the State of Israel.” Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon called the deal an agreement “built on lies and deceit.” “This agreement is a tragedy for all who aspire for regional stability and fear a nuclear Iran,” Yaalon said. “Instead of fighting terror with all its might, the free world has granted legitimacy to Iran’s hateful, murderous ways.” He added that with the signing of the agreement and the lifting of sanctions, “massive funds will be funneled into the Iranian terror accounts.” The combined Arab-Israeli political party, the Joint Arab list, praised the deal as “the victory of the will of the Iranian people in their struggle against the blockade and sanctions imposed on them.” The statement issued by the party said the prime minister’s “aggressive rhetoric of incitement and hostility against the Iran deal under the pretext of the ‘Iranian threat’ are indicative of his imperialist and colonialist outlook.” World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder in a statement pointed out that Iran has failed in the past to live up to its treaty obligations. “I fear we may have entered into an agreement that revives the Iranian economy but won’t stop this regime from developing nuclear arms in the long term, which would have disastrous consequences for the entire region and the world,” he said, calling the agreement ” just a piece of paper,” and “not a legally binding treaty.” The American Jewish Committee praised the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the other government officials that “turned (President Obama’s) vision into a reality.” “It is now incumbent on the United States Congress, pursuant to the provisions of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, to thoroughly review, debate, and, ultimately, vote it up or down,” said AJC Executive Director David Harris, in a statement. “However Congress decides to vote on the nuclear deal,” Harris added, “the need for vigilance regarding Iran will not for a single moment be diminished.” The European Friends of Israel called on European Union officials and the governments of the EU states “to speak out against this dangerous deal, which also represents a direct threat to the EU and the national security of European citizens.” The group called the deal “a clear, unmistakable surrender to Iran by the West, including the EU, which was a key member of the negotiations.” All of the groups expressed concern over repeated calls in Iran, including in recent days, for the annihilation of Israel and “death to America.” The Jewish Voice for Peace applauded the deal, saying in a statement that “a negotiated agreement is the only way to alleviate international concern about Iran’s nuclear program and avert war.”

We did commit to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and this commitment still stands,” Netanyahu said, calling on Israeli leaders to “put petty politics aside and unite behind this most fateful issue to the future and security of the State of Israel.” Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon called the deal an agreement “built on lies and deceit.” “This agreement is a tragedy for all who aspire for regional stability and fear a nuclear Iran,” Yaalon said. “Instead of fighting terror with all its might, the free world has granted legitimacy to Iran’s hateful, murderous ways.” He added that with the signing of the agreement and the lifting of sanctions, “massive funds will be funneled into the Iranian terror accounts.” The combined Arab-Israeli political party, the Joint Arab list, praised the deal as “the victory of the will of the Iranian people in their struggle against the blockade and sanctions imposed on them.” The statement issued by the party said the prime minister’s “aggressive rhetoric of incitement and hostility against the Iran deal under the pretext of the ‘Iranian threat’ are indicative of his imperialist and colonialist outlook.” World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder in a statement pointed out that Iran has failed in the past to live up to its treaty obligations. “I fear we may have entered into an agreement that revives the Iranian economy but won’t stop this regime from developing nuclear arms in the long term, which would have disastrous consequences for the entire region and the world,” he said, calling the agreement ” just a piece of paper,” and “not a legally binding treaty.” The American Jewish Committee praised the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the other government officials that “turned (President Obama’s) vision into a reality.” “It is now incumbent on the United States Congress, pursuant to the provisions of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, to thoroughly review, debate, and, ultimately, vote it up or down,” said AJC Executive Director David Harris, in a statement. “However Congress decides to vote on the nuclear deal,” Harris added, “the need for vigilance regarding Iran will not for a single moment be diminished.” The European Friends of Israel called on European Union officials and the governments of the EU states “to speak out against this dangerous deal, which also represents a direct threat to the EU and the national security of European citizens.” The group called the deal “a clear, unmistakable surrender to Iran by the West, including the EU, which was a key member of the negotiations.” All of the groups expressed concern over repeated calls in Iran, including in recent days, for the annihilation of Israel and “death to America.” The Jewish Voice for Peace applauded the deal, saying in a statement that “a negotiated agreement is the only way to alleviate international concern about Iran’s nuclear program and avert war.”

TEL AVIV (JTA) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lambasted the accord between Iran and world powers limiting Iran’s nuclear program, calling it a “stunning historic mistake.” Netanyahu, who has vehemently opposed the accord since negotiations between the parties began in 2013, said Tuesday in Jerusalem that “the world is a much more dangerous place today than it was yesterday” due to the agreement. The deal would remove international sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran freezing and storing much of its nuclear infrastructure, ridding much of its stockpile of enriched uranium and converting its nuclear facilities. “The international community is removing the sanctions, and Iran is keeping its nuclear program,” Netanyahu said at a news conference, referencing an earlier statement by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. “By not dismantling Iran’s nuclear program, in a decade this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorist regime the capacity to develop many nuclear bombs.” Netanyahu said Israel remains committed to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that the agreement will not limit Israel’s actions. “Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran because Iran continues to seek our destruction,” he said. “We will always defend ourselves.” Netanyahu compared the agreement to an accord signed between world powers and North Korea meant to limit that country’s nuclear program. In 2006, North Korea tested a nuclear weapon. “Iran’s support for terror and subversion will actually increase after the deal,” he said. “This deal repeats the mistakes made with North Korea. There, too, we were assured that inspections and verifications would prevent a rogue regime from developing nuclear weapons. We all know how that ended.” The prime minister also accused world powers of mistakenly assuming that Iran’s theocratic regime would fall by the time some provisions of the deal expire in a decade. He said the deal makes regime change less likely by empowering Iran’s current leadership. “They gambled that in 10 years’ time, Iran’s terrorist regime will change while removing any incentive for it to do so,” Netanyahu said. “In fact, the deal gives Iran every incentive not to change.”

BERLIN - German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier criticized Israel's opposition to a nuclear deal agreed by six world powers and Iran, saying the agreement will help contribute to security in the Middle East. "This is a responsible deal and Israel should also take a closer look at it and not criticize the agreement in a very coarse way," Steinmeier told German broadcaster ARD in an interview on Tuesday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the deal as a "stunning, historic mistake" and said it would enable Iran to pursue a path to nuclear weapons. But Steinmeier said the basis for the agreement was transparency and the ability to monitor Iran's compliance. "In the agreement, Iran has to commit to these monitoring possibilities. And we will make sure that the monitoring possibilities are also observed after this deal," he said.

News article:
July 14, 2015 The whole world speaks of a historical agreement with Iran, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks today, July 14, of a "historical mistake for the world." Netanyahu used this same terminology many times in the past. On July 12, the prime minister of a state the size of New Jersey, tiny Israel, announced, “We will not accept” the surrender to Iran by the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, and also the leadership of the European Union's 28 members. At the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu accused the world powers of capitulating to Iran and ignoring its incessant calls for the destruction of the state of Israel. Indeed, an Israeli leader has no right to accept a plan to destroy the Jewish state. When the prime minister announces that the agreement with Iran hastens Israel’s demise, he cannot make do with a statement to the media. He must leave no stone unturned in order to remove this threat. The Lausanne understandings and the emerging agreement being formulated in Vienna indicate that the verbal slings and arrows Netanyahu fired at the White House from the congressional podium on March 3 did not affect the negotiating powers. Now he is preparing to lash out in every direction, David against a company of Goliaths. There’s no telling whether this time David will gain the upper hand. Assuming that “we will not accept” does not include a military attack on Iran or the elimination of nuclear scientists on its territory — after it signed an agreement with the six major powers — the only way to carry out such a mission is to line up a large majority in the US Congress to override a presidential veto. There’s no secret which of the two American parties the prime minister favors. In the last US presidential elections he made no attempt to hide his support for President Barack Obama’s rivals. And so far, there is no sign of him changing his position. Despite the attempts by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to toe the right-leaning line of the US Jewish community, it’s safe to assume that Netanyahu will bestow his favors on the Republican candidate. After all, it was the Republicans who arranged for him to speak in front of the two houses. Surely he would prefer to see another name — Bush, for instance — gracing the White House door over Clinton. At that same Cabinet meeting at which he promised that Israel would not stand for a capitulation to Iran, Netanyahu sent the Democrats a taste of the cocktail he’s mixing for their candidate at the next elections if they don't assist the Republicans with the necessary votes to topple the agreement with Iran. He played for his ministers, the media was quick to learn, a 1994 video clip in which former President Bill Clinton is heard patting himself on the back for the framework agreement he reached at the time with North Korea on its nuclear program. The Democratic president promised to great fanfare that the agreement would “make the world a safer place.” In 2013, the US Defense Intelligence Agency issued a classified report according to which North Korea can, in all likelihood, arm a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead. Netanyahu is right; Clinton's expectations of North Korea were exaggerated. There’s no doubt North Korea continues to flout the will of the world and to hold nuclear weapons. What Netanyahu forgot or did not want to say is that there was another president who took seriously the word of a dictatorial regime regarding nuclear weapons. He was not a Democratic president who recoiled from using force. In February 2007, President George W. Bush took great pleasure in the success of negotiations with North Korea that culminated in its commitment to seal its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon within 60 days and to submit to international inspections at the site. Bush said at the time that the talks provide "the best opportunity to use diplomacy to address North Korea's nuclear programs." White House spokesman Tony Snow calmed skeptics, saying that if Korea fails to abide by the agreement, “There is still a possibility of sanctions through the international community.” Sound familiar? If Netanyahu had by his side a seasoned foreign minister to provide some balance, he might have warned him against his continued crude interference in American politics. Had he not surrounded himself with yes-men, someone might perhaps have told Netanyahu that his threat to “not accept” the actions of the world powers makes the same impression on them as the threat of a tail to stop wagging a dog. But there’s no one of stature by Netanyahu’s side to challenge his foreign policy and his conduct toward the international community. During his previous term as prime minister, Netanyahu named settler Avigdor Liberman, the most abrasive politician in the Knesset, as Israel’s top diplomat. During his current term, Netanyahu kept the foreign service for himself and named Tzipi Hotovely as his deputy minister, so that she could tell Israel’s diplomats that God gave the Jewish people the whole of the Land of Israel. Between dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue and managing his bare-bones coalition, the prime minister has to run his other ministries — the Health Ministry, the Ministry of Communication and the Ministry for Regional Cooperation. Netanyahu keeps all of these portfolios for himself mainly to maintain the possibility of enlarging the coalition in the future. The extra portfolios could then be delegated to new coalition partners. Associate Chief Justice Elyakim Rubinstein, who was in the past appointed Cabinet secretary by Likud Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and served from 1986 to 1994, said last week that holding many ministerial portfolios could interfere with Netanyahu’s performance. At a Supreme Court hearing on July 7 on a petition submitted by Yesh Atid against Netanyahu for holding the health portfolio, Rubinstein asked the state’s representative, “Who is truly in charge of health? You said the prime minister has Iran, and defense, and foreign affairs, and communications and a few others. So someone has to be in charge. Who’s in charge?” Attorney Yisrael Maimon, who served as Cabinet secretary between 2003 and 2007 during the second Sharon government and the Olmert government, told Al-Monitor on July 12, “The job of prime minister, especially in a country as challenging as Israel, requires that the captain deals with issues which he regards as being at the top of the national agenda, and that’s how his schedule is run.” Maimon said that having to head many ministries places an extreme burden on the prime minister and his staff. “Even without having to deal with the issues of other ministries, the prime minister faces many and complex tasks,” he noted. The defeat in the campaign to foil the Iranian plot to destroy Israel, as Netanyahu claims, will bear his name. The man who chose to personally lead one of the most difficult and intricate diplomatic missions that Israel has undertaken since its inception — if not the most difficult and intricate of them all — will bear sole responsibility for its failure. But we will all pay the price for the deep erosion in the estimation of Israel’s international influence and of the wisdom of its leaders.

News article:
July 14, 2015 The whole world speaks of a historical agreement with Iran, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks today, July 14, of a "historical mistake for the world." Netanyahu used this same terminology many times in the past. On July 12, the prime minister of a state the size of New Jersey, tiny Israel, announced, “We will not accept” the surrender to Iran by the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, and also the leadership of the European Union's 28 members. At the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu accused the world powers of capitulating to Iran and ignoring its incessant calls for the destruction of the state of Israel. Indeed, an Israeli leader has no right to accept a plan to destroy the Jewish state. When the prime minister announces that the agreement with Iran hastens Israel’s demise, he cannot make do with a statement to the media. He must leave no stone unturned in order to remove this threat. The Lausanne understandings and the emerging agreement being formulated in Vienna indicate that the verbal slings and arrows Netanyahu fired at the White House from the congressional podium on March 3 did not affect the negotiating powers. Now he is preparing to lash out in every direction, David against a company of Goliaths. There’s no telling whether this time David will gain the upper hand. Assuming that “we will not accept” does not include a military attack on Iran or the elimination of nuclear scientists on its territory — after it signed an agreement with the six major powers — the only way to carry out such a mission is to line up a large majority in the US Congress to override a presidential veto. There’s no secret which of the two American parties the prime minister favors. In the last US presidential elections he made no attempt to hide his support for President Barack Obama’s rivals. And so far, there is no sign of him changing his position. Despite the attempts by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to toe the right-leaning line of the US Jewish community, it’s safe to assume that Netanyahu will bestow his favors on the Republican candidate. After all, it was the Republicans who arranged for him to speak in front of the two houses. Surely he would prefer to see another name — Bush, for instance — gracing the White House door over Clinton. At that same Cabinet meeting at which he promised that Israel would not stand for a capitulation to Iran, Netanyahu sent the Democrats a taste of the cocktail he’s mixing for their candidate at the next elections if they don't assist the Republicans with the necessary votes to topple the agreement with Iran. He played for his ministers, the media was quick to learn, a 1994 video clip in which former President Bill Clinton is heard patting himself on the back for the framework agreement he reached at the time with North Korea on its nuclear program. The Democratic president promised to great fanfare that the agreement would “make the world a safer place.” In 2013, the US Defense Intelligence Agency issued a classified report according to which North Korea can, in all likelihood, arm a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead. Netanyahu is right; Clinton's expectations of North Korea were exaggerated. There’s no doubt North Korea continues to flout the will of the world and to hold nuclear weapons. What Netanyahu forgot or did not want to say is that there was another president who took seriously the word of a dictatorial regime regarding nuclear weapons. He was not a Democratic president who recoiled from using force. In February 2007, President George W. Bush took great pleasure in the success of negotiations with North Korea that culminated in its commitment to seal its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon within 60 days and to submit to international inspections at the site. Bush said at the time that the talks provide "the best opportunity to use diplomacy to address North Korea's nuclear programs." White House spokesman Tony Snow calmed skeptics, saying that if Korea fails to abide by the agreement, “There is still a possibility of sanctions through the international community.” Sound familiar? If Netanyahu had by his side a seasoned foreign minister to provide some balance, he might have warned him against his continued crude interference in American politics. Had he not surrounded himself with yes-men, someone might perhaps have told Netanyahu that his threat to “not accept” the actions of the world powers makes the same impression on them as the threat of a tail to stop wagging a dog. But there’s no one of stature by Netanyahu’s side to challenge his foreign policy and his conduct toward the international community. During his previous term as prime minister, Netanyahu named settler Avigdor Liberman, the most abrasive politician in the Knesset, as Israel’s top diplomat. During his current term, Netanyahu kept the foreign service for himself and named Tzipi Hotovely as his deputy minister, so that she could tell Israel’s diplomats that God gave the Jewish people the whole of the Land of Israel. Between dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue and managing his bare-bones coalition, the prime minister has to run his other ministries — the Health Ministry, the Ministry of Communication and the Ministry for Regional Cooperation. Netanyahu keeps all of these portfolios for himself mainly to maintain the possibility of enlarging the coalition in the future. The extra portfolios could then be delegated to new coalition partners. Associate Chief Justice Elyakim Rubinstein, who was in the past appointed Cabinet secretary by Likud Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and served from 1986 to 1994, said last week that holding many ministerial portfolios could interfere with Netanyahu’s performance. At a Supreme Court hearing on July 7 on a petition submitted by Yesh Atid against Netanyahu for holding the health portfolio, Rubinstein asked the state’s representative, “Who is truly in charge of health? You said the prime minister has Iran, and defense, and foreign affairs, and communications and a few others. So someone has to be in charge. Who’s in charge?” Attorney Yisrael Maimon, who served as Cabinet secretary between 2003 and 2007 during the second Sharon government and the Olmert government, told Al-Monitor on July 12, “The job of prime minister, especially in a country as challenging as Israel, requires that the captain deals with issues which he regards as being at the top of the national agenda, and that’s how his schedule is run.” Maimon said that having to head many ministries places an extreme burden on the prime minister and his staff. “Even without having to deal with the issues of other ministries, the prime minister faces many and complex tasks,” he noted. The defeat in the campaign to foil the Iranian plot to destroy Israel, as Netanyahu claims, will bear his name. The man who chose to personally lead one of the most difficult and intricate diplomatic missions that Israel has undertaken since its inception — if not the most difficult and intricate of them all — will bear sole responsibility for its failure. But we will all pay the price for the deep erosion in the estimation of Israel’s international influence and of the wisdom of its leaders.

News article:
Josh Block, CEO and President of The Israel Project, issued the following statement in response to today’s announced nuclear agreement with Iran. The Israel Project publishes The Tower. Today’s announcement of this nuclear agreement with Iran is a realization of the deepest fears and the most dire predictions of skeptics who have, for two years, been warning against exactly this outcome — a bad deal that both enriches this tyrannical regime and fails to strip Iran of nuclear weapons capability. The deal will give Iran billions in cash and sanctions relief to fuel its terror and war machines, shred the hard-won sanctions regime beyond repair, and enable the Iranians to get away with hiding the full extent of their nuclear work, infrastructure, and know-how. It will not have an enforceable inspections regime or a workable way to re-impose pressure on Iran when it cheats. And then, after just over a decade, most of this deal will expire, and Iran will be allowed to have a full-blown nuclear program– a screw’s turn away from a nuclear weapon. It is important to ask: if a 3-month nuclear breakout by Iran is a problem today, why are we giving the Mullah’s in Tehran hundreds of billions of dollars, all so Iran will have a zero break out time, according to President Obama himself, in just over a decade? Iran’s repressive regime needs economic relief far more than we need an agreement by these terms. Prior to this round of talks in September 2013, Iran was six-months from a balance of payments crisis and total economic calamity. Rather than leveraging that pressure to stop Iran and dismantle its program, President Obama relieved it prematurely in order to secure an agreement that will midwife an era of nuclear terror and tyranny, at the expense of freedom, human rights, and American national security. At the beginning of these talks, President Obama promised Congress and the American people that he would secure a good deal or walk away. He couldn’t bring home a good deal and he couldn’t bring himself to walk away. Instead, he walked away from every key position demanding the shuttering or dismantlement of Iran’s military nuclear infrastructure — including their fortified enrichment bunker, buried under a mountain, on a military base, where Iran will be permitted to continue enriching and developing its ability to spin faster and more advanced centrifuges. To believe this is a good deal, you have to trust Iran. The American people, and their lawmakers, rightly, do not. Over the next 60 days, Congress will review this accord, acknowledge that the President has, unfortunately, not lived up to the promises that he made, and instead delivered a deal that will make America, our children, and the world less safe. The American people deserve better. Our negotiators can do better. Congress must insist on it, and reject this bad deal. [Photo: The Israel Project / Flickr ]

Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will arrive in Israel on Wednesday evening to discuss the nuclear deal signed between Iran and world powers the previous day with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Earlier Wednesday, Hammond told parliament that Israel would not have been satisfied with any kind of nuclear deal with Iran, dismissing criticism of the agreement struck between Tehran and foreign powers. "The question you have to ask yourself is what kind of a deal would have been welcomed in Tel Aviv. The answer of course is that Israel doesn't want any deal with Iran," Hammond said in response to an opposition legislator who said he objected to the agreement and cited dismay in Israel. Hammond, center, with counterparts from the US and Germany (Photo: AP) "Israel wants a permanent state of stand-off and I don't believe that's in the interests of the region. I don't believe it's in our interest," Hammond said. Herzog to lobby US for compensation Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog announced on Wednesday that he would go to the US to lobby for a compensation package to ensure Israel's military advantage in the region. Herzog's trip reflects the broad opposition to the Iran nuclear deal in Israel, where most politicians fear the deal will fail to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons while strengthening the Islamic Republic's support for Israel's staunchest enemies. "We must enter dialogue with our big ally, the US," Herzog said in the Knesset. Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog (Photo: Gil Yohanan) In a videotaped statement posted on his Facebook page, Herzog said he had spoken with officials of pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC and other US groups, and would be headed to the US "to ask that Israel gets a security umbrella and a series of steps to allow Israel to maintain its advantage in the region due to the new reality coming out of the deal." Herzog has criticized Netanyahu over the deal, saying the Israeli leader unnecessarily antagonized the U.S. and other allies during negotiations. In March, Netanyahu voiced his opposition to the emerging deal in a speech to the U.S. Congress that enraged the White House. But in a meeting with Netanyahu late Tuesday, Herzog promised "to do everything for the security of Israel" in light of the Iranian deal, according to a statement from Netanyahu's office. "Our national security is not a matter of dispute," Netanyahu's office quoted Herzog as saying. The emperor has no clothes Nuclear Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Wednesday Israel was like the boy in the fairy tale who pointed out the emperor had no clothes. "Israel is like the little child that is pointing its finger and saying, 'the king is naked, this agreement is naked,'" Steinitz told reporters. Netanyahu has been highly critical of the deal, calling it a "stunning historic mistake," asserting that the deal gives Iran every incentive not to change. By not dismantling the nuclear program, the deal will give "an unrepentant" and "far richer" Iranian regime more regional power, the prime minister said. Yuval Steinitz (Photo: George Ginsburg) Steinitz described the deal, painstakingly negotiated over the past several years, including 17 straight days before Tuesday's signing, as full of loopholes, particularly when it comes to verification and Iran's "breakout" capability - the time it would theoretically take it to develop a nuclear weapon. Israel is also agitated by the fact that Iran will have access to around $100 billion of frozen assets as soon as the deal is implemented, which is expected to take six months. "Those who think that giving Iran $150 billion will have no effect on the Middle East are naive," said Steinitz. "It's like pouring fuel on the burning Middle East." As well as the long-term nuclear threat, Israel's alarm stems from Iran's backing for militant groups in the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and parts of Syria, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. "(We are) this little, tiny Jewish democracy that survives in the most difficult and problematic neighbourhood on the face of the earth," said Steinitz. Asked what extra weapons Israel might request from the United States, Steinitz would not be drawn, saying the only acceptable compensation would be an agreement that prevents Tehran producing nuclear arms. In the interim, he said, Israel reserved the right to defend itself, and would do so unilaterally if required. "Israel's right of self-defence is non-negotiable and cannot be limited by any international agreement, good or bad. "When a country like Iran is calling once again, even in the last few days, for Israel's destruction, Israel of course has the right, and also the duty, to defend itself by itself." The first Israeli opinion poll published since the deal was announced found a solid majority supported Netanyahu's view. The survey broadcast by Channel 10 television found 69 percent objected to the agreement with Iran and only 10 percent backed it, with the rest undecided. Thirty-two percent of Israelis thought their country should respond by attacking Iranian nuclear installations, while 40 percent opposed that idea and 28 percent had no view, polling results broadcast on Wednesday showed. But while Netanyahu vowed to continue fighting the agreement signed in Vienna on Tuesday, US President Barack Obama told the New York Times that Netanyahu “perhaps thinks he can further influence the congressional debate" but that he was confident the agreement would be approved. "But after that’s done, if that’s what he thinks is appropriate, then I will sit down, as we have consistently throughout my administration, and then ask some very practical questions: How do we prevent Hezbollah from acquiring more sophisticated weapons? How do we build on the success of Iron Dome, which the United States worked with Israel to develop and has saved Israeli lives?" the US president said.

The first Israeli opinion poll published since the deal was announced found a solid majority supported Netanyahu's view. The survey broadcast by Channel 10 television found 69 percent objected to the agreement with Iran and only 10 percent backed it, with the rest undecided. Thirty-two percent of Israelis thought their country should respond by attacking Iranian nuclear installations, while 40 percent opposed that idea and 28 percent had no view, polling results broadcast on Wednesday showed. But while Netanyahu vowed to continue fighting the agreement signed in Vienna on Tuesday, US President Barack Obama told the New York Times that Netanyahu “perhaps thinks he can further influence the congressional debate" but that he was confident the agreement would be approved. "But after that’s done, if that’s what he thinks is appropriate, then I will sit down, as we have consistently throughout my administration, and then ask some very practical questions: How do we prevent Hezbollah from acquiring more sophisticated weapons? How do we build on the success of Iron Dome, which the United States worked with Israel to develop and has saved Israeli lives?" the US president said.

President Barack Obama told the press from the White House on Wednesday that Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to provide a better alternative to the historic nuclear deal reached with Iran on Tuesday. "Israel has legitimate concerns about its security regarding Iran," Obama said, echoing Israel's repeated concerns about Iran's Holocaust denial and sponsorship of Hezbollah. However, Obama added that these threats are compounded if Iran obtains weapons, and Netanyahu has yet to present a better option. "Without a deal," Obama added, "there would be no limits to Iran's nuclear program and Iran could move close to a nuclear bomb. Without a deal, we risk even more war in the Middle East." "The starting premise of our strategy with respect to Iran has been that it would be a grave threat to the U.S. and our allies if Iran obtained a nuclear weapon," Obama said, adding that every U.S. policy over the past six-and-a-half years was motivated by this premise. "That was not simply my priority, but this has been my priority, a Republican priority, and Prime Minister Netanyahu's priority." Obama added that the nuclear deal meets all of the United States' priorities. He also noted that he still has low expections about Iran's behavior in the region. "My hope is that building on this deal, we can continue to have conversations with Iran that incentivize them to behave differently in the region, to be less hostile and more cooperative, to operate the way we expect nations to behave in the international community, but we're not counting on it." "There are mechanisms under international law to interdict weapon shipments," Obama added. The U.S. president specifically mentioned Iran's role in Syra, saying that the problems in Syria would not be solved without support from Russia, Turkey and other partners, and he said Iran needed to be part of those discussions. "In order for us to resolve it, there is going to have to be agreement among the major powers that are interested in Syria that this is not going to be won on the battlefield." Obama added that the U.S. lacked diplomatic leverage to eliminate every bit of a peaceful nuclear program in Iran. "Without a deal, the international sanctions regime will unravel, with little ability to re-impose it," he said. " With this deal, we have the possibility to peacefully resolve a major threat to regional and international security." Obama told the New York Times on Tuesday that although concerns over Iran are legitimate, "we have to keep our eye on the ball... Iran with a nuclear weapon will do more damage, and we will be in a much worse position to prevent it.” Regarding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intention to lobby against the deal in Congress, Obama said he doesn't believe the premier's efforts will be successful.

News article:
By Arab News By Yossi Mekelberg* When it comes to the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the line between policy and propaganda is opaque, tilting mainly toward the latter. His long career in politics, and his staying power, relied much on rhetoric, which has always superseded his deeds. His masterly inaction has actually served Israel well in avoiding a full-fledged intervention in the Syrian conflict. Above all, Netanyahu, despite his nationalist posturing and self-proclaimed “Mr Security” image, is mainly a political operator and survivor with minimal-to-zero long-term objectives or vision. In the good old tradition of the far right, he understands the value of domestic and external enemies when clinging to power. And a recent police investigation into his and his wife’s alleged corruption and misuse of public funds has intensified his siege mentality. Last’s week’s opening of the Knesset’s winter session, after the hiatus of a long summer and Jewish holidays, provided him with the perfect platform to position himself as the innocent victim of a smear campaign by the left and the media, and then to elevate the danger of Iran’s presence in Syria above that of Tehran’s nuclear program. The latter was not a passing remark, but a new and potentially dangerous trend that could lead to an intensification of military clashes with the Syrian army, Iranian affiliated groups such as Hezbollah, or even Iranian military personnel present in Israel’s troubled north-eastern neighbor. It is not only Netanyahu, but also his hawkish Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman who has upped the ante. Lieberman threatened this year to destroy Syrian air defense systems “without the slightest hesitation” after they targeted Israeli warplanes on a bombing mission. Last week he accused Iran’s ally of deliberately firing rockets from Syria into the Israeli occupied Golan Heights in an attempt to “drag Israel into battle.” He told his party members that this wasn’t just a spillover from the war in Syria but, “a personal and direct order from Hassan Nasrallah,” Hezbollah’s leader. Astonishingly, there was no confirmation from Israeli military intelligence of these blunt accusations. Instead, the Israeli response was swift, striking three Syrian artillery vehicles. In the past, when Israel responded with military force to such attacks, it did not attribute deliberate intention, and did not always feel obliged to retaliate. But last week’s events have intrinsically increased the risk of escalation and open hostilities. The combination of increasing incidents of a military nature, the claim that these are deliberate provocations on the part of the Syria–Iran–Hezbollah axis, and an Israeli prime minister who is rattled by a police investigation that might lead to fresh elections, is a potentially explosive one. It has led to heightened tension and has been exacerbated on both sides by the exchange of vitriolic threats. Between the tensions on the ground and the language used by the top echelons of all parties involved, a war that neither side has an interest in is not beyond the realm of possibility. Strategically Israel has been content, as long as the war in Syria was finely balanced, to see President Bashar Assad remain in power as long as he is not strong enough to pose a military threat to Israel. But as the war unfolded it came with a price for Israel — that of a better equipped and war-experienced Hezbollah. Furthermore, that group’s fighters and paymasters from Tehran are within sight of the Golan Heights border. The near collapse of Daesh and the restoration of the Damascus regime’s control of two-thirds of Syrian territory creates a new reality. Iran is eyeing a land corridor through Iraq and Syria all the way to Lebanon. The working assumption of the Israeli security establishment is that the probability of confrontation with Hezbollah is real, and would result in many casualties, mainly civilians. Any direct and easier access to Lebanon by the group that Israel regards as its arch-enemy is a recipe for a more proactive Israeli involvement in Syria. Escalating the war of words could drag Israel into a quagmire it has thus far sensibly managed to avoid. It might also be the case that in view of the Trump administration’s constant pressure to rescind the Iran nuclear deal, Netanyahu feels that, unlike during the Obama years in the White House, such a move now would leave the issue in “safe” hands, and in this case Israel can take a back seat and concentrate on the Iranian involvement in Syria and Lebanon. The former military commander of Israel’s Northern Zone, Major-General Amiram Levin, warned last week in an opinion piece for a major Israeli newspaper that Netanyahu lacked statesmanship qualities and was surrounded by people who lacked experience in matters of security, lacked diplomatic discretion, were devoid of a sense of political balance, and all this “alongside arrogance and a disregard of our enemies” that could have disastrous consequences. The threat of confrontation is not imaginary — it is a real one. However, to deal with it sensibly will require less inflammatory language and bravado, and more cooperation with regional and international actors. This is true for any conventional confrontation as much as the nuclear issue. However, in the next few months strategic calculations are going to be diluted by political and personal ones aimed at diverting attention from the personal hole the Netanyahus appear to have dug for themselves, and appeasing the extreme right views of coalition members, alongside increasing Iranian ambitions in the region — a menacing mix that could end in a confrontation that neither side wants or is capable of winning. • Yossi Mekelberg is professor of international relations at Regent’s University London, where he is head of the International Relations and Social Sciences Program.

Stepping up: Israel’s increasing anxiety about Syria Chris Doyle Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu views Iran as a huge menace in Syria yet he knows that there’s very little he can do to push Iran out. Chris Doyle Disclaimer: Views expressed by writers in this section are their own and do not necessarily reflect Arab News' point of view Syria is very popular in the Middle East. Practically every regional power has sent forces, intervened, sponsored proxies or affected this conflict in some way. Yet perhaps one actor that has received less attention than most is Israel.Thus far, Israel has carried out, according to the Israeli military in August, more than 100 strikes within Syria during the past five years. The frequency has increased in recent months.The Syrian regime typically responds with empty threats, promising that next time Israel will pay heavy consequences. The latest was just last week, when Israeli jets reportedly hit a security center south of Homs. Syrian regime sources claim that they responded with surface-to-air missiles.What is clear is that the Syrian regime cannot risk any form of confrontation with Israel. Israeli defense chiefs know this. Syrian regime forces are exhausted and overstretched, and perhaps most embarrassingly, for the regime, simply incapable of matching Israeli military technology and might.From 2011, the Syrian regime myth that its armed forces were built up to defend the country from Israel was also busted. Syrians saw that the real reason was to defend the regime from them and from any internal threat. The tanks and guns were turned on the Syrian people.But what are Israeli motives and does Israel have a strategy on Syria? Much of the region is instinctively suspicious of any Israeli actions across its borders. Many attribute grand conspiratorial schemes to Israeli moves. Israel has interfered in the region nowhere more so than in Lebanon, where Israeli leaders dreamed of creating a Maronite-client state that would be a regional ally. Israel has looked to non-Arab partners in the region at varying times such as Turkey, the Kurds and of course Iran under the Shah. The thinking was that Arabs would be a permanent hostile presence, so Israel could ally with those who felt threatened by the dominant ethnicity of the region. Likewise, Israel tried to attract support from religious minorities such as the Christians and the Druze, tapping into fears of Muslim domination.What is not always understood is that from the start of the Syria crisis, the Israeli establishment was massively divided. The Syrian regime was its mortal foe to the north so no Israeli leader wishes Assad well. The regime has largely fought Israel through Lebanon for the past four decades, and had with Iran, used Hezbollah to threaten Israel and undermine Lebanon from within. A portion of Israeli policymakers believed that the fall of Assad should be expedited. And Israeli leaders believed that the war meant that it could never be forced to return the Golan Heights to a crumbling regime. In fact, Israel has expanded illegal settlements in the Golan under the cover of the Syrian conflict.Against that view, many argued that Israel knew this regime backwards, how it operated, its strengths and weaknesses. It was useful to have one single address in Damascus to deliver the robust messages that Tel Aviv needed to. The fear was that if the regime fell, a dangerous vacuum could lead to a free-for-all and proliferation of numerous non-state actors fueled by extremist ideologies with access to Syria’s huge cache of conventional weapons and its chemical arsenal. This nightmare materialized even though the regime, albeit even more a creature of Russia and Iran, remains in place. Israeli strategists also understood that given Israel’s regional reputation, any actions it took were likely to be misinterpreted. Israelis understood that it has limited ability to determine the outcome of the conflict.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out his red lines early on. Israel would act to prevent the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah. He has repeated this even after Russia’s direct military intervention started in 2015, and made this clear in each of his four visits to Russia over the past 18 months. Israel has also acted to prevent extremist militants from operating on its northern border.Yet increasingly Israel has had a further concern. In a speech at Chatham House on Nov. 3 the Israeli prime minister made clear that he saw Iran as a huge menace in Syria. “Iran had come into the Syrian war to Lebanon-ize Syria economically and militarily. They want to leave their army, their airbases and fighter aircraft within seconds of Israel and we are not going to let that happen. We do not say that lightly. We mean what we say and we back it with action.”Iran rather than extremist militant groups was always Israel’s primary concern in Syria. Netanyahu’s problem is that while he has a close relationship with President Donald Trump, the American president has yet to outline anything approaching a strategy on Syria or Iran. Trump has focused solely on smashing Daesh but as far as the Iranian presence is concerned, it has been a series of vague empty threats. Israeli officials are also not optimistic that Russia will do what the US has not, and push Iran out.The question is what can or will Israel do to reverse Iran’s gains or even constrain it? Short of a conflict, probably with Hezbollah, the answer for the moment is, not very much.• Chris Doyle is director of the London-based Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU).

Yet perhaps one actor that has received less attention than most is Israel.Thus far, Israel has carried out, according to the Israeli military in August, more than 100 strikes within Syria during the past five years. The frequency has increased in recent months.The Syrian regime typically responds with empty threats, promising that next time Israel will pay heavy consequences. The latest was just last week, when Israeli jets reportedly hit a security center south of Homs. Syrian regime sources claim that they responded with surface-to-air missiles.What is clear is that the Syrian regime cannot risk any form of confrontation with Israel. Israeli defense chiefs know this. Syrian regime forces are exhausted and overstretched, and perhaps most embarrassingly, for the regime, simply incapable of matching Israeli military technology and might.From 2011, the Syrian regime myth that its armed forces were built up to defend the country from Israel was also busted. Syrians saw that the real reason was to defend the regime from them and from any internal threat. The tanks and guns were turned on the Syrian people.But what are Israeli motives and does Israel have a strategy on Syria? Much of the region is instinctively suspicious of any Israeli actions across its borders. Many attribute grand conspiratorial schemes to Israeli moves. Israel has interfered in the region nowhere more so than in Lebanon, where Israeli leaders dreamed of creating a Maronite-client state that would be a regional ally. Israel has looked to non-Arab partners in the region at varying times such as Turkey, the Kurds and of course Iran under the Shah. The thinking was that Arabs would be a permanent hostile presence, so Israel could ally with those who felt threatened by the dominant ethnicity of the region. Likewise, Israel tried to attract support from religious minorities such as the Christians and the Druze, tapping into fears of Muslim domination.What is not always understood is that from the start of the Syria crisis, the Israeli establishment was massively divided. The Syrian regime was its mortal foe to the north so no Israeli leader wishes Assad well. The regime has largely fought Israel through Lebanon for the past four decades, and had with Iran, used Hezbollah to threaten Israel and undermine Lebanon from within. A portion of Israeli policymakers believed that the fall of Assad should be expedited. And Israeli leaders believed that the war meant that it could never be forced to return the Golan Heights to a crumbling regime. In fact, Israel has expanded illegal settlements in the Golan under the cover of the Syrian conflict.Against that view, many argued that Israel knew this regime backwards, how it operated, its strengths and weaknesses. It was useful to have one single address in Damascus to deliver the robust messages that Tel Aviv needed to. The fear was that if the regime fell, a dangerous vacuum could lead to a free-for-all and proliferation of numerous non-state actors fueled by extremist ideologies with access to Syria’s huge cache of conventional weapons and its chemical arsenal. This nightmare materialized even though the regime, albeit even more a creature of Russia and Iran, remains in place. Israeli strategists also understood that given Israel’s regional reputation, any actions it took were likely to be misinterpreted. Israelis understood that it has limited ability to determine the outcome of the conflict.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out his red lines early on. Israel would act to prevent the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah. He has repeated this even after Russia’s direct military intervention started in 2015, and made this clear in each of his four visits to Russia over the past 18 months. Israel has also acted to prevent extremist militants from operating on its northern border.Yet increasingly Israel has had a further concern. In a speech at Chatham House on Nov. 3 the Israeli prime minister made clear that he saw Iran as a huge menace in Syria. “Iran had come into the Syrian war to Lebanon-ize Syria economically and militarily. They want to leave their army, their airbases and fighter aircraft within seconds of Israel and we are not going to let that happen. We do not say that lightly. We mean what we say and we back it with action.”Iran rather than extremist militant groups was always Israel’s primary concern in Syria. Netanyahu’s problem is that while he has a close relationship with President Donald Trump, the American president has yet to outline anything approaching a strategy on Syria or Iran. Trump has focused solely on smashing Daesh but as far as the Iranian presence is concerned, it has been a series of vague empty threats. Israeli officials are also not optimistic that Russia will do what the US has not, and push Iran out.The question is what can or will Israel do to reverse Iran’s gains or even constrain it? Short of a conflict, probably with Hezbollah, the answer for the moment is, not very much.• Chris Doyle is director of the London-based Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU).

It's still not clear whether the current escalation to the north of Israel is a temporary uptick in hostilities, or a reflection of the growing self-confidence of the Assad regime and its Iranian allies, and as such a portent of coming events.

June 7, 2016 Credit: Maxim Shipenkov / AP The first component of a strategy such as this would be the ongoing demonstration of military self-restraint and forbearance, based on a long-term approach of conflict management, not resolution. Military action should be taken only when truly essential and after all other alternatives have been exhausted, not merely as a demonstration of strength or for purposes of "deterrence maintenance", as the IDF explains following almost every incident. Ongoing weak and ineffectual responses, coming on top of the repeated rounds with Hezbollah and Hamas which have ended without a clear outcome, deplete Israel’s power to no avail and only weaken its deterrence in the end, rather than strengthening it. >>Abbas heads to Saudi Arabia in surprise visit to talk Iran, Trump's peace push | News The second component, along with military restraint, is rhetorical moderation. It is only natural to define difficult circumstances as being "intolerable" and to derive the measures to be taken from this determination.

Not every cabinet meeting, or visit by governmental leaders in the field, has to end with jingoistic statements designed to prop up our national pride. Russia and Iran also have public opinion and national pride of their own, not just us, and it is important to understand that the ongoing humiliation of their client state, Syria, by repeated public accentuations of our ability to fly anywhere in Syria’s airspace, is not something they will long be able to tolerate. Emphasizing similar capabilities in the past, for example, during the 1969-1971 War of Attrition, led to the deployment of Soviet anti-missile systems in Egypt and ultimately to the downing of 20% of Israel’s Air Force in the horrible first days of the Yom Kippur War.

Oct. 24, 2015 Credit: AP Photo/Hassan Ammar It is far better for Israel to operate quietly. The third component of the proposed strategy consists of a diplomatic effort vis-à-vis the U.S. and Russia, designed to achieve some, limited, influence over the emerging new order in Syria. The U.S., in the Trump era, cannot be a reliable strategic backer for Israel. Its stature in the world and region have diminished and it does not have a strategy for Syria beyond the defeat of ISIS. President Donald Trump also does not have a coherent policy towards Iran, his hollow protestations, when presenting his recent "Iran strategy", notwithstanding.

Russian interests in Syria are different from Israel’s, but Putin does tend to take them into account. Russian and Iranian interests in Syria are also not identical, despite Putin’s recent visit there, thereby creating some room for promoting space between them. Israel should therefore continue talking with Putin, in order to try and ensure that the emerging cease-fire in Syria creates as broad a buffer as possible between Iranian and Hezbollah forces, and ourselves. A diplomatic effort, combined with low intensity military pressure, may yield some results. Putin, too, is aware of the dangers of escalation in Syria generally, and between Israel and Russia in particular.

Israel should encourage the U.S. and its allies both to enforce the deal effectively and to begin creating the conditions for the future imposition of a follow-on deal on Iran, designed to ensure that the limitations on its nuclear capabilities never expire. A fifth and final component is an international diplomatic campaign to pressure Iran into changing its aggressive regional behavior, especially in Syria and in regard to its missile program. Preservation of the nuclear deal is a prerequisite for this; in its absence, it is the U.S. (and with it Israel) that will be isolated, not Iran. Israel can successfully deter Iran and defend itself against her, but Iran’s decisive defeat is beyond our capabilities. Even global powers treat Iran carefully. Lebanon’s unique characteristics, as well as the changes that have taken place in modern warfare, mean that Israel has also been hard-pressed to achieve a decisive defeat of Hezbollah, except at a completely unjustified cost in lives and damage to the home front. We can always go to war, and may have no alternative in the end, but the greater wisdom is in finding ways to avoid the need for that.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he has made it clear to the U.S. and Russia that Israel will continue with its operations in Syria. Netanyahu said he told Washington and Moscow that Israel will act according to its "security needs." Israel has largely stayed out of the war but has struck suspected weapon convoys to Hizbullah. His remarks came on the heels of an international agreement laying out principles for post-war Syria. A U.S.-Russian statement Saturday affirmed an understanding calling for "the reduction and ultimate elimination" of foreign fighters. Israel has long complained about the involvement of archenemy Iran, and its Lebanese ally Hizbullah, in Syria. It has expressed concerns of a "Shiite corridor" with land links from Iran to Lebanon, providing movement of militants and weapons across the region. Speaking later Monday in parliament, Netanyahu said some of Israel's Arab neighbors shared its concerns. "We stand shoulder to shoulder with countries of the moderate camp in the Arab world, in the face of radical Islam, no matter where it comes from, be it Iran, the Islamic State group or elsewhere," he said, without naming the countries. "I think that this growing closeness and consultation is first and foremost good for security and ultimately for peace," he added. Sunni Muslim powerhouse Saudi Arabia has long been at loggerheads with Shiite, non-Arab Iran but friction has been growing lately as Tehran has backed Shiite Huthi rebels in Yemen. Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman accused Iran of "direct military aggression" against the kingdom by supplying the rebels with ballistic missiles. The kingdom says one was fired toward Riyadh from Yemen on November 4 but brought down by its air defenses. Iran denied any involvement. "Iran knows very well, and everyone else should be aware, that we shall not agree to nor accept its military deployment in Syria," Netanyahu told parliament.

News article:
This file picture shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attending a weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem on November 12, 2017 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled Monday that Israel would take military action in Syria when it sees fit as it seeks to ensure Iran-backed forces stay away from its territory. Israel has long accused Iran, its main enemy, of taking advantage of Syria's civil war to send its Revolutionary Guard and its Lebanese Shiite ally Hezbollah into southern Syria, close to the border with the Jewish state. It has sought to avoid being dragged into the fighting but has carried out dozens of air strikes to prevent arms deliveries to Hezbollah, which fights alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Israel was reportedly seeking a buffer zone in southern Syria near Israeli territory of some 50 kilometres (30 miles), but an agreement reached last week between the United States, Russia and Jordan fell short of that demand, Israeli media said. "I have made it clear to our friends, first of all in Washington and also to our friends in Moscow, that Israel will act in Syria -- including in southern Syria -- according to our understanding and according to our security needs," Netanyahu told senior members of his Likud party, according to a party statement. "This is what is happening and this is what will continue to happen." The November 8 agreement between Jordan, the United States and Russia seeks to build on a ceasefire already in place in southwestern Syria. On Saturday the Israeli military said it shot down a Syrian drone carrying out a reconnaissance mission over the Golan Heights. "We will not allow the consolidation of a Shiite axis in Syria" as a base for operations against Israel, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a statement after the incident. - 'Shoulder to shoulder' - Speaking later Monday in parliament, Netanyahu said some of Israel's Arab neighbours shared its concerns.

Israel seized 1,200 square kilometres (460 square miles) of the Golan Heights from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community.

Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel would operate in Syria how and when it sees fit, regardless of the ceasefire agreement signed Saturday between the US, Russia and Jordan that Jerusalem complained fell significantly short of its security demands. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter “I clarified for our friends, first and foremost in Washington and also our friends in Moscow, that Israel will act in Syria, including in southern Syria, in accordance with its understanding and our security needs,” the prime minister said during a Likud party meeting. PM Netanyahu (Photo: Reuters) “That is what is happening and that is what will continue to happen,” he added. The agreement, which included a clause removing Iranian forces, Hezbollah and Shi'ite militias in Syria from its border with Israel on the Golan Heights, raised eyebrows among Israeli security officials after learning that they would be permitted to remain present a mere 5-7km from the border. Depending on current rebel positions on the Syrian Golan Heights, an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due, the forces would have to deploy up to 30km from the border. “We are concerned for Israel’s security and you all know this very well. We are doing this with the right combination of firmness and responsibility,” Netanyahu continued. “We are protecting our borders, we are protecting our country and we will continue to do so.” US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday affirmed joint efforts to stabilize Syria as its civil war wanes with the expansion of a July 7 truce in the southwestern triangle bordering Israel and Jordan. Preident Trump and President Putin (Photo: AFP) A US State Department official said Russia had agreed “to work with the Syrian regime to remove Iranian-backed forces a defined distance” from the Golan Heights frontier with Israel, which captured the plateau in the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel has been lobbying both the US and Russia to deny Iran, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite militias any permanent bases in Syria, and to distance them from the Golan, as they gain ground while helping Damascus beat back Sunni-led rebels. On Sunday, Regional Cooperation Minister and Netanyahu confidant, Tzachi Hanegbi (Likud), however, sounded circumspect about the deal, telling reporters that it “does not meet Israel’s unequivocal demand the there will not be developments that bring the forces of Hezbollah or Iran to the Israel-Syria border in the north.”

News article:
JERUSALEM: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled Monday that Israel would take military action in Syria when it sees fit as it seeks to ensure Iran-backed forces stay away from its territory. Israel has long accused Iran, its main enemy, of taking advantage of Syria’s civil war to send its Revolutionary Guard and its Lebanese Shiite ally Hezbollah into southern Syria, close to the border with the Jewish state. It has sought to avoid being dragged into the fighting but has carried out dozens of air strikes to prevent arms deliveries to Hezbollah, which fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Israel was reportedly seeking a buffer zone in southern Syria near Israeli territory of some 50 kilometers (30 miles), but an agreement reached last week between the United States, Russia and Jordan fell short of that demand, Israeli media said. “I have made it clear to our friends, first of all in Washington and also to our friends in Moscow, that Israel will act in Syria — including in southern Syria — according to our understanding and according to our security needs,” Netanyahu told senior members of his Likud party, according to a party statement. “This is what is happening and this is what will continue to happen.” The November 8 agreement between Jordan, the United States and Russia seeks to build on a cease-fire already in place in southwestern Syria. On Saturday the Israeli military said it shot down a Syrian drone carrying out a reconnaissance mission over the Golan Heights. “We will not allow the consolidation of a Shiite axis in Syria” as a base for operations against Israel, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a statement after the incident. Speaking later Monday in parliament, Netanyahu said some of Israel’s Arab neighbors shared its concerns. “We stand shoulder to shoulder with countries of the moderate camp in the Arab world, in the face of radical Islam, no matter where it comes from, be it Iran, the Daesh group or elsewhere,” he said, without naming the countries. “I think that this growing closeness and consultation is first and foremost good for security and ultimately for peace,” he added. Sunni Muslim powerhouse Saudi Arabia has long been at loggerheads with Shiite, non-Arab Iran but friction has been Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of “direct military aggression” against the kingdom by supplying the Yemen's Houthi rebels with ballistic missiles. The kingdom says one was fired toward Riyadh from Yemen on November 4 but brought down by its air defenses. Iran denied any involvement. “Iran knows very well, and everyone else should be aware, that we shall not agree to nor accept its military deployment in Syria,” Netanyahu told parliament. In September, Israel’s military shot down what it said was an Iranian-made drone operated by arch-foe Hezbollah on a similar mission. Israel seized 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) of the Golan Heights from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognized by the international community.

Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman sent a message to Russia on Wednesday that Israel will not allow Iranian and Shiite entrenchment in Syria after Moscow's foreign minister said Tehran's presence in the war-torn country was "legitimate." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "The IDF is ready and well prepared for any scenario, we maintain complete freedom of operations," Lieberman said at the end of a two-day tour of Israel's northern border. "We will not allow Iranian entrenchment in Syria, nor will we allow Syria to become a frontline against the State of Israel. Those who have yet to understand it, should understand it now," he added in a first official Israeli response to Sergey Lavrov's comments. Lieberman on tour of northern border (Photo: Ariel Hermoni/Defense Ministry) Lieberman was accompanied on his tour by IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, Deputy IDF Chief Aviv Kochavi, GOC Northern Command Yoel Strick, and the commanders of the Path of Fire Division and the Galilee Division. Lieberman on tour of northern border (Photo: Ariel Hermoni/Defense Ministry) The defense minister toured the border area, met with commanders and soldiers and received security briefings on the preparedness of the forces. "When you meet with IDF soldiers, you're confident there's someone you can count on," Lieberman said. Lieberman on tour of northern border (Photo: Ariel Hermoni/Defense Ministry) Lavrov’s comments, quoted in the Russian news agencies RIA and in Interfax, came in response to remarks made Monday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who publicly stated that Israel would not be bound by the agreement and that it would act as it saw fit against any residual presence near its northern border or threats in southern Syria left behind after the agreement. “I clarified for our friends, first and foremost in Washington and also our friends in Moscow, that Israel will act in Syria, including in southern Syria, in accordance with its understanding and our security needs,” the prime minister said during a Likud party meeting. Lieberman on tour of northern border (Photo: Ariel Hermoni/Defense Ministry) In October, Netanyahu told Russia’s Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu that Israel will not allow Iran to entrench its military forces in Syria. In November, it emerged that Netanyahu’s words had seemingly gone unheeded after the BBC aired satellite footage allegedly showing continued construction work on permanent structures in Lebanon, built for the Iran army between January and October. The permanent Iranian site, which includes over 20 buildings presumably to be used for soldiers' housing and storing military vehicles, is located 50km from the Golan Heights. "Israel has already clarified its positions to its friends in Moscow. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told President Vladimir Putin that in any eventuality, Israel will continue taking care of its own security needs," a statement by the Prime Minister's Office said in response to Lavrov's comments.

Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman sent a message to Russia on Wednesday that Israel will not allow Iranian and Shiite entrenchment in Syria after Moscow's foreign minister said Tehran's presence in the war-torn country was "legitimate." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "The IDF is ready and well prepared for any scenario, we maintain complete freedom of operations," Lieberman said at the end of a two-day tour of Israel's northern border. "We will not allow Iranian entrenchment in Syria, nor will we allow Syria to become a frontline against the State of Israel. Those who have yet to understand it, should understand it now," he added in a first official Israeli response to Sergey Lavrov's comments.

Lieberman on tour of northern border (Photo: Ariel Hermoni/Defense Ministry) The defense minister toured the border area, met with commanders and soldiers and received security briefings on the preparedness of the forces. "When you meet with IDF soldiers, you're confident there's someone you can count on," Lieberman said. Lieberman on tour of northern border (Photo: Ariel Hermoni/Defense Ministry) Lavrov’s comments, quoted in the Russian news agencies RIA and in Interfax, came in response to remarks made Monday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who publicly stated that Israel would not be bound by the agreement and that it would act as it saw fit against any residual presence near its northern border or threats in southern Syria left behind after the agreement. “I clarified for our friends, first and foremost in Washington and also our friends in Moscow, that Israel will act in Syria, including in southern Syria, in accordance with its understanding and our security needs,” the prime minister said during a Likud party meeting. Lieberman on tour of northern border (Photo: Ariel Hermoni/Defense Ministry) In October, Netanyahu told Russia’s Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu that Israel will not allow Iran to entrench its military forces in Syria. In November, it emerged that Netanyahu’s words had seemingly gone unheeded after the BBC aired satellite footage allegedly showing continued construction work on permanent structures in Lebanon, built for the Iran army between January and October. The permanent Iranian site, which includes over 20 buildings presumably to be used for soldiers' housing and storing military vehicles, is located 50km from the Golan Heights. "Israel has already clarified its positions to its friends in Moscow. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told President Vladimir Putin that in any eventuality, Israel will continue taking care of its own security needs," a statement by the Prime Minister's Office said in response to Lavrov's comments.

TEL AVIV (Sputnik) — On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel was ready to act alone if necessary to prevent Iran from turning Syria into its military base. "We maintain absolute freedom of action and the only considerations that guide us are the security considerations of Israel… With regards to Iran, we will simply not allow for Shi'ite consolidation and Iranian entrenchment in Syria nor will we allow Syria to become a forward operating base against the State of Israel. Anyone who has yet to understand that is advised to do so," the country's Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said, as quoted by his press service.

News article:
The presence of Iranian forces in Syria and of Iranian-backed militias not far from the border is the less troubling issue as far as Israel is concerned. For decades, we've lived and dealt with having five Syrian divisions on the Golan Heights border, armed with tanks, artillery and missiles. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, we even proved we are capable of dealing with such a force. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The biggest force the Iranians are capable of stationing 5 to 20 kilometers from the Purple Line (the ceasefire line) is two divisions—in other words, six brigades—which are not armed with any armored vehicles. These are primarily armed militias, not a threatening active army. It’s true that these militias could try to carry out terror attacks and infiltrate Israeli territory, or fire rockets and mortar shells, but these are activities the IDF knows and can deal with without great difficulties. And if needed, it can even enter Syria and attack the bases of these militias—including Hezbollah. The IDF was very successful in doing that in the War of Attrition, and there is no reason this can’t be done now, despite the Russian presence in Syria. Iranian-backed militia fighters in Syria The Russians cry out only when they are directly affected by these actions. There is no reason that a concrete operation against the Iranian-backed militias, as the IDF is capable of carrying out with its precision-guided ammunition, would lead to a clash with the Russians, and there is no reason for the Russians to launch an attack against us either. By the way, the Russians need the Iranians in Syria because they don’t want to bring in their own soldiers to operate on the ground. They would rather bomb from the air and let the Iranian militias serve as cannon fodder for the rebels, which is why most of the militia and Hezbollah fighters are now in the Idlib area in northern Syria, where the rebels are concentrated, while their presence in the Syrian Golan Heights is relatively small. The bottom line is that Iranian-backed militias operating near the border, including Hezbollah, are not a strategic threat but rather a tactical problem Israel is capable of dealing with. By the way, Hezbollah fighters have long been active much closer to the Golan Heights border than 7 to 20 kilometers away. They have already fired rockets into the Golan Heights and the Mount Hermon slopes twice. This serves as further proof that we can deal with this threat and know how to do it. Nevertheless, there are some causes for concern. Iranian batteries defending Lebanon’s skies What we should be concerned about is the Russian legitimization of long-term strategic Iranian presence in Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday that because the Syrian government invited the Iranians, their presence there was legitimate. This statement allegedly contradicts the spirit of the agreement signed between Russia, the United States and Jordan on Saturday, which states that all foreign forces must pull out of Syria. The agreement failed to indicate when this would happen, making it an unbinding statement—like any declaration of intent with no timetable—but it is important, because it makes the presence of the Iranian forces and the militias illegitimate in the long run. Then came Lavrov’s statement, however, and legitimized this presence. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Iranian presence in Syria ‘legitimate’ (Photo: AFP) This means that Iran would be able to have its own strategic presence, including planes and warships, as long as the Syrian government “invites it to do so.” This would allow the ayatollahs to create a military stronghold on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, right on the State of Israel’s border. A Navy ship or a merchant vessel leaving the Haifa Port would be threatened by Iranian missiles launched from the Syrian coast or by Iranian ships docking in the Tartus, Latakia or Beirut ports. Another example is that modern Iranian surface-to-air missile batteries could take part in blocking the Israel Air Force from entering Syria and Lebanon’s skies. This is a much bigger threat than the presence of gunmen near the border in the Golan Heights. A strategic Iranian presence in Syria would be much more difficult to neutralize once it expands. Moreover, the real strategic threat is that Iran wants to launch another front with Israel in the north, in addition to Lebanon. It wants to be able to fight Israel, when the time comes, both through Hezbollah in Lebanon and through its militias and aerial and naval forces in Syria. When will Israel be forced to declare war? There are, however, two positive aspects as far as Israel is concerned. First of all, the presence of Iranian military aircraft and vessels in Syria would allow the IDF to target and destroy them quite easily. There would be no need to fly to Iran and refuel in the middle of the flight, in the air. The Iranian facilities would be as vulnerable as the different Syrian army facilities. Second, Lavrov made it clear that his statement about legitimate presence in Syria applied exclusively to the Iranians. He explicitly noted that he was not referring to Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah, but only to Revolutionary Guards members and soldiers in the Iranian army. An Iranian S-330 anti-aircraft system. In Syria soon? In this context, it’s important to know that the Iranians aren’t eager to send their people to die for the Syrian regime, which is why they need Hezbollah and the Iraqi and Afghan militias they are sending to Syria. It’s therefore unlikely that Tehran will send thousands of its people to Syria even if the Russians find it legitimate. The bottom line is that a strategic Iranian presence in Syria, including surface-to-surface missile bases which Iran may try to build there, is a strategic threat to the State of Israel, and the world should be warned about it. The current government and the previous government have been very successful in doing that. These warnings have another purpose: To warn Iran and Syria that in the event of a strategic Iranian presence in Syria, Israel would be forced to declare war, which would make Russia and Iran lose all the assets they have gained during the civil war. Both Moscow and Tehran likely understand that the Israeli government and the IDF are building awareness for the possibility of an attack on strategic Iranian and Syrian assets, if and when they are available. They know that Israel usually makes good on its threats, which is why both the Russians and the Iranians will likely reconsider their moves.

The current government and the previous government have been very successful in doing that. These warnings have another purpose: To warn Iran and Syria that in the event of a strategic Iranian presence in Syria, Israel would be forced to declare war, which would make Russia and Iran lose all the assets they have gained during the civil war. Both Moscow and Tehran likely understand that the Israeli government and the IDF are building awareness for the possibility of an attack on strategic Iranian and Syrian assets, if and when they are available. They know that Israel usually makes good on its threats, which is why both the Russians and the Iranians will likely reconsider their moves.

News article:
The warning shots fired by the IDF on Saturday and Sunday at Syrian military positions constitute another message conveyed by Israel about its red lines in the Golan Heights. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter For the second day in a row, an Israeli tank fired a warning shell at a Syrian force building a post to protect the Druze village of Hader from the al-Nusra Front organization that has been threatening the village. Seemingly, the IDF and the Syrian force building the fortifications west of the village have the exact same goal—to defend the Druze living in the village. Al-Nusra Front militants, who are affiliated with al-Qaeda, tried to occupy the village from that direction a little over a week ago. They even got a car bomb into the village, killing nine Syrian Druze in its explosion. IDF forces near Syrian border in Golan Heights (Photo: EPA) The post being built by the Syrian army aims to block that route of attack. Israel has also vowed to protect the Syrian Druze in the village of Hader, because of the State of Israel’s alliance with its Druze citizens. So why is the State of Israel disrupting the Syrian army’s efforts to defend the Druze, even forcibly preventing this protection? The answer is that the Syrians are building the new fortified space within the buffer zone between the two disengagement lines—the Syrian and the Israeli—in the Golan Heights. The 1974 Disengagement Agreement, which was signed after the Yom Kippur War, bars the Syrian army from entering that area and setting up posts there. When the Syrian army built a post on the eastern side of the village of Hader, Israel didn’t say a thing, because that area is located on Syrian territory and not within the buffer zone. The Syrians are building the new posts within the buffer zone, prompting Israel to fire warning shots despite the fact these posts actually serve the security of the residents of the village Israel officially vowed to protect. This is just one of many absurdities characterizing the Middle Eastern arena, and the reason for this absurdity is that Israel—today more than ever—is unwilling to accept even the tiniest violation of the Disengagement Agreement signed 43 years ago. Against Israel’s immediate interests The 1974 agreement is the oldest agreement between Israel and Arab states that is still honored by both sides. Now, the agreement has become much more important for Israel than it has been in the past 20 years, in light of the attempts made by the Iranians and Hezbollah to get their people—primarily armed militias—into the Syrian Golan Heights, and particularly into the area close to the disengagement line. Israel has already announced it won’t allow it, and the Disengagement Agreement provides a legal and international basis for that. The Disengagement Agreement includes not only a buffer zone along several kilometers. There are also dilution-of-forces strips on both sides of the buffer zone, where both the IDF and the Syrians are not allowed to keep armed forces beyond a limited amount. In the buffer zone, it is strictly forbidden to keep military forces, which is why there are no Syrian forces and no IDF forces between the two disengagement lines. Today, there are only rebels there. There is a dilution strip on both sides of the buffer zone where the IDF and the Syrian army are allowed to keep 75 tanks and 6,000 soldiers. Beyond the first dilution strip there is a second strip, where each side is allowed to keep 450 tanks, but its location is more than 20 kilometers from the disengagement line on each side. In practice, if the Iranians try to keep their own forces—for example, Hezbollah or Shiite militias or even Revolutionary Guard soldiers—less than 20 kilometers from the border with Israel, it would be seen as a violation of the Disengagement Agreement, which is being supervised by the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. The Russians would see it right away, and so would the Americans and the UN. So although this slightly contradicts its immediate interests, Israel is making it clear it won’t allow the Syrian regime to protect Hader at the cost of violating the Disengagement Agreement, which is seen today an important deterring and legal tool against the Iranians and Hezbollah.

News article:
By Zalman Ahnsaf YERUSHALAYIM — Israel is having its say in the final disposition of forces in the developing ceasefire agreement in Syria, one way or another. A warning has been sent to President Bashar Al-Assad that if he formally agrees to allow Iranian or Hezbollah forces to remain in the country, Israel will intervene in the civil war, ending its policy of the past six years of staying neutral in the conflict, according to a report Sunday night on Israeli news media. The message to Assad apparently came in response to discussions with Iran and Russia which aim to exclude from Syria all foreign forces, except by agreement with, or invitation from, Assad. Russia’s presence in Syria is based on such an invitation, and Israel seeks to “to deter Assad from issuing” a similar invitation to Iran. Until now, Israel has confined itself to retaliation for cross-border fire on the Golan, and interdiction from the air of arms shipments to Hezbollah. But “there was no direct targeting of the Syrian Army or of Assad,” noted a Channel 2 report. That will change if he enters an agreement that allows Iran to establish military bases in Syria. The Iranians are reportedly seeking “a naval base, possibly for submarines, an air base and arms factories for precision weapons.” Earlier this month, the BBC, citing a Western security official, said that Iran was building a permanent base on a site used by the Syrian army near el-Kiswah, 8 miles south of Damascus, just 30 miles from the Israeli border. Aerial photos appeared to confirm the report.

Damascus and Jerusalem have exchanged heated remarks as well, with Netanyahu threatening to bomb Assad's palace , and Syrian officials warning of ' 'dangerous repercussions '' to Israeli strikes on Syrian targets.Over the course of the war, Israel has operated several field hospitals near the Syrian border, where those injured from the war are treated and subsequently returned to Syria.

News article:
© Iran Review Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jarida revealed on Sunday that an Israeli source disclosed a promise from Jerusalem to destroy all Iranian facilities within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of Israel's Golan Heights. The source, who remains unnamed, said that during Syrian President Bashar Assad's surprise visit to Russia last week, Assad gave Russian Premier Vladimir Putin a message for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: Damascus will agree to a demilitarized zone of up to 40 kilometers from the border in the Golan Heights as part of a comprehensive agreement between the two countries, but only if Israel does not work to remove Assad's regime from power. The report also claims that Putin then called Netanyahu to relay the message, and that the Israeli prime minister said he would be willing to accept the deal, but that Israel's goal of eradicating Iran and Hezbollah from the country would remain. According to the source, Jerusalem sees Assad as the last president of the Alawite community, indicating that a change of regime in Syria - at least towards a government less-linked to Iran - would be favorable for Israel. The source also commented that after the defeat of the Islamic State, the conflict in Syria would become ''more difficult,'' likely pointing towards a vacuum that would be left without the group.

Some of those who have been treated have been rebels fighting against the Assad regime, leading some to say that Israel is assisting the rebels to unseat Assad. A bombshell report that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to attack all Iranian facilities and assets within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of Israel's Golan Heights is circulating in Israeli media.Though unconfirmed, what appears to be an ultimatum by Netanyahu could be the catalyst that finally pushes the Levant either toward broader war, or in the direction of de-escalation and regional stability after months of intensifying and provocative Israeli airstrikes on Syria and a corresponding war of words. The report also follows on the heels of a rare and unexpected visit of Assad to Sochi, Russia where he met with Putin just prior to trilateral talks between Russia, Iran, and Turkey over the future of Syria.Netanyahu himself recently met with Putin in a reportedly contentious summit in August where the Israeli prime minister declared , "We cannot forget for a single minute that Iran threatens every day to annihilate Israel. Israel opposes Iran's continued entrenchment in Syria. We will be sure to defend ourselves with all means against this and any threat."And now after months of Israel issuing threats of "red lines" concerning Iranian troop and militia presence in Syria, The Jerusalem Post reveals the following It appears that Netanyahu may have accepted the deal while holding it up as future justification for any attack it might initiate on Syria from across the Golan. The Jerusalem Post continues Clearly, Israel remains deeply uncomfortable with the Syrian Army's overwhelming momentum of late, especially after the liberation of Deir Ezzor and Abu Kamal from ISIS and seeks to keep the fires burning in Syria, at least enough to bog down Assad and Iran, while bringing pressure to bear designed to force an Iranian and Hezbollah exit from the theater (especially now that Israel finds itself in a weakened position regarding its desire for full on regime change in Syria).According to a dubiously sourced BBC report from earlier this month, Syria stands accused of hosting a sizable Iranian military base south of Damascus, which Israel utilized to ratchet up rhetoric in preparing its case for strikes on supposed Iranian targets inside Syria before the international community. Israel has long justified its attacks inside Syria by claiming to be acting against Hezbollah and Iranian targets.Concerning Israeli policy and the Islamic State, The Jerusalem Post makes an astounding and surprising admission which further confirms that official Israeli policy prefers ISIS in Syria rather than Assad or Iran:It's certainly no secret that Israel has aggressively pursued regime change in Syria for years (perhaps even decades), but recent provocations, even while Russia maintains a significant presence in the air over Syria, has created an explosive mix which could blow up at any moment. Things have been especially tense along the contested Golan Heights region as each time Israel claims it's shelled from the Syrian territory bordering the country, the IDF retaliates for the attacks it inevitably blames on Damascus, despite the fact that terrorist groups have been controlling parts of those very bordering territories.Should reports of the Assad-Netanyahu deal be confirmed, it could actually be a positive step towards the continued winding down of the Syrian proxy war; however, it is also entirely plausible and even likely that Netanyahu will use the deal as an excuse to escalate Israeli military action in the Golan and elsewhere in Syria. After all, he can now hold out the "no Iranian facilities within 40 kilometers" as a red line up for his interpretation. And international media and Western governments have already demonstrated a penchant for towing the Israeli line anytime Iran can be blamed as a culprit - evidence or no evidence.

We will be sure to defend ourselves with all means against this and any threat."And now after months of Israel issuing threats of "red lines" concerning Iranian troop and militia presence in Syria, The Jerusalem Post reveals the following It appears that Netanyahu may have accepted the deal while holding it up as future justification for any attack it might initiate on Syria from across the Golan. The Jerusalem Post continues Clearly, Israel remains deeply uncomfortable with the Syrian Army's overwhelming momentum of late, especially after the liberation of Deir Ezzor and Abu Kamal from ISIS and seeks to keep the fires burning in Syria, at least enough to bog down Assad and Iran, while bringing pressure to bear designed to force an Iranian and Hezbollah exit from the theater (especially now that Israel finds itself in a weakened position regarding its desire for full on regime change in Syria).According to a dubiously sourced BBC report from earlier this month, Syria stands accused of hosting a sizable Iranian military base south of Damascus, which Israel utilized to ratchet up rhetoric in preparing its case for strikes on supposed Iranian targets inside Syria before the international community. Israel has long justified its attacks inside Syria by claiming to be acting against Hezbollah and Iranian targets.Concerning Israeli policy and the Islamic State, The Jerusalem Post makes an astounding and surprising admission which further confirms that official Israeli policy prefers ISIS in Syria rather than Assad or Iran:It's certainly no secret that Israel has aggressively pursued regime change in Syria for years (perhaps even decades), but recent provocations, even while Russia maintains a significant presence in the air over Syria, has created an explosive mix which could blow up at any moment. Things have been especially tense along the contested Golan Heights region as each time Israel claims it's shelled from the Syrian territory bordering the country, the IDF retaliates for the attacks it inevitably blames on Damascus, despite the fact that terrorist groups have been controlling parts of those very bordering territories.Should reports of the Assad-Netanyahu deal be confirmed, it could actually be a positive step towards the continued winding down of the Syrian proxy war; however, it is also entirely plausible and even likely that Netanyahu will use the deal as an excuse to escalate Israeli military action in the Golan and elsewhere in Syria. After all, he can now hold out the "no Iranian facilities within 40 kilometers" as a red line up for his interpretation. And international media and Western governments have already demonstrated a penchant for towing the Israeli line anytime Iran can be blamed as a culprit - evidence or no evidence.

News article:
“There is no Iranian military force in Syria,” said Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman on Tuesday in an interview with the Ynet website. “Iran is not on our border. It’s true that there are some experts and advisers, but there is no military force there.” To really understand the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz Are you confused? So are we. This is not the same Lieberman who only two weeks ago, while visiting the army’s Northern Command, warned that “Israel would not allow an entrenchment of Shi’ite and Iranian forces in Syria. Anyone who doesn’t understand what I mean would do well to try and understand.” And didn’t Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say last August, at the end of a cabinet meeting, that “wherever ISIS exits Iran enters,” declaring that Israel strenuously objects to Iran and its satellites firming up their grip there? Two weeks later, at a meeting with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Netanyahu claimed that Iran was building facilities for producing accurate missiles in Syria and Lebanon. Even Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, who is usually very cautions, said recently in an interview to the online Saudi newspaper Elaph that Israel demands Iran and its Shi’ite militias pull back in Syria at least to the east of the Damascus-Sweida highway, which lies 37 miles from the border with Israel in the Golan Heights. “We won’t allow any Iranian presence. We’ve warned them not to build plants or military bases [there],” Eisenkot added. >>Israel strikes Iranian military base near Syria's Damascus, reports say<< Open gallery view An Israeli soldier sits atop a tank and his comrade stands nearby in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, close to Israel's frontier with Syria November 22, 2017. Credit: AMMAR AWAD/REUTERS The stream of announcements made by Israel is unclear. Are the Iranians already in southern Syria, and if so, in what capacity – as advisers attached to Shi’ite militias or as organic units of the Revolutionary Guard? Does Israel regard these militias as an actual Iranian force? Does Israel’s opposition and its new red lines apply to their presence throughout Syria or only in its south? And are there or aren’t there Iranian armaments factories in Syria and Lebanon? Israeli intelligence officials who were asked this week to make some sense out of this jumble gave the following analysis: Iran’s moves in Syria are part of its efforts to shape “the day after,” following the victory of the Assad regime and the collapse of the ISIS caliphate in the country’s eastern sectors. A race against time is taking place there, regarding the booty left behind by fleeing ISIS forces, between the alliance of the Syrian Democratic Forces, which unite a Kurdish militia with Sunni rebels and with the support of the United States, and Iran and the Shi’ite militias operating with its financial support and under its influence. Iran is continuously trying to establish a land corridor under its control, going from Iraq through Syria to Lebanon. Thus, General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force which is part of the Revolutionary Guard, is investing great efforts into taking the town of Al-Bukamal, which lies in a strategic location on the planned corridor. Soleimani was presented as a national hero in Tehran this week due to the victory over ISIS. >> Israel climbing up too high a tree over Iran’s presence in Syria | Analysis << The Iranians are still looking for achievements on the ground since they realize that the next phase, the political settlement in Syria, led by Russia, will be more difficult. The summit meeting convened by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week in Sochi ended in disagreement. Weighty questions such as the status of the Kurds and the future of Bashar al-Assad remained unresolved. Other moves are also complicated. Tehran wants a naval and air base in Syria and has already started building a base south of Damascus. In tandem, it is seeking approval to begin mining in Syria, including for uranium. It is pressuring Assad to sign contracts for huge business ventures as part of the planned efforts to rebuild Syria. However, both Assad and Russia have their reservations about Iran’s moves, with Israel’s threats as a backdrop. In the meantime nothing has been settled. It seems the construction of weapons factories in Lebanon has also come to a halt, while in Syria a large armaments factory, with connections to Iran, was bombed last September from the air. The bombing was attributed to Israel, which did not formally respond to these claims. With regard to troops on the ground, Israel believes that there are currently several hundred Iranian combatants in Syria. These belong to the Revolutionary Guard, some serving as advisers and others as commanders guiding Syrian and Shi’ite militia military operations. Militia fighters – from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan – get paid by Tehran. There are several thousand of these now in Syria, alongside 7,000 Hezbollah fighters. Hezbollah combatants, the militias and a few Iranian advisers are on the front line with rebels in the south of Syria. So far they have not been seen close to the border with Israel in the Golan. According to Israel’s analysis, Tehran wishes to establish an advance outpost in Syria, as it did previously with Hezbollah in Lebanon. This could be a slow and gradual process, but the Iranians have no intention of giving up on this goal. Israel’s moves are meant to at least deny the possibility of an Iranian presence in southern Syria and reduce the chances for establishing bases and a port in northern Syria. This is the backdrop for the threats, which are now backed by a diplomatic “blitz” of diplomats and intelligence officials being sent to the U.S. and European capitals to explain Israel’s point of view, both on southern Syria and developments in Lebanon, following the resignation zigzag of Lebanon’s Prime Minster Saad Hariri. These moves are attracting attentive ears, but it seems that in Syria the horses have already bolted. As far as the Iranians are concerned, they came to Syria to stay. If Israel tries to compel them to leave it could lead to military friction which could deteriorate into a wider conflict.

Such visits used to be an exception. Aside from the U.S. Sixth Fleet and the odd French vessel, NATO members minimized the display of open military ties with Israel. Twenty years ago, when Israel started holding joint naval maneuvers with the U.S. (at that time together with its great friend Turkey) they usually consisted of search and rescue missions. Much ceremony with little substance. Times have changed. Last month the Air Force held a large joint exercise in the Negev, called Blue Flag, which hosted air forces from the U.S. and six European nations. Brig. Gen. Amnon Ein-Dar, the head of the air force’s air division, told Haaretz that the exercise was the culmination of the air force’s annual training plan with foreign forces, in the course of which numerous other exercises were held abroad. Given the regional turmoil, he added, “It’s significant that Israel is part of a coalition of the positive forces. You see here an expression of what an aerial force can provide a country in terms of its strategic and diplomatic ties.” Ein-Dar said that the joint exercises provide a good basis for operational collaboration if this is ever needed. Overall, Israel currently benefits from its image in the Arab world as a wielder of immense power, and in Western states there is also a growing appreciation of its military and technological capabilities. The damage caused by the poor performance of the IDF in the Second Lebanon War has long been forgotten there. The new attitude towards Israel is connected to its being at the forefront of the war on terror and to the appreciation of its mostly clandestine operations against rival organizations, as part of what is termed the campaign between wars. Military establishments in the West and in friendly Arab countries are well acquainted with Israel’s capabilities. This has led to a growing desire for cooperation with the IDF, with Military Intelligence and other branches of the intelligence services, as part of the war on terror. It seems the international arena is more ripe for joint coalitions against terror, especially after the success of the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. There may be something else afoot: Against the backdrop of the atrocities taking place in the wars in the Arab world, our neighbors take a less severe view of the daily activities associated with Israel’s occupation, including the deaths of many Palestinian civilians in the rounds of war in Gaza (since Western countries, and certainly not Russia, showed no greater caution in their wars in the Middle East). This ties in indirectly to Eisenkot’s interview with Elaph. In fact, these were reciprocal gestures: on the part of the chief of staff who agreed to be interviewed on a Saudi website and on the part of the kingdom in agreeing to broadcast it. Eisenkot mentioned in the interview that he agreed with what the Saudi chief of staff said at a meeting of army chiefs, hosted by the Americans in Washington at the end of October, where the Saudi general talked about the need to block Iran’s expansion in the region. In other words, the two have no problem sitting together as colleagues at a conference (in contrast to the Lebanese chief of staff, who bailed out at the last minute due to Eisenkot’s presence). This is no blooming, public romance with the Sunni bloc, but gradually relations are shaping up, ones that would have been unthinkable five years ago.

News article:
Netanyahu Says Israel Won't Allow Iran to 'Entrench Itself Militarily' in Syria Sputnik News 05:39 03.12.2017(updated 10:07 03.12.2017) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has posted a video on his Facebook page, explaining his policy on Iran as well as the Syrian conflict. MOSCOW (Sputnik) – Israel will not allow Iran to have military a presence in Syria or its own nuclear weapons, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed shortly after an alleged Israeli strike on a target in Syria. "Let me reiterate Israel's policy. We will not allow a regime hell-bent on annihilation of the Jewish state to acquire nuclear weapons, we will not allow that regime to entrench itself militarily in Syria as it seeks to do for the express purpose of eradicating our state," Netanyahu said in a video message posted on his Facebook on Saturday. According to local media reports that haven't yet been officially confirmed by either Damascus or by Tel Aviv, Syria has repelled an Israeli attack on a "military position" near Damascus. Some media outlets speculated that the possible target may have been an Iranian base and several Iranian troops may have been injured in the attack allegedly carried out by Israel. Tehran has repeatedly denied reports of having a base in Syria as well as conducting military operations there, however, stressed its cooperation with the country's leadership in the fight against various terrorist groups, including Daesh, and acts as one of the guarantors of the ceasefire in the Arab Republic jointly with Russia and Turkey. While Syria and Israel, which have never signed a peace treaty, have repeatedly exchanged multiple tit-for-tat attacks, Netanyahu along with the country's defense minister stated that Tel Aviv is free to act in Syria for the sake of its security. Netanyahu's video was reportedly taped on Thursday and is expected to be shown in full on Sunday at the Brookings Institution's annual Saban Forum in Washington. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
A recent surge in alleged Israeli strikes on targets in Syria appears to suggest a new Israeli urgency to block Iran’s spread into the war-torn country. So far, neither Iran nor its terror proxies have retaliated. Yet the lack of retaliation is not something that can be counted on forever and Israel’s deterrence is not a cast iron concept that will always come through, warned a former senior Israeli defense official. “I do not know if [Iran and its proxies] are deterred or not,” Maj. Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, former national security advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told JNS. “It is clear that in the cost-benefit calculation…they ran through their considerations and concluded that launching a war [against Israel] is not something they should do. There is no telling when their considerations will change,” he said. The latest purported Israeli strikes in Syria targeted weapons production facilities and an Iranian military base. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Amidror, who also headed Israel’s National Security Council, cautioned about the limits of deterrence, saying that it “is an evasive matter that must be examined per incident.” In the new regional reality, Syria and Lebanon have merged into a single, two-part front, according to Israeli intelligence assessments. With Iran’s chief proxy, the heavily armed Hezbollah, deployed in both Lebanon and Syria, and with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps building up the military capabilities of Iran’s clients in Syria and Lebanon, it is seemingly no longer possible to view the Lebanese-Syrian border as holding any real significance. This was reflected in comments made by Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who stated in October, “In the next war in the north, there will be only one sector, the northern sector, Syria and Lebanon together.” This has required the IDF’s Northern Command and Military Intelligence Directorate to change the way they operate in Israel’s northern arena, allowing them to better track movements of weapons and fighters across the border. It has also affected Israeli planning, based on the understanding that an escalation in Syria can quickly trigger an escalation in Lebanon, and vice versa. Prof. Eyal Zisser, an expert on Syria at Tel Aviv University, said the Iranian-led axis has little interest in getting involved in an escalation with Israel over its reported strikes in Syria at this time. “It prefers to allow Syria to respond, or not to respond. Syria is no one’s land. This allows everyone that is part of this arena to avoid getting too entangled,” Zisser told JNS. “But I assume that Iran continues to try and consolidate itself in Syria, friction can be created that will eventually compel it to respond, if Israel continues to attack,” he said, adding, “At the moment the war there continues, and the priority [for Iran] is to first of all win, and leave Israel to the side.” Whether it is deterred by Israel, or simply too busy to become involved in a war with Jerusalem, the Iranian axis is continuing to make progress in linking Syria to the Iranian zone of influence. “On the one hand, they have a land corridor from Tehran, through Baghdad, to Damascus and Beirut. And they have forces in Syria,” Zisser said, describing Iran’s activities in the region. “On the other hand, the Russians will certainly try to limit them,” he said. “They have a presence and they cannot be ignored, but this does not mean that Syria is in their control.” Addressing Monday’s announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin of Moscow’s withdrawal of troops from Syria, Zisser said such statements cannot be relied upon. “Putin has already announced a withdrawal a few times, and in reality everyone stayed,” he said. “I think that this time too, the withdrawal will be partial and symbolic, and will not influence Russia’s presence and standing in Syria.” Zisser believes that while there are enough elements to prevent an escalation in Syria from triggering a new Hezbollah-Israel war at this time, a victory in Syria could prompt the Iranian axis to grow more provocative towards the Jewish state. “The Iran axis or Hezbollah could become more aggressive towards their rivals,” Zisser said. “That could increase tension in Lebanon.”

News article:
By Idrees Ali WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. general in Afghanistan said on Tuesday that he had not seen a change in Pakistan's support for militants so far, despite President Donald Trump taking a tougher line against Islamabad. U.S. officials have long been frustrated by what they see as Pakistan’s reluctance to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on Pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. In August, Trump outlined a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, chastising Pakistan over its alleged support for Afghan militants. He accused Pakistan of harboring “agents of chaos” and providing safe havens to militant groups waging an insurgency against a U.S.-backed government in Kabul. U.S. official expressed hope that relations between the two countries could improve after a kidnapped U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children were freed in Pakistan in October. The couple was abducted in neighboring Afghanistan. "We have been very direct and very clear with the Pakistanis... we have not seen those changes implemented yet," General John Nicholson told reporters. "We are hoping to see those changes, we are hoping to work together with the Pakistanis going forward to eliminate terrorists who are crossing" the border, Nicholson said. He said that he believed that senior Taliban leaders were based in Pakistan, while the lower-level leadership was in Afghanistan. Nicholson added that he agreed with other senior U.S. officials that Pakistan's main spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, had ties to the Haqqani network militant group. The United States in 2012 designated the Pakistan-based Haqqani network as a terrorist organization. Pakistan says it has done a great deal to help the United States in tracking down terrorists. The four-star general said he had seen evidence of relations between Iran and the Taliban in western Afghanistan and was closely tracking it. The United States has sent more than 3,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan as a part of Trump's South Asia strategy. Nicholson said over 1,000 troops would be advising Afghan troops at the battalion level, putting them closer to the fighting and at greater risk. Nicholson gave an optimistic view of the situation, saying he believed "we are on our way to a win." U.S. officials have made similar statements during the course of the 16-year-old war, but the situation according to many U.S. officials remains in a "stalemate." According to a recent report by a U.S. government watchdog, the Taliban had increased the amount of territory it has influence over or controls in Afghanistan in the past six months. The figures are a sign of the deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country, even as the United States has committed more troops.

According to a recent report by a U.S. government watchdog, the Taliban had increased the amount of territory it has influence over or controls in Afghanistan in the past six months. The figures are a sign of the deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country, even as the United States has committed more troops.

News article:
Pakistan has said it is holding talks with the United States in an effort to ‘bridge gap’ in perceptions between the two countries on issues related to war on terror and overall regional situation.Speaking at a weekly news briefing on Thursday, Foreign Office spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal admitted that Pakistan did not agree with the US policy on South Asia that President Trump announced in August this year.“There was a difference in understanding and perceptions on both sides,” the spokesperson said, adding that the gap in perceptions prompted the two sides to talk to each other. He listed a series of meetings between the two countries in recent months to iron out these differences.Faisal insisted that despite the differences, Pakistan and the US were trying to find a ‘common ground’ and move forward in bilateral relationship in a positive and cooperative manner. “The upcoming visit of US Defence Secretary James Mattis is part of efforts by the two sides to achieve that objective,” he said.His comments came at a time when the US is increasingly upset over the release of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of Nov 2008 Mumbai attacks. The State Department and White House have issued separate statements expressing serious reservations over Saeed’s release.Washington has warned that the development will have negative impact on the bilateral ties and that release of Saeed has exposed Pakistan’s claim that it is fighting the war on terror indiscriminately.Pakistani officials, however, insist that it was decision of a court and hence the government had little option to detain JuD leader.When asked to comment on the strong reaction from US on the development, the FO official said Saeed was detained under the maintenance of public order but refused to offer further comments, saying the Foreign Office had asked the Ministry of Interior for response.To a question on the recently held meeting of Saudi-led Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC), Faisal said the aim of defence ministers’ conference was to boost cooperation for combating terrorism through intelligence sharing, capacity building, joint exercises and media campaign.“We highlighted Pakistan’s successful counterterrorism operations and the comprehensive National Action Plan. We reiterated our willingness to share our experience with other countries in countering the menace of international terrorism,” he added.Reaffirming Pakistan’s historical and fraternal relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, he said the Defense Minister Khawaja Asif assured Saudi Arabia and the participating countries of Pakistan’s support and cooperation within the mutually agreed framework of the IMCTC.The spokesperson, however, said Pakistan was also in close contact with Iran at all levels.Iran, Iraq and Syria are not part of the Saudi coalition – a fact that has raised questions about the exact motive behind the coalition. Pakistan is adamant that the coalition is only meant to fight terrorism and is not aimed at any other Islamic country.On the latest launch of a cruise missile by India, the spokesperson said the testing was part of the ongoing build-up and induction of sophisticated weaponry and delivery systems by India.“Pakistan has consistently raised serious concerns about these developments as they negatively impact regional security and stability. This launch is yet another manifestation of the Indian negative trends.”Faisal said Pakistan for its part continues to stress the need for a meaningful dialogue for confidence building, avoidance of arms race and promotion of strategic stability in South Asia. Pakistan’s proposal for a Strategic Restraint Regime for South Asia remains on the table.He said it was no surprise that India chose to exercise ‘strategic restraint’ on its missile development prior to its application for MTCR membership.“The recent growth of missile tests by India after its MTCR membership, clearly demonstrates its policy of duplicity, ie, paying lip service to the goals of non-proliferation while developing conventional and non-conventional capabilities that not only undermine regional security but are inconsistent with non-proliferation norms as well,” he added.The spokesperson also expressed concerns over reports of Indian forces using chemical weapons in Indian occupied Kashmir. “We have noted with serious concern the media reports that you have referred to. Such reports need to be verified,” he said.Faisal said the Indian policy of denying access to any independent observers had raised legitimate concerns. “Should these reports find credence, this use would constitute a breach of Indian international obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Similar reports had emerged a few months before. We call for independent investigations into such reports, including through OPCW,” he added.

US Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis is scheduled to land in Pakistan on a day-long visit on Monday and is expected to discuss Washington’s latest strategy for South Asia.According to a statement issued by the US Department of Defence, quoting Pentagon, Mattis on Friday embarked on a five-day trip to Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and Kuwait.Mattis is scheduled to meet with leaders in each nation "to re-affirm the enduring US commitment to partnerships in the Middle East, West Africa and South Asia," said Pentagon in the statement.He will begin his engagements with a visit to Egypt on December 2 and then travel to Jordan on December 3. Mattis will then visit Pakistan on December 4 and then conclude his trip with a visit to Kuwait December 5During his visit to Pakistan, the US secretary of defence will meet with Prime Minister Khaqan Abbasi and Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, according to the statement, and seek support for defeating militants.US officials have long been frustrated by what they see as Pakistan’s reluctance to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on Pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighbouring Afghanistan.In August, Trump outlined a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, chastising Pakistan over its alleged support for Afghan militants. He accused Pakistan of harbouring “agents of chaos” and providing safe havens to militant groups waging an insurgency against a US-backed government in Kabul. Pakistan has vehemently denied all such claims.The top US general in Afghanistan General John Nicholson also said on November 28 that he had not seen a change in Pakistan’s support for militants so far, despite President Donald Trump taking a tougher line against Islamabad.Mattis had said in October 2017, the US would try “one more time” to work with Pakistan in Afghanistan before President Donald Trump would turn to options to address Islamabad’s alleged support for militant groups.

News article:
ISLAMABAD: US Secretary of Defense James Mattis is due to arrive in Islamabad on Monday to discuss matters in progress for eradicating terrorism from Pakistani soil, and the country’s role in Afghanistan — an agenda he underlined on Saturday to the media. “The US remains committed to a pragmatic relationship that expands … cooperation on shared interests while reinforcing President Trump’s call for action against terrorist safe havens,” the secretary said. This is Mattis’ first trip to Pakistan as defense secretary, though he has visited the country several times before. Mattis is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and will conclude his last leg in Kuwait of the five-day four-nation tour which began Friday in Egypt. Mattis is the second highest-ranking US official to visit Pakistan after Trump unveiled the US’ Afghanistan and South Asia policy on August 21. In October, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Pakistan to deliberate over the new strategy, which is devised to defeat the Afghan Taliban and compel them toward reconciliation dialogue with Kabul. In his previous visit to the region, Mattis opted to meet with the Afghan and Indian leadership to discuss details of the strategy while ignoring Pakistan. “There has been some sort of tactical adjustment between both countries for short-term goals on Afghanistan, otherwise his visit to the region previously skipped Pakistan,” foreign relations expert Qamar Cheema told Arab News. Relations between both countries soured when Trump accused Pakistan of harboring “agents of chaos” in August, questioning Pakistan’s resolve to uproot militancy, allegedly thriving in its backyard, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. However, a series of continuing military operations has cleansed much of its volatile tribal areas of terrorists and Pakistan has conveyed its commitment to ensuring peace in the region to the international community. Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman Muhammed Faisal at a press briefing last week said Mattis’ visit is a continuation of interaction on the policy in which differences persist. “This clearly indicates that dialogue between both the countries to bridge the gap in perceptions is ongoing. We are trying to find common grounds and move forward in our bilateral relationship with the US in a positive and cooperative manner.” Mattis has acknowledged that Pakistan is actively supporting the US strategy but wants assurances that it will not provide sanctuary to any proscribed groups, especially ones it doesn’t find detrimental to its interests. Addressing the media, he said: “The bottom line is that Pakistan has to act in its own best interest. They know this” and stressed that its non-NATO ally must cooperate with the US and honor sacrifices of its countrymen with a zero-tolerance approach toward terror elements. The US wants Pakistan to promote reconciliation with the Taliban, which it hopes will be a step closer to ending the 16-year ongoing war in Afghanistan. Mattis said: “It’s a continued dialogue, in what our vision is for the Afghan peace process, which is based on four R’s” plus sustain which stand for regionalize, realign, reinforce, reconcile, an abridged description of Trump’s policy. US firmly believes Pakistan’s role is instrumental for the reconciliation process in Afghanistan. Analysts observe that both countries have differences on rules of reconciliation engagement. The US wants the Taliban forces to be stopped and squeezed by Pakistan and US-led forces between the Pak-Afghan border region, leaving no option but for them to negotiate. Pakistan wants to separate the good from the bad and have open dialogue with those who wish to talk, and strike those who refuse. Mattis’ visit to Pakistan signals a further improvement in relations, said Cheema. “Pakistan has given assurances which show relations may stay on track between both states.” The US is important for Pakistan, even though its northern neighbor China’s massive investment under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project has given the country a sense of stability and security as its economic crisis widens, he says. “The US has a global footprint. Its support on the world forum is essential. Pakistan needs that and can’t afford the US being anti-Pakistan.” In terms of defense, no matter what China can offer, “the US military hardware is reliable in comparison.”

News article:
CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) Chief Mike Pompeo has warned Pakistan that if it does not eliminate the alleged safe havens inside its territory, the United States will do “everything we can” to destroy them, said Tolo News.The warning came when he was asked at the Reagan National Defence Forum in Simi, California, on November 2, how the Trump administration would persuade Islamabad to adhere to its new Afghan strategy.“You begin by seeking their assistance,” Pompeo said.US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis is arriving in Pakistan today (Monday) and is likely to pressure Islamabad to do more against militant groups. He is expected to meet Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Chief of the Army Chief (COAS) Qamar Javed Bajwa during the visit. He will also visit Egypt, Jordan and Kuwait.The CIA chief said that Mattis would also “make clear the president’s intent” during his stay in Pakistan and “will deliver the message that we would love you to do that.”Pompeo said safe havens inside Pakistan have been detrimental in allowing the US “to do what we needed to do in Afghanistan”.He explained how the Trump’s administration would deal with the situation if Pakistan ignored the US request.“In the absence of the Pakistanis achieving that (ridding their country of insurgent bases), we are going to do everything we can to make sure that that safe-havens no longer exist.”US officials have long been frustrated by what they see as Pakistan’s reluctance to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network that they believe exploit safe havens on Pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighbouring Afghanistan.Pakistan, however, denies sheltering the militants, and the issue has emerged as a major irritant to bilateral ties between the US and Pakistan.This story originally appeared on Tolo News

CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) Chief Mike Pompeo has warned Pakistan that if it does not eliminate the alleged safe havens inside its territory, the United States will do “everything we can” to destroy them, said Tolo News.The warning came when he was asked at the Reagan National Defence Forum in Simi, California, on November 2, how the Trump administration would persuade Islamabad to adhere to its new Afghan strategy.“You begin by seeking their assistance,” Pompeo said.US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis is arriving in Pakistan today (Monday) and is likely to pressure Islamabad to do more against militant groups. He is expected to meet Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Chief of the Army Chief (COAS) Qamar Javed Bajwa during the visit. He will also visit Egypt, Jordan and Kuwait.The CIA chief said that Mattis would also “make clear the president’s intent” during his stay in Pakistan and “will deliver the message that we would love you to do that.”Pompeo said safe havens inside Pakistan have been detrimental in allowing the US “to do what we needed to do in Afghanistan”.He explained how the Trump’s administration would deal with the situation if Pakistan ignored the US request.“In the absence of the Pakistanis achieving that (ridding their country of insurgent bases), we are going to do everything we can to make sure that that safe-havens no longer exist.”US officials have long been frustrated by what they see as Pakistan’s reluctance to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network that they believe exploit safe havens on Pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighbouring Afghanistan.Pakistan, however, denies sheltering the militants, and the issue has emerged as a major irritant to bilateral ties between the US and Pakistan.This story originally appeared on Tolo News

News article:
Islamabad: Defence Secretary Jim Mattis met with top Pakistani leaders on Monday to seek common ground on the counterterrorism fight, amid Trump administration calls for Islamabad to more aggressively go after the insurgents moving back and forth across the border with Afghanistan. In brief comments before their meeting began, Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said his country is committed to the war on terror and shares the same common objectives as the US. “Engagement is there,” he said, adding that they “need to move forward with [the] issues at hand.” Mattis did not speak while media were present. Earlier, Mattis told reporters travelling with him that he wants to work with Pakistan to address the problems, adding that the US is committed to a pragmatic relationship that expands cooperation while also “reinforcing President [Donald] Trump’s call for action against terrorist safe havens”. “We have heard from Pakistan leaders that they do not support terrorism. So I expect to see that sort of action reflected in their policies,” Mattis said before his trip to Islamabad. Mattis met with Abbasi and army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, as well as a number of senior Pakistani leaders and military officials and US Ambassador David Hale. Asked if he was going to press the Pakistani leaders to take more action against the insurgents, Mattis said: “That’s not the way I deal with issues. I believe that we work hard on finding the common ground and then we work together.” Mattis’ optimism, however, comes despite persistent US assertions that Islamabad is still not doing enough to battle the Taliban and allied Haqqani network insurgents within its borders. Since the start of the war in Afghanistan, militants in Pakistan have crossed the mountainous and ill-defined border to wage attacks against US, Afghan and allied forces. They then would return to their safe havens in Pakistan, where they have had a long-standing relationship with the ISI, Islamabad’s intelligence agency. In a blunt assessment early last week, General John Nicholson, the top US commander in Afghanistan, said there have been no changes in Pakistan’s support for militant networks. He said Pakistani leaders went to Kabul and met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. “They identified certain steps that they were going to take. We’ve not yet seen those steps play out,” Nicholson told reporters in a recent briefing. The US, he said, has been very direct about what it expects Pakistan to do in the fight against the Taliban. “We’re hoping to see those changes,” he said. “We’re hoping to work together with the Pakistanis going forward to eliminate terrorists who are crossing” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The White House, meanwhile, condemned Pakistan’s release late last month of a US-wanted militant as a “step in the wrong direction” and warned that it could harm Islamabad’s relations with the US and its reputation around the world. In August, the US said it would hold up $255 million (Dh936 million) in military assistance for Pakistan until it cracks down on extremists threatening Afghanistan. Imtiaz Gul, an Islamabad security analyst, said US officials always come to Islamabad with their “own wish list”. “I am sure the US defence secretary is also carrying a wishlist with him but I don’t think Pakistan will accept any dictation as it has already demonstrated its seriousness in fighting terrorism, and Washington in recent weeks has appreciated and acknowledged Pakistan’s sacrifices in war on terror,” he said. Gul said relations between Pakistan and the US have gone from bad to worse since the Trump administration announced an Afghan strategy in which Pakistan was degraded and India was elevated. “Pakistan is genuinely concerned,” he said. President Donald Trump’s tough words about Pakistan as he unveiled the updated US strategy for the war in Afghanistan, infuriated Islamabad and triggered anti-US protests there that Pakistani police had to use tear gas to disperse Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said during a visit to Washington in October that Pakistan was willing to cooperate fully with the Trump administration. He said Pakistan had wiped out militant hideouts with little help from the US. Mattis’ trip to Pakistan comes at the end of a short trip to the region, including stops in Egypt, Jordan and Kuwait.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi today chaired a meeting to review progress on construction of the road infrastructure and allied works for Metro Bus Services connecting the capital with the new Islamabad International Airport (NIIA). pic.twitter.com/tGQzzgYTLw — PTV News (@PTVNewsOfficial) December 4, 2017 US Defence Secretary James Mattis held talks with the Pakistani civil and military leadership on Monday and the outcome of the meetings suggests that the way is being paved for the two sides to find a “common ground” for cooperation in the war in Afghanistan.As Mattis treaded lightly during his visit, he was told that Pakistan had been prepared to look into the possibility of “miscreants” exploiting Islamabad’s hospitality to Afghan refugees, while on his part he agreed to look into Pakistan’s “legitimate concerns”, including India’s growing footprint in Afghanistan.Although the underlying message from Mattis echoed the larger concern of President Donald Trump administration about Pakistan’s role in the fight against terrorism, the defence secretary’s tone was not as harsh as some of the statements given by other American officials.A US embassy statement issued after Mattis’ meeting with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and separate talks with Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa at the General Headquarters (GHQ), the defence secretary reiterated that Pakistan must “redouble its efforts to confront militants and terrorists operating within the country”.However, unlike the embassy statement, an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) hand-out gave a detailed account of what transpired between the army chief and the US defence secretary.The ISPR statement also reflected Mattis’ concern, but the choice of words was different. It said Mattis highlighted concerns that a few elements continued to use Pakistan’s territory to further their terrorist agenda in Afghanistan.The Prime Minister’s Office also issued a separate statement. The real business, nevertheless, appeared to have been discussed at the GHQ parleys. The military’s media wing said Mattis made it clear that the aim of his visit was not to make any demands but find common grounds to work together.The ISPR said the meeting focused on regional security with particular emphasis on Afghanistan as well as other matters of mutual interest. While insisting that Pakistan had eliminated safe havens from its soil, the army chief told Mattis: “We are prepared to look into the possibility of miscreants exploiting Pakistan’s hospitality to Afghan refugees to the detriment of our Afghan brothers.”The army chief acknowledged the history of US engagements with Pakistan, especially the on-going efforts for peace in the region. He said Pakistan had done much more than its due share despite the capacity constraints and would remain committed to peace as a responsible member of international community.Bajwa reiterated Pakistan’s support for peace and stability in the region and highlighted Pakistan’s concerns over Indian use of Afghan soil, the need for Afghan refugees’ respectable and early repatriation and the existence of terrorist safe havens across the border in Afghanistan.Mattis expressed his respect for the Pakistan armed forces and the effective operations undertaken against terrorists. He assured the US was ready to play its role in addressing Pakistan’s legitimate concerns, saying that his aim was not to make demands but find common grounds to work together.The army chief appreciated the defence secretary’s understanding of the underlying issues and emphasised that Pakistan did not require anything from the US but an understanding. Both sides agreed to work towards specific and sustained actions on each other’s concerns.The embassy statement said Mattis recognised Pakistan’s sacrifices in the war against terrorism. “The secretary emphasised the vital role that Pakistan can play in working with the United States and others to facilitate a peace process in Afghanistan that brings stability and security to the region,” it said.Separately, meeting with Prime Minister Abbasi, the US Defence Secretary underscored the importance of continuing and deepening cooperation for the common objective of eliminating terrorism from the region.Mattis told Abbasi that in view of his long association with Pakistan, he was aware of the sacrifices rendered and the lives lost in Pakistan’s fight against terrorism and extremism; and his personal respect and appreciation for the professional abilities of Pakistan’s armed forces.Recalling Pakistan’s longstanding relationship with the US, Abbasi stressed the need for a broad-based engagement to strengthen the partnership and enhance cooperation between the two countries.He agreed with Secretary Mattis that both Pakistan and the US have common stakes in securing peace and security in Afghanistan for the long-term stability of the region. The prime minister also appreciated the US resolve not to allow the use of Afghan soil against Pakistan.Highlighting the recent counter-terrorism operations to improve the law and order situation, the PM noted that Pakistan, in its national interest, would continue to conduct intelligence-based operations all over the country to consolidate the gains achieved in the last four years.He reiterated that there are no safe havens in Pakistan and the entire nation was committed to its resolve on eradicating terrorism once and for all in all its forms and manifestations.Earlier, en route to Pakistan, Mattis told reporters he would not use pressure as a tactic, and insisted he would do "some listening". When asked if he would "prod" Islamabad to take more action, he replied: "That's not the way I deal with issues. I believe that we work hard on finding the common ground, and then we work together, so that's the approach I want to take."Asked if he saw any indication that Pakistan was “open to do more”, Mattis replied in the affirmative. He referred to the army chief’s visit to Kabul in recent months, saying: “I would look at General Bajwa’s statements about Pakistan taking the lead on certain issues.”(With additional input from news desk)

WASHINGTON: Mantra of ‘do more’ is echoing in Islamabad ahead of the first visit of US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who has been cautious publicly stating that he does not plan to “prod” Pakistan, but expects it adhere to its promises to combat terrorism, as he embarks on his first visit to Islamabad as the Pentagon chief. Mattis will hold meetings Monday (today) with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa. During the meetings, he will discuss regional security, peace, Afghan conflict and other bilateral issues. Mattis on Friday began his crucial five-day tour of the Middle East and Pakistan. He will also visit Egypt, Jordan and Kuwait during his tour. "In Afghanistan, we have heard from Pakistan leaders that they do not support terrorism. So I expect to see that sort of action reflected in their policies," Mattis said during his visit to Egypt. His final stop will be in Kuwait on Tuesday, where he will meet with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah. On November 24, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif had confirmed that Mattis would conduct a one-day visit to the country. Speaking aboard a military plane, Mattis said he does not expect to butt heads during his Monday meetings with the PM and the army chief. “That’s not the way I deal with issues,” Mattis said. “I believe that we [can] work hard on finding common ground and then we work together.” Mattis will communicate Trump administration’s new policy about South Asia. In October, Mattis warned the United States is willing to work “one more time” with Pakistan before taking “whatever steps are necessary” to address its alleged support for militants, the Voice of America reported. But on Sunday, Mattis said he is focused on trying to find “more common ground ... by listening to one another without being combative.” The United States has for a decade accused Pakistan of sheltering or having ties to terrorists, such as the Haqqani Network and the Afghan Taliban, which attack Nato coalition forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. Islamabad rejects the accusation, saying Washington is scapegoating Pakistan for its own failures in Afghanistan, where the United States remains in a stalemate after 16 years of war. Before Mattis’s visit, other Trump administration officials are taking a harder public stance on Pakistan. Speaking at a defence forum on Saturday, CIA director Mike Pompeo said, “We are going to do everything we can to ensure that safe havens no longer exist,” if Pakistan does not heed the US message on militants. Since 2004, the CIA has conducted drone strikes -- mostly against al-Qaida and Pakistani Taliban targets -- in northwest Pakistan, near the border with Afghanistan. The United States is considering expanding those strikes, along with several other measures, according to media reports. Other options include downgrading Pakistan’s status as a major non-Nato ally or sanctioning individual Pakistani leaders suspected of having ties with the Taliban. But any kind of punitive action wouldn’t take place for at least a few weeks at minimum, predicts Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst with the Woodrow Wilson Centre. "I think [the administration] wants to give the Pakistanis a bit more time to see if they're responding to the various demands the United States made of them when it comes to cracking down on terrorists," said Kugelman. One of the likelier US responses, according to Kugelman, is expanding not only the geographic scope of the drone war, but also widening the type of targets the United States goes after. "I think we could start seeing the US trying to target more Haqqani Network and Afghan Taliban targets," especially in the sparsely populated Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, he said. The Trump administration has also threatened cut off aid to Pakistan. Since 2002, the United States has given over $33 billion in assistance to Pakistan. But the aid has already been cut sharply in recent years. If ties were to deteriorate, the United States also has much to lose. Pakistan controls US military supply routes to landlocked Afghanistan, and could close them down, as they did in 2011. The United States would also like Pakistan to scale back its nuclear modernisation, improve ties with India, and stay engaged in the broader fight against Islamic militants. But despite the risks, Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, warns Washington appears to be running out of patience. "For many years we were trying to hold out hope that the Pakistanis would change their mind about Afghanistan and our role there," he said. "But those kinds of hopes aren't as prevalent anymore. And on balance, therefore, I think we are closer to using some of those tougher methods." Mattis wouldn’t elaborate on any possible US action. But he says the situation is pressing. “There’s always an urgency to something when 39 nations plus Afghanistan have their troops in the midst of a long war where casualties are being taken,” he said.

News article:
Managing relations with the US has always remained Pakistan’s greatest foreign policy challenge. Military rulers whether it was Ayub, Zia or Musharraf sought legitimacy by submitting to America’s global and regional agenda and relations remained generally satisfactory and even cordial. The most recent and glaring example of this cooperation was Pakistan’s robust support to the Afghan Jihad during Soviet occupation and later its involvement in Afghanistan after the events of 9/11. But these expedient policies had long-term consequences whose ill affects are visible even now.It is somewhat sad that either by coincidence or otherwise whenever civilian governments have been in power, whether it was the PPP or the PML-N, they were subjected to US sanctions or remained under pressure. It was Pakistan’s nuclear programme that was the rationale, although during military regimes for expedient reasons it was overlooked by Washington.Once again we are undergoing a very challenging phase of our relationship with the US. We are being continuously blamed for providing sanctuary to the Haqqani Network and the Taliban Shura. Denial by the Pakistani side is not accepted on its face value and the commander of Nato-led coalition in Afghanistan, Gen John Nicholson, said that Pakistan has not changed in its support for the Haqqani Network and the Taliban Shura, the very groups that they are fighting. The secretary of state and senior members of the department of defence have made similar scathing statements. This accusation clearly implies as if Pakistan is not an ally but working against the US’s interests.The visit of Secretary of Defence General Mattis was rightly given great weightage, as he is one of the few members of the administration that enjoys the confidence of President Trump. The way the state department has been sidelined and the secretary of state apparently on the way out, the department of defence has assumed great importance.Pakistan’s relations with the US are going through a difficult and unpredictable phase. No doubt allegations that Pakistan is providing sanctuary to the Haqqani Network and Taliban leadership is nothing new, but since President Trump has assumed office he has taken a very strong stand on the question of sanctuaries. The warnings by the state department and General Nicholson’s statement preceding Gen Mattis’s visit shows that either the US does not believe in the veracity of Pakistan’s version or deliberately accuses us to scapegoat its failures. In fact, it is more of the latter. For in recent months, Pakistan has taken effective measures to ensure that the Haqqani Network and the Taliban leadership do not use Pakistan’s territory. It is clear that our army has taken very concrete steps that the Taliban or its ally the Haqqani Network does not operate from the Pakistani soil. But surely, it does not want to antagonise the Taliban leadership to an extent that should make them its enemy, as Pakistan is already facing the challenge of coping with Indian and Afghan hostility. Moreover, Pakistan’s contention is that the Taliban are a significant force in Afghanistan and merely relying on military force to subjugate the insurgency is unlikely to succeed. The solution lies in giving greater weightage to political engagement.The visit of Mr Tillerson, secretary of state, and the recent one of Secretary of Defence General James Mattis suggests the pressure Trump administration is mounting on Pakistan. Indications are that the Pakistan Army will go only to some extent in meeting the US’s demands. As the Foreign Office spokesperson stated recently Pakistan would try to seek common ground. This point has been reiterated during the middle-tier talks that took place recently as well.Withholding of the Coalition Support Fund of $700 million by the US has also not been well received, as this is the amount that Pakistan has already spent in providing services. If unfortunately, measures taken by Pakistan are unable to satisfy the Pentagon and the Trump administration it could lead to the US stepping up drone attacks. It could also withdraw the Non-Nato ally status and completely cut off aid. The worst-case scenario would be if the US’s expected winter offensive against the Taliban fails. In its frustration, it could unjustly blame Pakistan as sponsor of terrorism and apply strict UN sanctions. Pakistan understands all this but can only go that far while protecting its national interests. If the unfairly US pressure on Pakistan continues it will only push it more into the fold of the Chinese. Pakistan, meanwhile, is also trying to improve relations with Russia and Iran and focus more on Muslim countries. Its efforts to a large extent have been fairly successful. Furthermore, with the US engaged in serious confrontation with North Korea, having extremely tense relations with Iran and deep involvement in Syria, will it be prepared to open another front against Pakistan? However, President Trump and his team in the interim will keep the pressure, blowing hot and cold but keeping the channels of communication open. Despite the US’s present attitude it understands Pakistan’s value in the region and will only go that far. Meanwhile, it is expected that the Pakistan Army will keep a tight leash on the Haqqani Network, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Lashkar-e-Taiba so that it does not provide the US any excuse to malign it. Pakistan understands that there are mandatory obligations based on the UN resolutions 1267 and 1822 that compel it to take effective measures against these organisations. Meanwhile, civil and military leadership are likely to step up efforts to improve relations with Afghanistan by removing their misgivings.Despite recent setbacks Pakistan needs to make every effort to improve relations with Washington. It ought to step up the channels of traditional diplomacy — mutual visits by political and military leadership. Pakistan in the past has neglected public diplomacy, which too could play an effective role in correcting our image. This would require greater interaction at the civil society level. Pakistani intellectuals and diaspora need to be more active in their interaction with US think tanks such as Brookings, Carnegie, Hudson Institute and American Enterprise. These institutions play a major role in influencing American policy at the White House, the state department and the department of defence.Published in The Express Tribune, December 6, 2017.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

Pakistan, meanwhile, is also trying to improve relations with Russia and Iran and focus more on Muslim countries. Its efforts to a large extent have been fairly successful. Furthermore, with the US engaged in serious confrontation with North Korea, having extremely tense relations with Iran and deep involvement in Syria, will it be prepared to open another front against Pakistan? However, President Trump and his team in the interim will keep the pressure, blowing hot and cold but keeping the channels of communication open. Despite the US’s present attitude it understands Pakistan’s value in the region and will only go that far. Meanwhile, it is expected that the Pakistan Army will keep a tight leash on the Haqqani Network, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Lashkar-e-Taiba so that it does not provide the US any excuse to malign it. Pakistan understands that there are mandatory obligations based on the UN resolutions 1267 and 1822 that compel it to take effective measures against these organisations. Meanwhile, civil and military leadership are likely to step up efforts to improve relations with Afghanistan by removing their misgivings.Despite recent setbacks Pakistan needs to make every effort to improve relations with Washington. It ought to step up the channels of traditional diplomacy — mutual visits by political and military leadership. Pakistan in the past has neglected public diplomacy, which too could play an effective role in correcting our image. This would require greater interaction at the civil society level. Pakistani intellectuals and diaspora need to be more active in their interaction with US think tanks such as Brookings, Carnegie, Hudson Institute and American Enterprise. These institutions play a major role in influencing American policy at the White House, the state department and the department of defence.Published in The Express Tribune, December 6, 2017.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

Pakistan is rolling up its sleeves as it prepares to face off against India in all important case before the world judicial body, as the top brass of the country will be briefed on the matter of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jhadav.Sources informed The Express Tribune that Pakistan’s legal team, led by its top attorney Khawar Qureshi, will give a briefing to Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi today (Thursday) on the details of the final memorandum, which would be filed before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on December 13.It was also learnt that the Foreign Office, the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP), and the military establishment are all working on finalising the memorandum. The federal government has also sought legal assistance from two top Pakistani lawyers as well. Qureshi, however, will lead Pakistan’s legal team. It is expected that final hearings of the case will be conducted in the next couple of months.India on September 13 submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jhadav being tried by a military court in Pakistan. The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him counsellor access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad-hoc judge for the case at The Hague.Legal experts are urging all the stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum. Recently, Pakistan has offered India a meeting of Jhadav with his wife on humanitarian grounds.The ICJ on May 18 halted the execution of Jhadav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Sources revealed that Pakistan in its pleadings will be filing a dossier on various human rights violations committed by India in the past to highlight its lack of respect for human rights.“It will also be providing evidence of terror financing network which was penetrated and broken because of information revealed by Jhadav, including his confession,” they further informed.A senior lawyer, who has expertise in international law, contended that India cannot obtain an acquittal or the release of Jadhav on the basis of its application.Jhadev alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, a serving Indian Navy officer working with the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – India’s premier intelligence agency – was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed over into Pakistan via the Iran border.He was found in possession of an Indian passport issued by the Government of India on May 12, 2015, and valid until May 11, 2024. He confessed that he is a resident of Mumbai, India, still serving in the navy, and is scheduled to retire in 2022. The videos of his confession circulated widely in the media. He was convicted of espionage, sabotage, and terrorism by a field general court martial (FGCM) under Section 59 of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 and Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act of 1923.He confessed before a magistrate and the court that he was tasked by RAW to plan, coordinate and organise espionage and sabotage activities aimed at destabilising Pakistan.Among the charges, he was convicted for were sponsoring and directing IEDs and grenade attacks in Gwadar and Turbat. He also directed attacks on the radar station and civilian boats in the sea, opposite Jiwani Port. He funded subversive secessionist and terrorist elements through hundi for turning Pakistani youth against the country, especially in Balochistan. He sponsored attacks on gas pipelines and other infrastructure, an IED explosion in Quetta in 2015, causing massive damage to life and property, and attacks on Hazaras in Quetta and Shia Zaireen en route to and from Iran.He abetted attacks through anti-state elements against LEAs in Turbat, Punjgur, Gwadar, Pasni and Jiwani during 2014-2015, killing and injuring many civilians and soldiers. He also launched a website with subversive content in support of anti-Pakistan elements. Pakistan repeatedly requested Indian assistance in the investigation but to no avail.

News article:
Pakistan-US relations have seen a comparatively positive curve after the recent visit of US Defence Secretary James Mattis to Islamabad. While not overwhelmingly optimistic, the visit was a ray of hope for an otherwise fraught relationship between the two countries. Americans for the first time conveyed a resolve against possible use of anti-Pakistan activity from the Afghan soil; an indirect way of addressing Pakistani concerns about provision of strategic space to India in Afghanistan. However, the old rhetoric of ‘do more’ still remained a major agenda point for the US, implicitly accusing Islamabad of playing a double game.The Pakistani response this time was unambiguous in its denial of having any terrorist safe havens inside Pakistan. It must be appreciated that while Islamabad also has obvious interest in a stable Afghanistan, it does not have an absolute convergence of strategic interests with the US anymore and no amount of diplomatic small talk can change the facts on ground. To Pakistan, the American altruistic intent of staying indefinitely in Afghanistan “till it restores stability” is now increasingly being seen as an excuse for pursuing its geopolitical and economic goals in Central and South Asia. The US demands seem insatiable to meet not because Pakistan lacks the strength or candour but because they now seem to be premised on venal interest and insincerity.The frosty welcomes given to two important Washington envoys recently, Rex Tillerson and James Mattis, were adroit diplomatic expressions from Islamabad to kick-start negotiations based on some notion of equivalence. This also sent out clear messages to Washington that Pakistan was not rattled by Washington’s threats like the ones made by CIA chief Mike Pompeo before the Mattis visit. Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif’s statement about enhancing strategic ties with Russia and China were also carefully calibrated to time with the recent visit and subtly conveyed Pakistan’s options to Washington. To be fair, the insulting public declarations of the US using ‘powerful options’ against Pakistan if it did not comply are unintelligent and counter-productive ways of conveying intent. Similarly, recent assertions of US Chief of Staff Gen Joseph F Dunford and others against the Inter-Services Intelligence and its alleged links with terror outfits seem to be staggeringly hypocritical and are severely irking off the establishment since the US’s own involvement in creating and funding Islamic State in Syria and its support for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan in Afghanistan is no more a subject relegated to the realm of conspiracy. Iran, Russia and China are all deeply concerned and making their own intelligence inroads into Afghan power dynamics.Brash US diplomacy against Pakistan is clearly a façade for its vulnerability and failure in Afghanistan. Tillerson met Ghani at Bagram military airbase before arriving at Islamabad and in a most intellectually insulting manner the photographs of Bagram were digitally doctored to give an image that the meeting actually took place in Kabul. With vast swathes of territory, including the capital itself out of joint US-Afghan control, the idea of terrorists using safe havens in Pakistan seems ludicrous, and the continuous harping on this tune is ticking off Islamabad where the military confidently asserts that no-go areas do not exist on its territory anymore. In fact, top US delegations have already been hosted in erstwhile terrorist strongholds like North Waziristan to prove the point. Opinions and allegations, however, move faster than understanding and for the US, the quick selling rhetoric of safe havens is a constant theme to keep Pakistan under pressure.From the geopolitical viewpoint, permanent presence on Afghan turf supports the US to pursue its strategic objective of containing China. America’s ulterior motives were laid bare when in an apparent measure to appease India, its posture towards CPEC recently changed and was described as passing through disputed territory. This cements Pakistan’s suspicions that the US would assist Indians in destabilising CPEC to scuttle the Chinese strategic initiative through terrorist proxies already deployed and operating in Pakistan.Both Tillerson and Mattis were apparently furnished with irrefutable evidence of Indian involvement in terrorist activities in Pakistan, probably just as a bargaining chip at the negotiating table since the US is most definitely privy to the development already. While it has tried to alleviate Pakistani concerns in this regard during the Mattis visit, the US still continues to hedge support for the Indian propaganda of calling the legitimate indigenous freedom struggle in India-Occupied Kashmir (IOK) a terrorist enterprise funded by Islamabad. It is also conveniently turning a blind eye to Indian brutalities and human rights abuses in IOK and its frequent violations of the LoC. The US expectation of an honest and willing support from Pakistan after such overt and malicious diplomatic and economic hostility is unrealistic, duplicitous and unwise; a reality aptly conveyed to Mattis. Pakistanis, it appears, are no more willing to carry their own cross to crucifixion. That said, the apparently honest appraisal of this troubled relationship by both sides in the last visit seems like a glimmer of hope for the future.Published in The Express Tribune, December 9, 2017.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has informed India that the wife and mother of Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, serving Commander of the Indian Navy, will be issued visas for a meeting at the end of this month. “The visit should happen on 25th December, 2017. A diplomat from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad will be allowed to accompany the visitors. Requisite security would be provided to the visitors,” spokesman at the Foreign Office announced today. “In what looks like a quid pro quo, India appears to have dropped the Pakistan specific condition of attaching a letter from the Pakistan foreign minister while applying for a medical visa. Indian officials say, “Now common man [Pakistanis] is directly calling Sushma ji on twitter and she is responding with visas. Jadhav, an undercover RAW officer, is presently on death row after he confessed to carrying out and facilitating acts of espionage and terrorism inside Pakistan. He was captured inside Balochistan. He was sentenced to death by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) under the Pakistan Army Act. Earlier in November, the Pakistan Army had allowed Jadhav a meeting only with his wife on purely humanitarian grounds and based on Islamic traditions and jurisprudence. However, Jadhav’s wife was initially reluctant to travel alone to Pakistan and had requested for her mother-in-law Avantika Jadhav to accompany her. With India moving the International Court of Justice, which gave a stay for Jadhav’s execution, there was pressure from India and some world capitals to also allow the mother of Jadhav and an Indian official to also be present in the meeting, and complete security should be guaranteed to the visitors. Pakistan relented and the Foreign Office was conveyed of Rawalpindi’s decision, which in turn informed the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi. There was quick reaction from India on Friday, which accepted Pakistan’s announcement, with Sushma Swaraj , Minister (MEA), tweeting, “Government of Pakistan has conveyed that they will give visa to the mother and wife of Kulbhushan Jadhav. Pakistan has agreed to facilitate the visit of mother and wife of Kulbhushan Jadhav and assured us of their safety, security and freedom of movement in Pakistan.” Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif has written to his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj regarding the provocative ceasefire violations by the Indian army and the recent extra-judicial killings of innocent Kashmiris. “In 2017, India had violated the Line of Control 1,300 times and as a result, 52 citizens had been killed and 175 had been injured. We also condemn the extra-judicial killings of eight young Kashmiris and destruction of houses by Indian forces,” said the spokesman. Pakistan has repeatedly raised its concerns about the hegemonic conduct of India, including the unprecedented escalation of ceasefire violations this year by Indian occupation forces at the Working Boundary and LoC in an attempt to deflect the attention of the international community from the continuing Indian atrocities against Kashmiris in Indian Held Kashmir. He also brushed aside an earlier statement made by CIA Director Mike Pompeo , made a day before the US Secretary of Defense reached Islamabad, warning Pakistan that the US would step in to destroy militant safe havens. “The statement that came a day before an important visit was unnecessary and contrary to the facts,” the spokesperson said, adding that during his visit, Mattis had praised the professional conduct of Pakistan’s armed forces. Meanwhile, the spokesperson noted that incidents of kidnapping of Pakistanis from Afghanistan are increasing. He asked Pakistani citizens in Afghanistan to take caution and register with the Pakistan Embassy on an urgent basis. “Pakistani nationals in Afghanistan are cautioned to exercise extreme vigilance as off-late senior professionals working in different fields have been kidnapped. Pakistanis either considering employment positions or currently working in Afghanistan must take into consideration their personal safety and well being before accepting employment or continuing their residency in Afghanistan,” he added. China too on Friday cautioned that Chinese-invested organisations and Chinese citizens to increase security awareness, strengthen internal precautions, reduce trips outside as much as possible, and avoid crowded public spaces because of imminent terrorist attacks against them. While the Air Force chief made claims that in future any US drone or other aircraft that trespasses inside Pakistan air space will be shot down, to a query the spokesman replied, “On drone strikes, our policy is clear and already in public domain. There is no change or policy shift.” In the past Pakistan has refrained from bringing down US drones. While former US President Barrack Obama compared his successor Donald Trump to Hitler for his policy to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the spokesman announced that since OIC is holding an emergency session in the next few days, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will attend. “Our foreign minister will attend the Council of Foreign Minister’s Session of the OIC. We will follow the policy that OIC adopts at the end of this Emergency Session,” he remarked.

ISLAMABAD: Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, currently on death row in Pakistan, has been allowed to meet with his family members from India. Pakistani authorities have finalized all the arrangements for the meeting, a Foreign Ministry official told Arab News. His wife and mother will travel to Pakistan to meet him on Dec. 25. Earlier this week, Islamabad accepted New Delhi’s demand to allow Jadhav’s mother, Avantika Jadhav, to travel with his wife, Chetna, to Pakistan and this has been formally communicated to India. Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in the southwestern Pakistani province of Balochistan. Pakistan claims that Kulbushan Jadhav — alias Hussain Mubarak Patel — is a serving commander in the Indian Navy, working with Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing. However, New Delhi and Jadhav’s family maintain that he had quit the Indian Navy and was running a small business in Iran, from where he was kidnapped. Kulbushan Jadhav was sentenced to death by Pakistan’s military court in April 2017 on charges of espionage and terrorism. He has filed a clemency appeal with Pakistan’s army chief, which is pending. India moved to the International Court of Justice against the sentencing of Jadhav, after which the court ordered Pakistan not to execute Jadhav until it hears the case. Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Faisal said in a statement, available with Arab News, that Pakistan has informed India that it is ready to allow the visit of the mother of “Commander” Jadhav, along with his wife. India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Raveesh Kumar said that this is a positive development. In November this year, Pakistan told India for the first time that it was ready to arrange a meeting between Jadhav and his wife. But New Delhi requested that Islamabad also allow his mother to travel with Jadhav’s wife and asked for security assurance for the visiting Indian family members. Sushma Swaraj, Indian external affairs minister, took to Twitter to comment on Pakistan’s decision. “Pakistan has agreed to facilitate the visit of mother and wife of Kulbhushan Jadhav and assured us of their safety, security and freedom of movement in Pakistan,” she tweeted. Analysts in Pakistan consider this development as an ice-breaker between South Asian neighbors India and Pakistan, who have stalled the peace dialogue after accusing each other of supporting terrorism. “Pakistan’s gesture will possibly help to lower the tension in bilateral relations,” Dr. Nadeem Mizra, assistant professor in the school of politics and international affairs at Quaid-e-Azam University, told Arab News. During the past two years, tensions have been high between Pakistan and India on Kashmir’s Line of Control, the de facto border between the two countries in Kashmir. Pakistan claimed that India committed unprecedented cease-fire violations along the Line of Control this year. In a statement, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said on Friday that “in 2017, more than 1,300 Indian cease-fire violations, the highest ever in the recent past, have resulted in 52 deaths and 175 were injured ... We have consistently stressed that Indian aggression is a threat to regional peace and tranquility.” Pakistan urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 cease-fire arrangement and investigate incidents of cease-fire violations.

News article:
Pakistan has an important place in the Islamic world. It is the only Muslim country that was founded on the basis of religion. Israel is the only other state that came into existence to serve a particular religious group. Both countries were created about the same time. But there are differences, of course. Israel could accommodate the entire Jewish population in the world within its borders. It is committed to doing precisely that. The world’s Muslim population is now estimated at 1.6 billion.Pakistan has about 195 million Muslims or about 12 per cent of the total in the world that subscribe to the Islamic faith. What these numbers mean is that Pakistan’s policymakers have to be concerned about developments in the parts of the world where Muslims are living under some kind of stress. That is why developments in the Middle East are of great concern to the people in Pakistan.The Muslim world was delivered a serious blow by America’s erratic president. On the afternoon of December 6, Donald Trump, speaking from the White House, told the world that he had decided to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state of Israel. He said that in 1995 the US Congress passed a resolution that the United States should move its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, for almost a quarter century the American presidents continued to issue waivers for not implementing the decision. Setting aside that history, the current American president justified his move by saying that the facts on the ground justified his decision. Ever since the founding of the state of Israel, Jerusalem had been its capital. That is where the government is located and worked from. The houses of the country’s president and prime minister are located in the city. It is also the home of the country’s Supreme Court. But these facts were known all along.There were other facts. The Muslim world regarded Jerusalem as their religion’s third holiest place, after Makkah and Medinah. Even though in the 1967 war Israel had defeated the Jordanian forces that defended East Jerusalem, its occupation of that part of the city and the West Bank were not recognised by the world community. It was against international law to hold the territory won in a war. It was always recognised that the status of Jerusalem would be part of the agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians whenever the final settlement was reached. By giving to Israel the entire city of Jerusalem, Donald Trump had put himself and his country squarely on the side of the Jewish state. It could no longer be an honest broker, a role it had played ever since the 1967 war. What would be the reaction of the Muslim world to this move by the American president? Would it, paradoxically, split the Muslims into two parts: those who would show only mild unhappiness and those who are likely to be highly agitated? The paradox is that most of the Arabs — the people as well as their governments are likely to shrug their shoulders and move on. On the other hand, in countries such as Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia the reaction will be sharp and lasting.This is what a group of journalists writing in The New York Times had to say about the Arab reaction to the Trump decision on Jerusalem: “While Arab leaders have continued to pay lip service to the Palestinian cause, it has slipped in importance, displaced by the Arab Spring, the wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, the threat of Islamic State, and the contest between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional dominance. Persian Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, more concerned about their rivalry with Iran, have found their interests increasingly overlapping with those of Israel.”This analysis is supported by reports that Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and the point-man on the Middle East, had a night-long meeting recently with Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman at which the two worked out a plan for settling the Palestinian issue. It will have the Palestinian state made up of the bits and pieces of land that have not been given to the Jewish settlers, East Jerusalem will be reunited with the city’s western part, the city thus formed will be recognised as the capital of the Israeli state, the Palestinian state will work from Ramallah as its capital, it will not have an army of its own, and it will have to guarantee that it will not sponsor terrorist attacks on the Jewish state. With this as the conclusion of the half-century struggle by the Palestinians, Saudi Arabia will be left to focus on Iran.What we are seeing, therefore, is the move of Sunni part of the Arab world towards countering the growing but unnecessary struggle between Sunnis and Shiites in the Middle East. Bringing the economist’s perspective to these developments I see two things happening. The Asians in the Muslim world will get further away from both the United States and Saudi Arabia and will be more inclined to work with Iran and China. Iran having invested massively in developing its human resource has a better economic future than the Sunni Arabs. At the same time China’s Road and Belt Initiative will be bring the countries of Muslim Asia into its orbit.Published in The Express Tribune, December 11, 2017.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
Pakistan has an important place in the Islamic world. It is the only Muslim country that was founded on the basis of religion. Israel is the only other state that came into existence to serve a particular religious group. Both countries were created about the same time. But there are differences, of course. Israel could accommodate the entire Jewish population in the world within its borders. It is committed to doing precisely that. The world’s Muslim population is now estimated at 1.6 billion.Pakistan has about 195 million Muslims or about 12 per cent of the total in the world that subscribe to the Islamic faith. What these numbers mean is that Pakistan’s policymakers have to be concerned about developments in the parts of the world where Muslims are living under some kind of stress. That is why developments in the Middle East are of great concern to the people in Pakistan.The Muslim world was delivered a serious blow by America’s erratic president. On the afternoon of December 6, Donald Trump, speaking from the White House, told the world that he had decided to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state of Israel. He said that in 1995 the US Congress passed a resolution that the United States should move its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, for almost a quarter century the American presidents continued to issue waivers for not implementing the decision. Setting aside that history, the current American president justified his move by saying that the facts on the ground justified his decision. Ever since the founding of the state of Israel, Jerusalem had been its capital. That is where the government is located and worked from. The houses of the country’s president and prime minister are located in the city. It is also the home of the country’s Supreme Court. But these facts were known all along.There were other facts. The Muslim world regarded Jerusalem as their religion’s third holiest place, after Makkah and Medinah. Even though in the 1967 war Israel had defeated the Jordanian forces that defended East Jerusalem, its occupation of that part of the city and the West Bank were not recognised by the world community. It was against international law to hold the territory won in a war. It was always recognised that the status of Jerusalem would be part of the agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians whenever the final settlement was reached. By giving to Israel the entire city of Jerusalem, Donald Trump had put himself and his country squarely on the side of the Jewish state. It could no longer be an honest broker, a role it had played ever since the 1967 war. What would be the reaction of the Muslim world to this move by the American president? Would it, paradoxically, split the Muslims into two parts: those who would show only mild unhappiness and those who are likely to be highly agitated? The paradox is that most of the Arabs — the people as well as their governments are likely to shrug their shoulders and move on. On the other hand, in countries such as Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia the reaction will be sharp and lasting.This is what a group of journalists writing in The New York Times had to say about the Arab reaction to the Trump decision on Jerusalem: “While Arab leaders have continued to pay lip service to the Palestinian cause, it has slipped in importance, displaced by the Arab Spring, the wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, the threat of Islamic State, and the contest between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional dominance. Persian Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, more concerned about their rivalry with Iran, have found their interests increasingly overlapping with those of Israel.”This analysis is supported by reports that Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and the point-man on the Middle East, had a night-long meeting recently with Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman at which the two worked out a plan for settling the Palestinian issue. It will have the Palestinian state made up of the bits and pieces of land that have not been given to the Jewish settlers, East Jerusalem will be reunited with the city’s western part, the city thus formed will be recognised as the capital of the Israeli state, the Palestinian state will work from Ramallah as its capital, it will not have an army of its own, and it will have to guarantee that it will not sponsor terrorist attacks on the Jewish state. With this as the conclusion of the half-century struggle by the Palestinians, Saudi Arabia will be left to focus on Iran.What we are seeing, therefore, is the move of Sunni part of the Arab world towards countering the growing but unnecessary struggle between Sunnis and Shiites in the Middle East. Bringing the economist’s perspective to these developments I see two things happening. The Asians in the Muslim world will get further away from both the United States and Saudi Arabia and will be more inclined to work with Iran and China. Iran having invested massively in developing its human resource has a better economic future than the Sunni Arabs. At the same time China’s Road and Belt Initiative will be bring the countries of Muslim Asia into its orbit.Published in The Express Tribune, December 11, 2017.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
ISLAMABAD: More than 20 days after achieving a moral and diplomatic victory over India, the Foreign Office (FO) spokesman pointed out that a “controversial” list of terrorists through which Pakistan was affected, has been taken off the declaration of the Heart of Asia Conference (HoA) held in Amritsar in 2016. The breakthrough came on December 1 in Baku where the HoA-IP conference was held and Pakistan managed to through “effective and successful” diplomacy, convince member countries to drop the selected list from the Baku Declaration and referred the matter to the Working group on Counter-Terrorism to come up with a comprehensive list of all terrorist groups in the Heart of Asia Region. “Ever since a list of selected proscribed groups made it to the outcome document (Amritsar Declaration) of HoA-IP Ministerial Conference in December 2016, India celebrated it as a huge diplomatic success over Pakistan and started misusing the list for political point scoring against Pakistan”, explained the spokesman. Pakistan is no hurry to execute RAW agent, Commander Kulbhushan Jhadev, as his presence is a cruel reminder to New Delhi and important world capitals the extent to which the Modi government goes to carry out terrorism inside Pakistan. “It was after great difficulty and certainly tremendous efforts by Pakistan’s agency to arrest Jhadev inside Balochistan. This senior serving naval officer is the biggest catch of the enemy as far as one can remember.”, a source confides to The News. The spokesman had similar thoughts while replying to a query, “On the possible immediate execution of, and this being his last meeting with his family, let me assure you that the Commander is under no threat of immediate execution and his mercy petitions are still pending”. Chefs in the Foreign Office familiar with vegetarian cuisine will be readying a meal for the mother and wife of Jhadav keeping in mind Pakistan’s hospitality and Islamic traditions where guests specially women are treaty with dignity, even if they are related to a self confessed spy. “No foreigner visiting the Foreign Office has ever left without refreshments and the ministry is expected to keep up this tradition”, is one comment heard. While the Indian High Commission has still not notified the Foreign Office which diplomat would accompany Jadhav’s family, it is expected that the Deputy High Commissioner could be a likely choice. Sources from Delhi tell The News that it is unlikely that the Indian government would welcome a media interaction with the Indian ladies. “ They are terrified as it is, and will want to spend every second with Jadhav. Unused to the media , they probably would only appeal to the COAS to forgive their relative and spare his life. Also the Indian High Commission cannot guard them from a very hawkish Pakistani media. They speak a dialect of Marahathi and the Foreign Office will have to arrange for an interpreter unless there is an Indian diplomat who can understand the language”, sources confide. “We are still waiting for an Indian decision about the media interaction. Pakistan decided to permit the meeting of the wife of Commander Jadhav with him purely on humanitarian grounds. The Indian side subsequently also requested that the mother may accompany the wife. Pakistan has accepted the Indian request. Pakistan has issued visas to both the ladies. The meeting will be held in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs”, the spokesman added. Hours before a vote in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) , on the status of Jerusalem, Pakistan says, “Freedom has no price” and Pakistan’s vote will be consistent with its position, while fully endorsing the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) position that East Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine, while rejecting the US stance as "dangerous" calling on the international community to follow in its footsteps.The UN General Assembly will hold an emergency session on Thursday night (Pakistan time) to vote on the controversial US decision where analysts say that the non-binding motion is expected to pass easily in the 193-member UN body. The resolution condemns the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Pakistan used to threats from Washington, will still vote for the resolution despite President Donald Trump’s threats of cutting off aid to countries that vote in favor of the draft UN resolution. With Trump completely isolated in the world body, very jittery is the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is ready to see egg on his face. According to US media reports Netanyahu described the United Nations as a “house of lies”, while rejecting the resolution even before a single vote has been cast. “Jerusalem is our capital and we will continue to build there, and foreign embassies, led by the United States, will move to Jerusalem. It will happen”, he stated. Meanwhile the spokesman at the Foreign Office during the weekly media briefing said, “Pakistan views the decision of US Administration to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to shift the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as violation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. He pointed out that Pakistan firmly believes that the establishment of a viable, independent and contiguous State of Palestine, on the basis of internationally agreed parameters, the pre-1967 borders and with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital is the only lasting solution of the Middle East crisis.

News article:
India informs that the mother and wife of Commander Jadhav will arrive by commercial flight on 25 Dec and leave the same day. Indian DHC in Islamabad will be the accompanying diplomat. — Spokesperson 🇵🇰 MoFA (@ForeignOfficePk) December 23, 2017 India has confirmed that the mother and wife of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav will arrive in Pakistan on December 25 and meet the convict in the presence of an Indian diplomat on the same day.“India informs that the mother and wife of Commander Jadhav will arrive by a commercial flight on 25 Dec and leave the same day. Indian DHC [deputy high commissioner] in Islamabad will be the accompanying diplomat,” wrote the Foreign Office spokesperson Dr Mohammad Faisal in a Twitter post.The announcement came late on Saturday night after Pakistan gave India a deadline to share the relevant information about arrival of the family members of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav.Islamabad on Wednesday issued visas to the mother and wife of the Indian spy, who has been awarded death punishment by a military court in Pakistan.According to well-placed diplomatic sources, Pakistan has made all the necessary arrangements to conduct a meeting between the convicted Indian spy and his two family members.They said duration of the meeting will be from 15 minutes to an hour, and one or two officials of the Foreign Office will also be present in it.Pakistan has issued visas to Jadhav’s wife and mother from Dec 24 to Dec 26 only for Islamabad. Some reports suggested that Jadhav wass interested solely in meeting his wife and not any other member.According to sources, both his mother and wife will be allowed to speak to media should they wish so. The sources dispelled reports that it would be the last meeting between the spy and his family and that he was going to be hanged soon.In a bid to ensure transparency and openness and to avoid any speculations, the Foreign Office has made special arrangements for the media coverage of the event for which passes will be issued to the related journalists.The Foreign Office will also issue photographs and videos of the meeting. Security officials will be deployed in and outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the RAW operative’s appearance.Jadhav, an officer of the Indian Navy who later joined RAW, was arrested in Balochistan during a joint counterterrorism operation in March 2016 when he was crossing into Pakistan from neighbouring Iran.Later, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released his recorded video statement in which he confessed to working for RAW to instigate violence and terrorist attacks in Pakistan, particularly in restive Balochistan and Karachi.The spy was later awarded death sentence by a military tribunal in April this year after he was found guilty of espionage and subversive and terrorist activities. His mercy petition is pending before army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who has yet to decide on it.India also went to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague which asked Pakistan not to execute Jadhav till its final decision. Last week, Pakistan submitted a detailed reply to the ICJ, rejecting Indian arguments.Pakistan hopes that the ICJ would throw out the India’s application. Apparently, Islamabad has allowed Jadhav to meet his family in order to strengthen its case before the international court.

The information extracted from the image:


 Theme/Focus: Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian spy who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017, is shown in a mugshot on the left side of the image. On the right side, there is a board with the text "Jadavpur University".
Key Information/Sub-event: Jadhav is a former Indian Navy officer who was arrested in Balochistan in 2016 and accused of working for India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to carry out terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He was sentenced to death by a military court in April 2017, and his mercy petition is currently pending before the army chief.
News Event Perspective: The image provides a visual representation of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian spy who is at the center of a diplomatic row between India and Pakistan. The mugshot shows Jadhav looking directly at the camera, with a serious expression on his face.

The Pakistan Foreign Ministry says it has given permission to the wife and mother of an Indian naval officer facing the death penalty for espionage in Pakistan to visit the man in Islamabad. Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal on December 24 said in a Twitter statement that the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi had issued visas to the two women to visit with Kulbhushan Jadhav on December 25. Faisal said the two women will fly to Islamabad to meet with Jadhav, who was arrested in March 2016 by Pakistani officials after he entered the country from neighboring Iran. The prisoner will be brought to the ministry for the meeting, the spokesman said. He added that India had requested that Pakistan to prevent journalists from speaking with the family members for security reasons. The Associated Press quoted a security official involved with arranging the meeting as saying it will be conducted in the presence of three Indian diplomats. "The mother and wife of Jadhav will be able to see and talk to him, but there will be a partition between them for security reasons," the official said. Jadhav has filed a mercy petition with Islamabad's chief of army staff on “compassionate grounds,” the Pakistani military said in June. The military stated that Jadhav "has admitted his involvement in espionage, terrorist, and subversive activities in Pakistan and expressed remorse at the resultant loss of any precious lives and extensive damage to property due to his actions." The AP, which said it has seen the mercy petition, reported Jadhav as writing that "I feel very shamed and I genuinely seek pardon of the acts and sins and crimes I have committed here against the nation and the people of Pakistan." Pakistan alleges that Jadhav was working for India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the country’s intelligence agency. New Delhi denies Jadhav was a spy and claims he was kidnapped from Iran. After Jadhav was sentenced to death in April, India asked the International Court of Justice to block the execution, arguing he was denied diplomatic assistance during his trial. The court ordered Pakistan in May to delay Jadhav's execution. It argued that Islamabad violated a treaty guaranteeing diplomatic assistance to foreigners accused of crimes. An appeal is under way. Pakistan and India are longstanding bitter rivals in the region and have fought three wars since they gained independence in 1947. With reporting by AP, Geo News, and The Hindustan Times

News article:
ISLAMABAD: Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani on Sunday said Pakistan was a sovereign country and it was not in the habit of "taking notices" from anyone. "Trump in his recently announced South Asia policy, had blamed Pakistan for the US failures in Afghanistan. The US is trying to shift the blame for its defeat in Afghanistan to Pakistan, and it consistently refuses to recognize the sacrifices of the people of Pakistan in the war on terror,” he said while addressing the six-nation first Speakers Conference that got under way here under the theme of ‘Challenges of terrorism and inter-regional connectivity’. Representatives from Russia, China, Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey are in attendance. The conference was also addressed by Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Speaker of Wolesi Jirga of Afghanistan Abdul Rauf Ibraheemi, Speaker of the Shoora-e-Islami of Iran Dr Ali Larejani, Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia Volodin Vyacheslav Viktorovich, Speaker of Grand Turkish Assembly Ismail Kehrman and Vice Chairman of the National People’s Congress of China Zhang Ping. Referring to the recent remarks about Pakistan by US Vice President Mike Pence, Rabbani said, “Pakistan does not need to heed any ‘notice’ from a foreign nation. We will never sacrifice on our basic rights as a sovereign country.” Rabbani said the US had pursued a policy of "regime change and bringing about instability in Muslim countries," particularly in the Middle East. Describing Trump's decision to shift the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem the "blunder of all blunders", the chairman said Washington had failed to understand that it was neither supported practically, nor by history in their decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. He said the United Nations General Assembly had given a befitting reply to Washington when 128 countries rejected the US move. "What they [US] fail to recognise is that the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital will give rise to a new intifada, as the people of Palestine move to achieve their historic rights,” he added. He said a new coalition of the US, Israel and India was in the making, adding, "We find the US is trying to use or build up India as a policeman of the region." He said though Pakistan believed in dialogue and friendly relations with its neighbours, unless India was willing to speak on equal terms, ‘we will perhaps just be looking at the mirage of peace in the region.’ He said it was unfortunate that the United Nations had failed to implement its resolutions on Kashmir. “Time has come for Asia to make its own decisions, or else the history will never forgive us,” he added. Talking about the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said it had the potential to transform the economic fortunes of the region, ushering in a new era of prosperity. He said the One Belt One Road (OBOR) project will not only benefit the Pakistan, but also the whole region. Addressing the conference, President Mamnoon Hussain said terrorism was not a local phenomenon rather it was caused by interference of foreign powers. “Pakistan had been dragged into the war-quagmire after the tragic 9/11 incident,” he said, adding that law and order in Pakistan was adversely affected following the 9/11. Mamnoon said terrorism had created immense problems in several countries of the region, with Pakistan being the most affected. He said during the last few years, Pakistan had lost more than 70,000 precious lives to terrorism besides suffering more than $120 billion financial losses. He said owing to comprehensive steps to cope with the situation, terrorists had received a deadly blow. “We have taken comprehensive steps under the National Action Plan (NAP) in different parts of the country, while an effective action has been taken in tribal areas under operation Zarb-e-Azb,” he said. Talking about the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said as a result of untiring efforts by the two countries, the economic corridor was about to start functioning and would enable western China, particularly the Central Asian countries, to access other parts of Asia and larger markets of Africa and European countries through the Arabian Sea. “Pakistan is engaged in best efforts to materialise this great dream because we think the future of these regions lies hidden in active links, mutual trade and cooperation into which CPEC will infuse new spirit. Under this spirit, we sincerely invite all countries of the region to join the economic corridor,” the president said. However, he said economic stability and prosperity of the region was linked with regional peace and stability, peaceful co-existence and mutual respect. He said under this spirit, Pakistan had extended sincere and unconditional cooperation for peace and stability in Afghanistan, believing that stability in the region was linked with the stability in Afghanistan. “To achieve this common aspiration, we will cooperate in every serious effort,” he said. Similarly, he said Pakistan had extended full cooperation to neighbouring countries to improve and make the border security effective to control extremism. He said in order to combat terrorism, Pakistan’s armed forces had special experience and specialty from which its neighbour countries could benefit. Talking about the bone of contention between Pakistan and India, President Mamnoon said breach of people’s right to self-determination and fundamental rights created a number of problems and the Kashmir dispute was a glaring example. He said Pakistan was of the opinion that this issue had endangered peace in the Sub-continent. Welcoming guests to the federal capital, the president hoped that the conference would prove extremely beneficial in combating the challenges facing the region as well as utilizing the opportunities for regional development and prosperity. Mamnoon said geography, common values of opinions and similar conditions provide Pakistan, Iran, China, Turkey, Russia and Afghanistan wider opportunities to work in unison for the development and prosperity of their people. APP adds: Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said the Pakistani economy had suffered a loss of over $119 billion since 9/11 due to terrorism. He said the problem had been aggravated by the corresponding rise in illicit drug trade, which had largely remained unchecked and throbbed as the major source of terror financing. “Why has the global coalition against terrorism consistently failed to control and destroy the booming poppy cultivation? Increased production facilities and the expanding drug trade is a question that many fail to answer,” he said. Ayaz Sadiq termed the gathering of six countries speakers in Islamabad a historic occasion and noted that the parliamentary heads of these nations had arrived here for the first time to reaffirm their commitment to shared peace and prosperity and forge new grounds of mutual cooperation. The speaker said China and Pakistan alone provided half of the world’s cotton adding, “The untapped resources of Afghanistan could make it the richest mining region on earth while its mastery in infrastructural construction industry has brought Turkey to the top rankings in the world.” Ayaz Sadiq said the post-cold-war world had proved to be more dangerous and insecure than the bipolar era. “On the one side, the rise of unipolarism has given way to unilateralism and global hegemony, on the other, the ideals of respect for international borders and nations’ sovereignty are in danger with the introduction of the phenomenon of non-state actors,” he added. He said the seemingly unending spate of terrorist attacks during the last 10 years had rocked every corner of the world, claiming over two hundred thousand lives. “Almost half of these unfortunate victims were from our region,” he added. Ayaz said, “Most of our respective countries have faced the maximum brunt either through the al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the East Turkistan Islamic Movement and now the eminent threat of the Daesh.” He said innocent men, women and children across continents had been displaced and forced to leave their lands. “Of the five top countries in the world, hosting largest number of refugees, three are represented here; namely Turkey, Pakistan and Iran,” he said. Although, he said, religious fanaticism has been often cited as the main cause of global terrorism, let us not forget that that rise of populist right and the sanctioning of oppression have also added fuel to the mayhem. He said the recent controversy created around the status of the Holy city of Jerusalem was not only a move to violate the international law and the related UN resolutions, but also a deliberate attempt to undermine peace efforts. “It is a move to divide the people of the world further and fan religious animosity,” he said. He said the overall mutual trade volume of six countries gathered here was just 366 billion dollars for the year 2016, which was merely 2 percent of the entire global trade volume.

Referring to the recent remarks about Pakistan by US Vice President Mike Pence, Rabbani said, “Pakistan does not need to heed any ‘notice’ from a foreign nation. We will never sacrifice on our basic rights as a sovereign country.” Rabbani said the US had pursued a policy of "regime change and bringing about instability in Muslim countries," particularly in the Middle East. Describing Trump's decision to shift the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem the "blunder of all blunders", the chairman said Washington had failed to understand that it was neither supported practically, nor by history in their decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. He said the United Nations General Assembly had given a befitting reply to Washington when 128 countries rejected the US move. "What they [US] fail to recognise is that the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital will give rise to a new intifada, as the people of Palestine move to achieve their historic rights,” he added. He said a new coalition of the US, Israel and India was in the making, adding, "We find the US is trying to use or build up India as a policeman of the region." He said though Pakistan believed in dialogue and friendly relations with its neighbours, unless India was willing to speak on equal terms, ‘we will perhaps just be looking at the mirage of peace in the region.’ He said it was unfortunate that the United Nations had failed to implement its resolutions on Kashmir. “Time has come for Asia to make its own decisions, or else the history will never forgive us,” he added. Talking about the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said it had the potential to transform the economic fortunes of the region, ushering in a new era of prosperity. He said the One Belt One Road (OBOR) project will not only benefit the Pakistan, but also the whole region. Addressing the conference, President Mamnoon Hussain said terrorism was not a local phenomenon rather it was caused by interference of foreign powers. “Pakistan had been dragged into the war-quagmire after the tragic 9/11 incident,” he said, adding that law and order in Pakistan was adversely affected following the 9/11. Mamnoon said terrorism had created immense problems in several countries of the region, with Pakistan being the most affected. He said during the last few years, Pakistan had lost more than 70,000 precious lives to terrorism besides suffering more than $120 billion financial losses. He said owing to comprehensive steps to cope with the situation, terrorists had received a deadly blow. “We have taken comprehensive steps under the National Action Plan (NAP) in different parts of the country, while an effective action has been taken in tribal areas under operation Zarb-e-Azb,” he said. Talking about the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said as a result of untiring efforts by the two countries, the economic corridor was about to start functioning and would enable western China, particularly the Central Asian countries, to access other parts of Asia and larger markets of Africa and European countries through the Arabian Sea. “Pakistan is engaged in best efforts to materialise this great dream because we think the future of these regions lies hidden in active links, mutual trade and cooperation into which CPEC will infuse new spirit. Under this spirit, we sincerely invite all countries of the region to join the economic corridor,” the president said. However, he said economic stability and prosperity of the region was linked with regional peace and stability, peaceful co-existence and mutual respect. He said under this spirit, Pakistan had extended sincere and unconditional cooperation for peace and stability in Afghanistan, believing that stability in the region was linked with the stability in Afghanistan. “To achieve this common aspiration, we will cooperate in every serious effort,” he said. Similarly, he said Pakistan had extended full cooperation to neighbouring countries to improve and make the border security effective to control extremism. He said in order to combat terrorism, Pakistan’s armed forces had special experience and specialty from which its neighbour countries could benefit. Talking about the bone of contention between Pakistan and India, President Mamnoon said breach of people’s right to self-determination and fundamental rights created a number of problems and the Kashmir dispute was a glaring example. He said Pakistan was of the opinion that this issue had endangered peace in the Sub-continent. Welcoming guests to the federal capital, the president hoped that the conference would prove extremely beneficial in combating the challenges facing the region as well as utilizing the opportunities for regional development and prosperity. Mamnoon said geography, common values of opinions and similar conditions provide Pakistan, Iran, China, Turkey, Russia and Afghanistan wider opportunities to work in unison for the development and prosperity of their people. APP adds: Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said the Pakistani economy had suffered a loss of over $119 billion since 9/11 due to terrorism. He said the problem had been aggravated by the corresponding rise in illicit drug trade, which had largely remained unchecked and throbbed as the major source of terror financing. “Why has the global coalition against terrorism consistently failed to control and destroy the booming poppy cultivation? Increased production facilities and the expanding drug trade is a question that many fail to answer,” he said. Ayaz Sadiq termed the gathering of six countries speakers in Islamabad a historic occasion and noted that the parliamentary heads of these nations had arrived here for the first time to reaffirm their commitment to shared peace and prosperity and forge new grounds of mutual cooperation. The speaker said China and Pakistan alone provided half of the world’s cotton adding, “The untapped resources of Afghanistan could make it the richest mining region on earth while its mastery in infrastructural construction industry has brought Turkey to the top rankings in the world.” Ayaz Sadiq said the post-cold-war world had proved to be more dangerous and insecure than the bipolar era. “On the one side, the rise of unipolarism has given way to unilateralism and global hegemony, on the other, the ideals of respect for international borders and nations’ sovereignty are in danger with the introduction of the phenomenon of non-state actors,” he added. He said the seemingly unending spate of terrorist attacks during the last 10 years had rocked every corner of the world, claiming over two hundred thousand lives. “Almost half of these unfortunate victims were from our region,” he added. Ayaz said, “Most of our respective countries have faced the maximum brunt either through the al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the East Turkistan Islamic Movement and now the eminent threat of the Daesh.” He said innocent men, women and children across continents had been displaced and forced to leave their lands. “Of the five top countries in the world, hosting largest number of refugees, three are represented here; namely Turkey, Pakistan and Iran,” he said. Although, he said, religious fanaticism has been often cited as the main cause of global terrorism, let us not forget that that rise of populist right and the sanctioning of oppression have also added fuel to the mayhem. He said the recent controversy created around the status of the Holy city of Jerusalem was not only a move to violate the international law and the related UN resolutions, but also a deliberate attempt to undermine peace efforts. “It is a move to divide the people of the world further and fan religious animosity,” he said. He said the overall mutual trade volume of six countries gathered here was just 366 billion dollars for the year 2016, which was merely 2 percent of the entire global trade volume.

The Indian "spy", who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court over espionage and sabotage charges, met his mother and wife at Foreign Office in Islamabad on Monday. "I requested a meeting with my wife and mother and I am thankful to the government of Pakistan for this grand gesture," Jadhav said in a video shot prior to the meeting. Jadhav's mother Avanti and wife Chetankul Jadhav was accompanied by the Deputy Indian High Commissioner JP Singh during the meeting, which lasted for 40 minutes. However, the Indian diplomat was not allowed to speak or listen to the conversation. The pictures, released by Pakistan's Foreign Office, showed Jadhav and his family members are separated by a glass screen as they talked to each other on phone. The 47-year-old Jadhav was arrested in March last year in Mashkel, a town a few kilometers (miles) from the Iranian border. According to Pakistani military, he was a serving Indian naval officer and using the Muslim name Hussein Mubarak Patel. However, New Delhi described him as a retired naval officer. After the meeting, Jadhav's mother and wife met the Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Faisal and thanked the government of Pakistan and foreign office for arranging their meeting. "This is a very important day for Pakistan, being the birth anniversary of the Father of the nation, Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It was in this light that this day was chosen for the humanitarian meeting of Commander Jadhav with his wife and mother," Faisal told reporters shortly after the meeting. "Commander Jadhav -- an Indian spy, a terrorist and a saboteur -- is a serving Indian naval officer sentenced to death for his involvement in espionage, terrorism and subversive activities against Pakistan," Faisal recalled. "Let us be very clear that Commander Jadhav is the face of Indian terrorism, especially in Pakistan," the spokesman added. The military tribunal in Pakistan found him guilty of espionage and involved in terror acts, sentenced him to death in April this year. Later, Jadhav submitted a mercy petition to the Pakistan's army chief on compassionate grounds on June 2017, however, it is still pending and no decision has been taken so far.

New Delhi accused Pakistani authorities of disrespecting the cultural and religious sensibilities of Jadhav's family India Tuesday accused Pakistan of harassing the family of an alleged Indian spy on death row, saying their meeting was held in an "atmosphere of coercion". Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav met his mother and wife in Islamabad on Monday, their first meeting since his arrest in Pakistan last year on charges of espionage and terrorism, allegations India has rejected. "It appears that Jadhav was under considerable stress and speaking in an atmosphere of coercion," the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement shortly after top Indian officials debriefed his family in New Delhi. The ministry alleged that Jadhav's conversation during the meeting was "tutored and designed to perpetuate the false narrative of his alleged activities in Pakistan." Pakistani officials say Jadhav, who was arrested in the restive southwestern province of Balochistan, confessed to spying for Indian intelligence, and describe him as "the face of Indian terrorism in Pakistan". Jadhav was found guilty in a closed trial by a military court and sentenced to death on charges of espionage and terrorism. India took the case to the International Court of Justice which suspended his execution until it passes final judgement in the case. Pictures released by the Pakistan government on Monday showed Jadhav and his family speaking through a glass barrier at the foreign ministry in Islamabad. An Indian diplomat was present during the meeting, which lasted 40 minutes, but was not allowed to talk to the prisoner or listen to the conversation with his family. New Delhi said Pakistan disrespected the cultural and religious sensibilities of Jadhav's family, alleging they were asked to change their clothes, and that his wife was ordered to remove her "mangal sutra" -- a necklace worn by married Hindu women. The Indian foreign ministry added that Pakistani authorities did not return the shoes Jadhav's wife was ordered to remove. It also accused Islamabad of allowing local journalists to "harass and hector" the Jadhav family, violating an understanding between Islamabad and New Delhi to not allow the media "close" access. India also raised concerns over Jadhav's health, although he was seen sitting up in the grainy pictures. Pakistani officials said he was in good health. New Delhi has maintained that Jadhav is innocent and that he was kidnapped by Pakistani authorities, also accusing Islamabad of violating the Vienna Convention by denying Jadhav consular access. The nuclear-armed neighbours routinely accuse one another of sending spies into their countries. Jadhav joined India's prestigious National Defence Academy in 1987 and was commissioned as an engineer in the Indian Navy in 1991 before reportedly starting a business in Iran.

News article:
NEW DELHI: India is debating the real intent behind Pakistan allowing Kulbhushan Jadhav, a convicted Indian spy facing the death sentence in a Pakistani jail, to meet his mother and wife. Jadhav’s mother Avanti Jadhav and wife Chetankul Jadhav, accompanied by the Indian Deputy High Commissioner J.P. Singh, met the former Indian navy officer in Islamabad on Monday afternoon. “It has happened due to international pressure,” said Suman Sharma, a New Delhi-based foreign affairs expert. “It is a tactical gesture by the Pakistan government before the next hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is hearing the case. Islamabad can argue in the ICJ that they are treating the case from the humanitarian points of view,” Sharma told Arab News. Dr. Zakir Husain of the Indian Council of World Affairs, a New Delhi based think-tank, said: “The larger point of this meeting is more than humanitarian. Pakistan is sending a signal that it is willing to break the ice with India and hold talks with its eastern neighbor.” Talking to Arab News, Husain underlined that “it’s now up to India how it responds to the Pakistani overtures. This comes just days after the Pakistani army chief’s announcement of his willingness to talk with India.” However, there was a lot of curiosity in Mumbai, the city where Jadhav’s family lives. “We are really excited about the meeting taking place in Islamabad,” said Subrato Mukherjee, an old friend of Jadhav in Mumbai. Talking to Arab News, Mukherjee said that “last week a bike rally and human chain were organized in the city to extend support to Jadhav’s family and express our solidarity with the family.” India does not accept the Pakistani version of the story that Jadav was arrested in Baluchistan province of Pakistan on March 3, 2016, and was acting as a spy to create disturbances in its territory. New Delhi, however, claims that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran, where he went to do some business after his retirement from the Indian Navy. Jadhav’s case has created a frenzy in the Indian media with the majority calling Pakistan’s move “an optical illusion and choreographed exercise.” “On the question of Pakistan, Indian media loses its balance. We lose objectivity and sense of proportion,” said Sharma. “I feel the Jadhav case is a wonderful opportunity for both India and Pakistan to engage each other in dialogue. Had there been a regular mechanism of engagement between the two nations, we would not have had this kind of polarized debate and tension.”

News article:
Pakistan has warned the United States and President Donald Trump against taking unilateral military action in the country against extremist groups, after warnings from top officials in the president's administration and the American leader himself. Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech during a trip to Afghanistan earlier this month that Trump had issued a warning to Pakistan and cautioned that there was much for the country to lose if it aided extremist groups in any way. "As the president said, so I say now: Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with the U.S., and Pakistan has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists," Pence said. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have been fraught since it came to light that Osama bin Laden, the former Al-Qaeda leader and mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, was in hiding at a safe house in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad before the infamous U.S. Special Forces operation to kill him in 2011. Islamabad rejected the accusation that it could have been aiding extremist groups and was not doing enough to help Washington. "We have sacrificed a lot. We have paid a huge price both in blood and treasure. We have done enough, and we cannot do any more for anyone," Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor said Friday, according to Al-Jazeera. "Had we not supported [the U.S.], Al-Qaeda would not have been defeated," he continued. The country is battling an insurgency by the Pakistani Taliban, Al-Qaeda and a growing ISIS presence in the border regions with Afghanistan. The military has launched several major operations against these militant groups for several years. ISIS has continued to gain ground in Afghanistan, and Pakistan has made efforts to halt the militant group's spread to its territory. The jihadi group created an affiliate for the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region known as Khorasan Province, a historical name for the region. ISIS has conducted several attacks inside Pakistani territory, including suicide bombings against religious minorities the group considers to be heretical. The deadliest was the August 2016 suicide bombing that killed at least 70 people in the southwestern city of Quetta. While it has been conducting operations against militant groups, the Trump administration has been eager to press Pakistan to do more. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Islamabad in an opinion piece in The New York Times published Wednesday. "We are prepared to partner with Pakistan to defeat terrorist organizations seeking safe havens, but Pakistan must demonstrate its desire to partner with us," he wrote. Despite the warnings, Trump praised Pakistan in October for working closely with U.S. authorities. "Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders. I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts," Trump wrote in a tweet. While the Pakistani government may want to work with the president, the Pakistani people are not so fond of the construction magnate. Thousands of Pakistani Islamists held rallies opposing Trump in two cities last week, condemning his declaration to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The December 6 announcement angered Muslims around the world. East Jerusalem hosts the third-holiest site in Islam, the Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, which Jews also revere as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism.

News article:
WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The United States accused Pakistan on Tuesday of playing a “double game” on fighting terrorism and warned Islamabad it would have to do more if it wanted to maintain U.S. aid. “They can do more to stop terrorism and we want them to do that,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The White House said it would likely announce actions to pressure Pakistan within days, shortly after U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said at the United Nations that Washington would withhold $255 million in assistance to Pakistan. “There are clear reasons for this. Pakistan has played a double game for years,” Haley told reporters. “They work with us at times, and they also harbor the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan. “That game is not acceptable to this administration. We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.” The comments followed an angry tweet from President Donald Trump on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with “nothing but lies and deceit” for “foolishly” giving Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the past 15 years. “They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” he tweeted. Pakistan civilian and military chiefs on Tuesday rejected “incomprehensible” U.S. comments and summoned American Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump’s tweet. Pakistani U.N. Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi said in a statement that her country’s fight against terrorism was not based on any consideration of aid but on national interests and principles. “We have contributed and sacrificed the most in fighting international terrorism and carried out the largest counter terrorism operation anywhere in the world,” Lodhi said. “We can review our cooperation if it is not appreciated.” Relations with Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad’s alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban. The United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil, and has signaled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Mansour was killed by a U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan and in 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. troops in the garrison town of Abbottabad.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo STATE DEPT: PAKISTAN NEEDS TO EARN AID At the State Department on Tuesday, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Pakistan knew what it needed to do, including taking action against the Haqqani network and other militants. Pakistan needs to “earn, essentially, the money that we have provided in the past in foreign military assistance,” she said. Islamabad bristles at the suggestion it is not doing enough to fight militants, noting that its casualties at the hands of Islamists since 2001 number in the tens of thousands. Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday chaired a National Security Committee meeting of civilian and military chiefs, focusing on Trump’s tweet. The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, was brought forward by a day and followed an earlier meeting of army generals. The committee, in a statement issued by the prime minister’s office, did not name Trump but spoke of “deep disappointment” at a slew of critical comments from U.S. officials over the past few months. “Recent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation,” it said.

The rocky Pakistan-US relations sank to a new low with the advent of New Year with President Donald Trump accusing Islamabad of ‘lies and deceit’, drawing a strong protest from the government.In his first tweets of 2018, Trump said Pakistan gave the US nothing but 'lies and deceit' and that the country provided safe havens to Afghan 'terrorists'.Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif hit back to the outright accusation, saying: "the United States should hold its own people accountable for its failures in Afghanistan."He also spoke to a private TV channel and shared his views on the on-going war against terrorism. "We have already said 'no more' to America, so Trump's 'no more' has no importance.”Referring to Trump’s claim that US gave Pakistan $33 billion in aid, Asif said: “We are ready to give all account for every single penny to America in public."Separately, Defence Minister Khurram Dastagir said that Pakistan had cooperated enough with the US in the war against terrorism.However, he made abundantly clear that the Afghanistan war would not be fought from Pakistan.Hours later, US Ambassador David Hale was summoned to the Foreign Ministry. Sources said Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua lodged strong protest over Trump’s tweet and sought an explanation from the ambassador.Opposition politicians have also noted with concern further deterioration of the Pakistan-US relations, which have already been strained since Trump took over the office a year ago.Senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Senator Sherry Rehman stressed the need for Pakistan to have a balanced stance and not be too aggressive in replying to the US.She said the reason why Washington is being reactive is due to gaps in Pakistan's foreign policy. "The gaps should be filled. The world can see the lack of governance and is taking advantage of how Pakistan has not responded."Rehman, also a former Pakistani ambassador to the US, said the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) has never been counted as aid in any accounting in Pakistan, nor will it be seen as part of assistance.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that matters of foreign policy must not be delivered through social media but should be debated in a proper setting.Qureshi said challenges facing Pakistan are not being addressed adequately. "Pakistan has to move forward taking into account its own interests, irrespective of whether it gets US aid or not," he said.Omar Waraich, the Amnesty International Deputy Director for South Asia, cautioned the US that there were only two supply routes into Afghanistan, which go through Pakistan and Iran.However, he questioned how Saudi Arabia, a traditional ally of Pakistan, could see the US pushing Pakistan into the sphere of influence of Iran, Russia and China.

News article:
Pakistan has decided to review its relations with the United States and adopt a tough stance, in the wake of President Donald Trump’s recent statement, it is learnt.Pakistan will highlight its sacrifices in the war against terrorism at the diplomatic front; and if the US reduces or suspends aid to Pakistan or places any sanctions, the country will completely revise its relations policy with the superpower, according to sources.Pakistan, said the sources, would not accept any demands to do more, and could stop all kinds of cooperation with the US. The only response to any ‘do more’ demands will be ‘no more’. The future policy with the US would be limited to ‘cooperation for cooperation’ and relations based on equality. “This policy will be adopted gradually,” they added.It is learnt that the foreign minister and other officials will contact friendly countries, including China, to take them into confidence. The high-ups are reviewing the recent statement by President Trump and the future relations with the US “which are turning from strained to tense”.It is decided that Pakistan will make its decisions keeping in view its national security, and the US defence secretary had been told during his visit to Islamabad that Pakistan would not accept any dictation from the US against its national security.He was also told that Pakistan was playing a role of frontline state in the war against terror. “There any no safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan, nor is Pakistan supporting any terrorist group directly or indirectly; and if US has any proof, it should hand it over to Pakistan.”The sources based in Islamabad said that the US had failed to provide any proof and was blaming Pakistan just to cover up its failures in Afghanistan. “The Trump administration is pressuring Pakistan, but Pakistan will not accept any pressure and face the situation.”Pakistan, according to the sources, has also decided to reduce dependency on the US in different fields and look for alternatives. It will also speed up the process of implementing its strategy for increasing diplomatic, trade and other relations with China, Russia and other countries.The sources said that the Trump administration was under pressure after the resolution in the United Nations General Assembly.Pakistan had supported the resolution calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Since then, the Trump administration has intensified pressure on Pakistan and is busy in levelling allegations which are meeting failure at the diplomatic level as well. Not a single important country is supporting the US stance. The US fears that if it moves any resolution against Pakistan in the UNGA, China or Russia may veto it.According to the sources, since the US understands the importance of Pakistan; the Trump administration will think several times before taking any action against Pakistan. “Any anti-Pakistan step may deprive the superpower of valuable cooperation.”They said that the federal government had also decided to take parliament into confidence on the current situation of the Pak-US relations, and the federal government would devise its future strategy on relations with the US in consultation with the military leadership.

The Pakistani government has summoned US ambassador David Hale to the nation's foreign office after US President Trump said the state was protecting terrorists. In a tweet, Trump accused Islamabad of "lies & deceit." Islamabad called on the US envoy to Pakistan David Hale to explain US President Donald Trump's claims that Pakistan was harboring and aiding jihadists from neighboring Afghanistan. Hale was summoned to Pakistan's foreign office on Monday, hours after the US president used his first tweet in 2018 to slam Pakistan for "lies & deceit." Trump also hinted at cutting or limiting US aid to Pakistan. "The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars (€29 billion) in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools," Trump wrote on Twitter. "They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!" The US embassy to Pakistan confirmed that the meet took place but refused to provide details on the conversation. "We don't have any comment on the substance of the meeting," a spokesman said. Pakistan Prime Minister Shahif Khaqan Abbasi is due to host a cabinet meeting that would focus on Trump's accusations on Tuesday, while country's top security officials would consider US ties on the next day. US trapped in a 'dead-end street' Following the tweet, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Trump's comments were motivated by US failures in Afghanistan. Asif also said Pakistan did not need US aid. "He has tweeted against us and Iran for his domestic consumption," Asif told Geo TV on Monday. "He is, again and again, displacing his frustrations on Pakistan over failures in Afghanistan as they are trapped in dead-end street in Afghanistan."

News article:
On Thursday, the U.S. State Department added Pakistan to a watch list for religious freedom violations. This follows an angry tweet from Donald Trump about Pakistan, and a more substantive cut-off of U.S. security assistance. Pakistan has faced years of criticism for its failure to disrupt terrorist activity within its borders and its persistent violations of religious freedom. Should those of us worried about the status of religious freedom be heartened by this move? Unfortunately, the answer is no. There is no indication the Trump Administration will actually follow through with these actions to call for reforms in Pakistan. Tensions between Trump and Pakistan have been growing for months. In an August 2016 speech on his Afghanistan strategy, Trump criticized Pakistan, accusing it of “housing the very terrorists we fight.” And then on New Year’s Day, Trump sent an angry tweet about Pakistan, threatening to cut off U.S. aid. This week, he followed through, suspending U.S. aid. To the surprise of some, the Administration also called out Pakistan for human rights abuses, placing it on a watch list for religious freedom violations. The Trump administration’s actions may appear abrupt, but they reflect long-standing concerns. Pakistan and the United States have had a tense relationship on counterterrorism since the 1990s. The United States was initially critical of Pakistan’s support for Kashmiri militant groups. This expanded to concerns about al-Qaeda due to Pakistan’s ties to the Taliban — which hosted Osama bin Ladin — and blind eye towards al-Qaeda operatives. As I discussed in my book, while Pakistan did cooperate with America in some very important ways after 9/11, it continued to allow terrorists to operate in its territory. Advertisement Pakistan’s religious freedom record is also a problem. The country’s blasphemy laws have enabled vigilante violence against religious minorities — particularly Christians — and the authorities have done little to stop this violence. Additionally, Ahmadi Muslims face both social and governmental discrimination and harassment. The government also has favored hard-line Islamist groups for decades, giving these groups significant sway over the society to the detriment of Muslims and non-Muslims. When I ran the Pew Research Center’s work on religious freedom, Pakistan was consistently among the most repressive countries in the world. So I should be happy with the Trump administration’s actions. It is taking steps to pressure Pakistan on counterterrorism while also clearly condemning its religious freedom violations. But as with other aspects of its foreign policy, this administration is doing the right thing for the wrong reason. It is also unlikely to follow through. First, there is no indication this administration is committed to religious freedom. While Trump has made a big show of domestic religious freedom debates, international human rights promotion is not a priority. Secretary of State Tillerson announced that advancing U.S. values can be “an obstacle” for U.S. interests. In this case, condemning Pakistan is in line with Trump’s security priorities, but religious freedom is clearly the secondary issue here. Advancing religious freedom requires not just cutting off aid, but working with states to reform their policies. I don’t see that happening under Trump. Second, even if Trump was serious on increasing religious freedom in Pakistan, how would he do it? Under Tillerson, the State Department has been gutted. State Department employees — including its religious freedom office — appear to be valiantly attempting to continue their mission despite Tillerson’s cuts. But actually advancing religious freedom will require engagement on religious issues and close monitoring to ensure compliance. As with Trump’s declaration on ISIL’s genocide, rhetoric will not translate into actions without a fully-staffed, well-supported State Department. Moreover, Trump’s belligerent, confrontational style will undermine existing initiatives; Pakistani political figures are calling on their government to “remove” U.S. diplomatic personnel in response to Trump’s actions. Advertisement Some may accuse me of being cranky, or biased against Trump. But religious freedom advocates need to be very careful. Trump is saying the right things, but there is little indication he will actually act on international religious freedom. We have seen this repeatedly over the past year. Besides Tillerson’s dismissal of “values,” there is also Vice President Pence’s trip to the Middle East, meant to show solidarity with Middle East Christians; it was postponed after the furor over Trump’s statements on Jerusalem, and there is no indication it will be rescheduled.

News article:
By IPCS By Abhijit Iyer Mitra* On Friday, 29 December 2017, the Government of India faced a major public embarrassment, one that provides some insights into the failure of intelligence. What it shows is one of three things: a failure of gathering, collation and transmission of intelligence; a failure to archive, collate and assess foreign policy; or, possibly, a serial failure of both intelligence and foreign policy fronts and a diagnostics problem within the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). Background On 21 December, India voted for a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), condemning the US’ decision to shift its embassy to Jerusalem (a move thus supportive of the Palestinian position and condemnatory of the Israeli and US position). On 29 December, pictures started circulating on the Internet of a meeting between the Palestinian ambassador to Pakistan, Walid Abu Ali, and wanted terrorist, head of the Jamaat ud-Dawa (JuD), and founder of the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), Hafiz Saeed. By the time India lodged a diplomatic protest and Palestine formally recalled Abu Ali, documentary and photographic evidence emerged of at least two previous meetings (August 2014 and December 2014). While knowledge of these meetings may not have changed India’s vote, the Ministry of External Affairs’ (MEA) actions in dealing with the snafu seems to indicate no prior knowledge of the meetings, which was particularly galling in the backdrop of the 21 December vote. Implications Hafiz Saeed is one of India’s most wanted men, responsible for masterminding the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and as such a prime target for 24/7 surveillance by India. Given his accessibility to the public, keeping tabs on him is not particularly challenging, complemented by the Difa-e-Pakistan Twitter handle and coverage by Pakistani newspapers. This points to one of two possibilities. Either Indian intelligence is not equipped to perform such basic OSINT activities as what Indian Twitter users can. Or, such intelligence existed but was buried deep in the system and could not be archived for efficient extraction when required to make policy decisions, either on 21 December when the UN vote happened, or indeed on 29 December when pictures of the December 2017 meeting surfaced. What is however known for a fact is that even after the situation blew up publicly, the diplomatic protest note sent to the Palestinians referred only to the December 2017 meeting, which indicates that the MEA had no knowledge of the previous meetings (by this time, the open source verification of previous meetings had not emerged). This is particularly worrying as it implies that either the MEA did not seek intelligence inputs on previous meetings, or that despite requests such inputs were not provided, that there was no intelligence on the subject to provide, or that the MEA decision was taken despite knowing the scale and extent of links between the Palestinian Authority and Hafiz Saeed. While the last option points to questionable policymaking, the previous three possibilities beg the question, why has the MEA not invested in public source intelligence gathering or outsourcing the work to a think-tank? This is all the more jarring given the minister-in-charge’s penchant for playing twitter agony-aunt. If it is assumed that the MEA has in fact invested in such open source intelligence gathering, then clearly the archiving and retrieval systems were not in place for such intelligence to be used rapidly and in a policy-relevant manner. What is most indicative of systemic failure on the MEA’s part is the Palestinian explanation, which was accepted without demur by South Block. First, it made the Palestinian state’s regret over its ambassador’s actions conditional, dependent on India’s continuing support to the Palestinian position. Second, it claimed the meeting was a mistake, ignoring the fact that there were several meetings. Incredulously this would also lead on to accept that Walid Abu Ali, a former Palestinian Intelligence official, did not know who he was deep in conversation with, given the fact that the LeT was co-founded by a Palestinian, Abdullah Azzam, who for a while had cooperated with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) against Israel. Finally, the PMO’s functioning must be examined. By all accounts this is a prime minister who takes a great deal of interest in foreign policy. That the PM has not been able to diagnose and institute rectifying measures since the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) debacle (where official statements emanating from Delhi were in significant variance from ground reports from Vienna and Seoul) does not instil confidence in his stewardship of intelligence matters. Depending on preferences and biases, it can be concluded that either intelligence or the MEA have been tried and found wanting, or that all have failed in equal measure, as there were no redundancies in place to damage control the situation. What is however undeniable is the PMO has neither diagnosed the problem over the last three years, or taken corrective action. * Abhijit Iyer Mitra Senior Research Fellow, IPCS

The ties between the US and Pakistan further deteriorated after the US president had tweeted that his country made an unwise decision to provide over $33 billion aid to Pakistan in the last 15 years.In his tweet, Trump had accused Pakistan of giving nothing in return except lies and deceit by taking the US for a fool, saying, “They give safe havens to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!”Meanwhile in a related development reflecting on worsening ties, the US ambassador to Pakistan was summoned to the Foreign Office and a strong protest over Trump’s remarks was lodged with him.On the other hand, ties between Iran and Pakistan are improving especially a new turn in the bilateral ties came after the historic visit of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajawa to Tehran in November last year.Iran and Pakistan have been enjoying strong brotherly relations since the creation of Pakistan way back in 1947. Since then the two countries have always been supporting each other on world issues.The last year has seen major developments in Iran-Pakistan ties and it is expected that the year proved to be fruitful for relations between the two neighboring states in the coming year as well.In a recent development, Pakistan Prime Minister's National Security Adviser (NSA) Lt Gen (retd) Nasser Janjua has gone to Iran to discuss regional developments and bilateral ties.During his meeting with secretary of Iran’s National Security Council Ali Shamkhani, Janjua said that Pakistan will improve its security and economic relations with its neighboring country, Iran.On the other hand, Shamkhani slammed the US statements against Pakistan and Iran. He said that US policy is hypocritical. “We have to continue to work on cooperating against the US.”Criticizing the US new national security strategy that will increase insecurity and instability in the world, Shamkhani said that the double-standard and rift-widening policies of the US against Muslim countries, including Iran and Pakistan, necessitate alertness and deterring measures and expansion of ties among Muslim countries.Meanwhile Iranian Minister of Defense Brigadier General Amir Hatami in a telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart Khurram Dastagir Khan said that the US has always blamed others for its defeats in various parts of the world and pursued the Zionists approach to destabilize the region.Pakistani defense minister, for his part, welcomed expansion of defense cooperation between the two sides, and said rapid developments require closer cooperation between Iran and Pakistan.Both the ministers also agreed that recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Zionist regime by the United States had violated international understanding and destabilized the Middle East.Iran and Pakistan are also trying to enhance bilateral trade ties and leaders of the two countries have agreed to enhance the bilateral trade volume up to $5 billion by 2021.272**6125**1771Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish

News article:
Iran on Sunday urged Muslim nations to forge closer cooperation to counter the US policy of seeking to create division among them."The US' dishonest, duplicitous and divisive policy towards Muslim countries, including Iran and Pakistan, requires that they bolster cooperation against the US in addition to maintaining vigilance and taking preventive measures," Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, was quoted as saying by Iran’s state-owned Press TV.Shamkhani made the remarks during a meeting with National Security Adviser Nasser Khan Janjua, whose country has recently come under criticism by US President Donald Trump."We will not allow some countries to affect relations between the two countries through sending weapons and hiring terrorists to create insecurity on their borders," Shamkhani said.Recalling the historical and civilisation relations as well as the many cultural and religious ties between the two countries, Shamkhani highlighted the importance of the expansion of relations and cooperation for mutually reinforcing in various fields, especially against common threats.“Activating mechanisms for bilateral cooperation and designing joint procedures, in accordance with the changing components of threats, is one of the immediate measures that should be taken seriously by the relevant agencies in the two countries,” highlighted the Iranian official.For his part, Janjua said that Pakistan will expand cooperation with Iran in security and economic areas.Janjua also said Islamic countries should raise awareness to counter foreign plots which are being hatched to spread division among the Muslims.“Pakistan will strengthen its security and economic cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he reiterated.“Islamabad welcomes new areas created for developing joint economic, commercial and trade cooperation,” he added.Shamkhani also criticised the US new national security strategy (NSS), saying it will spread insecurity and instability in the world.The remarks by the Iranian security chief came two days after Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said that he sees his country’s alliance with Washington as over after the US suspended security-related aid to Pakistan and levelled charges against Islamabad.“We do not have any alliance,” with the US, Khawaja Muhammad Asif said in an interview. “This is not how allies behave.”In announcing the strategy, Trump also targeted China and Russia.Referring to China, together with Russia, as rival and revisionist powers, Trump sharply criticised China for challenging American power.The United States’ severe allegations immediately sparked a backlash from China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry reprimanded the United States for “malicious slander.”The NSS laid forward the Trump administration’s harshest stance toward China since Trump took office in January last year.Singling China out for 33 mentions, the report bluntly criticized China for seeking to “challenge American influence, values, and wealth,” “attempting to erode American security and prosperity,” and using “technology, propaganda, and coercion to shape a world antithetical to” U.S. interests and values.Specifically, the NSS claimed that “China seeks to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, expand the reaches of its state-driven economic model, and reorder the region in its favour.”

Trump anti-Pakistan tirade to bring Iran, Pakistan closer IRNA – U.S. President Donald Trump’s harsh strategy towards Pakistan has created a space for closer Iran, Pakistan ties as the two countries have vowed to expand cooperation against common US-posed threats. The ties between the US and Pakistan further deteriorated after the US president had tweeted that his country made an unwise decision to provide over $33 billion aid to Pakistan in the last 15 years. In his tweet, Trump had accused Pakistan of giving nothing in return except lies and deceit by taking the US for a fool, saying, “They give safe havens to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” Meanwhile in a related development reflecting on worsening ties, the US ambassador to Pakistan was summoned to the Foreign Office and a strong protest over Trump’s remarks was lodged with him. On the other hand, ties between Iran and Pakistan are improving especially a new turn in the bilateral ties came after the historic visit of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajawa to Tehran in November last year. Iran and Pakistan have been enjoying strong brotherly relations since the creation of Pakistan way back in 1947. Since then the two countries have always been supporting each other on world issues. The last year has seen major developments in Iran-Pakistan ties and it is expected that the year proved to be fruitful for relations between the two neighboring states in the coming year as well. In a recent development, Pakistan Prime Minister’s National Security Adviser (NSA) Lt Gen (retd) Nasser Janjua has gone to Iran to discuss regional developments and bilateral ties. During his meeting with secretary of Iran’s National Security Council Ali Shamkhani, Janjua said that Pakistan will improve its security and economic relations with its neighboring country, Iran. On the other hand, Shamkhani slammed the US statements against Pakistan and Iran. He said that US policy is hypocritical. “We have to continue to work on cooperating against the US.” Criticizing the US new national security strategy that will increase insecurity and instability in the world, Shamkhani said that the double-standard and rift-widening policies of the US against Muslim countries, including Iran and Pakistan, necessitate alertness and deterring measures and expansion of ties among Muslim countries. Meanwhile Iranian Minister of Defense Brigadier General Amir Hatami in a telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart Khurram Dastagir Khan said that the US has always blamed others for its defeats in various parts of the world and pursued the Zionists approach to destabilize the region. Pakistani defense minister, for his part, welcomed expansion of defense cooperation between the two sides, and said rapid developments require closer cooperation between Iran and Pakistan. Both the ministers also agreed that recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Zionist regime by the United States had violated international understanding and destabilized the Middle East. Iran and Pakistan are also trying to enhance bilateral trade ties and leaders of the two countries have agreed to enhance the bilateral trade volume up to $5 billion by 2021.

Topic: Security Region: Asia Tags: AfghanistanWarTerrorismTalibanDonald Trump Afghanistan’s old wounds—no longer bandaged by U.S. dollar bills—are opening once again. President Donald Trump rang in the new year with a Twitter salvo directed at Pakistan, claiming that Washington has given Islamabad more than $33 billion in aid after 9/11, but has only received “lies and deceit” in return. The administration has since announced the suspension of military assistance to Pakistan. An unnamed State Department official has described the suspension as reversible should the Pakistani military take desired action against the Haqqani Network. The Trump administration appears to be moving toward a strategy of compellence toward Pakistan. It may be nonviolent right now, but could include lethal covert action, both visible (e.g. drone attacks) and less visible, and yield a series of unintended consequences that push the bilateral relationship beyond the point of no return. The asymmetries of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship may drive some in Washington to believe in the promise of compellence. But these asymmetries are counterveiled by mutual dependencies and other factors, including geography and salience. The United States does the cause of stabilizing Afghanistan no good by externalizing blame for the failing war or attributing it to a single insurgent network. The future of Afghanistan is bleak. Regardless of what American officials say, the United States can easily walk away from Afghanistan without injuring itself. But it is regional states that will bear the fallout from the disaster unfolding in Afghanistan—a disaster that has American and Afghan fingerprints all over it. The cycle of violence in Afghanistan is moving in an untenable direction. The Taliban now control or contest over 43 percent of Afghanistan’s districts, encompassing most of the outer perimeter of the country. Civilian deaths due to coalition bombing rise. Afghan security forces are dying in record-breaking numbers. Washington is arming more unwieldy militias with weapons. The documented Afghan economy has come to a standstill. Economic growth is surpassed by population growth. But drug production soars. Worst of all, Afghanistan’s leaders are heading toward confrontation with one another as the Trump administration looks on vainglorious and indolent. The bitter truth about Afghanistan is this: the relative stability Afghanistan experienced in the initial years post–9/11 will likely prove to be an exception, not the rule, in the country’s post–1973 history. Afghanistan’s old wounds—no longer bandaged by U.S. dollar bills—are opening once again. They, along with a resilient insurgency, will consume the country. American introspection combined with cooperation with regional states may stave off an ugly civil war in Afghanistan. The Region Speaks Recent actions by regional states amount to a vote of no confidence in the U.S.-led strategy for Afghanistan. Virtually all of Afghanistan’s neighbors are taking active measures to prevent instability and violence from the country spilling into their own. Last month, Tajikistan closed its border with northern Afghanistan after two of its border police officers were killed by Afghan drug traffickers. During this period, Russia delivered military hardware to the Tajik border with Afghanistan, to help Dushanbe control the border region. In December, China—Afghanistan’s neighbor to the northeast—said that it would provide $85 million to support a mountainous Afghan army brigade to secure the border province of Badakhshan, the former anti-Taliban bastion where the militant group has made significant inroads since 2013. Chinese security forces have reportedly been conducting patrols inside Badakhshan since at least 2016. There is also trouble in western Afghanistan. In late December, a commander with Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps claimed that Tehran conducted a unilateral operation in Afghan territory to free an Iranian captive. The Taliban have a strong presence along Afghanistan’s western frontier with Iran—due in part to support from Iranian intelligence. And then there is Pakistan—the locus of Trump’s ire—which will spend over $100 million to fence its border with Afghanistan and line it with additional security posts. Pakistan presently has roughly one thousand posts along its border with Afghanistan and will add hundreds more. It will sustain a troop presence of around two hundred thousand along the Afghan border, complemented by the paramilitary Frontier Corps. Afghanistan, in comparison, has around two hundred posts along the border with Pakistan. There is a four hundred mile stretch in southern Afghanistan where the Afghan government has no border posts—astonishing for a country that complains of cross-border insurgent inflows and has received $70 billion in assistance to build its security forces. Make Afghanistan Great Again As Afghanistan’s neighbors work to insulate themselves from the country’s possible implosion, the U.S.-backed Afghan government continues to do itself no favors in the fight against the Taliban. Afghanistan’s western-educated President Ashraf Ghani was thought to have transcended the authoritarianism, irredentist revisionism, and myopic tribalism of his country’s elite. But he has instead quickly internalized those characteristics. Ghani began his tenure with a courageous attempt at striking a new chapter in relations with Pakistan, which eventually brought the Taliban to the negotiation table—but the process was sabotaged by members of his government. Since then, Ghani has reverted to a posture that only reinforces Pakistan’s distrust of Afghanistan’s leadership. Like his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, Ghani has opposed Pakistani attempts to fence the border, though it would benefit Afghanistan as well. Ghani proclaimed before an audience in Afghanistan that “every attempt at dividing the nation would fail.” By “nation,” Ghani meant Pashtuns in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. This hypernationalist rhetoric is the norm for Afghan leaders. Amrullah Saleh, the former Afghan intelligence chief, recently beseeched Trump to recognize the Pakistani city of Peshawar as an Afghan city in the same way he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Nearly half of Afghanistan could fall into Taliban hands, but Afghanistan’s power elite fantasize about a Greater Afghanistan based on maps from the nineteenth century. They boast of five thousand years of history, but they have little modern-day achievements to show for. Afghanistan’s empty pride has yielded empty hands. American largesse, which has made illiterate warlords into millionaires, and Washington’s messaging strategy in Afghanistan, which reinforces Afghan animosity toward its neighbors (who are there to stay), have only fed the country’s pathologies. Goodbye Unity, Hello ISIS To thwart and eventually defeat the Taliban insurgency, Afghanistan needs a legitimate government not at war with itself. Afghanistan’s present “national unity government”—led by Ghani with his election opponent Abdullah Abdullah as “chief executive officer”—was forged through a settlement brokered in 2014 by then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. In the words of Kerry, with the deal, Afghanistan avoided a civil war. Since coming into power, Ghani has: reneged on his agreement with Abdullah to enact political reforms (though relations have recently improved); played non-Pashtun politicians off of one another as he attempts to centralize power; and twice-delayed parliamentary elections. Ghani is pushing the country toward civil conflict and creating greater space not just for the Taliban, but also for the so-called Islamic State. Last year, Ghani forced his first vice president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord from the Jowzjan Province, into exile after he ordered his guards to rape a political rival after he was “physically incapable of doing so.” While Dostum is a detestable figure, his absence has left a power vacuum. Militiamen once under his control have now joined the Islamic State and the Taliban in the Jowzjan province. French fighters affiliated with the Islamic State somehow have made their way into the region. To the east of Jowzjan lies the province of Balkh, one of the few provinces that has withstood the Taliban’s ground offensive and where Ghani has unwisely picked another political battle. In December, Ghani effectively fired Atta Noor, the warlord who served as the province’s governor. Early last year, Ghani engaged Noor in talks as part of a bid to sideline the country’s “chief executive officer” Abdullah. By the year’s end, Ghani sacked Noor (by accepting the resignation letter Noor provided earlier in the year as collateral). Noor has since rejected his own resignation and ordered the arrest of the man appointed to replace him as governor. Now, there are rumors that Ghani could fire Abdul Raziq Achakzai, the warlord who has kept Kandahar from going the way of the Taliban and has recently supported Noor. Achakzai, whose forces drill holes in the heads of detainees, recently declared: “I was not appointed by this government, and it cannot fire me.” In June, he was photographed with the commander of U.S. forces, Gen. John Nicholson. The Trump administration has looked away as Ghani has engaged in a domestic “game of thrones” while his country is on fire. This is partly because generals run the show in Kabul and Washington and a neutered State Department has been unable to restrain Ghani. The Trump cabinet includes three generals and an uninfluential secretary of state keen on depleting his organization. It took the Trump administration six months to nominate an ambassador to Afghanistan. During that time, it dismantled the State Department’s Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan office. Avoiding Chaos The general consensus among U.S. observers of Afghanistan is that the Taliban is too strong to be defeated militarily, but it is not strong enough to take over the whole country. But infighting among Afghanistan’s power elite, much like in Vietnam, or for that matter, in Afghanistan when the Taliban first took over, could be the straw the breaks the camel’s back. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam, lest we forget, was a formidable fighting force—far more capable than Afghan army today.

Like his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, Ghani has opposed Pakistani attempts to fence the border, though it would benefit Afghanistan as well. Ghani proclaimed before an audience in Afghanistan that “every attempt at dividing the nation would fail.” By “nation,” Ghani meant Pashtuns in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. This hypernationalist rhetoric is the norm for Afghan leaders. Amrullah Saleh, the former Afghan intelligence chief, recently beseeched Trump to recognize the Pakistani city of Peshawar as an Afghan city in the same way he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Nearly half of Afghanistan could fall into Taliban hands, but Afghanistan’s power elite fantasize about a Greater Afghanistan based on maps from the nineteenth century. They boast of five thousand years of history, but they have little modern-day achievements to show for. Afghanistan’s empty pride has yielded empty hands. American largesse, which has made illiterate warlords into millionaires, and Washington’s messaging strategy in Afghanistan, which reinforces Afghan animosity toward its neighbors (who are there to stay), have only fed the country’s pathologies. Goodbye Unity, Hello ISIS To thwart and eventually defeat the Taliban insurgency, Afghanistan needs a legitimate government not at war with itself. Afghanistan’s present “national unity government”—led by Ghani with his election opponent Abdullah Abdullah as “chief executive officer”—was forged through a settlement brokered in 2014 by then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. In the words of Kerry, with the deal, Afghanistan avoided a civil war. Since coming into power, Ghani has: reneged on his agreement with Abdullah to enact political reforms (though relations have recently improved); played non-Pashtun politicians off of one another as he attempts to centralize power; and twice-delayed parliamentary elections. Ghani is pushing the country toward civil conflict and creating greater space not just for the Taliban, but also for the so-called Islamic State. Last year, Ghani forced his first vice president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord from the Jowzjan Province, into exile after he ordered his guards to rape a political rival after he was “physically incapable of doing so.” While Dostum is a detestable figure, his absence has left a power vacuum. Militiamen once under his control have now joined the Islamic State and the Taliban in the Jowzjan province. French fighters affiliated with the Islamic State somehow have made their way into the region. To the east of Jowzjan lies the province of Balkh, one of the few provinces that has withstood the Taliban’s ground offensive and where Ghani has unwisely picked another political battle. In December, Ghani effectively fired Atta Noor, the warlord who served as the province’s governor. Early last year, Ghani engaged Noor in talks as part of a bid to sideline the country’s “chief executive officer” Abdullah. By the year’s end, Ghani sacked Noor (by accepting the resignation letter Noor provided earlier in the year as collateral). Noor has since rejected his own resignation and ordered the arrest of the man appointed to replace him as governor. Now, there are rumors that Ghani could fire Abdul Raziq Achakzai, the warlord who has kept Kandahar from going the way of the Taliban and has recently supported Noor. Achakzai, whose forces drill holes in the heads of detainees, recently declared: “I was not appointed by this government, and it cannot fire me.” In June, he was photographed with the commander of U.S. forces, Gen. John Nicholson. The Trump administration has looked away as Ghani has engaged in a domestic “game of thrones” while his country is on fire. This is partly because generals run the show in Kabul and Washington and a neutered State Department has been unable to restrain Ghani. The Trump cabinet includes three generals and an uninfluential secretary of state keen on depleting his organization. It took the Trump administration six months to nominate an ambassador to Afghanistan. During that time, it dismantled the State Department’s Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan office. Avoiding Chaos The general consensus among U.S. observers of Afghanistan is that the Taliban is too strong to be defeated militarily, but it is not strong enough to take over the whole country. But infighting among Afghanistan’s power elite, much like in Vietnam, or for that matter, in Afghanistan when the Taliban first took over, could be the straw the breaks the camel’s back. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam, lest we forget, was a formidable fighting force—far more capable than Afghan army today.

News article:
Reports emerged this week that more than 10,000 Afghan fighters deployed by Iran to defend the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad have been killed or injured in the past five years. Fazal Hadi Muslimyar, chairman of Meshrano Jirga, has said, “Iran is abusing Afghan refugees and sending them to the war in Syria and Iraq, where more than 2,000 Afghans have been killed,” he told lawmakers on January 9. “I am calling on the Afghan president, the chief executive, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry to lodge a complaint with the Iranian ambassador on this matter.” Muslimyar had criticized the Afghan government for refusing to actively pursue the issue on the diplomatic front on the previous day. He told Radio Free Afghanistan, “They should formally complain and seek help from the members of the United Nations Security Council with whom we have strategic security agreements.” His call for a diplomatic initiative is backed by fellow lawmakers, like Aryan Yoon, a female member of Wolesi Jirga or lower house of the Afghan Parliament. “Kabul should suspend its bilateral relations with Tehran,” she told Radio Free Afghanistan. “The Afghan government also needs to raise this issue at international forums and even lodge formal complaints with international bodies that Iran is interfering in its domestic affairs and abusing refugees.” Lawmaker Abdul Qadir Zazai Watandost says Wolesi Jirga’s foreign relations committee is investigating the issue. “This issue will be part of our general agenda after the winter recess [in February],” he said. An official for the Fatemiyoun Divison, Zohair Mojahed, said that since 2012 at least 10,000 Afghans have either been killed or wounded while fighting for al-Assad. He told Iran’s Shargh newspaper on January 6th, “This brigade has given more than 2,000 martyrs and 8,000 wounded for Islam.” Members of the Fatemiyoun Division are estimated to be some 20,000, most of whom were recruited from among Afghanistan’s Shi’ite Hazara minority. Deputy Afghan Chief Executive Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara politician, came under fire last November for seeming to confirm that thousands of Afghan recruits are fighting in Syria on Iran’s behalf. “I thank all the warriors who cooperated in these wars from Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other parts of the world,” Mohaqiq said at an event in Iran. He also praised Major General Qasem Soleimani, foreign operations commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who is credited with founding the Fatemiyoun Division. Presidential spokesman Shah Hussain Murtazawi was critical. “We have repeatedly expressed our opposition to all kinds of proxy wars in Afghanistan,” he said. “Similarly, we oppose such wars everywhere. We do not want the blood of our children being spilled for foreign interests in other countries.” However, spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry, Sibghatullah Ahmadi says Kabul has raised the issue with Tehran and the United Nations. He told Radio Free Afghanistan, “We have discussed this issue with the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the relevant Iranian authorities.” He added, “We hope the vulnerability of Afghan refugees is not being exploited and that our complaints are seriously addressed on time.” Tehran has not responded to complaints or criticism from Afghanistan. Still, Iranian media frequently reports on the funerals of Afghan fighters killed in Syria. Abdul Baqi Baryal, a member of Meshrano Jirga, is pushing for Kabul to address the issue immediately. According to what he told Radio Free Afghanistan, the Afghan Constitution allows the country’s citizens to only fight under its flag. “This is a very painful issue. We need to talk seriously about this with Iran soon,” he said.

News article:
Pakistan is unlikely to expand its anti-terror fight despite the hardline approach taken by the Trump administration, with threats of further punitive measures to push it to destroy the alleged safe havens of the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network.The US has long been pushing Pakistan to deny space to the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network, but the pressure has never been so intense and visible as has been during last few days.Events of the past few days starting from Trump’s stinging tweet to suspend entire security assistance have suggested that Washington is willing to risk its 16-year alliance with Pakistan to get the job done in Afghanistan.It is believed that senior military officials through informal channels have already conveyed to the Pakistani military authorities about their ‘specific demands’.“Our expectations are straightforward,” Pentagon spokesman Colonel Rob Manning told reporters in Washington on Monday. “[The] Taliban and Haqqani leadership and attack planners should no longer be able to find safe haven or conduct operations from Pakistani soil,” he added.Although he did not share details, the US is thought to have identified ‘certain targets and specific actions’ that it wants from Pakistan to undertake in stipulated time frame.Pakistan was informed that timely action on the US demands would lead to immediate restoration of around $1 billion of security assistance that Washington suspended just days after Trump’s New Year tweet.But interaction with at least two senior Pakistani officials, who have direct knowledge of the issue, suggested that Pakistan was not going to accept any fresh US demands.Both the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Express Tribune that in Pakistan’s assessment there was no organised infrastructure of any militant outfit – including the Haqqani network.“Therefore, the US demand does not hold any ground,” said one of the officials, who gave a rare insight into thinking of the Pakistani policymakers in the wake of Trump’s onslaught.After the Trump’s tweet, the country’s civil and military leadership had three-hour-long discussions and consultations. One of the talking points was whether Pakistan could do more. However, there was consensus in the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting that Pakistan must not give in to the US pressure.Their decision was based on the fact that Pakistan had already done enough and any fresh commitment would be tantamount to accepting the oft-repeated allegations that Islamabad is responsible for the failures in Afghanistan.But the larger purpose behind Pakistan’s reluctance to accept US demands is attributed to its policy decision that solution to the Afghan problem hinges on sustained peace talks.And if there is a need of the use of force, such a decision has to be taken with consensus by taking on board other regional players including China, Russia and Iran, argued another official.But Pakistan’s position could antagonise the Trump administration, which may resort to further punitive measures. The US already made it clear that it would no more accept Pakistan’s current approach towards the fight against terrorism.Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief Mike Pompeo accused Pakistan of providing shelter to terrorists who target US citizens, saying this is "no longer going to be acceptable".But Pakistani authorities are confident that the Trump administration despite its rhetoric would not go beyond a certain point.Their confidence stems from the fact that Pakistan has considerable leverage over the US. The presence of around 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan means that they not only have to rely on Pakistan for key supply lines but also the Afghan endgame.Pakistan’s position has been endorsed by some of the senior American diplomats who served in Islamabad and have considerable experience and knowledge of the intricacies involved in the Afghan imbroglio.In an article published in The New York Times, former US ambassador Richard Olson admitted that the Trump’s new strategy on Pakistan had little chances of success.“While perhaps it is emotionally satisfying to penalise a country that has supported American enemies in Afghanistan for the past 16 years, the administration’s approach is unlikely to work. Pakistan has greater leverage over us than many imagine,” Olson wrote.He said the ultimate answer to the Pakistan conundrum was to start a diplomatic initiative to bring peace to Afghanistan by opening talks with the Taliban.“The Trump administration has publicly stated that it sees the conflict ending only through a negotiated solution. It is difficult to understand why no such diplomatic initiative had been started,” Olson concluded with an observation that ironically supports Pakistan viewpoint.Meanwhile, speaking at a seminar in Islamabad, Defence Minister Khurrum Dastagir disclosed that Pakistan had suspended military and intelligence cooperation with the United States in the wake of Trump's diatribe."Field of intelligence cooperation and defence cooperation which we have suspended and my colleague Khawja Asif correctly pointed that out," Kurrum said.However, he added that the ground and air lines of communications were still operational. "Its a leverage we want to use at an appropriate time," the minister further said hinting that Pakistan could suspend key supply lines for the US forces in Afghanistan.

News article:
In reference your story US suspending more than $255 million in security aid to Pakistan (January 5) and the harsh tweets by president Donald Trump about Pakistan not co-operating fully to control terrorism, Pakistan must be very upset with the halting of aid and the strong comments of Mr Trump. However there is an opportunity in every crisis. Pakistan should endeavour to generate its own resources to fight terrorism in the country. Why depend on money from other countries to manage law and order at home? Pakistan is rich in agriculture, industry and textiles. Pakistan should focus on exports and generate adequate revenues so that it is self-sufficient. Self-help is the best help. Rajendra Aneja, Dubai Iran needs new leadership Regarding your story US and France agree on Iran regime's failure to serve people (January 8), the time of bad government in Iran has to come to an end. There has to be a new system of politics working in the direction of peace. Asyah Elisabeth Meel, Abu Dhabi VAT threatens the agility of the UAE's economy In reference to your leader The Government's VAT pledge gives a taste of our economic future (January 8), VAT is a redistributionist construct, so it is not hard to understand why redistribution should be promoted as its benefit. What is hard to understand is that, given the golden opportunity of developing the UAE's post-oil economy, the authorities have chosen to adopt this tax, where the cost ends up in the lap of the consumer, with often the least able bearing the greatest burden on their net income. The UAE's economy needs its agility to compete in the global marketplace. Andy Preston, Abu Dhabi Good conduct certificates are good in theory, but will they work in practice? In response to your story UAE to introduce 'good conduct certificate' requirement for work visas (January 8), where do these certificates come from if you have been a resident working expat for 23 years in the UAE? Or a born-and-brought-up expat here who has never worked outside the country? Tanya Milbourne, Dubai The UAE authorities already perform a background check on expatriate workers, so how is this any different? Sam Anderson, Abu Dhabi The UAE's effort to contain deadly Australian flu deserves applause In response to your story Deadly Australian flu spreads across the world (January 9), this is only the latest development in the spread of the deadly Australian flu across the globe, including America. That doctors in the UAE are calling for vaccination as a preventive measure after one patient's death is laudable. The World Health Organisation should immediately take measures to prevent this flu further. K Ragavan, India The US and Israel should stop bullying the Palestinians In response to your article Sweden warns against US cutting UN aid to Palestinians (January 10), it is about time to end the illegal occupation of Palestine. The United States should put pressure on Israel to end the longest and ugliest occupation in modern history, instead of bullying the Palestinian victims of the belligerent apartheid Israeli regime.

News article:
India has once again ramped up tensions with Pakistan, with its army chief General Bipin Rawat accusing Pakistan of sending terrorists into India through the Line of Control and saying that his country would not hesitate to call our nuclear bluff. Rawat’s irresponsible war-mongering, which has become typical of the Narendra Modi government, has been immediately condemned in Pakistan by the Senate and the DG of ISPR. The Indian general’s later statement – that India will need to solve the Kashmir issue – was seen by some as a softening of his stance, although the fact that he did not mention Pakistan in the context of Kashmir is notable. India has always maintained the pretence that Kashmir is an internal issue and there has been no change in that stance. Just how aggressive India is now becoming can be seen in the military deals concluded during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the country. Modi has specifically asked Netanyahu to invest more in India’s defence sector. The nexus between the two countries – both of which are international scofflaws illegally occupying territory – will only lower the chances of peace with Pakistan. India’s aggression can only be compounded now that it is allying itself so closely to Netanyahu – a man who never saw a Muslim-majority nation he didn’t advocate war against. The rapid deterioration in ties between Pakistan and India, despite the PML-N coming into power and advocating for peace, has been accompanied by a similar trajectory in our relationship with the US. From the time of his campaign trail, Donald Trump had been an advocate for India, and the general trajectory the US has been on had already brought it closer to the Indians. Trump has faithfully repeated the India line on Pakistan’s supposed support for militant groups. In what may be seen as some damage control effort, US Acting Assistant Secretary for State Alice Wells became the first American to visit Pakistan after Trump tweeted threats about cutting off all aid – and then did cut some aid. Well’s meetings with Pakistani officials have been appropriately fraught. It seems we are now turning the tables on the US and demanding it do more to take on militant groups like the TTP which are based in Afghanistan and regularly carry out attacks on our soil. Pakistan has long maintained that India has used its considerable influence in Afghanistan to foment militancy in this country, and the US has always turned a blind eye to this. The Centcom chief did phone Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa a few days back and was conciliatory in acknowledging that we have suffered because of superpower wars in Afghanistan. Such words of understanding, though, hold little weight so long as the US and its Indian allies continue their aggressive posturing in both words and deed.

News article:
India has once again ramped up tensions with Pakistan, with its army chief General Bipin Rawat accusing Pakistan of sending terrorists into India through the Line of Control and saying that his country would not hesitate to call our nuclear bluff. Rawat’s irresponsible war-mongering, which has become typical of the Narendra Modi government, has been immediately condemned in Pakistan by the Senate and the DG of ISPR. The Indian general’s later statement – that India will need to solve the Kashmir issue – was seen by some as a softening of his stance, although the fact that he did not mention Pakistan in the context of Kashmir is notable. India has always maintained the pretence that Kashmir is an internal issue and there has been no change in that stance. Just how aggressive India is now becoming can be seen in the military deals concluded during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the country. Modi has specifically asked Netanyahu to invest more in India’s defence sector. The nexus between the two countries – both of which are international scofflaws illegally occupying territory – will only lower the chances of peace with Pakistan. India’s aggression can only be compounded now that it is allying itself so closely to Netanyahu – a man who never saw a Muslim-majority nation he didn’t advocate war against. The rapid deterioration in ties between Pakistan and India, despite the PML-N coming into power and advocating for peace, has been accompanied by a similar trajectory in our relationship with the US. From the time of his campaign trail, Donald Trump had been an advocate for India, and the general trajectory the US has been on had already brought it closer to the Indians. Trump has faithfully repeated the India line on Pakistan’s supposed support for militant groups. In what may be seen as some damage control effort, US Acting Assistant Secretary for State Alice Wells became the first American to visit Pakistan after Trump tweeted threats about cutting off all aid – and then did cut some aid. Well’s meetings with Pakistani officials have been appropriately fraught. It seems we are now turning the tables on the US and demanding it do more to take on militant groups like the TTP which are based in Afghanistan and regularly carry out attacks on our soil. Pakistan has long maintained that India has used its considerable influence in Afghanistan to foment militancy in this country, and the US has always turned a blind eye to this. The Centcom chief did phone Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa a few days back and was conciliatory in acknowledging that we have suffered because of superpower wars in Afghanistan. Such words of understanding, though, hold little weight so long as the US and its Indian allies continue their aggressive posturing in both words and deed.

MNA – Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Raza Rabbani said Wed. that the US has been using Pakistan as a ‘scapegoat’ due to its recent losses in the Middle East, adding that Pakistan has paid a high price since then. Ali Larijani sat with the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Raza Rabbani on the sidelines of the 13th session of Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States (PUIC) Conference on Wednesday in Tehran. During the meeting, the Pakistani official slammed Washington’s approach in using his country as a ‘scapegoat’ due to the Western country’s recent losses in the Middle East region, adding “we have paid a high price for this. The US even cut off its military assistance to us due to our vote in condemnation of Trump’s decision to relocate US embassy to Jerusalem.” He also touched upon the good relations between Iran and Pakistan, noting that the Wednesday visit was his second in the last six months with Iranian Parliament Speaker, Ali Larijani. He further expressed hope that the PUIC’s statement that would be released today at the end of the conference would further strengthen relations among the Muslim countries. Ali Larijani, for his part, noted the common enemies facing Iran and Pakistan, calling for stronger relations between the two sides in a bid to foil any disruptive plot hatched by the US. Larijani also called for development of economic and security cooperation with Pakistan, saying the rise in the level of cooperation in the past few months indicates the appropriate decisions made by the two countries.

News article:
Relations between Pakistan and the US plunged to an all-time low after US President Donald Trump’s Twitter outburst against Pakistan on January 1. Subsequent actions by the US president to block dispersal of most aid to the country only made matters worse. The optimist’s view would be that ties had reached such a low that the two countries would have no option but to give diplomacy a chance lest the relationship be abandoned altogether. That is exactly what the US and Pakistan have now tried to do with the visit of Alice Wells, the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs’ principal deputy assistant secretary. Wells met with the civilian leadership during her stay in Pakistan and had some encouraging words to offer. She acknowledged the sacrifices Pakistan has made in fighting militancy, and pointed to intelligence-sharing and working towards a political settlement in Pakistan as ways in which the two countries could have a productive partnership. Her visit was a sign that the two countries will not entirely go their own way yet. But no amount of diplomatic niceties can change the fact that there has been an irrevocable change in ties. Wells has pointed out that there has been a shift to a new relationship, one where the US is engaged with us only so long as it is in its own interests. While that has always been a staple of US foreign policy, the Trump administration has been more open about it. For Pakistan, too, there is now less of a need to be stuck in a relationship that is no longer working for the country. After Wells’ visit, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said that we will have to survive without US aid so that we never again have to hear the taunts and insults of the US. The truth is that Pakistan is far less reliant on US aid than before, with China having stepped into the breach. We also need to understand that such diplomatic exchanges do not change the reality that American interests in the region are irrevocably tilted towards India. That was amply demonstrated by the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting India while Wells was in Karachi. The US-Israel-India nexus, focused on trade, investment and security cooperation, is a reminder that in today’s world US alliances have a decidedly anti-Pakistan nature. In India, Netanyahu has drawn common cause with India, saying both India and his own country face the problem of Islamist extremists. For these two countries, ‘Islamist extremism’ is the euphemism used to violently suppress the liberation movements in Palestine and Kashmir. India is also determined to convince the world that Pakistan is the prime sponsor of terrorism in the region, something it will now do with the backing of the US and Israel. Against this backdrop, any improvements in our relations with the US are likely to be temporary and not lead to any genuine breakthroughs.

News article:
Throughout the Cold War, Pakistan has been an instrumental US ally in south and central Asia. And the close relationship has continued in the years after. Pakistan has been key to the US efforts in Afghanistan since 2001, as the only reliable staging post in a region squeezed between Iran and China. In the service of this alliance, the US has supported Pakistan through thick and thin, through military dictatorships, through developing their own nuclear arsenal and through successive scandals involving Pakistan’s notorious ISI intelligence agency, and their dubious activities. Advertisement But in recent months, the ISI’s indiscretions and the tacit support they seem to have received from the military and political leadership of the country appear to have led the US to threaten to more or less cut ties with Pakistan. The transgressions which are motivating this move are Pakistan’s support for terrorist groups, and its duplicitous game of friend or foe it alternatively plays with the US and the Taliban. A recent point of contention has been the release from prison in Pakistan of Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Pakistan insists there is not enough evidence against him to try him in court, despite the fact that India has produced and handed over to the Pakistani authorities what they call “considerable evidence”. Saeed’s lawyers claim that no such evidence has been presented in court. This is very much in keeping with Pakistan’s history of supporting and protecting all manner of radical Islamist extremists. This historical policy has backfired spectacularly, as ordinary Pakistanis have suffered from radical Islamist terrorism more than any other intended target, but there is no denying that the ISI in particular has been keen to cultivate and protect Islamist terrorist agents to direct against India and Afghanistan. Yet Pakistan has also traditionally yielded when the US applied pressure on them for such activities. In normal circumstances, when the US would have called for an individual such as Saeed to be “prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”, they would have followed suit. Not so today. There are a number of reasons for why this is so. The relationship between the US and Pakistan has never truly recovered after the bin Laden episode. It remains as inconceivable today as it was in 2011 that the leader of al-Qaida had lived safely, for so many years in hiding in Pakistan. And not just anywhere, but in a large compound in the large city of Abbottabad, less than a mile away from the Pakistan Military Academy. An alliance requires trust. And that trust has never been re-established. A buffer for Iranian influence Then, there is the fact that the US has largely withdrawn from Afghanistan. It retains no particular strategic interests in the region beyond, perhaps, containing Iran. But even so, Pakistan and Iran are natural opponents on national and sectarian grounds, so Pakistan would be expected to continue to serve as a buffer for Iranian influence with or without US support. So the US is keen to extricate itself from the complicated and damaging relation it has with Pakistan, and is currently repositioning itself as more favourable to India: a bigger economic partner, and a more reliable counter-weight to Chinese expansion in Asia. Pakistan no longer feels itself beholden to American desires. And the US does not care enough to flex its muscle and get its way. Azeem Ibrahim But the crucial part of this is Pakistan’s own relationship with China. Whereas for most of its post-independence history, Pakistan has relied on US support against India and Iran, currently, the country is drifting ever more clearly into the Chinese sphere of influence. China is investing massively into infrastructure in the country as part of their New Silk Road initiative so that their access to the Western markets avoids the contentious Straights of Malacca. This investment is responsible for driving most of the current economic growth in Pakistan, as well as the increasing conditions ordinary Pakistanis are seeing along the Chinese-built economic corridor. The entire political and military establishment are also behind these new developments. In other words, the US is happy to retreat from Pakistan, and Pakistan is happy to move on to a closer relationship with China. The case of Hafiz Saeed may become emblematic of this shift. The rational thing to do about this case would be to hand him over to a court in a respected independent country agreeable to all parties, or maybe something like the ICC. If he were found not-guilty, that would vindicate Pakistan’s long standing claim that India is accusing it of terrorism without any basis. If he were found guilty, Pakistan would be confirmed as a state-sponsor of terror. But of course, no such thing will happen. Pakistan no longer feels itself beholden to American desires. And the US does not care enough to flex its muscle and get its way. It seems the two countries are having an amicable enough parting of ways. And the victims of Mumbai will be denied justice in the process.

News article:
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has given new timeline to both Pakistan and India for filing another round of memorials in the case of convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, sources have revealed to The Express Tribune.Sources revealed that the ICJ has set April 17 for India to file another memorial, while Pakistan will have to submit a counter memorial by July 17.In view of the timeline, they also informed that there is little chance that the hearing of the case will resume in 2018, adding that the two-month summer vacations of ICJ judges will start in August, and when it ended, the court will take up cases that have already been fixed before it.Earlier, New Delhi sought time to file an additional memorial at the ICJ. Legal experts are, however, wondering why India is trying to unnecessarily drag the matter.While submitting a 1,700-page counter memorial in the ICJ on December 13 last year, Pakistan rejected the Indian objection of not giving consular access to Jadhav, saying the provision of such access under the Vienna Convention is only for legitimate visitors, and not spies.Pakistan said that since India did not deny that Jadhav was travelling with an assumed Muslim name, they have no case to plead.India has repeatedly sought consular access to Jadhav, but Pakistan has turned down its requests, citing a bilateral accord that does not permit such access to spies.However, on December 25, Islamabad allowed Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet with him on purely humanitarian grounds.It was learnt that the government has also sought legal assistance from two top lawyers of the country. The initial memorial was drafted by Khawar Qureshi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under India’s spy agency – Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion, that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission.“Only a state that adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said that sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking the jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said the counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.On September 13 last year, India submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan.The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad hoc judge for the case at The Hague.Legal experts are urging all stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 last year halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

News article:
As president, Donald Trump has steered a new course in the Middle East Donald Trump has spent much of his first year as president of the United States seeking to undo the legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. The volatile Middle East is one of the many areas where Trump has broken with US policy and precedent. On Wednesday, Trump overturned decades of US policy by announcing that Washington recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and setting in motion plans to move the embassy there from Tel Aviv. Here is a look at some of the hot button issues in the Middle East and the new course being steered by Trump: - Israel and the Palestinians - Trump has instituted a policy of unwavering support for Israel after a period of strained relations between Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The last days of the Obama administration included an extraordinary US refusal at the United Nations to block a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction. Netanyahu welcomed Trump's November 2016 election saying he was a "true friend of the State of Israel." Since then, Trump has appointed a US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, known for his support for settlement activity, and ordered the withdrawal of US support for UNESCO, citing anti-Israel bias. Trump has tasked his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a senior adviser, with relaunching moribund peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. But he has been lukewarm about a Palestinian state and angered Palestinian leaders earlier this year with a threat -- since withdrawn -- to close the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in Washington. - Iran - Trump considers Iran to be the principal threat to US interests in the Middle East and has frequently condemned the Islamic Republic for what he sees as its "destabilizing" influence in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. Trump has been a relentless critic of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and has repeatedly threatened to scrap the agreement intended to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. The president's tough stance on Iran has earned praise from Netanyahu and from Saudi Arabia, the Islamic Republic's chief regional rival. - Saudi Arabia, Egypt - Trump has strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia and his first official visit abroad as president was to the oil-rich monarchy, where he was received with pomp and circumstance. Trump threw his support behind the anti-corruption crackdown launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi actions against Qatar, which Riyadh accuses of cooperating with Tehran. Relations with another Middle East powerhouse -- Egypt -- have also entered a new era under Trump. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was persona non grata under Obama and the United States cut off some military aid because of the bloody crackdown on supporters of the former president. But Trump welcomed Sisi to the White House in April and proclaimed his "strong backing" for the Egyptian leader. - Syria - Trump frequently accused Obama of failing to stand up to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and in April he ordered the first US military strike on Syrian troops since the civil war began in that country. Dozens of US missiles were fired at a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack on a rebel town which left 87 people dead. The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria and the Pentagon said Tuesday that they will stay "as long as we need" to prevent a return of the Islamic State group. Trump also reinforced the US military contingent in Afghanistan, a move at odds with Obama's efforts to withdraw US troops from conflict zones abroad.

The president's tough stance on Iran has earned praise from Netanyahu and from Saudi Arabia, the Islamic Republic's chief regional rival. - Saudi Arabia, Egypt - Trump has strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia and his first official visit abroad as president was to the oil-rich monarchy, where he was received with pomp and circumstance. Trump threw his support behind the anti-corruption crackdown launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi actions against Qatar, which Riyadh accuses of cooperating with Tehran. Relations with another Middle East powerhouse -- Egypt -- have also entered a new era under Trump. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was persona non grata under Obama and the United States cut off some military aid because of the bloody crackdown on supporters of the former president. But Trump welcomed Sisi to the White House in April and proclaimed his "strong backing" for the Egyptian leader. - Syria - Trump frequently accused Obama of failing to stand up to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and in April he ordered the first US military strike on Syrian troops since the civil war began in that country. Dozens of US missiles were fired at a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack on a rebel town which left 87 people dead. The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria and the Pentagon said Tuesday that they will stay "as long as we need" to prevent a return of the Islamic State group. Trump also reinforced the US military contingent in Afghanistan, a move at odds with Obama's efforts to withdraw US troops from conflict zones abroad.

Criticism from the international community of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital continue, warning that it threatens stability throughout the region. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that he is "launching an appeal for calm and responsibility." Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said the move runs counter to common sense. Moscow expects the U.S. to clarify its controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital before the U.N. Security Council, Lavrov said. "Today, in my opinion, the [U.N.] Security Council will meet on this topic. We hope that there our American counterparts will explain how and where they see future steps" in the wake of the decision, Sergey Lavrov was quoted as saying by Russia's official TASS news agency. Lavrov's remarks came during a news conference at the OSCE foreign ministers meeting in the Austrian capital of Vienna. He mentioned that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told him on Thursday that the U.S. wants to conclude a "deal of the century" to solve the Palestinian-Israeli problem "in one stroke." The European Union's foreign policy chief on Friday sounded the alarm on the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, warning of its "very worrying potential impact." At a joint news conference with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi, Federica Mogherini said: "We were in close contact as always, but particularly in these last days during and after the announcement by Mr. Trump on the U.S. decision [on] Jerusalem. "We both agree that it is a decision that has a very worrying potential impact in this very fragile context. "No one can afford any further destabilization, and especially those living in the region. ... More violence and chaos are absolutely to be avoided. They are in no one's interest." Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri also said the U.S. decision "will further complicate the peace process and pose an additional challenge to the stability of the whole region." Hariri's brief resignation last month sparked fears of a new proxy conflict in Lebanon. Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Friday called on Muslim countries to unite and reject Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Latin American and Caribbean countries also voiced strong opposition Thursday. Eight out of 15 countries on the U.N. Security Council, including Bolivia and Uruguay, called for an urgent meeting of the council to discuss the issue. The government of Uruguay stressed that the White House's decision, "does not help to improve the climate of peace and mutual respect needed to reach a complete, lasting and fair solution in the Middle East." Bolivian ambassador to the U.N. Sacha Llorenti said the "unilateral decision violates various [U.N.] Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, undermines any attempts to reach a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and makes the already volatile region even more unstable." Mexico, through its Foreign Affairs secretary, said it will maintain its embassy in Tel Aviv. "Mexico will maintain its friendly bilateral relations with the state of Israel … and it will also support the historic claims of the Palestinian people," Mexico's foreign minister said. Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile and Cuba are also among the Latin American countries that oppose the decision. Tanzania on Friday said its embassy in Israel will also remain in Tel Aviv, despite concerted efforts to convince the East African country to move its embassy to Jerusalem. Meanwhile, protests against the decision around the world continue. Thousands of people in the U.S. city of Chicago marched and protested through downtown on Thursday night, voicing their opposition to Trump's decision. Hundreds of Muslims protested in Indian-controlled Kashmir against Trump's decision concerning Jerusalem. Protesters marched in several places in the main city of Srinagar and other parts of the region after Friday prayers. They chanted slogans such as "Down with America" and "Down with Israel." Similar protests also took place in Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Tunisia. Jordanians chanted "Jerusalem is Arab," as part of a protest against Trump's decision. Hundreds of Iranians also rallied in the capital, Tehran, and chanted "Death to America" and "Death to Israel" in a show of anger over the decision. More than 2,000 people staged a demonstration after Friday prayers outside Al-Azhar Mosque in eastern Cairo to protest U.S. President Donald Trump's decision.

News article:
Talking to IRNA on Saturday, Abhimanyu Kohar, who is the founder of a group called Yuva Kranti Organization which advocates new paradigms for Indian youth in political and social arenas said that the Zionist lobby in the United States has grown more powerful.Noting that earlier governments in the United States too had sought to transfer the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, he said now it is Trump who acts courageously to expose the dual American standard to the whole world.He said that the Zionist regime lobby in the United States has also tried to cancel the nuclear deal with Iran. And all these happen because the Zionist regime fears Hezbollah, Iran, and the Palestinian people.He added that “one of America's objectives in moving its embassy to Jerusalem is to provoke Muslims. The ISIS terrorist group has now been destroyed by the efforts of the Iraqi and Syrian armies and the Iranian aid. But the United States wants to expand extremist Wahhabi ideas in the region thus provokes Muslims to react.”On the consequences of the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the Indian political activist stressed that one results of this US decision is the elimination of talks with Palestine. While the US backed Zionist politicians claim they want to negotiate, but such actions will undermine the negotiation process.“If the United States really is a democratic country, they should respect the sentiments of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian issue is not a religious issue, but a humanistic problem. Human rights in Palestine have been ignored,” he stressed.He further noted, “People around the world support Palestine in a peaceful manner. But the Zionist regime is using violence against oppressed Palestinians. The people of the world should give the message to the United States that they support the Palestinians and press the United States and Zionist regime to comply with UN resolutions.”On Indian government and Indian media positions against Palestine, Kohar said, 'The Indian government has said that its policy will not be affected by the third country. The Indian foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj in the last Non-Alignment meeting has said that India is concerned about the situation in Palestine.However, he noted that in recent years, the Zionist regime-Wahhabi lobby has infiltrated India's media, so many of Indian media would refrain from explicitly voicing support to Palestine. The Indian government should continue to support the Palestinian people.Kohar concluded, 'The Palestinians must attain their rights, and all the countries must support the Palestinian people.'Ignoring the United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 478 dated 1980, Trump on Wednesday said in a press conference that the fact that Tel Aviv was currently used as the Zionist regime capital was 'illegal' and said, 'Time is ripe to recognize Quds as Israel capital.'He also ordered the US foreign ministry to make necessary preparations to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds.His decision was met by wide protest on the part of both governments and people of many world countries, even US allies.267**1424Follow us on Tweeter@ IrnaEnglish

By Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor* By Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor* Through its own actions, the US has diminished its status as leader of the free world and eliminated itself as an honest broker. America’s allies and adversaries are appalled by the recent decision to throw a grenade into the Middle East by unilaterally declaring Jerusalem the capital of the Jewish state. The special relationship between the UK and America is in jeopardy. Furious parliamentarians are calling for the US President Donald Trump to be banned from visiting Britain. In an unprecedented move, the UK, France and Italy joined with five other countries to demand an emergency session of the UN Security Council to air their condemnations. However, there will be no UN resolution due to America’s power of veto. Germany’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Sigmar Gabriel dispensed with diplomatic norms, saying: “The US no longer sees the world as a global community, but as a fighting arena where everyone has to seek their own advantage. Even after Trump leaves the White House, relations with the US will never be the same.” This reckless act has killed all hopes of peace. The motivation behind this decision was either to pacify the right-wing pro-Israel base in the US or to provoke violent reactions within our region to justify US anti-Muslim policies. Hamas has called for a third Palestinian uprising. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, who will shortly be dispatched to the region to undertake damage control. Worse, this declaration has fed into the narrative of extremist groups. Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabab, the Taliban and others have made calls to arms. It has made the world a far more dangerous place for Israeli and American travelers by putting targets on their heads. This gross provocation is a gift to terrorist recruiters and could spark lone wolf attacks in Western and Arab cities. Trump is aware of the potential repercussions, which is why he has ordered US Marines to guard embassies and the US Department of State has advised Americans in the Middle East to keep a low profile. Disappointed in former US President Barack Obama’s pro-Iran stance and his affiliation with the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood, I had high hopes that a businessman could invigorate America’s economy and bring a fresh perspective to US Middle East policy. Unlike the US media that savaged Trump from the get-go, and still goes for his jugular, I nevertheless chose to give the new US administration a chance, primarily because the US is up there with the countries I most admire and many of my dearest friends are American. I wanted Trump to succeed for the sake of the American people and hoped he would strengthen the relationship between the US and the Arab world. It soon became evident that he had surrounded himself with disreputable characters, not least his short-lived chief strategist, the Machiavellian bully Steve Bannon, known for his incendiary anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant rhetoric. His even shorter-lived National Security Advisor Mike Flynn admitted lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and is now cooperating with Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling with the US election to save his own skin. In just over a year, 14 top-level officials within his administration have either been fired or have quit. At least nine Trump associates are being probed for collaboration with Moscow. The rogues’ gallery is expanding fast. True to his word, he binned liberal democratic free trade principles by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP) and threatening to cancel the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Almost the entire international community was shocked and dismayed by his ditching of the Paris climate accord and since, his executive orders have illustrated his disregard for maintaining a healthy environment and preserving wildlife. Within pro-western Arab nations, the strikes against him were mounting until his wildly successful visit to Saudi Arabia where he discussed ways of combating terrorism with King Salman and other Arab leaders in a warm celebratory atmosphere. Trump’s criticism of Qatar’s funding of terrorists and his support for the Saudi-led quartet’s political and economic distancing — contingent upon the emir’s acceptance of 13 demands — persuaded me that for all his faults we could count on him as a staunch ally. That was until his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson heaped praise on Qatar for its fight against terrorism while criticizing Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt for what he termed their “blockade.” From my own perspective, the US administration has three major strikes against it: Strike one: On Iran, it is yet to deliver the campaign pledge to pull America out of the woeful Iran deal, merely opting not to certify Tehran’s compliance. He is still to halt Iran’s aggressive actions toward its neighbors. Strike two: Following a US military assault to clear Raqqa of Daesh, Washington has seemingly handed Syria back to the Iranian-backed Bashar Assad regime and its Russian protector. Strike three: Washington has betrayed the Palestinian people, reneged on America’s commitments under the Oslo Accords and trampled upon UN Security Council Resolutions endorsed by his predecessors to the effect that only a final status agreement can determine Jerusalem’s status. In another mishap, Tillerson seems to have ignored that America has been a fully-fledged partner in the Saudi coalition’s efforts to beat back Iranian-supported Houthis to restore the legitimate government in Yemen. Now it appears the US State Department is “taking a tougher stance” against the efforts to reinstall a legitimate government in Yemen. That must be music to the ears of the Iranian mullahs and the primitive Houthi rag-tags, who slaughtered former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. I must, therefore, appeal to the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan to adopt new policies to cope with these realities. We must be united to project power in order to protect our part of the world that has suffered so terribly from foreign interference and we should show our displeasure by collaborating with other world powers while diversifying our suppliers of aircraft, weapons, technological items etc. We Emiratis should work closely with our trusted friends to repair the damage done by the latest US Jerusalem announcement to ensure Jerusalem will always be the capital of Palestine in our hearts — and, if God wills, in reality. • Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor is a prominent UAE businessman and public figure.

His even shorter-lived National Security Advisor Mike Flynn admitted lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and is now cooperating with Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling with the US election to save his own skin. In just over a year, 14 top-level officials within his administration have either been fired or have quit. At least nine Trump associates are being probed for collaboration with Moscow. The rogues’ gallery is expanding fast. True to his word, he binned liberal democratic free trade principles by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP) and threatening to cancel the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Almost the entire international community was shocked and dismayed by his ditching of the Paris climate accord and since, his executive orders have illustrated his disregard for maintaining a healthy environment and preserving wildlife. Within pro-western Arab nations, the strikes against him were mounting until his wildly successful visit to Saudi Arabia where he discussed ways of combating terrorism with King Salman and other Arab leaders in a warm celebratory atmosphere. Trump’s criticism of Qatar’s funding of terrorists and his support for the Saudi-led quartet’s political and economic distancing — contingent upon the emir’s acceptance of 13 demands — persuaded me that for all his faults we could count on him as a staunch ally. That was until his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson heaped praise on Qatar for its fight against terrorism while criticizing Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt for what he termed their “blockade.” From my own perspective, the US administration has three major strikes against it: Strike one: On Iran, it is yet to deliver the campaign pledge to pull America out of the woeful Iran deal, merely opting not to certify Tehran’s compliance. He is still to halt Iran’s aggressive actions toward its neighbors. Strike two: Following a US military assault to clear Raqqa of Daesh, Washington has seemingly handed Syria back to the Iranian-backed Bashar Assad regime and its Russian protector. Strike three: Washington has betrayed the Palestinian people, reneged on America’s commitments under the Oslo Accords and trampled upon UN Security Council Resolutions endorsed by his predecessors to the effect that only a final status agreement can determine Jerusalem’s status. In another mishap, Tillerson seems to have ignored that America has been a fully-fledged partner in the Saudi coalition’s efforts to beat back Iranian-supported Houthis to restore the legitimate government in Yemen. Now it appears the US State Department is “taking a tougher stance” against the efforts to reinstall a legitimate government in Yemen. That must be music to the ears of the Iranian mullahs and the primitive Houthi rag-tags, who slaughtered former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. I must, therefore, appeal to the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan to adopt new policies to cope with these realities. We must be united to project power in order to protect our part of the world that has suffered so terribly from foreign interference and we should show our displeasure by collaborating with other world powers while diversifying our suppliers of aircraft, weapons, technological items etc. We Emiratis should work closely with our trusted friends to repair the damage done by the latest US Jerusalem announcement to ensure Jerusalem will always be the capital of Palestine in our hearts — and, if God wills, in reality. • Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor is a prominent UAE businessman and public figure.

News article:
By Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor* By Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor* Through its own actions, the US has diminished its status as leader of the free world and eliminated itself as an honest broker. America’s allies and adversaries are appalled by the recent decision to throw a grenade into the Middle East by unilaterally declaring Jerusalem the capital of the Jewish state. The special relationship between the UK and America is in jeopardy. Furious parliamentarians are calling for the US President Donald Trump to be banned from visiting Britain. In an unprecedented move, the UK, France and Italy joined with five other countries to demand an emergency session of the UN Security Council to air their condemnations. However, there will be no UN resolution due to America’s power of veto. Germany’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Sigmar Gabriel dispensed with diplomatic norms, saying: “The US no longer sees the world as a global community, but as a fighting arena where everyone has to seek their own advantage. Even after Trump leaves the White House, relations with the US will never be the same.” This reckless act has killed all hopes of peace. The motivation behind this decision was either to pacify the right-wing pro-Israel base in the US or to provoke violent reactions within our region to justify US anti-Muslim policies. Hamas has called for a third Palestinian uprising. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, who will shortly be dispatched to the region to undertake damage control. Worse, this declaration has fed into the narrative of extremist groups. Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabab, the Taliban and others have made calls to arms. It has made the world a far more dangerous place for Israeli and American travelers by putting targets on their heads. This gross provocation is a gift to terrorist recruiters and could spark lone wolf attacks in Western and Arab cities. Trump is aware of the potential repercussions, which is why he has ordered US Marines to guard embassies and the US Department of State has advised Americans in the Middle East to keep a low profile. Disappointed in former US President Barack Obama’s pro-Iran stance and his affiliation with the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood, I had high hopes that a businessman could invigorate America’s economy and bring a fresh perspective to US Middle East policy. Unlike the US media that savaged Trump from the get-go, and still goes for his jugular, I nevertheless chose to give the new US administration a chance, primarily because the US is up there with the countries I most admire and many of my dearest friends are American. I wanted Trump to succeed for the sake of the American people and hoped he would strengthen the relationship between the US and the Arab world. It soon became evident that he had surrounded himself with disreputable characters, not least his short-lived chief strategist, the Machiavellian bully Steve Bannon, known for his incendiary anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant rhetoric.

News article:
President Donald Trump will on Monday declare a new US national security strategy for the next four years based on four pillars: protecting the homeland, stimulating American prosperity, promoting peace through strength, and enhancing American leadership in the world. National security adviser H.R. McMaster gave a preview of the Trump administration’s new national security policy, using interesting terminology to describe Russia and China as “revisionist powers”, and Iran and North Korea as “rogue regimes”. McMaster cited extremist jihadist groups as the third challenge facing the United States, but went beyond ISIS and al-Qaeda to include the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood in this category of threats, accusing Turkey and Qatar of endorsing, supporting, and promoting the Brotherhood. Moscow responded swiftly, questioning the knowledge of the national security adviser and denying any “sophisticated subversion” in the United States. This came amid continued bickering between Washington and Moscow, the Kremlin having recently responded to Washington’s questioning of Russian victory against ISIS in Syria and attempting to take credit for that victory itself, by saying 'victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan'. The American-Russian bickering in Syria is both superficial and deep, especially with regard to the fate of foreign forces in Syria – US troops, Russian forces, Iranian militias, and Turkish soldiers – as well as the fate of Bashar al-Assad himself. According to UN sources, the Syrian government is now working to kill off the Geneva Process, which has had the backing of the Security Council as a roadmap for a political settlement in Syria culminating with a transitional government with executive powers. Damascus’s bet is that the putative Sochi process would be the bullet that terminates Geneva. The Syrian government thus wanted the Geneva meeting to convene as a last stop without any further meetings, because in Sochi, under the auspices of its Russian ally, Damascus can possibly manipulate the transitional process away from the UN and Geneva path, complete with a new constitution, elections, and transitional mechanisms. Advertisement UN Syria envoy Staffan De Mistura is currently engaged in talks with the Russian authorities to agree on principles to link the Sochi process to Geneva’s. The UN hopes for a national dialogue to convene in Sochi on a basis that would enshrine a UN supervisory role in drafting the new constitution and holding elections, which should be the outcomes of this dialogue. But if De Mistura’s efforts to agree a clear framework for the Sochi process fail, Sochi will no doubt replace Geneva. This could spell the end for the idea of a transitional government with full executive powers, as promised by Security Council resolutions. Regarding the role of the Syrian former foreign minister Farouk al-Sharaa, amid reports he could lead the transitional process, a UN source revealed Syrian opposition figures had suggested to Russia that Sharaa lead the Sochi meeting, as a figure acceptable to both sides. The Russians reportedly were open to the idea, and have communicated this to Damascus. However, according to the same source, the Syrian government has not given a conclusive answer. If an agreement is reached on Sharaa heading the Sochi meeting, it is likely his role would be expanded to head a broad-based national government agreed by both sides. However, this does not mean that Bashar al-Assad would step down. That outcome was related to the Geneva process, but if Sharaa comes to head a transitional government through Sotchi, the terms are entirely different both practically and politically. The US administration seems less interested in the fate of Assad, his powers, and the transitional government than it is in the issue of permanent US military deployment in Syria. The US is determined to prevent Russia from monopolizing this strategic location to the exclusion of US interests. In equal measure, Washington is not concerned with the Syrian constitution and elections as much as it is concerned with the fate of Iran’s strategy in Syria and its corridor to Lebanon via Iraq and Syria. Advertisement US high-level military sources have mocked speculations suggesting Washington is going to turn a blind eye to Iran’s foothold in Syria and allow it to gain a strategic advantage there. Diplomatic sources say the US administration’s moves this week are crucial on the Iranian issue, ahead of President Trump’s announcement of his new national security strategy. Indeed, both McMaster and the US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley have moved to highlight their administration’s intention to confront Iran, especially in Syria, as McMaster said, and in Yemen, with Haley preparing a dossier on Iran’s actions there at the UN. A starting point for the US campaign against Iran in Yemen would be the UN Security Resolution that prohibits Iran from exporting weapons and missiles to the Houthi rebels. Haley has ‘evidence’ of Iranian support for the Houthis, and intends to present it to the Security Council after presenting it to the media and public opinion, to mobilize support for a firm US policy against Iran’s role in Yemen. In truth, this marks a shift in US policy, which previously steered clear from the issue of Yemen. It is also a shift from the policies of former President Obama, who avoided challenging Iran’s regional policies including its intervention in Yemen. This is an important shift, because it has a dimension related to US-Saudi relations under Trump, who resumed the strategic alliance with Riyadh after Obama’ downgraded those ties to a notch below his Iranian priority. It is also important because Obama had unburdened Iran from the Security Council resolutions that banned the export of weapons and fighters, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, under the nuclear deal with Iran. Today, the Trump administration is attempting to re-uphold the ban through Yemen, on the basis of a binding international resolutions with sanctions in the event of non-compliance. Haley is seeking to present evidence of Iranian violations and threats to the stability of US allies including by means of facilitating the launch of ballistic missiles against them, to pressure the European Union powers to stop abetting Iran’s actions in order to safeguard the nuclear deal. Indeed, the Trump administration intends to lobby the Europeans to impose sanctions on Iran, especially the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) for its deep incursions into Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. According to one US official source, however, it may be impossible to pass a resolution like that at the Security Council because of the Russian and Chinese vetoes. However, it is not impossible to take a firm stance with the Europeans on Iran’s destabilization of US allies. The doctrine Trump is expected to unveil on Monday will be based on confronting threats to US national security as a strategic commitment. Confronting Iran as a matter of policy, philosophy, and doctrine for the Trump administration upends Obama’s doctrine of appeasing Iran and its regional adventures. Advertisement The introduction of the Muslim Brotherhood to this doctrine is new, along with its inclusion in the list of Islamic radicalism and the accusations against Turkey of sponsoring the Brotherhood, and Qatar of promoting them. This in parallel with the expansion of the scope of what constitutes Islamic radicalism to include Iranian-backed Shia groups. The priority for the Trump doctrine will not be the ‘rogue regimes’ like Iran and North Korea, as much as it will be the ‘revisionist powers’ engaging in subversion in the domestic politics of Western states, undermining the international system, and waging economic aggression, like China and Russia, as designated by McMaster.

Confronting Iran as a matter of policy, philosophy, and doctrine for the Trump administration upends Obama’s doctrine of appeasing Iran and its regional adventures. Advertisement The introduction of the Muslim Brotherhood to this doctrine is new, along with its inclusion in the list of Islamic radicalism and the accusations against Turkey of sponsoring the Brotherhood, and Qatar of promoting them. This in parallel with the expansion of the scope of what constitutes Islamic radicalism to include Iranian-backed Shia groups. The priority for the Trump doctrine will not be the ‘rogue regimes’ like Iran and North Korea, as much as it will be the ‘revisionist powers’ engaging in subversion in the domestic politics of Western states, undermining the international system, and waging economic aggression, like China and Russia, as designated by McMaster.

News article:
President Donald Trump has laid out plans for the U.S. to challenge Russia and China's growing influence on the world stage; rein in North Korea and Iran's defiance of the West; and destroy what's left of the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). Trump announced Monday his new national security strategy, a document produced by every U.S. leader since former President Ronald Reagan as mandated by Congress in 1986. Trump's highly anticipated report, which was shared by the White House, promised an "America First" strategy that identified other leading world powers, authoritarian states opposed to the West and the global threat of jihadi organizations as the foremost threats to the U.S. Related: U.S. War With Russia and China More Likely as World Power Shifts From West to East, NATO Says "China and Russia challenge American power, influence and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity. They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence," Trump wrote in his first such report as president. "At the same time, the dictatorships of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran are determined to destabilize regions, threaten Americans and our allies, and brutalize their own people. Transnational threat groups, from jihadist terrorists to transnational criminal organizations, are actively trying to harm Americans," he wrote. In the 55-page document, Trump did not specifically reference U.S. allegations that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election in his favor, but did charge Moscow with "using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies." When Trump entered office in January, he was widely considered to be a political ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, but their relationship has been strained as their nations diverged on major issues such as the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. Recent reports that the CIA provided the Kremlin with crucial intelligence to stop a jihadi attack in St. Petersburg, and cautious cooperation between the U.S. and Russia in battling ISIS in Syria have produced prospects for an improved relationship, but the Trump administration has remained deeply suspicious of Russia's growing military power and diplomatic influence that challenges Western dominance in crucial areas such as Europe and the Middle East. Trump criticized Russian and Chinese initiatives to develop "advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten our critical infrastructure and our command and control architecture" and "to reassert their influence regionally and globally." In addition to targeting China's own growing military and political power, Trump censured Beijing for stealing "U.S. intellectual property valued at hundreds of billions of dollars," while noting its advances in sophisticated artificial intelligence programs and investment in infrastructure across the globe. The report singled out the "rogue regime" of North Korea and "evil dictatorship" of Iran, both of which occupied the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism as of November. Trump escalated the U.S.-led campaign to disarm North Korea's nuclear and ballistic weapons arsenal, which has grown substantially in power under young supreme leader Kim Jong Un, and threatened to do so by force. Trump also decertified a 2015 historic nuclear deal with Iran and has led efforts to isolate Tehran diplomatically over accusations it sponsored militant groups across the Middle East. Trump pledged to deploy "a layered missile defense system focused on North Korea and Iran to defend our homeland against missile attacks." Both countries have denied wanting to target the U.S. and have compared Trump's stance toward their respective nations to that of former President George W. Bush in the days leading up to the Iraq War. Trump's charges against Russia and Iran came in spite of the fact that all three were involved in the fight against ISIS, which saw significant losses in the past year. In separate offensives, a Russia and Iran-backed campaign and a U.S.-led campaign largely defeated the militants in Syria, while forces supported by both the U.S. and Iran ousted the jihadis from the vast majority of Iraq. Russia, Iran, Iraq and Syria have all declared victory over the group in past weeks, but their forces, as well as the U.S., continue bombing the group in shrinking pockets of territory. Despite ISIS's massive territorial defeats, attacks conducted in the name of the group have continued worldwide. New York City experienced its first ISIS-inspired attack in October, the deadliest to hit the city since 9/11, and a second earlier this month, which injured several people, including the perpetrator. Authorities said the suspect in the pipe-bomb blast, which only seriously hurt the attacker himself, may have gotten instructions to build the device online, highlighting the continued threat of ISIS's virtual caliphate, which has provided instructions to would-be jihadis to strike targets around the world.

News article:
Alwaght– In an appearance with his British counterpart Mark Sedwill, the US National Security Advisor General H. R. McMaster on December 12 outlined the most important aspects of the new American national security doctrine. They came in four priorities: Protection of the homeland and American people, advancing the American prosperity, preserving peace through strength, and advancing the American influence. The American president is set to unveil the document of the new American national security strategy on December 18. The irrational functions of the American president both at home and in the country’s foreign policy have doubled significance of unveiling of the new national security strategy that will highlight the national interests as well as the threats and their sources and the ways to prevent and repulse them. According to the American national security advisor, Russia and China, and then North Korea and Iran will be marked the top threats to the US national security and Washington’s position of the global leadership. The General took a warning tone on Russia, saying: “We are facing a threat from Russia that involves also so-called new generation warfare.” He as part of the Russia-related comments touched on the American intelligence community’s assessment of Russian attempts to influence the American presidential elections last year, adding “These are very sophisticated campaigns of subversion and disinformation, and propaganda, using cyber tools operating across multiple domains that attempt to divide our communities within our nations.” General McMaster blasted China for what he called Beijing’s “economic aggression.” He said China has challenged the global law-based economic order, causing hundreds of millions of people around the world to live in poverty. The advisor, moreover, asked the Chinese officials to do more in relation to the North Korean nuclear crisis. He said that this call could mark the best and last opportunity to steer clear of military confrontation with Pyongyang. The American official also had his words on Iran, maintaining that the new American strategy will seek to counter the Islamic Republic in not only the embattled Syria but also the whole West Asia region. He added that this encounter will go while efforts to block Iran’s alleged efforts to build nuclear weapons will go on unceasingly. America First policy: Walking towards isolation One of the major mottos of Donald Trump during 2016 presidential campaign was “America First” policy. For the American president, there are no such things as “global anthem”, “global currency”, and “global flag.” Nevertheless, the American businessman believes that his “Job is not to represent the world,” emphasizing that “My job is to represent the United States of America”. When it comes to the comparison with his precedents, Trump’s strategy is way different. The national security of the former President Barack Obama, published in 2015, focused on such concepts as multilateralism, smart power, and the need to tackle the climate changes. Obama’s predecessor George W. Bush national security accentuated the American alleged commitment to opening up the closed societies and defending the democracy and human rights. But Trump’s key national security strategy lines isolate the US from such things as global security efforts, boosting peace, and promoting democracy in other countries. Instead, the core tenets of his strategy are the advancing prosperity, protecting the Americans, and expanding Washington’s influence worldwide. Here is the American strategy under Trump in short: The US stages irresponsible interventionism, in which the American prosperity should be saved instead of enlarged, and, foreign economic powers are considered rivals rather than partners. In this new strategic pathway, the US role-playing on the global stage will be devoted to the cases and regions where the country’s interests are directly involved. In the brand-new vision, the realization of interests will less be pursued through multi-polar international organizations, modalities, and regimes. Instead, the concentration will be on bipolar balance-making deals with each of the rival powers, similar to the 19th century fragile and flowing accords between the powers on specific cases. Therefore, under the new leadership, the US seeks preserving the past achievements rather than creating opportunities for more partnership with the others. This is drawing opposition from allies. Europe as the closest ally of the US comes against Washington’s unilateral decisions like withdrawing from Paris climate agreement, challenging the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran, and very recently the controversial recognition of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the Israeli regime’s capital. Such conflict of views with the allied EU will certainly bring isolation to the US. Therefore, Trump himself is setting up major roadblocks ahead of the global American influence. Confrontational policy to save the current position The revision of the national security strategy in less than three years accentuates the White House leader’s growing concerns over the wavering position of the US as a global superpower which was gained after the breakup of the rival Soviet Union whose existence ensured a bipolar global order. In the recent years, concomitant with the decline of the US role and effect on various intentional cases was the rise of such new powers as Russia, China, and the European Union, three of which proving to be challengers, though in various degrees, to the American might. Among the other two, China, with its extraordinary economic growth and military strength boost, presented most challenging force to the US hegemony on the world arena. McMaster also said that in recent years the US cleared the rivalry scene and so gave opportunities to what he called “revisionist powers”, in a reference to China and Russia. His reference was apparently to the Obama’s policies, including pulling out of Iraq and partially from Afghanistan and failing to meet expectations of the regional allies for Washington’s direct role in crises such as Syria and Ukraine that flattened the way of the Russian influence boost in West Asia and Eastern Europe. Other US fallacious policies, according to McMaster, involved failing to seriously check Beijing’s rapid economic upturn and geopolitical expansionism in East Asia and posing threats to US allies in the region. In McMaster’s eye, signing the nuclear agreement with Iran and neglecting the Israeli and Saudi calls for adequately pressing Tehran under Obama was another flaw of the previous administration.

News article:
Topic: Presidency Strategy Region: United States Blog Brand: Paul Pillar The congressionally mandated national security strategies have for the most part not merited the term “strategy”. They are public documents meant for public consumption rather than as guides to decision-making about individual foreign policy problems. They are essentially an additional opportunity, along with presidential speeches and other vehicles, for expressing to the public an administration’s favored themes. This observation applies at least as much to Donald Trump's newly released national security strategy as to those of other administrations. Although some of Trump’s senior subordinates are quite capable of thinking strategically, the president himself has given scant indication of having a strategic bone in his body when in comes to national security. Trump’s utterances on the subject have shown evidence less of any deep thinking than of inconsistency, ignorance stemming from inexperience, and a demagogue’s concern with applause lines. Moreover, a document published under the name of a president who has taken lying to a level far beyond that of most other politicians is, unsurprisingly, duplicitous as well. The duplicity extends not just to individual mischaracterizations but to absconding of entire concepts—or more precisely, to the use of terms that refer to such concepts without making policy that conforms with them. The administration’s document claims to be a “strategy of principled realism,” while the Trump foreign policy has not been realist at all, especially given its tendency to divide the world rigidly into friends and foes. The document also favorably refers to the realist concept of “balance of power,” but Trump’s foreign policy has been far different from one that would observe the principles and reap the benefits of a balance of power. The administration’s document brazenly claims to be pursuing objectives that it instead is trashing. It says that “diplomacy is indispensable to identify and implement solutions” and that “we must upgrade our diplomatic capabilities” at the same time that it is running the State Department into the ground and, on issue after issue, blowing off the department’s diplomatic mission. The document declares that “the national debt, now over $20 trillion, presents a grave threat to America’s long-term prosperity and, by extension, our national security” as the president is about to sign, with celebration and no reluctance, one of the biggest deficit-ballooning pieces of legislation in recent history. The over-arching theme of the strategy document is the now-familiar slogan of “America first”. An outward-looking sub-theme involves American leadership abroad. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, in a much-noticed op ed earlier this year, explained that “America First does not mean America alone.” But in its first eleven months, the Trump administration has descended more quickly into self-generated isolation than has any other U.S. administration in memory. Much of this descent stems from Trump’s insistence on doing the opposite of whatever his predecessor did. The United States is the sole country on the planet that disavows the Paris climate change agreement aimed at saving the planet—now that the last two other previous holdouts, the Assad regime in Syria and the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, have signed on. Trump’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership has left the other participants to proceed without the United States, as well as giving new opportunities for regional influence to China. Trump’s efforts to undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a.k.a. the Iran nuclear agreement, which seven countries negotiated, have left the United States, not Iran, as the isolated party. And just this week, Nikki Haley cast the first U.S. veto in six years at the United Nations Security Council, against an otherwise unanimously supported resolution opposing the Trump administration’s declaration about Jerusalem. The Jerusalem move illustrates another of the Trump administration’s proclivities that run directly against the idea of “America first”. This tendency is the subcontracting of policy to certain favored foreign regimes, rather than independently pursuing U.S. interests. Bowing to the preferences of the right-wing government of Israel is the most glaring example, with the decision on Jerusalem going farther in this direction than even previous U.S. administrations had gone. Not as far-reaching but just as obvious over the past year has been the bowing to preferences of the Saudi regime regarding rivalries and tensions in the Persian Gulf. The strategy document, and much of Trump’s other rhetoric, suggest that “America first” also implies a need to attend to the strength of America at home, and so it should. But again the chasm between rhetoric and policy is gaping. The illustrations of this are numerous, but consider just some of what has been in the news the past several days. The Republican tax bill heads the list. It (along with ostensibly deficit-hawkish resistance to Barack Obama’s stimulus program when the United States was still struggling out of the Great Recession) stands sound fiscal policy on its head. It rewards owners and inheritors over workers and strivers. The heavy blow it delivers to the public finances will make more difficult, politically as well as economically, many ways of strengthening America to better enable it to advance its interests in a turbulent world, from improving the health of its citizens to rebuilding decrepit infrastructure. Donald Trump talked a good game about infrastructure, but he has done little or nothing to make good on the talk and in the post-tax bill world is even less likely to make good on it. One infrastructural deficiency—the unwillingness to pay for the installation of proven technology that prevents speeding by trains—allowed this week's fatal train crash in Washington state. At least as important in defining a strong America as a competitor on the world stage is the strength and integrity of American democracy. Here, too, the recent trend has not been good. In addition to voter suppression laws and gerrymandering, the biggest additional issue since Trump’s rise has been Russian interference in U.S. elections. Rather than leading, as any U.S. president should, a principled effort to uphold the integrity of representative democracy in the United States, Trump has tried to deny the whole problem. With his kind of leadership, members of his party are trying to discredit and derail the one investigation with the best chance of getting to the bottom of it all. Honest and open discourse and debate are essential to the healthy functioning of any democracy. Trump’s constant dismissal of inconvenient truths and his raising of lies to the same level as any truth have been corrupting that discourse and debate all year long. Here the relevant development of the past few days is another turn in the administration’s Orwellian attempts at thought control by banishing certain terms or concepts from any part of the discourse it can censor. Its previous efforts expunged discussion of climate change—the most blatant big omission from the national security strategy document. The latest censorship was the attempt to impose on the Centers for Disease Control a list of banned terms such as “evidence-based”. As an example for the world, the America of Donald Trump is becoming less the shining city on a hill of Ronald Reagan’s (and John Winthrop’s) America and more an embarrassment. Don’t expect to find real strategy in the latest national security strategy. Do grieve at the discrepancy between favorable-sounding words in that document and the reality being wrought by the man whose name appears on it.

News article:
Donald Trump, who had no experience in politics, became the president of the United States with his famous motto "America first." While Trump and his aides try to "make America great again," unconsciously, they have sped up the decline of American hegemony due to their unilateral foreign policy understanding and exclusionary political discourse. The U.S. now is notorious not only in the eyes of its challengers, but also in the eyes of its long-time allies and friends. Trump's America has begun to alienate almost all its partners, from the narrowest circle to the widest one, from Anglo-Saxon friends to European partners, from Latin American neighbors to Asian rivals, from Sub-Sahara to North Africa. Trump's America contradicts its closest ally, the United Kingdom. The latest two cases, in which the Trump administration contradicted the May government, are Trump's proclamation on Jerusalem and retweeting inflammatory videos shared by a British ultra-nationalist politician. Similar to almost all European countries, the U.K. government also rejected Trump's decision on Jerusalem. In her official statement, British Prime Minister Theresa May pointed out that her government disagrees with Trump's decision. Similarly, all sides of the House of Commons condemned the decision. Moreover, Prime Minister May denounced President Trump for sharing abusive and threatening videos posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a far-right political party in the U.K. Trump, who is against the global free trade order established by Pax Americana, declared the end of the era of multinational trade agreements. As soon as he came to power, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP). As a result, the 11 Pacific Rim countries, which had total trade of $350 billion last year, decided to resurrect the partnership and start free trade. Trump's America initiated a comprehensive trade war with European countries. Trump promised to scrap the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Nevertheless, he claimed that it would limit imports of steel and aluminum to protect domestic companies. The European Union will retaliate against any sanctions imposed by the U.S. against European companies. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had to declare that the EU's mood "is increasingly combative" on the topic of international trade. Furthermore, 25 EU member states signed a defense cooperation agreement and decided to establish Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which will decrease their dependence on NATO, and as a result their dependence on the U.S. Latin American countries, which are considered as the "near abroad" of the U.S. since the early years of the 19th century, consistently complain about threats from the U.S. Similarly, most Asian countries have many political and economic divergences with Trump's America. Trump even attempted to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump's America otherizes Islamic civilization and Muslims worldwide, including American and European Muslims, who are citizens of Western countries. Trump's anti-Islamic and anti-immigration rhetoric damages American global perception. In particular, after the Jerusalem decision, it would not be surprising if anti-Americanism skyrockets in Muslim countries. Although it will satisfy the Israeli government and his constituency, the unpopularity of Trump's America is growing in the Muslim world. Two developments last Monday punctuated America's increasing isolation. The first was the vote on a resolution demanding the rejection of Trump's decision on Jerusalem. All 14 members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, including the staunchest U.S. allies such as the U.K., voted for the resolution. The U.S. was alone. The second was the announcement of the new national security strategy. Trump declared global powers such as Russia and China, middle states such as Iran and North Korea and non-state actors as multiple threats challenging U.S. interests. While the strategy aims to fight these multiple challenges, it rejects multiple cooperation initiatives such as multiple free trade agreements. As a result, due to its unilateral and irresponsible foreign policy behavior and conflictual political discourse, Trump's America instigated the rise of anti-Americanism even in friendly countries such as the U.K., Germany, Mexico and Turkey. Most observers from both the U.S. and other Western circles claim that Trump's strategy is not sustainable and that it will turn out to be self-destructive. Soon to be a lone hegemon, Trump's America is seen as an unreliable partner by most of its partners and allies. Trump's unpredictable and domestically driven foreign policy discourse confuses not only foreign governments but also most of the American public.

News article:
The torment of waking up to a Trump presidency has been described by some American's as a glitch in the matrix; of being transported to a parallel universe in which a loutish red-haired charlatan, a bully accused of being a serial abuser of women – while bragging that as a famous man he can get away with anything – becomes the president of the United States. Wielding power in a manner devoid of compassion and decency is innate to narcissist Trump. Power to the likes of Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump is a tool to bully, humiliate and coerce others into doing things which they would never do. It comes as no surprise then to see President Trump take the unprecedented step of threatening to cut US funding to countries that oppose his decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital in a UN vote today. The threat is Weinsteinian in its depravity. One imagines Trump saying to himself: If you want me to use my power and wealth to help you, then you need to humiliate yourself by performing demeaning political favours, which no self-respecting country would ever debase themselves to doing. In the characteristically simpleton parallel universe that Trump inhabits, the logic is straightforward: "They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we're watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care." Read: Why America's declaration on Jerusalem is wrong The reality of course is very different. US aid is not a gift bestowed by the president to demonstrate American benevolence to impoverished nations. The main purpose of aid is the advancement of national self-interest. Aid is an instrument of power, deployed by powerful states to carry influence amongst weaker states. According to a former State Department official and aid expert Carol Lancaster modern US aid originated in Cold War geopolitics. "The Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe," the Council on Foreign Relations points out, "was designed to blunt the influence of rising Communist political forces on the continent. National security concerns have continued to drive US assistance policy, aiming to provide stability in conflicted regions, bolster allies, promote democracy, or contribute to counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts abroad." Who are the recipients of the $49 billion (1.3 per cent of the federal budget) distributed by the US: with $3.1 billion Israel is far and away the biggest recipient of US aid followed by Egypt which receives $1.5 billion. In fact a number of Arab and Muslim majority countries receive significant amounts of aid from the US to fund a complex stew of programmes that include promoting liberal values to security and counterterrorism. Reflecting the close relation between US aid and US power is the significant increase to the budget of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. During the 1990s aid levels were cut to barely half of what they are today, falling to less than $20 billion in 1997, or 0.8 per cent of the overall budget. The terrorist attack on the US, however, prompted the Bush administration to embark on a "crusade" armed with the world's largest military arsenal and an aid budget that that would be the envy of any superpower in world history determined to win political favour using financial bribes. Read: If Jerusalem is Israel's capital, then Washington is Bolivia's capital The story of aid is not as straightforward as Trump would like it to be. Foreign aid in actual fact provides massive financial gains for donor countries. What poor countries received through aid is minuscule compared to the vast sums that are extracted by affluent Western capitals. The sustained and significant outflows from the developing countries since the eighties have topped $16.3 trillion. To put it another way, the outflow of wealth from developing nations over the intervening period equals the GDP of the US. Foreign aid is part of a complex global structure in which donors and recipients clearly recognise the mutual benefit of having a means to exchange favours under the guise of the redistribution of wealth. This is one of the main reasons why western governments are reluctant to reduce the aid budget despite pressure from large sections of society. As with much of what Trump has done since moving into the White House, this unprecedented move, one expects, will work against him. Despite what Trump may think, aid has already bought the US untold political favours and no self-respecting government, however poor, will allow themselves to be bullied into thinking they are a basket case in need of US generosity. If Trump's bulling tactic does anything of significance, it should awaken a sense of national pride amongst recipients of US aid. "No honourable state would bow to such pressure," said the Foreign Minister of Turkey – a co-sponsor of the UN vote – Mevlut Cavusoglu. "The world has changed. The belief that 'I am strong therefore I am right' has changed. The world today is revolting against injustices." Others have denounced the threat saying "states resort to such blatant bullying only when they know they do not have a moral or legal argument to convince others." Even a senior western diplomat, described it as "poor tactics" but not one which is "going to win any votes in the General Assembly or the Security Council". A senior European diplomat agreed Haley was unlikely to sway many UN states. US Congress has also called Trump on his bluff, with condemnations from key Democratic lawmakers who have poured water over the idea that Congress would allow him to carry out such an unprecedented threat. No pragmatic US politician would wish to play the aid card, as Trump has done, over an issue like Jerusalem. Not least because the draft resolution reaffirms numerous Security Council resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city's final status must be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Not to mention of course that the resolution had been US policy over five decades. Today's vote will be a defining moment for the international community, and more so for the Arab Gulf states allied to the Trump administration. It is not just a vote over the fate of Jerusalem and the millions of Palestinians suffering under the brutal Israeli occupation. The 193 members of the General Assembly are being asked to choose what kind of politics they want on the playground of the international stage. Are they going to reward a bully who challenges basic decency and forever be held hostage to their cowardice or stand up to the bully as everyone should.

News article:
Donald Trump’s newly announced national security strategy has prompted a Russian scramble to defend Russian interests, with the Kremlin announcing the White House’s endorsement of a “peace through strength” principle a confrontational bid that undermines hopes for a breakthrough in US-Russian relations. It has also triggered an Iranian escalation, with the first response coming in Yemen where the Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile into inhabited areas south of the Saudi capital Riyadh. The Trump administration also inflamed a third front omitted by the national security strategy, when the US president detonated a bombshell by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, infuriating and embarrassing Arab and Muslim friends and allies of the United States. The US envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, took the crisis to the next level by deploying vetoing a Security Council draft resolution rejecting Washington’s Jerusalem move and calling for its withdrawal. The resolution was backed by all other 14 Security Council members, prompting Haley to vow that her country would remember this “insult”. When Arab and Muslim nations put forward a similar resolution at the General Assembly, Haley threatened that Washington was “taking names” and watching which countries would vote which way. In an unprecedented move in the history of the UN, the US President threatened to cut off aid from countries voting in favor of the resolution, saying: “Let them vote against us…We’ll save a lot. We don’t care. But this isn’t like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars”. Donald Trump’s statements meant to coerce American aid recipients to accept his dictates are humiliating. Furthermore, they have no value vis-a-vis the US’ strategic partners that do not need US aid, such as Saudi Arabia, whose king Salman bin Abdulaziz was meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the day of the vote to show Riyadh’s support for Palestinian rights. Indeed, how does the Trump administration intend to “punish” the Saudi, Emirati, and Egyptian votes in favor of the UN General Assembly resolution, in light of the important strategic relations between these countries and Washington? Advertisement There are a lot of signs of immature policies in the conduct of the Trump administration at the UN, where every member state is fully entitled to vote in any way it suits it. This is a shaming, dictating, bullying, and coercing strategy that does not serve US long-term interests, not to mention that it violates the most basic principles of democracy and respect for different views. Worst of all, this strategy upends international legitimacy and the norms governing international relations, regardless of whether or not the scrutiny of a sovereign decision by way of a Security Council resolution was a political mistake or an affront against the US. When Egypt, the only current Arab member of the Security Council, put forward a draft resolution calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the transfer of the US embassy there, it wanted to reaffirm previous UN Security Council resolutions that demand no change in the status of Jerusalem except through negotiations between the two parties. Trump’s measures that sought to completely alter this facet of US foreign policy therefore appear arbitrary, even in the context of US grand strategy and national security. The reason, according to one observer close to the Trump administration, is that Trump is picking and choosing from the demands of three rival camps in his administration fighting to shape his final decisions, and as a result, the implementation of many of these decisions is effectively on hold. According to the same source, the first camp considers China to be the foremost long-term challenge for US interests, followed by Iran and Turkey in the near term. The proponents of this view want the administration to bolster Russia, even if this requires compromises such as on accepting Bashar al-Assad’s survival in power in Syria. For this camp, China’s challenge includes the North Korean challenge, yet both are of a long-term nature. Meanwhile, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, and Hezbollah are seen as challenges of a near-term nature. The mantra of this camp, dominated by alt-right voices such as Steve Bannon, is the necessity of eliminating radical Islamic terror, in both its Sunni and Shia iterations. Advertisement The second camp, led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and national security adviser H. R. McMaster, accepts the first camp’s view regarding the need for a strategic alliance with Gulf countries against Islamic radicalism, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, through firm policies and reforms. This camp wants to preserve the cohesion of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), but insists that Qatar’s policies deviate from the Gulf line and threaten Gulf unity. This camp considers Iran a major problem in Iraq and Syria, while Lebanon for them has already fallen “militarily and politically,” as the source put it. Regarding Russia, this camp does not trust Putin and does not believe he would abandon Iran, and calls for further pressure on Russia, Iran, and Assad. The third camp in the Trump administration favors the status quo. It sees in former President Barack Obama’s approach to Iran an example to be emulated, and therefore, does not see Iran as a threat. This camp is led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who sometimes gets support from Defense Secretary James Mattis, for example with regard to their view that North Korea’s threat to US interests should be prioritized. Tillerson does not see the value of a strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

On April 7 , however, he stunned even many of his supporters by authorizing the launching of missile strikes on an airbase of the Syrian Army after an alleged chemical attack in the town of Khan Shaykhun. The perpetrators of the attack have still not been identified by a UN investigation, however the US president and his ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley immediately held Syrian president Bashar al-Assad responsible. While the missile attack caused many of his own supporters to begin doubting the sincerity of his non-interventionist promises, the attack received widespread approval in the American media, with many prominent commentators identifying it as the point at which he, "became presidential." Iran Nuclear Agreement Having condemned as a candidate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, agreed between the United States, Great Britain, France, Russia, China, Germany and Iran to suspend elements of the latter's nuclear program, as president, Mr. Trump set about indicating that he was intending to sink the agreement altogether and re-impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Despite the International Atomic Energy Agency's repeated certifications that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement, President Trump has persisted in claiming the Islamic Republic is not complying with "the spirit of the agreement." His decertification of Iranian compliance with the JCPOA and his insistence that Congress reimpose sanctions within 60 days or he will, drew hostile responses even from close US allies. Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief flatly rejected the US' ability to sink the agreement, saying that no single country could do so. She also reiterated that the Agreement could not be renegotiated. The German Foreign Minister also ominously warned that the US scuttling of the deal could have profound geopolitical consequences globally, hinting that EU states would pursue closer economic relations with Russia and China rather than go along with a renewed US sanctions regime against Iran. North Korean Crisis Donald Trump's first appearance at the United Nations General Assembly set the stage for an unprecedented exchange of insults between the US and the North Korean leadership.

News article:
Paris (AFP) - From the inauguration of US President Donald Trump to the exodus of Rohingyas from Myanmar, here are 12 events that marked 2017. - A year of Trump - On January 20 Republican billionaire Donald Trump, 70, is inaugurated as US president, vowing: "America first." Suspicions of collusion between his election campaign and Russia dog the start of his term. Trump progressively unpicks the achievements of his Democrat predecessor, Barack Obama. He pulls out of international agreements on climate, free trade, immigration and UNESCO. On December 6, in another break with the previous administration, Trump creates shockwaves when he recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move largely rejected in a UN vote. On December 20 he seals his first major reform, signing long-awaited tax cuts into law. - Brexit under way - On March 29 London launches the process to quit the European Union, as voted in a referendum nine months earlier. In a snap general election on June 8 Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives suffer a major setback and lose their majority. Brussels and London agree on divorce terms on December 8. - France: political earthquake - Pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron, 39, wins a resounding victory over far-right rival Marine Le Pen in France's presidential election on May 7. His new En Marche (One the Move) movement drives the two biggest parties -- the Socialists and Republicans -- from the Elysee Palace for the first time. - Middle East: boiling point - Saudi Arabia and its allies sever diplomatic ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it supporting "terrorists" and of being too close to Iran. Then on November 4 Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announces from the Saudi capital that he is resigning, citing Iran's "grip" on his country. He later backtracks. Saudi Arabia also accuses rebels in Yemen of receiving support from Iran, which denies the accusation. The UN describes Yemen's humanitarian situation as the worst in the world in 2017. Story continues - Venezuela: economic disaster - On July 30 Venezuela's Constituent Assembly -- whose legitimacy is disputed by the opposition and abroad -- is elected after four months of deadly protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro. With wide-ranging powers, it dismisses in early August Attorney General Luisa Ortega, one of Maduro's top critics. It then takes over the opposition-dominated Congress. Crippled by plummeting oil prices, the country is considered to be in "selective default" by ratings agencies. - North Korea: escalation - The reclusive regime conducts its sixth and largest nuclear test on September 3. On November 29 leader Kim Jong-Un says a "state nuclear force" has been completed with the test of a long-range missile able to deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the United States. Washington threatens to "utterly destroy" the regime "if war comes". On December 22 the UN Security Council imposes new sanctions against North Korea that restrict vital oil supplies. - Myanmar's Rohingyas: 'genocide' - On August 25 the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar launches a crackdown on Rohingyas after militants from the stateless Muslim minority ambush security forces. Nearly 655,000 Rohingyas find refuge in Bangladesh. The United States denounces "ethnic cleansing" while the UN speaks of "elements of genocide". - Catalonia: autonomy suspended - Spain's wealthy northeastern Catalonia region holds a referendum for independence on October 1 that is deemed illegal by the central government. Madrid moves to assert control but Catalan lawmakers vote on October 27 to declare independence. Madrid dismisses Catalonia's government and suspends its autonomy, also calling regional elections. Deposed regional president Carles Puigdemont, charged with sedition and rebellion, takes refuge in Belgium. On December 21 three pro-independence parties defeat the central government in the elections. However, the centrist, anti-independence Ciudadanos party gets the best individual result. - The Weinstein scandal - On October 5 the New York Times publishes a bombshell investigative report accusing Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, 65, of sexual harassment over decades. Similar allegations have since been levelled at a long list of personalities in film, television, journalism and politics around the world. - Zimbabwe: Mugabe falls - Zimbabwe's veteran President Robert Mugabe, 93, resigns on November 21 following 37 years of rule and after being abandoned by the military and his own party. - IS defeated, not wiped out - Iraq on December 9 declares victory in its war to expel the Islamic State group but experts warn that jihadists remain a threat. They have also lost most of their territory in Syria. Numerous deadly attacks around the world over the year, including in Afghanistan, Britain, Egypt and Somalia, are claimed by or blamed on the group or others linked to Al-Qaeda. - Climate: record disasters - The year in which Trump decides, on June 1, to leave the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord is marked by a series of natural disasters, including record-breaking hurricanes, earthquakes and devastating fires that affect several countries. It is set to be one of the three warmest years ever recorded.

News article:
After the political earthquakes of 2016, 2017 was unlikely to be easy. And it was not. From Donald Trump being the president to Britain's exit decision from the EU and the turmoil in the Middle East, 2017 was a year that many cannot wait to leave behind. But can we be optimistic for 2018 after the increasing turbulence and tensions of the past 12 months? The year 2018 will be the second year of Trump in the White House. Many predicted at the beginning of 2017 that Trump would resign by the year's end. In fact, it was not a prediction, but a prayer that has remained unanswered until now. Democrats introduced articles of impeachment against Trump in November, though they admitted that their efforts would be unsuccessful while Republicans control both houses of Congress. Some senators called on Trump to resign over the allegations of sexual misconduct in December, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation can be seen as if he is getting closer to Trump with each new finding. One might think that Trump is backed into a corner, however, with Israel's backing and Saudi Arabia's financial support, he is more powerful than before. That is why it is likely that he will still be in office at the end of 2018. Due to political divisions shaking America, the U.S. presence abroad has been weakened. It looks like increasing doubts and tensions regarding the U.S. role in the world will continue in 2018, which will probably be followed for the next several years. A weakened U.S. means some gaps on the stage of world politics, which might be filled by global powers like China and Russia. China will probably increase its activities in the Sea of Japan in 2018 even though Japan will further complain about it, while Russia will continue its military presence in Syria, or we can say the Middle East. One can bet that Vladimir Putin will be re-elected as the Russian president in March. The war in Ukraine will continue as the Trump administration recently approved a plan to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, and Moscow is not likely to step back. If Russia-backed forces continue to gain more territory on the ground, that kind of development will whip up the European NATO allies. However, we cannot be really sure if the U.S. will stand side by side with them as it always did, since we know Trump has implicitly warned NATO allies many times that they should not expect what former administrations did in the past from him. He finally did say that the U.S. would defend them if Russia's stance hardens after too much internal and external pressure, but I am not sure if European leaders have found that final statement convincing. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote of 2016 and Trump's being elected, many in the EU were concerned that the extreme right would win in their electoral contests in 2017. It was close but did not happen. Many countries passed the test and gained some time, but it is obvious that rising ethnic, demographic and economic tensions as well as Eurosceptisim and populism will continue to gain ground. There might be some big protests as economic problems in European countries continue. And there is still the risk that other countries would like to get out of the EU, such as Italy, which will hold a general election in 2018. Angela Merkel of Germany won the elections in October but is still struggling to form a coalition government. We can say that Germany may have to go back to the polls in 2018. That means Europe will not get back its strongest voice for a while. The Brexit negotiations may result in a real plan but new problems are inevitable until Britain leaves the union in March 2019. It has never been easy to make predictions about North Korea. In addition, the Trump administration makes things more unpredictable. Still, I do not think that the U.S. and North Korea will enter into a large-scale war. But this is not to say that the tension will not continue to rise alongside the battle of words between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump. India's provincial elections, which are seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Pakistan's general elections might escalate regional tensions in Asia, while it is almost sure that Saudi Arabia and Iran will increase regional turbulence in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's unpredictability will most likely continue in 2018, which will further destabilize the region. And we cannot be sure if the power play between Saudi Arabia and Iran will hit which Middle Eastern country next. The seven-year civil war in Syria might be close to an end after the de-escalation zones plan agreed to by Russia, Iran and Turkey in the Astana rounds. But we cannot say if the approximately 6 million Syrian refugees from Syria would be eager to return to their country in 2018, considering the fact that Bashar Assad, the Syrian dictator who has been the reason of all the bloodshed in the first place, is still in Damascus. We are not talking about the Daesh threat, as a priority anymore, but there is still a risk of Daesh or another terrorist group posing a new threat unless the Middle East finds peace, and that dream is not seen on the horizon yet. After Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Palestine would probably shape regional alliances will be a key topic, but I believe it will be a short while since a new chaos or hot conflict will emerge in another zone on the map, and will cause a distraction as it always happens. It already looks like 2018 will be a year of new crises caused by unprecedented environment, rising populist trends and ongoing tensions. And we have not put global economic risks into the equation yet. But I must say that the risks of new economic crises, which would be big enough to shake the countries, regions and maybe the world, are the ones that scare me most in 2018, and the possibilities of natural disasters, which might shake the earth.

News article:
After the political earthquakes of 2016, 2017 was unlikely to be easy. And it was not. From Donald Trump being the president to Britain's exit decision from the EU and the turmoil in the Middle East, 2017 was a year that many cannot wait to leave behind. But can we be optimistic for 2018 after the increasing turbulence and tensions of the past 12 months? The year 2018 will be the second year of Trump in the White House. Many predicted at the beginning of 2017 that Trump would resign by the year's end. In fact, it was not a prediction, but a prayer that has remained unanswered until now. Democrats introduced articles of impeachment against Trump in November, though they admitted that their efforts would be unsuccessful while Republicans control both houses of Congress. Some senators called on Trump to resign over the allegations of sexual misconduct in December, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation can be seen as if he is getting closer to Trump with each new finding. One might think that Trump is backed into a corner, however, with Israel's backing and Saudi Arabia's financial support, he is more powerful than before. That is why it is likely that he will still be in office at the end of 2018. Due to political divisions shaking America, the U.S. presence abroad has been weakened. It looks like increasing doubts and tensions regarding the U.S. role in the world will continue in 2018, which will probably be followed for the next several years. A weakened U.S. means some gaps on the stage of world politics, which might be filled by global powers like China and Russia. China will probably increase its activities in the Sea of Japan in 2018 even though Japan will further complain about it, while Russia will continue its military presence in Syria, or we can say the Middle East. One can bet that Vladimir Putin will be re-elected as the Russian president in March. The war in Ukraine will continue as the Trump administration recently approved a plan to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, and Moscow is not likely to step back. If Russia-backed forces continue to gain more territory on the ground, that kind of development will whip up the European NATO allies. However, we cannot be really sure if the U.S. will stand side by side with them as it always did, since we know Trump has implicitly warned NATO allies many times that they should not expect what former administrations did in the past from him. He finally did say that the U.S. would defend them if Russia's stance hardens after too much internal and external pressure, but I am not sure if European leaders have found that final statement convincing. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote of 2016 and Trump's being elected, many in the EU were concerned that the extreme right would win in their electoral contests in 2017. It was close but did not happen. Many countries passed the test and gained some time, but it is obvious that rising ethnic, demographic and economic tensions as well as Eurosceptisim and populism will continue to gain ground. There might be some big protests as economic problems in European countries continue. And there is still the risk that other countries would like to get out of the EU, such as Italy, which will hold a general election in 2018. Angela Merkel of Germany won the elections in October but is still struggling to form a coalition government. We can say that Germany may have to go back to the polls in 2018. That means Europe will not get back its strongest voice for a while. The Brexit negotiations may result in a real plan but new problems are inevitable until Britain leaves the union in March 2019. It has never been easy to make predictions about North Korea. In addition, the Trump administration makes things more unpredictable. Still, I do not think that the U.S. and North Korea will enter into a large-scale war. But this is not to say that the tension will not continue to rise alongside the battle of words between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump. India's provincial elections, which are seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Pakistan's general elections might escalate regional tensions in Asia, while it is almost sure that Saudi Arabia and Iran will increase regional turbulence in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's unpredictability will most likely continue in 2018, which will further destabilize the region. And we cannot be sure if the power play between Saudi Arabia and Iran will hit which Middle Eastern country next. The seven-year civil war in Syria might be close to an end after the de-escalation zones plan agreed to by Russia, Iran and Turkey in the Astana rounds. But we cannot say if the approximately 6 million Syrian refugees from Syria would be eager to return to their country in 2018, considering the fact that Bashar Assad, the Syrian dictator who has been the reason of all the bloodshed in the first place, is still in Damascus. We are not talking about the Daesh threat, as a priority anymore, but there is still a risk of Daesh or another terrorist group posing a new threat unless the Middle East finds peace, and that dream is not seen on the horizon yet. After Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Palestine would probably shape regional alliances will be a key topic, but I believe it will be a short while since a new chaos or hot conflict will emerge in another zone on the map, and will cause a distraction as it always happens. It already looks like 2018 will be a year of new crises caused by unprecedented environment, rising populist trends and ongoing tensions. And we have not put global economic risks into the equation yet. But I must say that the risks of new economic crises, which would be big enough to shake the countries, regions and maybe the world, are the ones that scare me most in 2018, and the possibilities of natural disasters, which might shake the earth.

News article:
The world, to say nothing of two-thirds of the people in this country, deplores Donald Trump. It rejects his racist, sexist rhetoric, his wild and foolish pronouncements, his arrogance, his abundant manifestations of malignant narcissism. The world deplores his withdrawal from the Paris Accord, his rejection of the painstakingly negotiated Iran nuclear agreement, and now his decision–opposed by his leading advisors (except for his son-in-law Jared Kushner)–to recognize, as no other nation save the occupying power Israel ever has, occupied Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The recent UN General Assembly vote implicitly condemning Trump’s decision – which so infuriated the clueless US UN ambassador, Nikki Haley – was a harsh rebuke to Trump. But did it not reflect a broader repudiation of the contemporary USA? A recent Pew poll, taken before the Jerusalem announcement, showed that only 49 percent of the world’s people now see the U.S. favorably. Trump argues validly that he has simply made official what has been US policy since 1995, when Congress, pressured by the Israel Lobby, passed the ‘Jerusalem Embassy Act.’ The move was politically unproblematic within the US; at the time nearly 50 percent of US residents told pollsters they believed that “God gave Israel to the Jews.” The mix of Lobby influence, Christian Evangelical credence to biblical myth (Genesis 12:3), general historical ignorance and racist indifference to the plight of a cruelly oppressed and humiliated people produced that vote (of 374 to 37 in the House and 93 to 5 in the Senate). That is to say: this preposterous recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, including – as it necessarily does – an open attack on Palestinian rights, is not merely another eccentric work of Trump. It is a natural emanation of US imperialist culture. The Obama presidency showed how a leader continuing and expanding on his predecessor’s assault on the Middle East could maintain high domestic ratings; enjoy the respect of the leaders of allied states, such as the UK, France and Germany; and if we can believe the polls even receive a generally positive reception from the world’s people. But the Trump presidency shows how a leader staying his predecessors’ course on Afghanistan, Iraq and even to a considerable extent Syria (these involvements, and US knee-jerk support for Israel, being the key source of global hatred for the US) can only retain the support of one-third of the US population. This is due to his manifest ignorance, bigotry and general buffoonery. It shows too that there are limits to western allies’ deference. Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Emmanuel Marcon have all had harsh words for Trump on climate, Iran, trade, immigration, Islam, Korea threats, and now Jerusalem. This is good. Fractures in the unholy alliance called NATO, the anti-Russian alliance which successive US administrations have sought to expand, and which under Trump’s watch has now included Montenegro, can only be positive. Let Washington’s current imperialist partners conclude that the US cannot lead the world in a direction that advantages them. Let them conclude that the preposterous Jerusalem decision, which can only produce more violence, is the last straw. Let the European masses realize that Europe’s refugee crisis is the fruit of US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya that made no sense. Let them realize that Washington’s drive to include Ukraine in NATO through the February 2014 putsch led to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and the US-mandated sanctions on Russia damaging European economies.

News article:
Photo illustration by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images The United States was about 48 hours into the new year and, for a sweet, brief moment, it seemed like the political news cycle would be uncoupled from the presidential Twitter feed. But, alas, just two days into 2018, President Donald Trump, itching for controversy following a relatively quiet holiday break, sent off a barrage of missives with far-reaching international and domestic implications. Here’s a round-up of president’s Twitter feed from the first Tuesday of the year. 363 days to go. He Attacked Former Hillary Clinton Aide Huma Abedin Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Advertisement Trump renewed his attacks against former 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, calling for one of her top aides, Huma Abedin, to be jailed. His message ― which also included a hit at what he called the “deep state Justice Department” ― apparently referenced emails sent by Abedin that were released by the State Department on Friday. Trump has continued to attack Clinton and her team more than a year after he was elected president. Read more here. He Called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” And Said He Had A “Much Bigger” Nuclear Button North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 Trump taunted Kim Jong Un on Tuesday, just a day after the North Korean leader warned the U.S. that Kim had a nuclear button “always on [his] desk” and that the entire United States was “within range of our nuclear weapons.” Earlier in the day, the president once again demeaned Kim as a “rocket man” and later tweeted that his own nuclear button was “a much bigger & more powerful one than his.” Advertisement “And my Button works!” Trump finished. Read more here. He Threatened To Cut Off Foreign Aid To The Palestinians It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 The White House also appeared to threaten hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to the Palestinians on Tuesday, just hours after America said it would withhold similar funds from Pakistan. Trump lambasted the Palestinians for not giving the U.S. “appreciation or respect,” and accused their leaders of abandoning the peace process with Israel. Tension has risen throughout the Middle East in recent weeks following Trump’s decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Read more here. He Announced Plans For “The Most Dishonest & Corrupt” Media Awards I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 The president continued his almost daily attacks on the media on Tuesday with a vague joke that he would establish something called “THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR.” Advertisement “Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media,” he wrote. Earlier Tuesday, Trump lobbed an attack against his favored punching bag, the “Failing” New York Times, and its new publisher. “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Read more here. He Took Credit For The Safety Record Of Commercial Jet Airliners Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Commercial airlines recorded their safest year ever in 2017 after documenting zero accidental deaths on commercial passenger jets around the world. Advertisement Trump moved to take credit for the record early Tuesday, linking the lack of fatalities to his efforts to be “very strict on commercial aviation.” But, as HuffPost’s Ethan Klapper notes, such boasts appear to be overstated. 2017 was just as safe for U.S. aviation as both 2015 and 2016, and the numbers reported this week account for commercial flights worldwide.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 The president continued his almost daily attacks on the media on Tuesday with a vague joke that he would establish something called “THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR.” Advertisement “Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media,” he wrote. Earlier Tuesday, Trump lobbed an attack against his favored punching bag, the “Failing” New York Times, and its new publisher. “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Read more here. He Took Credit For The Safety Record Of Commercial Jet Airliners Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Commercial airlines recorded their safest year ever in 2017 after documenting zero accidental deaths on commercial passenger jets around the world. Advertisement Trump moved to take credit for the record early Tuesday, linking the lack of fatalities to his efforts to be “very strict on commercial aviation.” But, as HuffPost’s Ethan Klapper notes, such boasts appear to be overstated. 2017 was just as safe for U.S. aviation as both 2015 and 2016, and the numbers reported this week account for commercial flights worldwide.

News article:
When two strongest democracies in the world elected Donald Trump as US president and Narendra Modi as India’s prime minister, peace became the first casualty and their lethal combination along with Israel only added to the miseries of millions of peace-lovers across the world. While one was expecting New Year greetings, Donald Trump dropped a ‘New Year bomb’, on Pakistan. Surprisingly, the world’s only super power’s foreign policy these days is being run through Twitter, and no one can beat US President Donald Trump in this mad race of social media. You can trigger war through one tweet but, not peace. Let us first sympathise with the American people, who themselves got the biggest surprised when he was elected as the president, defeated a much more mature and experienced Hillary Clinton. The world’s most liberal democracy had never voted a woman to the White House while Pakistan become the first Muslim country, which elected woman as a prime minister, not once but twice. She was the late Benazir Bhutto. Many thought Ms Clinton would become the first woman in the US to get elected as president. So, which country has more moderate approach when it comes to electing its president or prime minister? Freedom of the Press became the first casualty under Trump, whose war with the media, started much before he got elected and has not ended yet. He calls the US media ‘fake news’.Even on the moral ground, he faced criticism over his attitude, and his approach towards women, is no secret to the world and the Americans themselves are not sure how to deal with this most amazing president. Many thought he would be unpredictable but, in the last one year, he proved to be the most predictable president of the United States, and that too on a fast pace. His policies, unfortunately, has endangered the world peace.For instance, when the world rejected Trump’s decision on Jerusalem, he refused to respect the UN and 146 countries. On the contrary, his government created history by threatening all those who opposed the US policy with a threat to teach them a lesson. Trump’s tweet or threat should be taken as the first step towards that policy. What else one can expect from Trump doctrine except for hate, distrust and insult to the huge sacrifices of the people of Pakistan.This is what he said in what looks like a New Year message to Pakistanis. “The United States has foolishly given 33 billion dollars in aid in over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing, but lies and deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They gave safe havens to terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more.” Trump’s response of ‘No more’ came days after we said, ‘No more’ after years of ‘Do more’ rhetoric. We certainly had committed many mistakes and the biggest one was our decades old policy on Afghanistan. Mr Trump must know that Pakistan was a moderate country before US injected extremism in our policies and asked us to fight its war in 1980, in Afghanistan against Soviet invasion.In return, Pakistan got five million Afghan refugees, gun and drug culture, beside the menace of terrorism and extremism. Thousands of foreign ‘Mujahideen’ including Arabs were sent to Pakistan to fight the US war. Osama bin Laden was one of them, which years later became the world’s most wanted man and mastermind of 9/11. Pakistanis, not Americans, are fools that they trusted the US and became an American ally, soon after the birth of Pakistan. In pursuance of the US policy, the left wing politics in Pakistan was crushed through a ban on Communist Party of Pakistan in 1950s and later on a ban on National Awami Party (NAP) in the 1970s. Now, what should be our response? Pakistan’s response should not be as foolish as that of Trump as despite our own weaknesses, we are a responsible nation and the support we got in the United Nation recently provide an ample proof. So, when the world supported us, the US opposed us. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi called a meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday, in which both civil and military leadership discussed the prevailing situation in the aftermath of Trump’s warning. The government and the opposition are also on one page on this issue of utmost importance. But, we also have our own problems and it is high time to change our decades old doctrine on Afghanistan. Within the country, rising extremism and terrorism has threatened country’s foundations and we need a foreign policy based on live and let live. Pakistan should neither become proxy nor need any proxy. The US has a history of doing adventures like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, from Iraq to Syria, from Afghanistan to Libya. Humans hardly matter for them when it comes to their interests.They have the history of doing this around the world. How could we forget 1977 and 1979? The US made our elected prime minister a ‘horrible example’, because he had refused to toe the American line. We were naive that we waited for 7th fleet to arrive during 1971 war. Our response should be candid and well drafted as there is no ‘Donald Trump’ in Pakistan. We just need to place on record straight: what price we had paid, not only in the last 15 years, but in the last 30 years or to be more specific since the day we decided to become an American ally in the 1950s. It is most shameful that the US president did not acknowledge huge sacrifices Pakistan has given as a nation, not in the last 15 years but in the last 40 years and beyond.It is a matter of history that the US always supported military dictatorships in Pakistan, whether it is Field Marshal Ayub Khan, General Ziaul Haq or General (retd) Pervez Musharraf. People of Pakistan have not yet forgotten its alleged role in overthrowing Pakistan’s elected prime minister, the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a year after he was threatened with a warning of making him a ‘horrible example’, if Pakistan did not abandon its nuclear programme, which he refused and was hanged. If the US could support the UN resolution against North Korea, Iraq or against Iran, why it backed out and opposed resolution of its decision on Jerusalem.Surely, the world has changed after 9/11, one of the worst terrorist attacks, which killed over 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans. But, there was a Pakistani by the name of ‘Hamdani’, who gave his life in rescue operations and saved many lives. In the 15 years of war, many Pakistani youngsters gave their lives in defeating terrorism. You don’t give or compare death toll in war because every human life is precious, but if the US president insists and calls American foolish in giving 35 billion dollars to Pakistan, please let us know as to how many Americans lost their lives in these years. Our fight against terrorism and extremism must continue as we cannot afford rise of non-state actors, and we must remain alert over the possible drone strikes in settled areas. Pakistan can face economic sanctions or even drone strikes.Pakistan has come a long way to make the country more responsible and peaceful, but the threat of terrorism is not over yet. It is just world’s bad luck that when it is looking for peace, two biggest democracies have elected people like Donald Trump in US and Narendra Modi in India.The writer is a senior columnist and analyst of Geo, The News and Jang.

News article:
The problem with the current resident of the White House is that he seems to have forgotten the very ideas that he has espoused in his book “The Art of the Deal”. Even though politics is the art of the possible and politics unlike business deals with the lives and futures of people not just money and interest, Donald Trump clearly has no serious foreign policy. His policy appears to be knee jerked decisions made often to please certain constituents or funders but certainly does not rise to the level of being given the description of a well thought policy. In foreign policy, words matter. And decisions often have a life of their own that can go much further than originally expected. The international community and especially political adversaries look carefully for any sign, hint and certainly any statement that can be seen as a green, amber or red light to whatever ideas and plans they have been awaiting to unleash. Donald Trump wanted the world to think that his decision on Jerusalem was simply a sovereign US decision about recognising a reality. The White House and the US mission at the UN went out of their way to say that there is no change in policy and that the decision does not pre-judge the final status talks of the holy city. Tell that to the Israeli members of Knesset or to the central committee of the ruling right-wing Likud Party. Israeli legislatures and right-wing activists quickly understood the Jerusalem decision as a blaring greenlight to continue and escalate their efforts to strengthen Israeli occupation and control, and to put even more obstacles to any possible negotiated solution for Jerusalem and the final status of the occupied territories. The very same Trump and his sidekick who repeatedly said that the Jerusalem decision is not meant to affect final status talks, has now tweeted that in fact “Jerusalem is off the table”, and therefore that peace talks are now expected to sail through that the contentious issue of Jerusalem is no longer part of the talks. What? So the Israelis were correct in their speedy understanding of the greenlight blaring from Washington. But Trump’s appetite to cause political wreckage appears to have no end. The US now is tampering with funding to a UN agency that has been entrusted since 1948 to take care of humanitarian needs of Palestinians. The goal is to force Palestinians to come to the negotiating table. Translated — that Palestinians surrender and accept US and Israeli dictates. Political leaders even novice ones learn from their mistakes and build an accumulation of knowledge over time. Almost one year in office and President Trump clearly has not learned anything. One would expect that after the failure of his threats to financially punish all countries which voted against the UN in the General Assembly that he would think twice about using blackmail again. Cutting off aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) will not bring Mahmoud Abbas and any other Palestinian leader to their knees. Instead, it will embolden Palestinians even more and will once again show that the US bluffs and blackmail efforts simply do not work. What is dangerous, however, is not that blackmail will work or not, but that tampering with so many issues at the same time, Jerusalem, and refugees, the US action will produce the very same results that it claims it wants to avoid. The majority of Palestinian refugees today live in the besieged Gaza Strip. It will not cause refugees to demonstrate against Mahmoud Abbas and demand of him to quickly rush to Washington to accept whatever dictates that Trump, Kushner and Greenblatt have to offer. Even the Israeli military officials understand the dangers in putting any further pressure on innocent Palestinian refugees. The Israelis who make a modest contribution to UNRWA have in their power to totally stop the work of this UN agency, but have chosen not to stop its effort because they understand the important soothing role that this agency has as it addresses daily humanitarian needs of a population that has been forced out of their homes and who are waiting a political solution. What is clear today is that there is no serious ultimate solution, there is no strategy or policy for a Middle East solution and there is no process or mechanism that can help bring about a solution. What exists is simply a US/Israel dictate whose features we have yet to see. But if the early signs are to go by, it certainly does not have a chance of day to work.

When two strongest democracies in the world elected Donald Trump as US president and Narendra Modi as India's prime minister, peace became the first casualty and their lethal combination along with Israel only added to the miseries of millions of peace-lovers across the world. While one was expecting New Year greetings, Donald Trump dropped a 'New Year bomb’, on Pakistan. Surprisingly, the world's only super power's foreign policy these days is being run through Twitter, and no one can beat US President Donald Trump in this mad race of social media. You can trigger war through one tweet but, not peace. Let us first sympathise with the American people, who themselves got the biggest surprised when he was elected as the president, defeated a much more mature and experienced Hillary Clinton. The world's most liberal democracy had never voted a woman to the White House while Pakistan become the first Muslim country, which elected woman as a prime minister, not once but twice. She was the late Benazir Bhutto. Many thought Ms Clinton would become the first woman in the US to get elected as president. So, which country has more moderate approach when it comes to electing its president or prime minister? Freedom of the Press became the first casualty under Trump, whose war with the media, started much before he got elected and has not ended yet. He calls the US media 'fake news’. Even on the moral ground, he faced criticism over his attitude, and his approach towards women, is no secret to the world and the Americans themselves are not sure how to deal with this most amazing president. Many thought he would be unpredictable but, in the last one year, he proved to be the most predictable president of the United States, and that too on a fast pace. His policies, unfortunately, has endangered the world peace. For instance, when the world rejected Trump's decision on Jerusalem, he refused to respect the UN and 146 countries. On the contrary, his government created history by threatening all those who opposed the US policy with a threat to teach them a lesson. Trump's tweet or threat should be taken as the first step towards that policy. What else one can expect from Trump doctrine except for hate, distrust and insult to the huge sacrifices of the people of Pakistan. This is what he said in what looks like a New Year message to Pakistanis. "The United States has foolishly given 33 billion dollars in aid in over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing, but lies and deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They gave safe havens to terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more." Trump's response of 'No more’ came days after we said, 'No more’ after years of 'Do more' rhetoric. We certainly had committed many mistakes and the biggest one was our decades old policy on Afghanistan. Mr Trump must know that Pakistan was a moderate country before US injected extremism in our policies and asked us to fight its war in 1980, in Afghanistan against Soviet invasion. In return, Pakistan got five million Afghan refugees, gun and drug culture, beside the menace of terrorism and extremism. Thousands of foreign 'Mujahideen' including Arabs were sent to Pakistan to fight the US war. Osama bin Laden was one of them, which years later became the world's most wanted man and mastermind of 9/11. Pakistanis, not Americans, are fools that they trusted the US and became an American ally, soon after the birth of Pakistan. In pursuance of the US policy, the left wing politics in Pakistan was crushed through a ban on Communist Party of Pakistan in 1950s and later on a ban on National Awami Party (NAP) in the 1970s. Now, what should be our response? Pakistan's response should not be as foolish as that of Trump as despite our own weaknesses, we are a responsible nation and the support we got in the United Nation recently provide an ample proof. So, when the world supported us, the US opposed us. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi called a meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday, in which both civil and military leadership discussed the prevailing situation in the aftermath of Trump's warning. The government and the opposition are also on one page on this issue of utmost importance. But, we also have our own problems and it is high time to change our decades old doctrine on Afghanistan. Within the country, rising extremism and terrorism has threatened country's foundations and we need a foreign policy based on live and let live. Pakistan should neither become proxy nor need any proxy. The US has a history of doing adventures like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, from Iraq to Syria, from Afghanistan to Libya. Humans hardly matter for them when it comes to their interests. They have the history of doing this around the world. How could we forget 1977 and 1979? The US made our elected prime minister a 'horrible example’, because he had refused to toe the American line. We were naive that we waited for 7th fleet to arrive during 1971 war. Our response should be candid and well drafted as there is no 'Donald Trump' in Pakistan. We just need to place on record straight: what price we had paid, not only in the last 15 years, but in the last 30 years or to be more specific since the day we decided to become an American ally in the 1950s. It is most shameful that the US president did not acknowledge huge sacrifices Pakistan has given as a nation, not in the last 15 years but in the last 40 years and beyond. It is a matter of history that the US always supported military dictatorships in Pakistan, whether it is Field Marshal Ayub Khan, General Ziaul Haq or General (retd) Pervez Musharraf. People of Pakistan have not yet forgotten its alleged role in overthrowing Pakistan's elected prime minister, the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a year after he was threatened with a warning of making him a 'horrible example’, if Pakistan did not abandon its nuclear programme, which he refused and was hanged. If the US could support the UN resolution against North Korea, Iraq or against Iran, why it backed out and opposed resolution of its decision on Jerusalem. Surely, the world has changed after 9/11, one of the worst terrorist attacks, which killed over 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans. But, there was a Pakistani by the name of 'Hamdani’, who gave his life in rescue operations and saved many lives. In the 15 years of war, many Pakistani youngsters gave their lives in defeating terrorism. You don't give or compare death toll in war because every human life is precious, but if the US president insists and calls American foolish in giving 35 billion dollars to Pakistan, please let us know as to how many Americans lost their lives in these years. Our fight against terrorism and extremism must continue as we cannot afford rise of non-state actors, and we must remain alert over the possible drone strikes in settled areas. Pakistan can face economic sanctions or even drone strikes. Pakistan has come a long way to make the country more responsible and peaceful, but the threat of terrorism is not over yet. It is just world's bad luck that when it is looking for peace, two biggest democracies have elected people like Donald Trump in US and Narendra Modi in India.

News article:
When two strongest democracies in the world elected Donald Trump as US president and Narendra Modi as India's prime minister, peace became the first casualty and their lethal combination along with Israel only added to the miseries of millions of peace-lovers across the world. While one was expecting New Year greetings, Donald Trump dropped a 'New Year bomb’, on Pakistan. Surprisingly, the world's only super power's foreign policy these days is being run through Twitter, and no one can beat US President Donald Trump in this mad race of social media.

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Americas Blog Brand: The Skeptics Tags: Donald TrumpAmerica FirstMAGAGovernmentPolicy The president has the option to shake up American foreign policy for the better this year. The Bible tells us that not even a sparrow “will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.” Washington officials long have considered themselves the equivalent of God, at least in this regard. Nothing on earth, in any other country, at any moment, is supposed to happen without America’s consent. That’s how U.S. foreign policy looks, anyway. Candidate Donald Trump talked like he would change that. Unfortunately, the officials with whom he has surrounded himself as president have done their best to stifle his natural impulses. Indeed, the National Security Strategy obviously was written by someone different than the president who gave the talk announcing the NSS’s release. Even so, lately he has been taking some of the right steps, such as cutting aid to Pakistan and the Palestinian Authority, though sometimes for the wrong reasons. With a new year dawning the president has an opportunity to toss off establishment shackles, so to speak, and push his own approach. In many cases all he needs do is pick up policies which he once advanced, before his appointees neutered him, ignoring him with his tweets while draining “America First” of meaning. Consider a few possibilities. Talk to North Korea’s Kim Jong-un The president once said that he would be “honored” to meet the North’s Supreme Leader. A meeting (with or without honor) is less important that engaging the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The reasons are many. War would be catastrophic. Talking would lower the temperature and reduce Kim’s fear that the United States was ready to strike. There is no evidence that Kim is suicidal, but if he believed America was preparing to attack, it would be in his interest to strike first, preempting U.S. action. Moreover, negotiation might reveal intermediate positions that both are achievable and better than the status quo, meaning the DPRK’s unrestrained expansion of its nuclear arsenal. For instance, a freeze at current levels backed by intrusive inspections. Better for America and the world to face North Korea with twenty or thirty nukes than an expanding arsenal of, say, 100. Would Pyongyang ever agree and comply? It’s impossible to know without trying. Abandon Attempts to Micromanage Syria The civil war which engulfed Syria was tragic but never warranted American involvement. Damascus was a Soviet ally throughout the Cold War, always hostile to the U.S. and Israel. But it posed no security threat to America. The probability of Washington creating a democratic, moderate, pro-American state was even lower than that of doing so in Iraq. Indeed, during the campaign President Trump appeared to recognize the foolishness of the Obama administration’s attempt to micromanage the multisided struggle. Washington simultaneously sought to oust Bashar al-Assad, who was fighting ISIS; empower the supposed “moderates,” who usually lost and surrendered to more radical insurgents; defeat ISIS, which ultimately grew out of the insurgency spawned by America’s invasion of Iraq; aid jihadist groups, including ones linked to Al Qaeda; work with Kurdish groups as well as Turkey, which feared them far more than ISIS; minimize the influence of neighboring Iran, ally of Assad and enemy of ISIS; and counteract Russian intervention, focused on the single goal of bolstering Assad. Implementing this policy were officials who had been bungling U.S. foreign policy for years. At least Washington succeeded in the essential task of destroying the Islamic State’s “caliphate.” The rest should be left up to the Syrians and their neighbors. Not even the winners have won much: Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies have weak control over only part of a nation which has been wrecked and, like Humpty Dumpty, probably cannot be put back together. In any case, it will take years for Syria to recover. Let the Saudis spend a bit of the money fleeced from imprisoned billionaires to help rebuild the homes of brother Arabs instead of purchase more chalets and yachts. Exit the Yemen War By pressing Riyadh to end its blockade, President Trump appeared to recognize that intervention in Yemen’s endless civil war has been a humanitarian horror. It also is a practical disaster. By attacking a rebel alliance to reinstate a puppet regime Saudi Arabia turned a local conflict into a sectarian struggle and gave Iran a low-cost means of bleeding the Saudi royals. No doubt, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (and his “coalition” partners, mostly the United Arab Emirates) expected a quick victory in Yemen. Instead, he ended up demonstrating the Saudi military’s inadequacy, exposing his militaristic ambitions, trashing his nation’s already poor reputation abroad, and giving Tehran an easy target. It will be difficult for Riyadh to withdraw, but Washington should leave that problem to the man who would be king—literally. The United States should end refueling and targeting assistance and cut off sale of munitions used to kill Yemeni civilians. Yemen is Saudi Arabia’s war. Negotiate a Better Relationship with Russia President Trump’s well-founded desire to improve relations with Russia has been overshadowed by charges that Moscow meddled in America’s election (just like Washington has done in numerous other nations’ contests.) Most Americans have noticed that Vladimir Putin is not a nice fellow. But there’s no evidence that he’s suicidal. He doesn’t want war with America. Nor is there any evidence that he’s planning an improbable attack on Europe, which has around ten times the economic strength and three times the population of Russia. The dangerous posturing by both sides grows out of the Ukraine conflict. Moscow is in the wrong, but the West’s hands are very dirty: expanding NATO to Russia’s border after promising not to do so, dismantling Moscow’s historic Serbian ally, planning to induct Georgia and Ukraine into NATO, using the European Union to pull Kiev away from Russia economically, and supporting a street putsch against an elected—if flawed—president who leaned toward Moscow. One can imagine how Washington politicians would have responded if Russia employed similar tactics in Mexico. Ukraine is in a bad neighborhood, but matters not for America’s security. Alliances should be used to provide security to the United States, not welfare to others. Washington still should seek to end the conflict for humanitarian reasons, but nothing involving Kiev is worth a conflict with Russia. Washington should propose a compromise. The United States should drop plans for lethal military aid to Kiev. NATO should pledge not to include Georgia and Ukraine, which actually would make the Western powers less secure by inducting those two nations’ conflicts with Moscow. Russia should end its support for Ukrainian separatists. Kiev should enact and implement greater local autonomy. While formally refusing to accept Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, the U.S. and European governments should recognize that nothing absent military defeat will reverse the move. The West then should lift sanctions on Russia. Washington as well as Moscow loses from an endless and purposeless new Cold War. Expect Allies to Defend Themselves While running for office candidate Trump pointed out how America’s supposed friends never seemed to wean themselves from military dependence on the United States. Of course, the real problem is Washington, which doesn’t want its allies to be independent. While American elites enjoy the illusion of running the world, average folks pay the bill. Since taking office, the president has periodically reiterated these complaints, but his national security team has defended America’s defense commitments to Europe, South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia. The president should take charge. He need not tell friendly states what to spend, only that the United States will do less. Why should prosperous and populous Europe tremble in fear of Russia? The Republic of Korea has an astonishing forty-five times the GDP of its northern antagonist, as well as twice the population. Why does America have to deploy troops to defend what amount to international welfare queens? The Cold War created a unique circumstance requiring an oversize U.S. military role. But that world has passed away. So should Washington’s outsize commitment to allies capable of defending themselves. America should remain engaged, but act primarily as emergency support against a hegemonic threat beyond the defense capabilities of friendly states. The only region where that seems plausible in practice today is Asia, and even there U.S. allies could do much more to handle day-to-day threats, even if still looking to America in an outsize crisis. Reconsider Nuclear Proliferation Among America’s Allies There is good reason to oppose the spread of nuclear weapons. But when proliferation occurs anyway the United States should consider whether it would be better for Washington’s allies to build countervailing weapons than for America to risk its homeland to guarantee the security of other states. In fact, President Trump once raised the possibility of South Korea and Japan building nuclear weapons. While that idea is controversial in Tokyo, two-thirds of South Koreans support creating their own deterrent. Of course, the usual suspects, including, it seems, the president’s own appointees, were horrified by the idea and reflexively clutched their pearls. While everyone agrees that it would be best if the North did not possess nuclear weapons, no one knows how to stop Pyongyang. If the DPRK gains the ability to hit the American homeland will any U.S. president be prepared to go to war on behalf of South Korea? If North Korea was losing, it would have no reason not to launch, or at least to threaten to do so if Washington did not withdraw. Why not exit Northeast Asia, where only the bad guys—China, Russia and the North—have nuclear weapons, and encourage America’s democratic allies to build their own?

Why does America have to deploy troops to defend what amount to international welfare queens? The Cold War created a unique circumstance requiring an oversize U.S. military role. But that world has passed away. So should Washington’s outsize commitment to allies capable of defending themselves. America should remain engaged, but act primarily as emergency support against a hegemonic threat beyond the defense capabilities of friendly states. The only region where that seems plausible in practice today is Asia, and even there U.S. allies could do much more to handle day-to-day threats, even if still looking to America in an outsize crisis. Reconsider Nuclear Proliferation Among America’s Allies There is good reason to oppose the spread of nuclear weapons. But when proliferation occurs anyway the United States should consider whether it would be better for Washington’s allies to build countervailing weapons than for America to risk its homeland to guarantee the security of other states. In fact, President Trump once raised the possibility of South Korea and Japan building nuclear weapons. While that idea is controversial in Tokyo, two-thirds of South Koreans support creating their own deterrent. Of course, the usual suspects, including, it seems, the president’s own appointees, were horrified by the idea and reflexively clutched their pearls. While everyone agrees that it would be best if the North did not possess nuclear weapons, no one knows how to stop Pyongyang. If the DPRK gains the ability to hit the American homeland will any U.S. president be prepared to go to war on behalf of South Korea? If North Korea was losing, it would have no reason not to launch, or at least to threaten to do so if Washington did not withdraw. Why not exit Northeast Asia, where only the bad guys—China, Russia and the North—have nuclear weapons, and encourage America’s democratic allies to build their own?

News article:
For years people around the world glued every four years to their televisions sets, (nowadays of course to their more advanced electronic devices) to follow all the news about the presidential elections in the US. As if the Americans were in the process of electing not solely a new occupant for the Oval Office in the White House, but a world leader!Many of the audience in different parts of the globe, for instance, under the influence of Western mainstream media, tended to be mesmerized by all the pageantry surrounding Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009; an African-American had become the US president to ensure a victory for African-Americans while the event itself was a symbol, so to speak, representing a 'change' in US oppressive approaches at least towards Black Americans something soon sank into collective unconscious of the global audience that there is a real change in the policies of the so-called 'nation of nations'.But in reality and away from the positive and pleasant aura surrounding Obama's election, both in the 'letter and spirit', the world saw no significant change in the overall polices of the United States, both domestically and internationally. The evidence: Obama administration's deafening silence on many world issues, including the terrorism mainly sponsored by US allies in the region, and of course the killing of hundreds of people in US 'overseas' drone operations.Now, one year after replacing Obama, Donald Trump is in the office; a controversial businessman whose election astound many, both in the US and outside.But, unlike Obama, Trump's rhetoric and pledges both on the campaign trail and after inaugurating on January 20, 2017 as the 45th President of the United States have created a negative aura based on a quite different letter and spirit; something still lingering over both the US and the world.The indecent literature Trump has been using in his Twitter posts in the first year of his presidency to react to global events and announcing new policies, have raised many eyebrows, even prompting some to repeat claims similar to those made soon after he launched his campaign, that the new president of the so-called nation of nations, was mentally sick.The promises and attempts made by the US president in the first year of his presidency have been increasingly encouraging the idea that he has some sort of mental problem.Trump's pledge to rip up the July 2015 Iran nuclear deal is an example. He and his administration during the past year have been trying to decertify the Iran Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite all the efforts by the international community to address the issue of the country's peaceful nuclear activities and ward off a crisis that many believed had it started, it could have spilled over into all the whole region.He and his administration so far has not been able to sink the Iran Deal, though, mostly as result of other parties involved in the deal who want the landmark accord to be maintained.But Trump has gone on with his plan to decertify the JCPOA by referring the case to the Congress, and threatening to unilaterally withdraw from the deal.'In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,' Trump said, adding that American participation 'can be canceled by me, as president, at any time'.'I can do that instantaneously,' he said.One wonders what kind of logic is behind Trump's decision to sink the Iran Deal, better to say, to undermine a peaceful process.The US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is another example.While the countries are working together to stop global warming and save our planet Earth, the United States which is among industrial nations responsible for producing much of the greenhouse gases, suddenly decided to renege on a lifesaving global pact initially agreed to by all 195 countries present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December of that year.'The Paris accord will undermine (the US) economy,' and 'puts (the US) at a permanent disadvantage,' Trump said, failing to take into account that the US is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, of course along with China, a country with a population about four times that of the US.Too, in case of terrorism, the new US president has repeatedly behaved inappropriately and illogically, especially when we consider his trip to Saudi Arabia.Two weeks after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the US soil, the Federal Bureau of Investigation connected the hijackers to al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization founded in 1988 by Osama bin Laden who was a wealthy man from a Saudi family.Washington never published the findings of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks which killed 3,000 people and injured more than 6,000 others. This is while, there are claims suggesting attempts by Riyadh to keep hidden their alleged role in the terrorist attacks.But to the surprise of all the anti-terror activists and countries in the frontline of fighting terrorism, Trump chose Saudi Arabia his first foreign visit and joyfully participated in a sword dance with Saudi rulers.Again the million-dollar question is that why he traveled to Saudi Arabia, a country whose hidden hand was, and still is, instrumental in propping up terrorist organizations in the region.Trump also raised hackles in London in September 2017, commenting on the terrorist attack on the British capital, when said in a tweet that the terrorists were in the sights of the police in the country.'Another attack in London by a loser terrorist. These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!' he tweeted.Nick Timothy, who was British Prime Minister Theresa May’s chief of staff until the June general election and worked for her as a senior adviser when she was home secretary, was quick to answer, denouncing the US president for his 'unhelpful' statements.'True or not - and I'm sure he [President Trump] doesn't know - this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner,' Timothy wrote in his Twitter post.The US president also bewildered the people in the country when he described the white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “very fine people'.The far-right neo-Nazi groups who gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August met with anti-fascist counter-protesters who clashed with the racists. One woman was killed after a member of a white nationalist group, plowed his car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.It is no surprise, now, that Michael Wolff, an American, author, essayist and reporter puts Trump under the spotlight in his new book titled 'Fire and Fury' trying to disclose the inner layers of a president who he describes as having childlike behaviors.'I will tell you the one description that everyone gave — everyone has in common — they all say he is like a child,' Wolff told NBC's 'TODAY'.'And what they mean by that is he has a need for immediate gratification. It is all about him,' the writer said.Wolff said that Trump has 'less credibility' than perhaps anyone who has walked on Earth.His book features explosive quotes from former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon deriding Trump's children, as well as numerous claims of top advisors and friends calling the president terms like 'idiot' and 'dumb as s--t.'Trump, in response, characterized himself as 'smart', 'genius' and 'very stable genius', in a Twitter message posted on January 6, 2018, a day after the public release of the book by Wolff.The so-called nation of nations, this time has opted to choose a president interested in 'early-morning tweetstorms, febrile conspiracy theories, grandiosity and impulsiveness and serial counter-factualism' as put by the Time.According to the Time, Trump 'appears unstable to a great many observers' and the world seems to be wary of the nuclear threats lobbed between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un across the Pacific.The US president once taunted North Korea’s leader about the size of his nuclear arsenal, saying “nuclear button” in Washington is “much bigger and more powerful” than Kim’s – “and my button works!”'North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times,” Trump tweeted.'… please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!' he wrote.Such threats have caused concern among observers, with Ron Rosenbaum, who authored a book on nuclear war entitled How the End Begins, warning about the potential rise of nuclear irrationality.“All the previous worries about the potential of a deranged president to use a nuclear button irrationally have been multiplied,” Rosenbaum said.“He [President Trump] has no sense of history, of nuclear deterrence, etc., etc. Only his own impulsiveness separates us from nuclear war,” he stressed.The American presidential orchestra, led this time by Trump, apart from all the comments, lacks the necessary letter and spirit to lure the global audience into believing that he is acting and speaking from the position of a so-called global leader.Trump's presidency has proved that there are other players on the world scene; that, electing a president in the United States does not mean electing a president for the entire world; that the world unlike claims in the West is not a unipolar one with the US crowning it.Finally, election of Donald Trump exposed the real 'letter and spirit' of a system whose ultimate goal is devouring the world.2044**2050*Reza Bahar, Member of the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) English Desk, columnistFollow us Twitter @IrnaEnglish

News article:
At a first glance, the recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital by US President Donald Trump looks like an empty gesture, if not an irrational and unwanted declaration, which fomented violence. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Russia recognized west Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and east Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital, before Trump’s announcement. Trump did not move the US embassy in Tel Aviv, and in fact gave nothing to Israel, other than increased Palestinian rioting, after being warned not to go ahead with this announcement. Israel’s gains are nowhere to be seen. This, at least is according to the Western utility-based view, which weighs all steps by their costs and gains. Yet there are more successful ways of viewing such developments. The Russian strategic thinking, for example, does not focus on end state production logic, which dominates Western thinking. In the Western mindset, there is no room for emerging phenomena. Russian thinking, by contrast, is non-linear and non-predictive. Western decision makers look at events that ‘veer off course’ as accidents that need to be fixed and studied, much like engineers investigating why a rocket blew up at the launch stage.

Strategy is based on the assumption of marching into the unknown. Instead of setting a main purpose and then calculating all steps from start to finish in line with the goal of reaching it, the correct path is to realize that in strategy, one operates in a changing environment.

Instead, taking a step and then stopping to see what has changed, before reassessing and moving again, is the correct approach. This is the Russian doctrine.

He has abandoned the idea of pursuing the same dead end peace plans promoted by his predecessors, US Presidents Barack Obama, George Bush, and Bill Clinton. Instead, he sought to shake up the system in a highly calculated manner, and march into the unknown. Yet Trump did not jump over a cliff. He left one stable leg on the ground. Trump did not explicitly abandon the two-state solution, nor did he recognize Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria. Trump, in essence, realized that the current situation is leading nowhere, and threw a rock into the water to muddy it and see how the system would rearrange itself.

As a result of Trump’s declaration, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held a conference with Jordan’s King Abdullah and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to push back against Trump—yet Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi attempted to stop Abbas and Abdullah from attending, underlining a crack. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas are each responding to the declaration, and the Palestinian arena is united on this issue at least, that any scenario that does not include Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine is intolerable. The Israeli interest Ultimately, these events serve Israel’s interests of maintaining a united Jerusalem—a need that was recognized by former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who declared this in a speech to the Knesset in 1995 prior to his assassination. Rabin’s goal was to provide Israel with stability, which the Palestinian Authority was designed to provide. Only later, from the time of the 2000 Barak - Clinton proposals onward, did the idea of splitting Jerusalem appear as an Israeli government position. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s offer was repeated by the ex premier Ehud Olmert, and Abbas demanded that the next Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, use Olmert’s offer as the starting point of future negotiations. Netanyahu has rejected this demand. President Trump and PM Netanyahu (Photo: Reuters) Trump understood what his predecessors did not. After the mass terrorism of the second intifada, and the conversion of Gaza into an enemy Hamas territory after Israel’s withdrawal from it, Israeli society no longer believes in the idea of giving land for stability, or in the ability of the US to supervise and guard this stability. Trump therefore proceeded with a recognition of Jerusalem, assisting Israel’s position, which holds that even if a Palestinian state is formed, it will not be based on the Barak - Olmert parameters of dividing Jerusalem. By doing so, he closed the door to future blackmail and demands from the Palestinian side, which is welcome news indeed for Israel.

At a first glance, the recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital by US President Donald Trump looks like an empty gesture, if not an irrational and unwanted declaration, which fomented violence. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Russia recognized west Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and east Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital, before Trump’s announcement. Trump did not move the US embassy in Tel Aviv, and in fact gave nothing to Israel, other than increased Palestinian rioting, after being warned not to go ahead with this announcement. Israel’s gains are nowhere to be seen. This, at least is according to the Western utility-based view, which weighs all steps by their costs and gains. Yet there are more successful ways of viewing such developments. The Russian strategic thinking, for example, does not focus on end state production logic, which dominates Western thinking. In the Western mindset, there is no room for emerging phenomena. Russian thinking, by contrast, is non-linear and non-predictive. Western decision makers look at events that ‘veer off course’ as accidents that need to be fixed and studied, much like engineers investigating why a rocket blew up at the launch stage.

News article:
The row over Trump's 'racist' comments about allowing 's***hole countries' is another chapter in the president's difficult relationship with the United Nations. In December, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley blasted member states who overwhelmingly backed a proposal condemning the US for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and pledging to move its embassy there. The vote was 128–9, with 35 abstentions. Only Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo joined the United States and Israel in opposing the measure. Another 21 countries didn't show up to vote. US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley blasted countries that condemned the US for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital American ambassador Nikki Haley blasted anti-Israel member nations during a pre-vote debate, warning that there would be a price to pay for standing in President Donald Trump's way. 'This vote will be remembered,' she said as the entire UN General Assembly looked on. 'America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that,' Haley lectured from the central podium. 'But this vote will make a difference on how Americans look at the UN and on how we look at countries who disrespect us in the UN.' Back in September, in Trump's first speech to the UN, he drew a round of applause after attacking Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela. He called Iran a 'rogue state' for its supposed nuclear ambitions as he criticized the nuclear deal struck by Iran and the Obama administration. 'We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles. And we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,' Trump said, drawing applause from leaders of more than 180 nations in the room. 'The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States and I don't think you've heard the last of it, believe me,' he said. 'It's time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.'

News article:
Washington – Trust in U.S. institutions, particularly the government, has plunged in President Donald Trump’s first year in office, according to a leading survey released on the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The annual Edelman Trust Barometer showed overall trust in the four institutions it measures – the government, media, business and non-governmental organizations – falling more steeply in the United States than in any of the 28 countries surveyed. Trump has broken with presidential tradition and repeatedly denounced the media and judiciary – attacks his critics say risk undermining public confidence in those institutions. By contrast, the country that saw the biggest trust gains among its own citizens was China, after a year in which President Xi Jinping cemented his hold on power at a triumphal party congress. Faith in the Chinese government jumped 8 points to 84 percent. In the United States it fell 14 points to 33 percent. “The United States is enduring an unprecedented crisis of trust,” said Richard Edelman, head of the communications marketing firm that commissioned the research. Xi was the headliner in Davos last year, days before Trump was inaugurated. This year, Trump is the main attraction. He is expected to defend his “America First” policies in a speech on the final day of the conference of policymakers, CEOs, bankers and celebrities in the Swiss Alps, which runs from Jan. 23-26. Pointing to the steep erosion in trust in the United States, Edelman said it was the first time since the survey began 18 years ago that such a precipitous drop was not linked to a specific event, such as an economic crisis or catastrophe, like the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Instead it comes at a time when the U.S. economy is showing robust growth and stock markets are at record highs. “Normally when things are going well, trust is pretty good,” Edelman said. “Increasingly there is a disconnect between trust and economic outcomes.” FAKE NEWS He attributed this to a politicisation of the public discourse in the United States and elsewhere that has left many people confused about what is fact and what is fiction. The survey showed nearly 2 in 3 people are unable to distinguish reliable news from rumors and falsehoods. While trust in journalism rose to its highest level in years, faith in search engines and social media platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook fell in 21 of the 28 countries, making media the least trusted of the four institutions globally. The Edelman survey, based on the opinions of over 33,000 people and conducted between Oct. 28 and Nov. 20 of last year, showed an even deeper lack of trust in U.S. institutions among the “informed public” – people who are college educated, earn above-average incomes and consume news regularly. Among this group, trust declined a whopping 23 points, putting the United States in last place among the 28 countries surveyed, below Russia and South Africa. In 2017 it ranked sixth. In the broader U.S. population, faith in the government was equally low among respondents who said they voted for Trump and those who supported his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. But trust in the media was significantly higher among Clinton backers. The survey also showed that Americans’ trust in their own companies fell more steeply than in any other country, with Switzerland and Canada registering the highest levels of trust in their homegrown brands. It showed a revival of faith in “experts”, including academics and businessmen.

News article:
Only one year after Donald Trump was inaugurated, the US has already suffered an alarming setback to its global leadership role. In short order, Trump managed to bewilder our friends and allies, intensify the enmity between us and our foes, and evoke fear, concerns and unpredictability in the international community. I cannot imagine how much further America’s reputation will decline as an increasing number of countries, including our allies, have resigned themselves to the lack of American leadership under Trump’s watch, which will have major adverse repercussions on our national interests, and influence the world over. Trump’s “America First” notion, his abandonment of our soft power, and his reckless utterances have deeply troubled countries with strong ties to the US; enraged those who have been maligned by his reprehensible rhetoric; and delighted our adversaries, while leaving America increasingly isolated. On the issue of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and anti-ballistic missiles, instead of engaging Pyongyang in quiet diplomacy to resolve the conflict, he resorted to bellicose rhetoric and threats that only heightened tensions and brought the US and North Korea ever closer to the unthinkable — nuclear war. Since then, Trump’s comments have been chaotic — sometimes remaining bellicose, other times signaling he will indeed work diplomatically with Kim Jong-un. Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... On the Iran deal, rather than trying to peacefully negotiate any changes, especially to the sunset provisions, Trump decertified the deal and threatened to impose new sanctions, which would torpedo the deal completely. He demanded that Congress modify the deal, even though the other five signatories to the accord vehemently reject any tampering of the deal because of Iran’s continued full adherence. Tehran rejects any changes, and threatened to withdraw from the deal and resume its nuclear program, which could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and subject the region’s inhabitants to living in the shadows of nuclear conflagration. And rather than take action himself against the deal, Trump simply punted to Congress. On immigration, Trump’s racist attitude toward Muslims and people of color has severely undermined America’s unique image as a country of immigrants, which made America great in the first place. His reference to Africa, Haiti and El Salvador as “shithole” countries provoked unprecedented international outrage. Scores of American ambassadors around the world were summoned to explain the inexplicable statement. Why would a sitting US president utter such filth, in the White House no less? Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney put it succinctly when he said: “What he [Trump] communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn.” As to international treaties and accords, Trump has completely disregarded our commitment to live up to such agreements. He insists on renegotiating the terms of NAFTA, and effectively withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (connecting the Americas with Asia and Australia). He pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord and withdrew from the United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). As a result, he acutely damaged America’s credibility, making many countries wary of entering into bilateral agreements with the US, as they can no longer trust his administration to live up to our commitments. This leaves a wide opening for our adversaries to fill the vacuum that Trump has created. Trump has further shocked all democracies around the world with his incessant assault on the press. Though a few of his predecessors have occasionally ostracized the press, none has mounted such vile criticism. He accuses all media outlets (except for Fox News) of being the “enemy” of the people, claiming they are biased and spreading “fake news” to purposefully malign him and deride his policy initiatives. Sadly, whereas America was once seen as the beacon of freedom and democracy to be emulated, Trump is consciously undermining one of our central constitutional pillars — the free press — to the utter consternation of democracies around the world. On the question of the US’ reliability, many countries who depend on America for their national security are worried about Trump’s commitment to safeguarding their security. Trump’s criticism of NATO, which is the core of West European security, and his appeasement of Russia, which is as the West’s staunchest enemy, raises questions as to where he would stand if Europe was threatened. This concern is being expressed by our allies. For example, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her misgivings, stating that: “The times when we could fully rely on others have passed us by a bit. … [W]e Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands. … We have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans.” The fact that Trump lies as often as he breathes also deeply troubles countries around the world — because they can no longer take his word for granted on issues of major importance. Trump seems to be totally oblivious to the reality that without American global leadership, the world will be even more chaotic than it is today. Trump has no end-strategy for Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan (he has ceded many of these places to Russia, Iran and terrorists). He also lacks focus or interest in stemming the widespread, destabilizing violent conflicts and human rights abuses around the world. The Republican Party has become complicit in Trump’s mischiefs and misguided policies. It is now up to the Democrats to get their act together, regain control of the House and Senate, and shackle Trump before he causes irreparable damage to America’s global role and responsibility.

But already, one man has taken the spotlight at the gathering – and he isn't even attending. U.S. President Donald Trump's incendiary comments about African nations – in which he allegedly used a profane term comparing them to toilets – has deeply resonated among the 55-member body, according to the AU's commission chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat. "Africa has not yet finished digesting this shocking statement and the hatred and desire to marginalize and exclude Africa that it conveyed," he said. "Such a statement, coming after others by the Trump administration on Jerusalem and the reduction of U.S. funding for international peacekeeping operations, makes one think that multilateralism is in the midst of a grave crisis. The African continent cannot remain silent on this subject." Trump, for his part, denied making the comment during White House talks on immigration earlier this month. Rare words Such harsh words directed at a major ally are rare for the continental body, which makes decisions by consensus and prides itself on multilateralism. This is the second year that the U.S. leader has become a focus in an event meant for African nations to talk about reforming national institutions, restoring peace and improving the lives of some 1.2 billion people on the world's fastest-growing continent. Last year, delegates were upset over the Trump administration's announcement that people from certain countries would be banned from visiting the U.S., which initially targeted three AU member states: Libya, Somalia and Sudan. The ban has since been expanded to include the central African nation of Chad. AU analyst Liesl Luow-Vaudran spoke to VOA from Addis Ababa and said she expects to hear some pointed words against the U.S., but that the remarks are likely to be less vitriolic now that firebrand Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe has left office. Luow-Vaudran also said she does not expect the AU to pass any resolutions on the U.S. And that, she says, is a key weakness of the Addis Ababa-based institution: The AU is built on consensus, and getting 55 members to agree on sensitive issues is a challenge. For example, she says, while it's commendable that the continental body has chosen corruption as its theme this year, members have little power to enforce their resolutions, and are hesitant to make decisions that could be seen as trampling on the sovereignty of other nations. "The AU, for African citizens, has yet to show its relevance when it comes to, for example, intervening in peace and security issues and crises on the continent, which, to an extent, is the core business of the AU," she said. "It needs to intervene where no one else will and mediate in crises. ... But to a large extent, the AU is struggling, because it is such a big organization in terms of member states, but it's a small organization, in terms of capacity." When it comes to the U.S., it is clear the body doesn't speak as one: The AU's current head, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, smiled Friday as he met with Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and discussed trade and cooperation. Neither man spoke about Trump's alleged comments on African countries when they met afterward with reporters. Luow-Vaudran notes, however, that for decades, the only non-African leaders allowed to speak at the opening ceremony – and again on the schedule this year – were Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, and members of the Arab League. More action? Elissa Jobson, AU relations adviser for the International Crisis Group, says she'd like to see more action from the AU. "What I'd like to see on the agenda would be some of the crucial peace and security issues: The [Democratic Republic of] Congo, South Sudan and Somalia, although I expect these will not be on the agenda," she told VOA. "I think we'll probably also see them tackling another crucial issue for the African Union, the institutional reforms that have been spearheaded by Paul Kagame." But that, she says, is the nature of meetings like this. "I think it's similar with a number of summits like this: the main sessions, the formal sessions, countries come with prepared speeches, they're not open to debate, it's a place to get your position across without really, sort of, getting into the details of the subjects that are on the agenda," she said. "So often, the real debate takes place on the sidelines, inside meetings, in bilateral meetings." NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Berlin – German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said there was no place for anti-Semitism in Germany after demonstrators angered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel burned Israeli flags in Berlin. Hundreds of people gathered outside the U.S. embassy in the German capital for “Day of Rage” protests on Friday. Police later said on Twitter that they had detained 10 people during the protest and 12 criminal charges had been brought — including for burning Israeli flags. Maas told Bild newspaper’s Monday edition: “Any kind of anti-Semitism is an attack on everyone. Anti-Semitism must never be allowed to have a place (in society) again.” Anti-Semitism remains a very sensitive issue in Germany more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed. Germany regards itself as one of Israel’s closest allies. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Bild that while criticism of Trump’s decision was understandable, people had no right or reason to burn the Israeli flag, stir up hatred against Jews or question Israel’s right to exist. He said whoever did this nonetheless was “taking a stand not only against Israel but also against the German constitution” and Germany would not tolerate that. Gabriel said Germany only permitted peaceful demonstrations and would not allow conflicts in which people were prepared to use violence to be brought to Germany from other countries and played out here.

News article:
BERLIN, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The German government condemned on Monday the burning of Israeli flags and use of anti-Semitic slogans reported at protest rallies in Berlin and other cities after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert repeated Berlin's criticism of Trump's decision but said that did not justify anti-Semitic acts, adding that Germany had a historic responsibility to stand by Israel and all Jews everywhere. Anti-Semitism remains a very sensitive issue in Germany more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed. Germany regards itself as one of Israel's closest allies. "One must be ashamed when such open hatred of Jews is on display on the streets of German cities," Seibert told a regular government news conference. "Our laws on freedom of expresssion and assembly guarantee everyone a right to peaceful protest, but this right is no free pass for anti-Semitic atrocities, for incitement and violence," he said, calling for continual efforts to combat such incidents. Trump's decision last week to recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital reversed decades of U.S. policy and caused consternation across the Arab world and among Western allies. It has ignited "Day of Rage" street protests in the Palestinian territories and beyond. On Sunday, about 2,500 people demonstrated in Berlin against Trump's decision and one Israeli flag was burned, police said. They have launched investigations into 11 people, one of them related to the flag burning. On Friday hundreds of people had gathered outside the U.S. embassy in Berlin for "Day of Rage" protests. Police said they had detained 10 people during that protest and brought criminal charges against 12 people, including for burning Israeli flags. Additional "isolated" incidents have been reported in Munich and other German cities, Seibert said on Monday. A Justice Ministry spokesman said authorities would prosecute those responsible for the flag-burning incidents. Seibert also criticised comments made by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who referred to Israel over the weekend as a "terror state". "Basically, we see it as completely wrong, unacceptable and inappropriate to describe Israel in such a manner," he said. Other top German officials, including the foreign, justice and interior ministers, have condemned anti-Semitic acts and the burning of Israeli flags in interviews and on Twitter. A German foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday the country's ambassador to Kuwait had met Kuwaiti officials on Nov. 28 to discuss a separate issue that has raised concerns among Jewish groups about anti-Semitism. A German court ruled last month that Kuwait Airways had the right to refuse to carry an Israeli passenger due to his nationality, saying Germany's anti-discrimination law applies only in cases of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnic background or religion, not citizenship.

Anti-Semitism was still showing "its evil face" in Germany, said President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Speaking at the Israeli embassy, he added he was "horrified and ashamed" by crowds burning Israeli flags in Berlin. People burning Israeli flags on German streets "do not understand, or do not respect, what it means to be German" President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Friday, commenting on the recent protest that saw angry crowds in Berlin's Neukölln neighborhood destroying symbols of Israel. Speaking at the event hosted by the the Israeli embassy, Steinmeier added that Germany's historical responsibility for the Holocaust applied to everyone in the country. Demonstrators burning a makeshift Israeli flag in Berlin Image: picture alliance/dpa/Jüdisches Forum für Demokratie und gegen Antisemitismus e.V. "This responsibility does not recognize caveats for migrant backgrounds and no exceptions for newcomers," Steinmeier said. "It is non-negotiable, for everyone who lives here and wants to live here!' The German president also said he was "horrified and ashamed" by the act.

The Jewish state managed to harness crucial international backing after the mass killings of European Jews by the German Nazi regime. In his speech, Steinmeier said that anti-Semitism has not yet been beaten in Germany. "It is showing its evil face in many shapes," including public acts with hate-filled slogans, but also in the spreading of prejudice and ethnically-charged politics, he said.

Steinmeier also referred to the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, saying he discussed it with his Israeli counterpart Reuven Rivlin. "My message to him was: There are good reasons to doubt that the unilateral recognition of Jerusalem would contribute to peace in the Middle East," Steinmeier said, adding it was both Berlin's official stance and his personal view. However, this political view did not justify "hatred against Israel and disparagement of our Jewish citizens in Germany's streets," he said. dj/ng (KNA, dpa)

News article:
The Israeli flag was recently burned at a protest in Berlin — and with it the Star of David. That it happened in Germany is particularly scandalous, because it awakens memories of the Nazi persecution of the Jews. Israeli flags were burned at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin earlier this week during protests against the decision of US President Donald Trump to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The scenes quickly became an issue for almost all political parties in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the acts, as well as all ministers and the parties represented in German parliament, the Bundestag. "Those who set the Israeli flag on fire in German squares not only show intolerable hatred of Israel, but also do not understand or respect what it means to be German," said President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. This week Steinmeier made a special call to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, and spoke of "deeply disturbing expressions of anti-Semitism." The president expressed his shock and shame that something like this would happen in Germany in 2017. The protests in Berlin sparked a strong response from Germany's political leaders Image: picture alliance/dpa/Jüdisches Forum für Demokratie und gegen Antisemitismus e.V. The Star used as stigmatization The magnitude of the response is also due to the fact that the Star of David, the hexagram, a religious and political symbol of the Jews and the State of Israel, is emblazoned in the middle of the country's flag. The resulting scenes over the weekend thus showed the Star of David being burned at the Brandenburg Gate, the very place where the torch-holding Nazis marched in January 1933, after the taking power. During the pogroms on the evenings of November 9 and 10 in 1938, synagogues, Jewish institutions and Jewish-owned shops were burned in Germany — and with them the Star of David. From 1941 onwards, the Nazis forced the Jews, or persons considered to be Jewish according to "race laws," to wear the star as identification. The star was printed on a yellow background, which was inspired by Christian princes in the Middle Ages, who ordered yellow patches to be worn on clothing to make Jews recognizable to them. In this way, the star became a symbol for the mass murder of millions of Jews in Europe during the Second World War by Nazi Germany. Steinmeier visited the Israeli embassy in Berlin on Friday for an event marking the country's 70th anniversary Image: picture-alliance/dpa/M. Gambarini Debate about ban on flag burning Nevertheless, it is not illegal to burn an Israeli flag in Germany, at least not if it is a privately acquired flag. Now, however, after the incidents in Berlin, there is a discussion as to whether German lawmakers should address this issue. Israel's ambassador in Berlin, Jeremy Issacharoff, suggested that German public burning of any foreign flags should be punishable, not only Israel's. Representatives of a range of political camps in Germany expressed their agreement. "Anyone who burns Israeli flags questions Israel's right to exist and is rejecting the country," said Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Defending Israel's right to exist is a matter of national interest for Germany. However, the more that conflicts between Muslims, Christians and Jews are brought to Berlin, the more often this national interest will be called into question. Not officially, but within German society. Berlin's Jewish community recently raised the alarm: Its anti-Semitism commissioner, Sigmount Königsberg, reported that openly appearing Jewish can be problematic in the German capital. "I know many Jews who conceal a chain with a Star of David in the subway. There are now such automatic actions."

After a wave of anti-Israeli protests, German authorities feel arriving refugees and migrants must be firmly reminded of the country's responsibility to the Jewish state accrued during the Nazi Holocaust. Anti-Israel and anti-US rallies and the sight of Israeli flags burned on German streets have triggered the German politicians' concerns. All people who live in Germany must understand its historical responsibility to Israel, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Friday at an event marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Jewish state. “This responsibility does not end for the people who were born [after the Holocaust] and has no exceptions for the immigrants,” he said, adding that it is “not a subject to discussion for anyone living in Germany or willing to live there.” Justice Minister Heiko Maas took the idea further, suggesting that the issue of Holocaust should be a central part of the German integration courses for refugees and migrants. “I believe it is absolutely necessary to make Holocaust and its significance for our society a central topic in our integration courses,” the minister said in a piece written for Der Spiegel weekly. “Lessons learnt from the Holocaust must become the key message of those [courses],” he added. At the same time, the minister pointed out that the German authorities would not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism, including that brought to Germany by refugees and migrants from the Middle East. “Racism has no place in Germany, so everyone who wants to stay in Germany for the long term needs to be clear that we fight the Neo-Nazis’ anti-Semitism and we won’t tolerate any imported anti-Semitism from immigrants either,” Maas said. “Those who call for ‘death to Jews’ should not [be allowed to] take to the streets but should be taken to court instead,” he added. Pro-Palestinian protests have gripped Germany in the wake of the US President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel without regard for Palestinian's claim to the holy city. Jens Spahn, a senior member of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union Party warned that the growing anti-Semitism is in fact a result of a massive inflow of refugees and migrants from the Middle East to Germany. Many refugees and migrants come from countries where anti-Semitism is “an omnipresent part of the everyday life,” the politician told Der Spiegel. He went on to say that these people are likely to have deep-rooted anti-Semitic sentiments and it would take time to make them change their minds. At the same time, he demanded that the German Muslim associations take a clearer stand on the issue and help the authorities to curb anti-Semitic sentiments. “In case of anti-Islamic hatred, you have every right to expect that we will take measures against it,” he said, addressing the German Muslim leaders and adding that “it also means however, that we should all make a stand against anti-Semitism.” Earlier, the outbreaks of anti-Semitism at Berlin’s rallies were also condemned by the Jewish community and the German politicians across the political spectrum.

Germany’s acting interior minister has lent his support to the creation of an anti-Semitism commissioner in the country’s next government. Thomas de Maiziere nailed his colors to the mast in an interview with German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, following demonstrations in Berlin in which people protesting the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel were reportedly seen burning the Israeli flag. The creation of the role was also recommended by Germany’s Central Council of Jews as well as an independent panel of experts. “A single crime motivated by anti-Semitism is one too many and shameful for our country,” he told the paper. “Hatred towards Jews must never be allowed to take hold of Germany again.” De Maziere also said that Germany “cannot tolerate” the burning of another country’s flag as it constitutes “the symbolic annihilation of a country’s right to exist.” Berlin police ban US & Israeli flags at protests, tighten control over pro-Palestinian demos https://t.co/dlfHB8nsMIpic.twitter.com/JErcbabW83 — RT (@RT_com) December 15, 2017 US President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital sparked protests outside the US Embassy in central Berlin and in Neukoelln, a borough of the German capital known for its high concentration of immigrants. Last week German police took to Twitter to advise against bringing US or Israeli flags along to protest rallies against the Jerusalem decision. “Any dangerous objects as well as the US and Israeli flags are not allowed at the demo,” the Berlin police wrote in a Twitter post ahead of a pro-Palestinian rally on Friday. The police also warned potential rally participants that the officers would carry out personal searches and would be accompanied by interpreters to monitor for “offensive utterances.” READ MORE: 'Sky hasn't fallen': Haley downplays Middle East turmoil after Trump's Jerusalem decision “Burning a flag is not a crime, whether it be Israeli or American or from any other nation” Berlin police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf explained to broadcaster Deutsche Welle. “The only exception is, for instance, when a flag is taken from an official building such as an embassy and burned.” Three months on from its election in September, Germany is still without a functioning government. Not having won a majority, Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Christian Democratic Union leader, has been frustrated in her attempts to enter into a coalition with the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU). One of the main sticking points in negotiations is immigration, which the CSU wants to limit to 200,000 people in the coming year.

A few hundred feet away from the protest, the names of each victim of last year’s attack were freshly inscribed along steps near the church, constituting a permanent memorial, where an arc of candles illuminated their headshots — including that of slain Israeli woman Dalia Elyakim. The memorial calls “for peaceful co-existence of all humanity.” Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and other top German officials attended the memorial’s dedication earlier that day. Elio Adler attended on behalf of WerteInitiative (Values Initiative), a lobbying effort that he heads that addresses issues of German-Jewish concern. “[German politicians] were careful to say the right words and honor the victims,” Adler said. “They don’t have a defiant kind of attitude that you would find in Israel. It’s more about, ‘We have this burden to carry and we’ll carry it.’” While the government officials spoke of mistakes that were made, with Berlin Mayor Michael Müller asking for “forgiveness” for the oversights that enabled the 2016 attack, Adler would like to see these words backed by action. He is also uncertain how the government will crack down on the aggressive anti-Israel protests throughout Germany in response to President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. “They are not prepared for Islamist protests just like they were not prepared for Islamic terror,” Adler said, though he and other Jewish community leaders and commentators are acknowledging that they have seen some improvement in official responses to the recent protests. “We had such situations in the past, and we had even worse [anti-Israel] demonstrations in recent years,” said Eldad Beck, author of the 2015 book Germany, at Odds, and the Berlin correspondent for Israel Hayom. “Unfortunately, it did not wake up the German authorities in doing something concrete against the phenomenon. What we can say is that the official reactions to what happened were this time much faster than in recent years.” The anti-Israel protests at Kurfurstendamm during Operation Protective Edge in 2014 were a turning point for the Jewish community in Germany and its sense of safety against antisemitic assaults. Muslim protesters, notoriously shouted, “Jews to the gas,” as police looked on. It took several weeks for German politicians, then on summer vacation, to issue condemnations. Every year, Shia and Hezbollah-backed groups hold an annual anti-Israel “Al Quds Day” demonstration in Berlin, although the recent protests, according to the American Jewish Committee’s (AJC) local office, were actually backed by Sunni elements with possible links to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. As the recent protests erupted, AJC released a study finding that antisemitic and anti-Israel attitudes and stereotypes are widespread among Arab refugees in Germany. Radicalism in the Muslim-German population is not being properly addressed, according to AJC Berlin’s director, Deidre Berger. “Although the problem of Islamic radicalization has been constantly on the rise, particularly since outbreak of the Syrian war, there are far too few prevention and de-radicalization programs,” she told JNS. “The radicalization takes place in an increasingly, Israel-hostile environment in parts of the Muslim community, including growing numbers of Germans of Turkish origin, a worrisome development.”

Charlotte Knobloch, President of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, said online abuse and even physical attacks were 'commonplace'. Pictured in Jan 2016 Anti-Semitism is now 'the order of the day' in Germany, according to a community leader, who claims Jews now need 'police protection' to practice their religion. Charlotte Knobloch, former leader of the German Council of Jews, said online abuse and even physical attacks were 'commonplace'.

Mrs Knobloch, who is now President of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, claimed these attacks meant Jewish life had to take place under 'police protection', the Heilbronner Stimme reported. 'Aggressive anti-Semitism, from verbal hostility on the Internet and in the analogue world to desecration and destruction to physical attacks are commonplace in Germany,' she said. 'Jewish life can only take place in public under police protection and the strictest security precautions, or it must be completely cancelled for security reasons.'

Thomas de Maiziere's intervention followed a protest in Berlin where Israeli flags were burnt to protest the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. 'Every criminal act motivated by anti-Semitism is one too many and a shame for our country,' de Maiziere, the caretaker minister since inconclusive September elections, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 'Anti-Semitism must never again take hold in Germany,' he said, pointing to a rise of 'derogatory remarks, inappropriate jokes and discriminatory behaviour against our Jewish citizens'.

German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the country needed an anti-Semitism commissioner On Friday, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also declared himself 'shocked and shamed' by the incidents and warned that anti-Semitism was still 'showing its evil face in a variety of ways'. Steinmeier stressed Germany's responsibility to learn 'the lessons of two world wars, the lessons of the Holocaust, the responsibility for the security of Israel, the rejection of all forms of racism and anti-Semitism'. This was 'non-negotiable' for everyone who lives in Germany, no matter where and when they were born, he added. Justice Minister Heiko Maas demanded that lessons on the Holocaust be included in integration courses that teach German language and civics to asylum seekers and immigrants. He wrote on Spiegel Online that many 'come from countries where powerful elites intentionally fuel hatred of Jews and Israel, and where anti-Semitism is practiced almost as a matter of course'. Maas said that all immigrants needed to understand that 'we fight against the anti-Semitism of the neo-Nazis and we will equally never tolerate an anti-Semitism imported by immigrants'.

JTA - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has come under fire for his suggestion that Israel pursues an “apartheid” policy. Now, a Jewish woman in Cologne has addressed Gabriel in an open letter, demanding an apology for “providing further ammunition to youths who were fed anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk,” according to a report in the German Jewish weekly, the Juedische Allgemeine. As yet, there has been no such apology. At issue is an event in Berlin in mid-December, at which Gabriel addressed the issue of anti-Semitism among Muslims in Germany, with a group of Muslim communal representatives. The event was hosted by the Kreuzberg Initiative Against Anti-Semitism, a non-governmental organization that works in schools with children of migrant background, trying to combat anti-Semitic attitudes from an early age. Instead of helping fight anti-Semitism, Gabriel fed the flames, the letter from Malca Goldstein-Wolf said. In her open letter to Gabriel, published on the Israel advocacy website “Honestly Concerned” on Dec. 21, Goldstein-Wolf applauded the idea of meeting with Muslim leaders. “But if you use this occasion to repeat your defamation of Israel as an apartheid state, then it is not only counterproductive but must be vehemently condemned.” According to the Berliner Zeitung, during the meeting with Muslim representatives Gabriel mentioned that he had visited Hevron several years ago and what he saw reminded him of apartheid. In fact, he had posted words to that effect on Facebook after his visit there in 2012. Responding to a query from the German Jewish weekly, Gabriel’s office said he had emphasized at the meeting that there was no place for anti-Semitism in Germany.

News article:
Lawmaker Beatrix von Storch, accused by Cologne police of inciting hatred against Muslims, sees Israel as a model for Germany. (Nicolaus Fest) A neo-Nazi member of Germany’s parliament who has been charged by police with inciting hatred against Muslims is a big fan of Israel. Beatrix von Storch was suspended from Twitter and Facebook after she slammed police in the city of Cologne for this tweet – one of several put out in various languages – wishing the city’s residents happy new year in Arabic: #PolizeiNRW #Köln #Leverkusen تتمنى الشرطة في كولن لجميع الناس في منطقة كولن وليفركوزن والمدن الأخرى إحتفالاً سعيداً بعام 2018 الجديد. https://t.co/G5erMWFNQyرأس السنة 2017 ـ لمزيد المعلومات: # pic.twitter.com/BGxs4Kew7K — Polizei NRW K (@polizei_nrw_k) December 31, 2017 This was an apparent reference to a spate of alleged sexual assaults that were blamed on men from Muslim-majority countries in the city on New Year’s Eve two years ago, and that then fueled exaggerated or outright fabricated claims against immigrants in other parts of Germany. Police have filed a criminal complaint against von Storch for hate speech. Her posts were removed under a new online hate speech law that civil liberties advocates have warned deputizes social media companies to carry out censorship on behalf of the government. Neo-Nazis embrace Israel Von Storch is the deputy leader of Alternative for Germany – known by its German initials AfD – the neo-Nazi party that won almost 100 seats in Germany’s general election last September, prompting alarm from the country’s Jewish community. Like their neo-Nazi counterparts who just joined the government of neighboring Austria, AfD has been cozying up to Israel – a philosemitic stance that aims to rebrand the anti-Semitic far-right as defenders of Jews against a supposed Muslim threat. Their embrace has been reciprocated by politicians in Israel’s ruling Likud party. A granddaughter of Hitler’s last finance minister, von Storch told The Jerusalem Report last September that “For historical and cultural reasons, we will always look for good relations and close cooperation with Israel.” She has been very explicit not only about her party’s support for Israel, but also that hatred of Muslims is one of the values she shares with its Zionist ideology. “Both anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are strongest in the Islamic community, as well as the Left,” she explained. “They reject the fact that the Judeo-Christian foundations of European civilization are instrumental to its success. We recognize the threat they pose to both Israel and Germany’s Jewish community and their safety is a high priority for us.” Von Storch concluded that “Israel could be a role model for Germany” as a country that “makes efforts to preserve its unique culture and traditions.” This echoes closely the line of American neo-Nazi demagogue Richard Spencer who speaks of Zionism as a key model for the kind of Aryan homeland he seeks to create under the guise of preserving “European” culture. Not surprisingly, von Storch’s Jerusalem Report interview was promoted approvingly by Breitbart, a major platform for racism and white supremacy. Israel as racist model Von Storch’s identification with Israel is a symptom of the long-standing alliance between the right, and even anti-Semites, on the one hand, and Zionism and Israel, on the other. This alliance has recently found new life in a common hatred of Muslims. Israeli leaders have habitually exploited violent attacks in Europe to further stoke Islamophobia and justify their own violence against Palestinians. Yet while many mainstream commentators in Germany can be expected to express horror at von Storch’s anti-Muslim incitement, few dare speak out in criticism of Israel – including its prominent role in fomenting xenophobia and hatred of Muslims as part of its effort to push Europe further into its far-right camp. Indeed, Germany’s establishment appears to be less tolerant than ever of advocacy for full, equal civil, political and human rights for Palestinians. In December, the city council in Munich passed a measure smearing the BDS – boycott, divestment and sanctions – movement. The Palestinian BDS National Committee had written to city councillors to explain that the definition of anti-Semitism cited in the resolution is one drawn up by Israel lobbyists to deliberately conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. Yet there do appear to be cracks. Foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel is under intense attack from Israel for stating a simple truth. Israel’s public security minister Gilad Erdan, who is also in charge of combatting the BDS movement, accused Gabriel of engaging in speech that “demonizes and delegitimizes the Jewish state.” Gabriel reportedly told a group of Muslim representatives in December that when he visited the occupied West Bank city of Hebron a few years ago, what he witnessed reminded him of apartheid.

News article:
New migrants to Germany must visit Nazi concentration camp memorials to help tackle a perceived rise in anti-Semitism, Germany's Central Council of Jews said on Wednesday, supporting a proposal by a Palestinian-German politician. Anti-Semitism remains a sensitive issue in Germany, one of Israel's closest allies, more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed. The government decried as shameful the spectacle of the Israeli flag being burned at demonstrations last month against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews expressed support for a proposal by Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin state senator, for mandatory visits by newly arrived refugees to Nazi concentration camps memorials. "People who have fled to us who have themselves had to escape or been expelled, can develop empathy in such memorials," Schuster told Deutschlandfunk radio on Wednesday. Germany has received well over a million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. Germany is home today to an estimated 200,000 Jews and has built a reputation in recent decades as a tolerant, safe place for Jews to live - though data shows anti-Semitic crimes reported to the police rose 4 percent to 681 in the first eight months of 2017 from the same period in 2016. "It makes sense for everyone living in this country to be obliged to visit a concentration camp memorial site at least once in their lives," Chebli told Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday when she first floated the proposal. She said such visits, long a staple of high school education in a country determined that the lessons of its history not be forgotten, should also be extended to new migrants, who should make trips as part of their compulsory integration courses. Currently, the integration courses focus on learning the German language and about Germany's history, culture and its legal system Asked about the possibility of mandatory visits to concentration camps, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ministry said the integration course for immigrants already had a module regarding the consequences of the Nazi rule for the people of Germany and Europe. Last month, Germany's justice minister called for more emphasis on the Holocaust in migrants' integration courses. Schuster said everyone who wanted to live permanently in Germany must identify with its history. Such visits, which should be prepared by schools, would show where anti-Semitism and hatred for Jews could lead, he said.

News article:
New migrants to Germany must visit Nazi concentration camp memorials to help tackle a perceived rise in anti-Semitism, Germany's Central Council of Jews said on Wednesday, supporting a proposal by a Palestinian-German politician. Anti-Semitism remains a sensitive issue in Germany, one of Israel's closest allies, more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed. The government decried as shameful the spectacle of the Israeli flag being burned at demonstrations last month against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews expressed support for a proposal by Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin state senator, for mandatory visits by newly arrived refugees to Nazi concentration camps memorials. "People who have fled to us who have themselves had to escape or been expelled, can develop empathy in such memorials," Schuster told Deutschlandfunk radio on Wednesday. Germany has received well over a million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. Germany is home today to an estimated 200,000 Jews and has built a reputation in recent decades as a tolerant, safe place for Jews to live - though data shows anti-Semitic crimes reported to the police rose 4 percent to 681 in the first eight months of 2017 from the same period in 2016. "It makes sense for everyone living in this country to be obliged to visit a concentration camp memorial site at least once in their lives," Chebli told Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday when she first floated the proposal. She said such visits, long a staple of high school education in a country determined that the lessons of its history not be forgotten, should also be extended to new migrants, who should make trips as part of their compulsory integration courses. Currently, the integration courses focus on learning the German language and about Germany's history, culture and its legal system Asked about the possibility of mandatory visits to concentration camps, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ministry said the integration course for immigrants already had a module regarding the consequences of the Nazi rule for the people of Germany and Europe. Last month, Germany's justice minister called for more emphasis on the Holocaust in migrants' integration courses. Schuster said everyone who wanted to live permanently in Germany must identify with its history. Such visits, which should be prepared by schools, would show where anti-Semitism and hatred for Jews could lead, he said.

https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/11743/germany-antisemitism Finally, it seems, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is proposing legislation that might even include deporting migrants who are anti-Semites, according to Die Welt. The alarming scale of anti-Semitism in Germany has been escalating with newly arrived refugees, mainly from Muslim lands, and causing the government previously to launch a desperate integration program with a warning that this kind of hatred would not be tolerated in the country. The German government also decided to introduce extensive discussions about Germany’s Nazi past in the course designed to make newcomers integrate into democratic societies. The situation seemed to be getting out of control with escalating anti-Semitism among more than a million asylum seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Teachers familiar with the curriculum, however, predict a bleak future for the efforts to convince the Muslim refugees about European history of Nazi Germany: most of them are already drunk with the anti-Semitic propaganda spread across the Muslim world by Nazi-sympathizing Islamists. The course book introduced by Federal Bureau for Immigration and Refugees (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge, BAMF), carries a full chapter and other small sections about the Holocaust and the atrocities committed by Nazi regime against Jewish citizens of Europe. A senior teacher for the integration course, requesting anonymity, told this author that she finds most of the Muslim participants struggling to understand the Nazi crimes, with many of them soft towards Nazis or assuming that the Jews were to be blamed for Holocaust instead of being the victims of it. One chapter, titled, Eine Zeitzeugin Berichtet (“An Eyewitness Reports”), narrates the ordeal of a Holocaust survivor, Magda Hollander-Lafon. Ms Lafon, an Auschwitz survivor, narrates how her mother and sister were gassed to death while she endured unspeakable torture, hunger and thirst to survive the horrors. The teachers, however, always hear from some of the Muslim students that the Jews must have been responsible for being treated that way because they had opposed the Nazi regime. Many of them believe, she said, that each and every Jew is responsible for the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Many participants in these Muslim integration courses, in fact, seem to justify the acts of Nazis by associating their own Muslim hatred against Jews concerning the Palestine issue. The situation also becomes even more surreal when the majority of the Muslim students in class are faced with face counter-arguments from other participants, who are now in minority in these integration classes. A Syrian-Jewish young man, for instance, came forward to counter the claim of Middle Eastern students that the Muslim regimes in their lands provided equal safety and respect to non-Muslim citizens. The young man from Damascus, also seeking anonymity, explained that life is hell for Jews, Christians and citizens of other religious minorities in most Muslim countries, including Syria. He added that the local tiny Jewish community in Damascus lived under constant threat of robberies, extortion and abductions; that he himself had twice been a victim of abduction for ransom, and that each time his family had to pay a heavy ransom to Islamists to buy his freedom after his abductors had threatened to kill him if the money were not paid. He said that Jewish immigrants who reached Germany and Europe do not feel safe inside the migrant camps where majority of the immigrants have hostile views towards Jews. He added that this fear was why the majority of Middle Eastern Jews abstain from revealing their identities to the people around them, and try to look for some relatives or volunteers who are willing to give them shelter for a while. In the meantime, the recent marches organized by Islamists in Berlin as a response to US President Donald Trump’s declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel revealed the real face of Islamists. They burned images of the Star of David and chanted anti-Israel slogans while burning Israeli flags — exposing the deep-rooted hatred and racism of many Muslims, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government seemed baffled by the extreme demonstration of anti-Semitism by those protesting President Trump’s decision. Such an incontrovertible display of anti-Semitism made Chancellor Merkel and then Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière warn everyone that Germany will not tolerate any kind of anti-Semitism. The incident, however, was just tip of the iceberg: Jewish citizens in Germany face horrific harassment during their day-to-day life in public places and schools. In Berlin, a 14-year- old Jewish boy was forced to change schools after increasing bullying and intimidation by pupils of Turkish and Arab descent. After his fellow students discovered that he is a Jew, he was threatened with a fake pistol and subjected to intense verbal abuse. In addition, Mekan Kolasinac, a local politician in the city of Saarlouis of the Left Party, which is known for its anti-Israel views, branded the party’s federal head, Bernd Riexinger, a “sneaky Jew” in a Facebook post. Although Kolasinac later decided to apologize for his comment, it had already exposed hateful mindset that exists even among the relatively influential section of society. A study conducted by German government revealed that 33 million Germans, around 40% of country’s population, appear to share a modern form of anti-Semitism Recently, a member of Green party of the Bundestag, Volker Beck, told Deutsche Welle, “Forty percent agree with Israeli-centered anti-Semitism, That’s almost half of the society. It says a lot about the intellectual environment in which Jews have to live.” This dangerous mix of local anti-Semites and newly arrived Muslims provide the newcomers with a compelling opportunity to flourish, and to further whatever violent designs many may have against the Jewish people. This new generation of anti-Semites knows the laws and seem well-trained to juggle around the legal loopholes to express their thoughts. That is why those in Berlin brought a homemade Israeli flag to burn, but may well avoid jail because in court it may be proven that it was not an exact flag of Israel. This is how the extremist attendees of integration courses are able to present their anti-Semitic thoughts. They just stop just short of denying the Holocaust and avoid directly praising their idol (Hitler), yet they comfortably discuss that Jews earned the ferocity of Nazis for opposing them. It is ironic that all this harassment against the Jewish citizens takes place under the nose of law, which theoretically does not allow hate speech. The authorities, however, appear to feel helpless about curbing the extremism against Jewish members of their society. The situation demands an immediate review of policies and laws evidently too feeble to protect all residents equally, not to mention the even greater feebleness of political will to implement those laws. The situation demands an immediate review of policies and laws evidently too feeble to protect all residents equally, not to mention the even greater feebleness of political will to implement those laws. If not stopped and countered in a timely way, possibly by these new proposals, this nest of hate-mongers carries with it the potential to push Germany into another really ugly time.

Berlin – German lawmakers have voted to install a commissioner who would coordinate government activities against anti-Semitism. The lower house approved by a wide majority Thursday a motion proposed by four of the six parliamentary groups to install the official, who would be chosen by independent experts. The center-left Social Democrats called for the commissioner to be installed at the chancellery. The decision follows a recommendation by a panel of experts and comes amid concern over anti-Semitic incidents during recent pro-Palestinian protests. Volker Kauder, the parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Union bloc, told lawmakers that far-right motives are behind the bulk of anti-Semitic crimes but there’s been a rising number of acts by migrants. He said “we must not allow either of these things.”

FILE PHOTO: Logo of Saudi Aramco is seen at the 20th Middle East Oil & Gas Show and Conference (MOES 2017) in Manama, Bahrain, March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi oil giant Aramco said its plants and facilities are operating normally after Yemen’s Houthi movement announced on Thursday it had fired a short-range ballistic missile towards an Aramco facility in the southern Saudi province of Najran. There was no immediate comment from Saudi authorities about the report, which was carried by Houthi TV al-Massirah and the Houthi-controlled news agency SABA. The report did not identify the facility that was targeted in Najran, where Aramco has some offices and a loading facility. The Iranian-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom - causing little serious damage - since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015. The coalition moved in after the armed Houthi movement drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country during its civil war. Iran and the Houthis deny the charge.

A Saudi fighter jet been shot down in Yemen by Iran backed Houthi rebels, Press TV reported quoting Arabic-language al-Masirah television on Wednesday. According to the TV, F-15 fighter jet belonging to the Royal Saudi Air Force was targeted with a surface-to-air missile as it was flying in the skies over northwestern Yemeni province of Sa'ada. There was no independent confirmation of the report ran by Iranian's regimes's propaganda tool. The conflift in Yemeni began in 2015 between two factions, each claiming to constitute the Yemeni government, along with their supporters and allies. Houthi rebels fighting the Saudi-led coalition are backed by Iran in the conflict that has killed thousands civilians since the war began.

News article:
An Egyptian national was killed by shrapnel in Saudi Arabia on Sunday when Saudi forces shot down seven ballistic missiles launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said. Saudi air-defence forces say they intercepted three missiles aimed at the capital Riyadh and four others fired at the southern cities of Khamis Mushait, Najran and Jizan, according to Colonel Turki Al-Malki, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. Shrapnel from the missiles fell on residential areas in Riyadh, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians, the SPA quoted Al-Malki as saying. "This hostile action and indiscriminate action by the Iran-backed Houthi group proves the continued involvement of the Iranian regime in supporting the armed Houthi group with qualitative capabilities," Al-Malki said. "The firing of multiple ballistic missiles towards populated cities contravenes international human laws and ... is a serious development." The Saudi-led coalition launched an airstrike campaign in Yemen in March 2015 to fight Iran-backed Houthi rebels after they seized parts of Yemen, including the capial Sanaa and forced President Abd Rabbu Mansour Al-Hadi to flee. The Saudi military says the Houthis have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi Arabia since last year, all of which were intercepted. Search Keywords: Short link:

RIYADH – Saudi air defenses shot down seven ballistic missiles fired by Yemen's Houthi militia on Sunday, with debris killing a man in what was the first death in the capital during the Saudi-led coalition's three-year military campaign in Yemen. Saudi forces destroyed three missiles over northeastern Riyadh shortly before midnight, as well as others fired at the southern cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, the coalition said in a statement carried by state news agency SPA. Debris from the missiles fell on a home in Riyadh, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians, said coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki, according to SPA. Reuters reporters in Riyadh heard several booms and saw smoke in the air. Another witness said he saw a long stream of light followed by additional explosions.

Other video showed a missile landing in the middle of a highway, with the wreckage pictured on social media afterward. It was unclear if this was a Saudi missile, or one fired by the Houthis. The attack came on the third anniversary of the Saudi-led coalition's intervention in Yemen. 'This aggressive and hostile action by the Iran-backed Houthi group proves that the Iranian regime continues to support the armed group with military capabilities,' coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said. 'The firing of multiple ballistic missiles towards cities is a serious development.' The Houthi-run Al-Masira television channel claimed the rebels had targeted Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport as well as other airstrips in the south. The strikes come after the US defence secretary last week urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his visit to Washington to pursue 'urgent efforts' to end Yemen's conflict.

The Houthis expelled pro-government forces from the capital in September 2014 and went on to seize swathes of the impoverished Arabian peninsula country. This prompted a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia to intervene in Yemen on March 26, 2015, to help the government push back the Shiite rebels. Since then, around 10,000 people have been killed and 53,000 wounded in Yemen, triggering what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Houthi rebel chief Abdelmalik al-Huthi on Sunday said his fighters were ready to make more 'sacrifices' against the Saudi-led coalition, in an address marking the war's third anniversary. The Houthis plan a huge rally in Sanaa on Monday to mark the anniversary. The UN says living conditions in the war-scarred country have reached catastrophic levels and that 8.4 million people face imminent famine. The UN urgently needs $350million for humanitarian projects in Yemen, a senior agency official said on Sunday, insisting it was mere 'peanuts' compared with the cost of the country's war. Saudi Arabia and its allies - aided by billions of dollars worth of military equipment from the US and Britain - could stand guilty of war crimes, Amnesty International said on Friday.

News article:
The firing of seven ballistic missiles at Saudi Arabi by Yemen's rebels comes at a precarious time. Experts and former diplomats contend that the attack on Sunday, on the eve of the third anniversary of start of the war, is largely symbolic for the Houthis as a way to demonstrate military capabilities, but it could derail a new UN push to resume political talks. Gerald Feierstein, the director for Gulf affairs at the Middle East Institute, cautioned against over-reading the attack. "The timing is related to the third anniversary of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, and each party is attempting to demonstrate on the military side that they are making progress and achieving their goals", said Mr Feierstein, a career US diplomat who last served in Yemen in 2013. While the Saudi-led coalition says it is advancing in the north and Saada province, the rebel stronghold, "this was a message from the Houthis to demonstrate that they are far from defeated, that they can threaten Saudi security", he told The National. The attack puts the United States in a tougher position as it pushes for political negotiations. Last week, Defence Secretary James Mattis pledged to work with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in seeking an end to the war. The State Department on Monday condemned the Houthi attack, reiterating support for “the right of our Saudi partners to defend their borders”, but also urged a “return to political negotiations and move toward ending the war in Yemen”. ____________ Read more: Saudi-led coalition says Iran supplied missiles fired at Riyadh Attack on Saudi Arabia calls for a firm stance ____________ Peter Salisbury, a non-resident fellow who studies Yemen at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said the attack came amid “an uptick in back channel negotiations over an end to the conflict”. “It could make it a lot harder," he said. The United Nations' new special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths arrived on his first trip to Sanaa on Saturday, while the Saudi crown prince is scheduled to meet UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in New York this week, and US efforts have intensified via Oman to block arms smuggling to the Houthis by land and sea routes. “This is the largest cross-border attack since the conflict started,” said Mr Salisbury. Although Patriot defence systems were successful in intercepting the missiles, the attack leaves everyone in a sticky spot on how to move forward, he said. Another question looming over the attack is the role of Iran, and the response of the US administration in light of changes in President Donald Trump's team. The US president has picked Iran policy hawks Mike Pompeo and John Bolton as his new secretary of state and national security adviser respectively, with Mr Bolton to assume his post as soon as April 9. The appointments of Mr Pompeo and Mr Bolton could bring “a more right-wing hawkish view, that views Yemen and a Saudi-Iran proxy conflict” in a way that prolongs the confrontation, said Mr Salisbury. But it could also mean a new US approach behind a political process. Mr Feierstein said that beyond rhetoric, and counter-terrorism, the US has not done much on Yemen in the past 15 months. While acknowledging the need for more pressure on Iran, the former US ambassador advocated for a US diplomatic push to promote a political process. "That is something that [outgoing secretary of state] Rex Tillerson hasn’t done much and that Mr Pompeo could be doing,” he said. Separately, the White House announced on Monday the conclusion of the first trilateral meeting of national security advisers of the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The meeting was held on Friday "to discuss issues of strategic importance to the three countries, including joint efforts to counter the Iranian regime’s malign influence and provocative behaviour", the White House said.

The firing of seven ballistic missiles at Saudi Arabi by Yemen's rebels comes at a precarious time. Experts and former diplomats contend that the attack on Sunday, on the eve of the third anniversary of start of the war, is largely symbolic for the Houthis as a way to demonstrate military capabilities, but it could derail a new UN push to resume political talks. Gerald Feierstein, the director for Gulf affairs at the Middle East Institute, cautioned against over-reading the attack. "The timing is related to the third anniversary of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, and each party is attempting to demonstrate on the military side that they are making progress and achieving their goals", said Mr Feierstein, a career US diplomat who last served in Yemen in 2013. While the Saudi-led coalition says it is advancing in the north and Saada province, the rebel stronghold, "this was a message from the Houthis to demonstrate that they are far from defeated, that they can threaten Saudi security", he told The National. The attack puts the United States in a tougher position as it pushes for political negotiations. Last week, Defence Secretary James Mattis pledged to work with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in seeking an end to the war. The State Department on Monday condemned the Houthi attack, reiterating support for “the right of our Saudi partners to defend their borders”, but also urged a “return to political negotiations and move toward ending the war in Yemen”. ____________ Read more: Saudi-led coalition says Iran supplied missiles fired at Riyadh Attack on Saudi Arabia calls for a firm stance ____________ Peter Salisbury, a non-resident fellow who studies Yemen at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said the attack came amid “an uptick in back channel negotiations over an end to the conflict”. “It could make it a lot harder," he said. The United Nations' new special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths arrived on his first trip to Sanaa on Saturday, while the Saudi crown prince is scheduled to meet UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in New York this week, and US efforts have intensified via Oman to block arms smuggling to the Houthis by land and sea routes. “This is the largest cross-border attack since the conflict started,” said Mr Salisbury. Although Patriot defence systems were successful in intercepting the missiles, the attack leaves everyone in a sticky spot on how to move forward, he said. Another question looming over the attack is the role of Iran, and the response of the US administration in light of changes in President Donald Trump's team. The US president has picked Iran policy hawks Mike Pompeo and John Bolton as his new secretary of state and national security adviser respectively, with Mr Bolton to assume his post as soon as April 9. The appointments of Mr Pompeo and Mr Bolton could bring “a more right-wing hawkish view, that views Yemen and a Saudi-Iran proxy conflict” in a way that prolongs the confrontation, said Mr Salisbury. But it could also mean a new US approach behind a political process. Mr Feierstein said that beyond rhetoric, and counter-terrorism, the US has not done much on Yemen in the past 15 months. While acknowledging the need for more pressure on Iran, the former US ambassador advocated for a US diplomatic push to promote a political process. "That is something that [outgoing secretary of state] Rex Tillerson hasn’t done much and that Mr Pompeo could be doing,” he said. Separately, the White House announced on Monday the conclusion of the first trilateral meeting of national security advisers of the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The meeting was held on Friday "to discuss issues of strategic importance to the three countries, including joint efforts to counter the Iranian regime’s malign influence and provocative behaviour", the White House said. It said the meeting was attended by senior US officials from the state, defence and treasury departments and the intelligence community participated. The situation in Afghanistan was also discussed in a session attended by the Afghan national security adviser.

News article:
By News desk RIYADH/SANAA: The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after missiles crashed into Riyadh overnight causing casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time. The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of people live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have shut food and medical supplies in the past. Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians. Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. A top Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place on the eve of the third anniversary of the entry into the Yemen war by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies. “We praise the successful advance of military capabilities,” Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. “If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles,” he said. “If you continue your air strikes we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available.” The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against a Shia armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south. Khattab Gamal, a 27-year-old Egyptian electrician who lived in the Riyadh house hit by the debris, told Reuters he and his 15 housemates were awoken by loud explosions. “We knew something fell on the room where Abdulmuttalib was asleep. There were three others in the same room with him. All were asleep at the time of explosion. They all rushed and ran out and then we realized he was missing.” “We kept looking for him and realized he was still inside, we went back and tried to enter the room and save him but we couldn’t,” Gamal said by telephone. “There was a lot of dust and the smell was suffocating. A few minutes later the civil defence came and got him out but he was already dead.” The Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes on Yemen in the past three years, some of which have hit hospitals, schools and markets, killing hundreds of civilians while bringing Riyadh little closer to military victory. The kingdom has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died so far in the war in the region’s poorest country, and three out of four Yemenis - 22 million civilians - need relief aid. The conflict has caused the worst cholera outbreak in modern history, with more than 1 million reported cases. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted without doing damage, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports, a blockade that the United Nations said raised the prospect of mass starvation before it was partially lifted. Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh’s argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. “The transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is irresponsible and contrary to law,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement on Monday, appearing to refer to Iran. The United Arab Emirates, a key ally of Saudi Arabia in its military campaign, blamed Iran directly. “The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear,” said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his official Twitter account. “There’s no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran.” Pakistan too condemned the missile attack, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “Pakistan commends the Government of Saudi Arabia for destroying the missiles and limiting the casualties.” “The Government of Pakistan reiterated its full support and solidarity with the leadership, the government and people of Saudi Arabia against any threats to its territorial integrity and against the Harmain Sharifain.” Separately Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif in a tweet said, “We strongly condemn missile attack on Saudi Arabia. Pakistan remains fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom.” The Saudi military depends on service contracts with Western arms companies to keep its planes flying. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the war with US President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House last week, and with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London the previous week. Saudi Arabia viewed the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis as part of a regional strategy by arch-foe Tehran to encircle it. Independent UN experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran. The Houthis deny they are Iranian pawns, and say their movement has spawned a national revolution against corruption. Diplomats and Yemeni political officials reported this month that the Houthis and Saudi Arabia were conducting secret peace talks after years of UN-mediated dialogue yielded no results.

News article:
The seven ballistic missiles launched at four Saudi cities by the Houthis underscore the correctness of waging the war against them and the soundness of the warnings about Iran’s role in the region. It is Iran that smuggles the missiles and orchestrates their launching into Saudi Arabia. On Sunday night we witnessed the first major attack on Saudi Arabia since the start of Iran’s efforts to control Yemen three years ago. But despite the large number of missiles launched and the distance they crossed, the operation remains a mere show, and the four missiles in the skies over Riyadh were no more than fireworks. It is no coincidence that they were launched on the third anniversary of the war against the coup staged by the Houthi militias and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. While the missiles failed to hit any vital target, they succeeded in enabling the Saudi government to remind everyone that the war against the Houthis and their allies was and continues to be war of necessity. Currently, the Houthis control about a quarter of Yemen — with great difficulty, even in their stronghold Saada governorate. There was a time when they controlled all of Yemen, including the city of Aden in the south, to the extent that the legitimate government led by President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi had to flee through Oman to Saudi Arabia. Thus, had the military campaign not been launched, Yemen as a whole, not just a quarter of it, including its ports and airports, would have been under Iranian influence; and the Iranians would have been able to fire thousands of ballistic missiles and conventional rockets into Saudi territory. Those who denounce the military solution, on the third anniversary of the war, should imagine what would have happened had Yemen, or most of it, still been under the control of the Houthis and other rebels. The situation would have been frightening; much worse and more serious for both Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and would have caused a wider war than the one we have witnessed in the past 36 months. The launch of the seven missiles was a propaganda show, but it does not demonstrate a superior capability on the part of the Houthis; rather, it proves their inability to use missiles as they would wish. It also proves that the quarter of the country that they still hold in the north of Yemen requires military liberation, instead of relying solely on political action. However, the area that the Houthis control is rugged, mountainous and densely populated; moreover, the rebels are using civilians there as human shields to prevent aerial bombardment. The missile attack on Riyadh, which killed one person and injured two, confirms that Saudi Arabia and the Coalition it leads must complete the journey to Sanaa, liberate Yemen from Houthi control, and restore it as a state with a central authority headed by the legitimate government. In the past, all efforts to persuade the Coalition to halt military operations and attempt a political solution proved to be misguided; and could have led, indeed, to serious consequences. At present, however, the Houthis and the Iranians are struggling to smuggle their missiles into the country, and their numbers have been limited by the continuation of the fighting. Even the seven missiles launched on Sunday, and the ones launched before, were mostly fired at random as a result of the Coalition’s military activity, which is hunting the Houthis down in the areas under their control. Hence, any suggestion that political negotiation could reduce or stop military action would only achieve what the Houthis desire — which is to reorganize their forces on the ground and obtain more supplies of arms and fuel. Iran, through its Houthi agents, has now condemned itself in front of the new international envoy, Martin Griffiths. Met by the multiple missile attack on Saudi Arabia, Griffiths can see that a political solution cannot be based on granting the Houthis any political concessions outside the framework of the original political project; which calls for participation under the exclusive framework of the legitimate government, and the need to withdraw all weapons from the warring parties “outside” that legitimate government. There is no political solution that can justify granting the Houthis, and others, a mandate over some areas, allowing them to keep their weapons, or giving them a greater role in the political process.

Responding to reports that the Huthi armed group in Yemen fired seven ballistic missiles at airports in Riyadh and other Saudi Arabian cities overnight on Sunday, killing one civilian, Samah Hadid, Middle East Deputy Director for Campaigns at Amnesty International, said: “Launching indiscriminate attacks is prohibited by international humanitarian law and can constitute a war crime. A high death toll may have been averted, possibly due to the missiles being intercepted, but that doesn’t let the Huthi armed group off the hook for this reckless and unlawful act. These missiles cannot be precisely targeted at such distances, so their use in this manner unlawfully endangers civilians. “These unlawful attacks must not be used as an excuse by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to indiscriminately attack civilians or further exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian crisis by imposing yet more restrictions on importing aid and essential goods such as food, medicine and fuel. “We have documented extensively how all sides have violated international law in the Yemen conflict over the past three years. Saudi Arabia-led coalition airstrikes have recklessly destroyed and damaged Yemeni homes, hospitals, schools and markets. As a result, thousands of civilians have lost their lives and millions are displaced and in dire need of humanitarian aid. But violations by one side do not give the other side license to flout international humanitarian law.” Attack 'intercepted' According to initial media reports, including from the Saudi Arabian state press agency, all seven missiles were intercepted and destroyed, but an Egyptian national was killed after sustaining shrapnel wounds in the aftermath. The Huthi missiles were launched on the third anniversary of the beginning of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition’s campaign of airstrikes in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the war, and three out of four Yemenis — 22 million civilians — need relief aid. More than 1 million cholera cases have been reported, the worst outbreak in modern history. Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh's argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. The US Pentagon blamed Iran for exacerbating the conflict. "This follows Iran's pattern of providing advanced weapons to the Houthis," spokeswoman Lieutenant Commander Rebecca Rebarich said in a statement. "Iran has enabled the conflict in Yemen to spill into neighbouring countries and undermines international efforts to resolve the conflict, exacerbating the suffering of the Yemeni people." French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, appearing to refer to Iran, said in a statement that the transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is "irresponsible and contrary to law". Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi military ally, tweeted: "The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear. There's no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran." Qatar, which has been under months of sanctions from Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, also condemned the attacks on Saudi cities as "a violation of international law". The Saudi military depends on service contracts with Western arms companies to keep its planes flying. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the war in recent visits to US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May. Diplomats and Yemeni political officials reported this month that the Houthis and Saudi Arabia were conducting secret peace talks after years of UN-mediated dialogue yielded no results.

News article:
Why the Houthis have escalated the Yemen crisis Dr. Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg While the new UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths was on his first visit to Sana’a on March 25, Houthi militias fired seven ballistic missiles aimed at four Saudi cities — the largest number of missiles launched in one day since the beginning of the war. Later in the week, the Houthis fired more missiles at Saudi Arabia, and their statements indicated they intend to continue the missile attacks against Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Why the escalation? And why now? First, the Houthis wanted to nip Griffiths’ mission in the bud. With this escalation, they wanted to send a message to the UN that they have no plans to submit to the international will to disarm and dispose of their ballistic missile arsenal, as mandated by Security Council Resolution 2216. The resolution also bars other countries from supplying them with weapons, including ballistic missiles. The war has been a boon for the rebels. They have never been able to control such large swaths of Yemeni territory — about 20 percent of its total land. And through control of the government’s resources, such as taxes and fees, and profiteering in the black market, militia leaders have amassed large fortunes. Hodeidah port alone provides them with nearly a billion dollars annually in fees and other levies. The sanctions imposed on those leaders by the Security Council have not been implemented. Second, their patron and chief supporter, Iran, is facing pressure from the United States over the nuclear deal, its ballistic missile program, and its destabilizing activities in the region. It is in Iran’s interest to keep the pot boiling in Yemen to scuttle the renewed US efforts to confront its activities and renegotiate the nuclear deal. It thinks that, by showing resolve in Yemen, it can force the US to change course, as happened in Syria, for example. Third, the Houthi militias’ efforts to intimidate and blackmail the UN have been successful in the past because the UN thought it needed their cooperation to deliver badly needed aid in areas under their control. As such, the Houthis used the suffering of civilians to their advantage. By threatening to end cooperation in allowing the passage of aid, they cowed the UN into acquiescing to their belligerent tactics. By coinciding attacks with UN envoy’s first visit, rebels wanted to send a message that they have no plans to submit to the international will to disarm and dispose of their ballistic missile arsenal. Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg Fourth, the Houthis believed that the international community was not united in its determination to end their rebellion. Just a few days before they launched their March 25 missile volley against Saudi Arabia, the Houthis played host to several European diplomats, led by the European Union’s envoy to Yemen. The intentions of the diplomats aside, the Houthis touted the visit as a political victory. The fact that the European diplomats visited Yemen just before the new UN envoy did was seen by the Houthis as a clear demonstration that Europe had its own diplomatic channels that they could play against the UN. Since the conflict began, the EU’s diplomacy has unintentionally upstaged and undermined UN mediation efforts in the eyes of Yemeni rebels. In its attempts to woo the Houthis and convince them to reach a political compromise, the EU has provided the Houthis with the political and financial wherewithal to avoid dealing seriously with the UN. Thus, Houthi profiteering, Iran’s meddling, UN appeasement, and the EU’s alternative diplomacy are the four factors that appear to be derailing Griffiths’ first visit to Yemen. If the UN’s new special envoy is going to succeed, he has to be in charge of the mediation process. As representative of the UN secretary-general, he is responsible for bringing about a resolution to the conflict according to the terms of Resolution 2216, based on the GCC Initiative and its implementation mechanisms, and the outcomes of the Yemeni National Dialogue Conference. These key documents represent the international, regional and national consensus. Unless the Houthis are faced with the risk of losing their main sources of war profits, they may not ever come to the negotiating table to try and reach a political solution. Similarly, unless there are real consequences for its continued arming of the Houthis with ballistic missiles and other strategic weapons, Iran will continue to frustrate UN mediation. Without unity among the international community, including Europe, Griffiths’ mission is in danger, just as the previous UN envoy was undermined by differences within the international community. Fortunately for Yemen, and despite the missile attacks and the lack of progress on the political track, Saudi Arabia announced that it was going ahead with its previously announced humanitarian assistance plans. On March 28, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres witnessed the signing in New York of an agreement whereby Saudi Arabia and the UAE will provide $1 billion, or about 33 percent of the total cost of the 2018 UN Humanitarian Response Plan for Yemen. On Tuesday, an international conference will be held in Geneva to mobilize the funds needed to cover the remaining two-thirds of the money. The UN plan will provide urgently needed assistance in Yemen, including in the areas under rebel control. The conference is also important in that it could demonstrate international unity in facing the humanitarian disaster in Yemen and single out the main culprits in perpetuating that crisis, the Houthi militias.

News article:
Yemen's Houthi group hit a Saudi oil tanker off the main port city of Hodeidah on Tuesday, the Saudi-led coalition said, in an attack that could complicate a new United Nations push to end a war that has killed more than 10,000 people. The Iranian-aligned Houthis said they had targeted a coalition warship in response to an air strike on Hodeidah on Monday that killed at least a dozen civilians, including seven children. Tensions have been rising in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, including the capital Riyadh, in recent days. In a statement carried by Saudi media, the coalition said the oil tanker was in international waters when it came under "Houthi-Iranian attack" at around 1330 local time (1030 GMT). A coalition warship conducted a "swift intervention" foiling the attack, it said, without identifying the type of weapon used in the assault. "As a result of that attack, the tanker was subjected to a slight but ineffective hit and it resumed its naval course northwards, escorted by a coalition warship," the statement said. A European Union naval force that operates in the region confirmed the ship was underway, adding that the crew were safe and unharmed. The media department of the Houthi-run Yemeni military said naval forces had "targeted a battleship belonging to the coalition in response to the bombardment of displaced people in Hodeidah". It gave no further details. The department's text message was referring to an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on Monday in Houthi-controlled Hodeidah that destroyed a house and killed 12 civilians from the same family, including seven children. A coalition spokesman said the alliance takes the report very seriously, promising a full investigation. Last week, Saudi air defences intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge. CALL FOR ENDING WAR Earlier on Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the warring sides in Yemen to reach a political settlement to end a conflict now in its fourth year that has left 22 million people in urgent need of aid. Speaking in Geneva on the sidelines of a U.N. pledging conference for Yemen, Guterres said his Special Envoy Martin Griffiths will head to the United Arab Emirates, Oman and the Yemeni government-held city of Aden in the drive for peace, Guterres told reporters. Griffiths has already held talks with Houthi authorities as well as internationally-recognised Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Saudi officials in Riyadh. Guterres said he saw "positive perspectives" for preparing a plan of action "to lead to an effective inter-Yemeni dialogue able to achieve a political solution, with of course the involvement of all those that are relevant in this conflict". "I am optimistic about that possibility," the United Nations chief added. He announced that more than $2 billion has been pledged towards a U.N. humanitarian appeal of $3 billion for Yemen this year. It includes $930 million from Saudi Arabia and the UAE which lead the coalition air strikes. Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi called for a return to the negotiating table to end the war in the Arabian peninsula's poorest country and said his government was working to open blockaded ports and airports to aid.

RIYADH: Yemeni rebels on Tuesday attacked a Saudi oil tanker in the Red Sea, causing “minor damage”, state media said citing the Saudi-led military coalition against the Iran-backed insurgents. “A Saudi oil tanker was subjected to an Iranian Huthi attack off Hodeida port,” the Saudi Press Agency quoted a coalition spokesman as saying, without revealing the nature of the assault.The tanker continued on its route “after the rapid intervention of a coalition naval vessel”, the statement read. No casualties were immediately reported.It came a day after the United Nations said children were among 16 Yemenis killed in an apparent coalition air strike in Hodeida province, calling it “one of the deadliest attacks” on minors in the country for years. The coalition said Tuesday’s rebel assault “highlighted the dangers posed by Huthi militias and their backers to regional security”, in a reference to Iran.

RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia’s air defense had intercepted a missile that the armed Houthi movement said it fired at storage tanks belonging to Saudi Aramco oil company. Debris fell on residential areas when the missile, launched towards the southwestern Saudi Arabian port of Jizan, was destroyed around 2130 (1830 GMT) but there were no reported casualties or damage, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Aramco said on Twitter that all its facilities in Jizan were safe and operating normally. Tensions have risen in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia which the coalition said were intercepted. Falling debris killed one person in Riyadh, the first death in the Saudi capital from the Yemen war. Saudi Arabia accuses arch-rival Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the allegation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened against the Houthis in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the fighting.

The Saudi-led military coalition said Thursday it shot down a missile fired by Yemen's Shia Houthi rebels who said they targeted storage facilities of the kingdom's oil giant Aramco. "The missile fired at the town of Jizan was intercepted and destroyed" late Wednesday, said coalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki. "The debris fell on residential areas and we have no report of human losses or material damage," he said. Aramco said its facilities in Jizan, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, were "intact" and operating normally, after pictures were posted on social media of a fire sparked by a missile attack. The Houthi rebels said on their Al-Masirah television channel they had targeted Aramco storage tanks in Jizan. Saudi Arabia leads a regional military coalition allied with Yemen's embattled government in a war against the Iran-backed Houthis, who have ramped up their attacks on the kingdom. An Egyptian labourer was killed by falling debris from a March 25 missile attack on Riyadh. *This story was edited by Ahram Online. Search Keywords: Short link:

Coalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki said the missile was launched randomly from Yemen’s Saada province. The missile intended to target civilian and populated areas, he stated. When intercepted and destroyed, the debris fell on residential areas but there was no report of human losses or material damage, he added. Maliki reiterated that the Houthis’ hostile action is evidence of the Iranian regime’s support to the armed insurgents in violation of Security Council Resolutions 2216 and 2231.

A Saudi soldier from an artillery unit walks near ammunition at a position close to the Saudi-Yemeni border, in Saudi Arabia's southwestern Jazan province. (AFP) Asharq Al-Awsat The Arab coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen announced on Wednesday that the Saudi air defense system intercepted two drones sent by the Houthi militias from Yemeni territories, reported the Saudi Press Agency. Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki Al-Malki said that the drones were downed in the southern cities of Abha and Jazan. In a statement, he explained that the air defense system detected at 07:40 am an unidentified body flying towards Abha International Airport. It quickly destroyed it due to the rules of engagement. Air navigation was closed soon after in accordance with the global aviation laws. It was resumed shortly after. Malki announced that specialists from the Arab coalition examined the fragments of the body and found that it was a Houthi drone with Iranian features and specifications. He accused them of trying to target the airport in violation of International Humanitarian Law. In Jazan, he said that an unidentified body was flown towards a civilian area in the city. It was monitored and later destroyed by the air defense. No casualties were reported in the incident. Immediate tests conducted by specialists revealed that the body of the drone was identical to the one downed in Abha. The Arab coalition warned in the strongest terms the Iran-backed Houthis against targeting civilian areas and people, saying that a retaliation is justified. The command will take all deterrent actions in accordance with International Humanitarian Law and rules, Malki said. Arms monitor Conflict Armament Research said it has evidence that the drones used on Wednesday and other Houthi kit were made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction “in contrast to Houthi statements”.

(Adds details on Jizan refinery in para 4) DUBAI, April 11 (Reuters) - Yemen's armed Houthi movement said on Wednesday it had launched a drone strike on a facility belonging to oil giant Saudi Aramco in southern Saudi Arabia - though the company said its facilities there were operating "normally and safely". The Houthis' Al-Masirah TV channel did not say when the attack took place or give details of any damage. "The air force announced the execution of air strikes with the Qasef-1 aircraft on Aramco in Jizan (province)," the channel said on its Twitter account, referring to a drone the Houthis unveiled last year. Saudi Aramco is building a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Jizan, part of a new economic city on the Red Sea. The refinery is expected to become fully operational in 2019. Al-Masirah said the Houthis had also launched an attack with the same model of drone on the airport of Abha in neighbouring Asir province. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab states intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to try and push back the Houthis after the movement drove the internationally recognized government into Saudi exile. The coalition has launched thousands of air strikes which have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians. The Houthis have stepped up ballistic missile attacks on the kingdom in what it says is retaliation for the air raids. They have frequently claimed attacks, including on Aramco facilities, that Saudi Arabia and its main ally the United Arab Emirates have either said did not happen or were intercepted. The group unveiled what it said was a series of drones, including the Qasef-1, at a ceremony last year. The arms monitor Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said it had evidence showing the Qasef-1 and other Houthi kit was made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction "in contrast to Houthi statements". The coalition accuses the Houthis of being armed and supported by Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny.

News article:
Saudi soldiers take their position at Saudi Arabia's border with Yemen. (Reuters) Washington, Riyadh – Atef Abdul Latif and Asharq Al-Awsat Saudi air defenses intercepted on Thursday night a new ballistic missile fired by the Iran-backed Houthis towards the Kingdom. Official spokesman for Coalition Forces Supporting Legitimacy in Yemen Colonel Turki Al-Malki said that the missile was launched by the militias in Yemen’s Saada province and targeted residential areas in the city of Jizan in southern Saudi Arabia. The missile was was intercepted and destroyed by the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces, resulting in the scattering of its shrapnel debris on residential neighborhoods. There were no reports of any casualties or damage. The failed attempt to target Jizan coincided with the flow of Arab and international condemnation of the Houthis, who on Wednesday fired missiles against Saudi cities. All of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. The United States State Department condemned the attack, saying the Kingdom has the right to defend its borders against the militias. The attack, it said, raises questions on just how committed the Houthis are towards achieving peace and building a secure and prosperous future for Yemen. Director of the Center for Gulf Affairs at the Middle East Institute Gerald Feierstein told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Houthis were using such attacks against Saudi Arabia to embarrass it before its own people. They are attempting to demonstrate that the Saudi armed forces were incapable of protecting their borders and territories, he continued. The arms used by the Houthis in their attacks cannot really achieve real military purposes because they lack the means to target vital infrastructure, he went on to say. He stressed that the US must continue to support Saudi Arabia and the Arab Coalition in their efforts to restore legitimacy in Yemen and prevent the Houthis from taking over the country. Feierstein said that Washington supports the Saudi-led Coalition’s goal to implement United Nations Security Council resolution 2216 on Yemen. Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Dr. Abdullatif bin Rashid Al-Zayani condemned Wednesday’s terrorist ballistic missile attack by the Houthis against the Saudi capital Riyadh and cities of Jizan and Najran. The continuation of such attacks demonstrates the militias’ insistence to threaten the security of Saudi Arabia and their rejection of regional and international efforts to stop the bloodshed and achieve peace in Yemen. He hailed the efficiency of the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces, which intercepted and destroyed the missiles before they reached their targets. He called on the international community to condemn these hostile acts that violate international laws and conventions, urging the Security Council to implement its resolutions on Yemen, including resolution 2216. Britain also expressed deep concern after the ballistic missile attacks by the Houthis against Saudi cities, stressing that it stands with Saudi Arabia against these serious threats. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a statement: "We will call on the UN to investigate how ballistic weapons reach Yemen in violation of Security Council resolutions." "Those responsible for firing these missiles and their supporters must stop these provocative acts and return to political dialogue to ensure an end to the conflict in Yemen for the benefit of the Yemeni people and ensure the security of the region," he added. Egypt strongly condemned the Houthi attack. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday that it fully support Saudi Arabia in confronting all who attempt to destabilize or threaten its security.

News article:
Al Mukalla: UAE-backed Yemeni Security Belt forces have killed two senior Al Qaida militants in the southern province of Abyan, scoring another victory in the battle against the militant group. Hassan Basaria and Murad Doubali were killed in an intense gun battle after refusing to surrender in Al Wadhea district, the birthplace of Yemen’s president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi, the security unit said in a statement. They had been involved in plotting attacks against local security forces. Al Qaida has largely failed to resurface in their former strongholds as thousands of Yemeni troops, trained and armed by the UAE military in Yemen, assert control over key urban and rural areas in southern Yemen. Meanwhile, Saudi-led coalition fighter jets have killed an Al Houthi navy commander responsible for smuggling arms and staging attacks against ships in the Red Sea. Yemen Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that coalition fighter jets targeted a gathering of Al Houthi militants in the western port city of Hodeida, killing Mansour Ahmad Al Sa’adi and a number of his associates. Al Sa’adi was described as an important Al Houthi smuggler and a commander of the movement’s navy soldiers who plotted attacks against military and humanitarian ships from the USA, UAE and Saudi Arabia. The death of Al Sa’adi comes as the Iran-backed militia officially mourned the death of brigadier Nasser Al Qubari, a former Republican Guard, killed in an air strike by the coalition jets on Wednesday. Precision air raids by the coalition’s fighter jets have killed dozens of Al Houthi commanders, including military aides to Al Houthi leader, Abdul Malik Al Houthi. The Saudi-led coalition has intensified their ground and air offensive in the province of Hodeida in an attempt to cut off the remaining smuggling routes on the Red Sea under Al Houthi control. Meanwhile, Yemen’s Defence Ministry mourned the death of Colonel Ali Abdullah Al Suaidi, the commander of Brigade 159, who was killed in clashes with Al Houthi militants on Al Abadia battlefield, east of the central province of Baydha. Another pro-government field commander, Mohammad Jawas, was killed after attacking Al Houthi-controlled sites in Al Shareja, north of Lahj province. The Defence Ministry said coalition fighter jets carried out dozens of air strikes in Taiz and Serwah, Baydha and Sa’ada, striking Al Houthi military equipment and gatherings and killing dozens of militants. The coalition massive air support is credited for turning the tide of the current war in favour of government forces. The Saudi-led Arab coalition entered the Yemeni war in 2015 just months after an Al Houthi coup forced internationally-recognised Yemeni president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi out of power. He later was able to escape house arrest and flee to Aden where he temporarily shifted government headquarters. Since then, the coalition has gained back 86 per cent of Yemeni territory but major population centres still remain under Al Houthi control. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of illegally smuggling weapons into Yemen to sustain Al Houthi war efforts. In December, one such Iranian-made ballistic missile was fired towards Riyadh for the first time in the three-year war. Although it was intercepted, Riyadh called it an ‘act of war’. The war has cost the lives of thousands of Yemenis and pushed the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine. The latest government push seeks to take advantage of cracks in the awkward Al Houthi alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s supporters. Saleh ruled Yemen for more than three decades until he was forced to resign following an Arab Spring uprising in 2011. He remained in the country, however, and continued to wield power from behind the scenes. In 2014, his forces allied with Al Houthi militia, despite the fact that as president he had gone to war with them. There had been simmering tensions between the two awkward allies in past months that boiled over in December when Saleh suggested he would cooperate with Hadi — he was assassinated shortly after. Since then senior members of Saleh’s party have either been executed or placed under house arrest by Al Houthis amid a draconion crackdown. The broken alliance between Al Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh appears to be permanent, which will help the Yemeni government and its backers in the Saudi-led coalition weaken their grip on the country given the reduction in manpower. In a recent meeting with New York Times editors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said that Al Houthis have become increasingly isolated politically. He dismissed the seven missiles Al Houthis fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on March 25 as “a last-ditch effort” that only showed they were weak. Saudi Arabia, he said, is now seeking to end the war through a political process, trying to divide Al Houthis and maintaining military pressure on them.

Al Qaida has largely failed to resurface in their former strongholds as thousands of Yemeni troops, trained and armed by the UAE military in Yemen, assert control over key urban and rural areas in southern Yemen. Meanwhile, Saudi-led coalition fighter jets have killed an Al Houthi navy commander responsible for smuggling arms and staging attacks against ships in the Red Sea. Yemen Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that coalition fighter jets targeted a gathering of Al Houthi militants in the western port city of Hodeida, killing Mansour Ahmad Al Sa’adi and a number of his associates. Al Sa’adi was described as an important Al Houthi smuggler and a commander of the movement’s navy soldiers who plotted attacks against military and humanitarian ships from the USA, UAE and Saudi Arabia. The death of Al Sa’adi comes as the Iran-backed militia officially mourned the death of brigadier Nasser Al Qubari, a former Republican Guard, killed in an air strike by the coalition jets on Wednesday. Precision air raids by the coalition’s fighter jets have killed dozens of Al Houthi commanders, including military aides to Al Houthi leader, Abdul Malik Al Houthi. The Saudi-led coalition has intensified their ground and air offensive in the province of Hodeida in an attempt to cut off the remaining smuggling routes on the Red Sea under Al Houthi control. Meanwhile, Yemen’s Defence Ministry mourned the death of Colonel Ali Abdullah Al Suaidi, the commander of Brigade 159, who was killed in clashes with Al Houthi militants on Al Abadia battlefield, east of the central province of Baydha. Another pro-government field commander, Mohammad Jawas, was killed after attacking Al Houthi-controlled sites in Al Shareja, north of Lahj province. The Defence Ministry said coalition fighter jets carried out dozens of air strikes in Taiz and Serwah, Baydha and Sa’ada, striking Al Houthi military equipment and gatherings and killing dozens of militants. The coalition massive air support is credited for turning the tide of the current war in favour of government forces. The Saudi-led Arab coalition entered the Yemeni war in 2015 just months after an Al Houthi coup forced internationally-recognised Yemeni president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi out of power. He later was able to escape house arrest and flee to Aden where he temporarily shifted government headquarters. Since then, the coalition has gained back 86 per cent of Yemeni territory but major population centres still remain under Al Houthi control. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of illegally smuggling weapons into Yemen to sustain Al Houthi war efforts. In December, one such Iranian-made ballistic missile was fired towards Riyadh for the first time in the three-year war. Although it was intercepted, Riyadh called it an ‘act of war’. The war has cost the lives of thousands of Yemenis and pushed the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine. The latest government push seeks to take advantage of cracks in the awkward Al Houthi alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s supporters. Saleh ruled Yemen for more than three decades until he was forced to resign following an Arab Spring uprising in 2011. He remained in the country, however, and continued to wield power from behind the scenes. In 2014, his forces allied with Al Houthi militia, despite the fact that as president he had gone to war with them. There had been simmering tensions between the two awkward allies in past months that boiled over in December when Saleh suggested he would cooperate with Hadi — he was assassinated shortly after. Since then senior members of Saleh’s party have either been executed or placed under house arrest by Al Houthis amid a draconion crackdown. The broken alliance between Al Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh appears to be permanent, which will help the Yemeni government and its backers in the Saudi-led coalition weaken their grip on the country given the reduction in manpower. In a recent meeting with New York Times editors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said that Al Houthis have become increasingly isolated politically. He dismissed the seven missiles Al Houthis fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on March 25 as “a last-ditch effort” that only showed they were weak. Saudi Arabia, he said, is now seeking to end the war through a political process, trying to divide Al Houthis and maintaining military pressure on them.

Saudi air defences intercepted a "ballistic missile" fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern coastal city of Jizan, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the rebels said. It was the latest in a series of such attacks. "Saudi air defences intercepted a ballistic missile launched by the Huthi militias targeting Jizan," the coalition said in a statement. The Huthis, in a statement on their news outlet Al-Masirah, claimed that they fired a "Badr 1" ballistic missile and said it struck Jizan Regional Airport. AFP was unable to reach the airport for comment, but open-source flight information appeared to show flights arriving and departing on time. Saudi Arabia has since March 2015 led a coalition of Arab states fighting to roll back the Huthi rebels in Yemen and restore its neighbour's internationally-recognised government to power. Nearly 10,000 people have since been killed in the conflict, in what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In March, an Egyptian labourer became the first known fatality in a rebel missile attack on the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia accuses its rival Iran of smuggling missiles to the Huthis -- a charge Tehran denies.

Riyadh (AFP) - Saudi air defences on Sunday intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern border city of Najran, which set a farm ablaze, state media said. "Saudi forces were able to intercept (the missile)," the Saudi Press Agency said, citing the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels. "But the shrapnel scattered over residential areas and caused a fire at a farm belonging to a citizen, without causing any injuries." The missile was launched from Saada, the Huthi stronghold in northern Yemen, the coalition was cited as saying. The coalition said another missile crashed in a Saudi desert on Sunday, without specifying a location, adding it caused no damage. Sunday's strikes are the latest in a series of rebel bombardments on Saudi territory. Saudi forces said they intercepted a rebel ballistic missile targeting kingdom's southern coastal city of Jizan on Friday, the second such strike in the area in over a week. Earlier this month, Saudi forces said they intercepted rebel ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and the south of the kingdom, where two drones were also shot down.

(Adds Houthi leader speech) By Noah Browning DUBAI, April 28 (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi movement fired ballistic missiles at what it called "economic and vital targets" in the southern Saudi province of Jizan on Saturday, and Saudi authorities said a man was killed by debris from the projectiles. The attack appeared to be retaliation promised by Yemen's dominant political faction in a war there as thousands attended a funeral in the Houthi-run capital Sanaa for a top Houthi official killed in a Saudi-led air strike last week. Eyewitnesses in Sanaa reported Saudi-led air raids on Saturday near the downtown rally for the burial of Saleh al-Samad, the president of the political body that runs Houthi-controlled northern Yemen. There were no reports of casualties. The Houthis said they launched eight ballistic missiles at "economic and vital targets" in Saudi's Jizan province on Saturday. Riyadh said it intercepted four of the projectiles. Jizan civil defence spokesman Colonel Yahya Abdullah Al-Qahtani said on Arabiya TV that the Saudi man was killed by "falling fragments of military projectiles." A picture accompanying the Arabiya TV report appeared to show the outside of a civilian home pockmarked by shrapnel. The two sides in Yemen have fought to a stalemate after more than three years of war. A Saudi-led military coalition is trying to restore Yemen's internationally recognised government that was forced into exile after the Houthis took over large parts of the country in 2014 and seized the capital Sanaa. Saudi and other warplanes from the mostly Gulf Arab alliance have carried out thousands of air strikes, repeatedly hitting markets, hospitals and other civilian targets, killing hundreds of civilians. The coalition says it does not target civilians. In a televised speech, Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi vowed that the death of Samad -- a relative moderate who helped oversee political and administrative duties while the Houthi military wing pursued fighting -- would not split its ranks. "They anticipated that this crime would break the spirit of the Yemeni people ... Our enemies have fantasized that the assassination of the president will lead to disagreements within the Ansarullah (Houthis). All this is a mirage and illusions." The Houthis have fired more than 100 ballistic missiles into the kingdom, causing few casualties, but fuelling accusations by their adversaries and the United States that Iran is providing the missiles to their Houthi allies. Tehran and the Houthis deny the accusation. The group says it is fighting for Yemen's sovereignty against a Western-backed plot to dominate the country.

The four missiles were shot at the same time at 10:40 am local time (0740 GMT) and were targeting residential areas in the city, the report said. The forces intercepted on Friday a ballistic missile shot towards another border city Najran. Houthi militias have been targeting various Saudi cities, mainly those near the Saudi-Yemeni border. Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition in support of the exiled Yemeni government against Iranian backed militias. The militias have fired over 100 ballistic missiles in total targeting Saudi Arabian land, said an Arab coalition statement released on April 16. Saudi air defenses were able to intercept most of them.

News article:
Al Mukalla: Yemen’s army and Saudi-led coalition explosive sappers have defused more than 300,000 landmines and booby traps planted by the Iran-backed Al Houthis who suffer heavy setbacks on the battlefields. The director of Yemen’s Mine Action Centre, Brigadier General Amen Al Oukaili, said Al Houthis have planted more than 500,000 landmines before fleeing areas liberated by Yemeni troops during the course of the three-year war. Remaining landmines continue to pose a grave threat to civilians who return to their homes. 440 Yemenis have been killed by landmines The aim of leaving behind the landmines is to slow down government forces as they advance on the battlefield. Yemen’s under-secretary of the ministry of human rights, Majed Fadhael, was quoted by Saudi news agency as saying that Al Houthi-planted landmines have killed 440 people, mainly women and children and wounded more than 540 others. Last year, Human Right Watch criticised Al Houthis for using landmines which are banned because of their indiscrminate killing and maiming of civilians. Many Yemenis fear to return home because of the fear of stepping on a landmine which has kept the numbers of internally-displaced Yemenis high. On Tuesday, Al Masdar Online news site reported a woman and her child were killed when a landmine planted by Al Houthis exploded in the southern city of Taiz. Sabah Sultan, 30 and her child Ali Mouath, 6, were getting water from a water tanker when a landmine that was planted behind the tanker exploded, killing them instantly in Hathran region, west of Taiz. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, fighter jets from the Saudi-led coalition escalated attacks against Al Houthi targets, west of Taiz, in support of thousands of army troops, led Tareq Mohammad Abdullah Saleh. Yemen’s Defense Ministry said the coalition’s fighter jets bombed Al Houthi military equipment and gatherings in areas east of the Red Sea Mokha town as Tareq’s forces push deeper into Al Houthis’ shrinking territories in Taiz. The ministry said the air strikes killed and wounded a number of Al Houthis and enabled ground forces to make limited advances in their push towards Al Bareh town. Heavy fighting also broke out on Wednesday in the northeastern province of Saada, Al Houthis’ main heartland, where government forces made fresh gains that brought them closer to reaching Marran region, the birthplace of Al Houthi movement founder Hussain Al Houthi. Local military commanders say government forces are battling Al Houthis on five fronts in Saada in a bid to cut off supply lines from and to Saada and erode their military power that protects Saada. The Saudi-led Arab coalition entered the Yemeni war in 2015 just months after an Al Houthi coup forced internationally-recognised Yemeni president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi out of power. 540 Yemenis wounded by landmines He later was able to escape house arrest and flee to Aden where he temporarily shifted government headquarters. Since then, the coalition has gained back 86 per cent of Yemeni territory but major population centres still remain under Al Houthi control. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of illegally smuggling weapons into Yemen to sustain Al Houthi war efforts. In December, one such Iranian-made ballistic missile was fired towards Riyadh for the first time in the three-year war. Although it was intercepted, Riyadh called it an ‘act of war’. The war has cost the lives of thousands of Yemenis and pushed the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine. The latest government push seeks to take advantage of cracks in the awkward Al Houthi alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s supporters. Saleh ruled Yemen for more than three decades until he was forced to resign following an Arab Spring uprising in 2011. He remained in the country, however, and continued to wield power from behind the scenes. In 2014, his forces allied with Al Houthi militia, despite the fact that as president he had gone to war with them. There had been simmering tensions between the two awkward allies in past months that boiled over in December when Saleh suggested he would cooperate with Hadi — he was assassinated shortly after. Since then senior members of Saleh’s party have either been executed or placed under house arrest by Al Houthis amid a draconion crackdown. The broken alliance between Al Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh appears to be permanent, which will help the Yemeni government and its backers in the Saudi-led coalition weaken their grip on the country given the reduction in manpower. In a recent meeting with New York Times editors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said that Al Houthis have become increasingly isolated politically. He dismissed the seven missiles Al Houthis fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on March 25 as “a last-ditch effort” that only showed they were weak. Saudi Arabia, he said, is now seeking to end the war through a political process, trying to divide Al Houthis and maintaining military pressure on them.

News article:
Al Mukalla: Yemen’s army and Saudi-led coalition explosive sappers have defused more than 300,000 landmines and booby traps planted by the Iran-backed Al Houthis who suffer heavy setbacks on the battlefields. The director of Yemen’s Mine Action Centre, Brigadier General Amen Al Oukaili, said Al Houthis have planted more than 500,000 landmines before fleeing areas liberated by Yemeni troops during the course of the three-year war. Remaining landmines continue to pose a grave threat to civilians who return to their homes. 440 Yemenis have been killed by landmines The aim of leaving behind the landmines is to slow down government forces as they advance on the battlefield. Yemen’s under-secretary of the ministry of human rights, Majed Fadhael, was quoted by Saudi news agency as saying that Al Houthi-planted landmines have killed 440 people, mainly women and children and wounded more than 540 others. Last year, Human Right Watch criticised Al Houthis for using landmines which are banned because of their indiscrminate killing and maiming of civilians. Many Yemenis fear to return home because of the fear of stepping on a landmine which has kept the numbers of internally-displaced Yemenis high. On Tuesday, Al Masdar Online news site reported a woman and her child were killed when a landmine planted by Al Houthis exploded in the southern city of Taiz. Sabah Sultan, 30 and her child Ali Mouath, 6, were getting water from a water tanker when a landmine that was planted behind the tanker exploded, killing them instantly in Hathran region, west of Taiz. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, fighter jets from the Saudi-led coalition escalated attacks against Al Houthi targets, west of Taiz, in support of thousands of army troops, led Tareq Mohammad Abdullah Saleh. Yemen’s Defense Ministry said the coalition’s fighter jets bombed Al Houthi military equipment and gatherings in areas east of the Red Sea Mokha town as Tareq’s forces push deeper into Al Houthis’ shrinking territories in Taiz.

The Saudi-led coalition, consisting mostly of Persian Gulf countries, has been carrying out airstrikes against the Houthi movement since March 2015, when the rebels conducted a takeover in the country, which resulted in President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi fleeing Sanaa, Yemen's capital. The Houthis, allied with ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, clashed with Hadi's forces, with each side claiming to be the official government. The coalition led by Saudi Arabia denounced the Houthi takeover as unconstitutional and since then has been attempting to restore the government of Hadi. READ MORE: Saudi Air Defenses Down Yemeni Rebel Missile — Reports The military conflict in Yemen has further escalated since November 2017 when Saudi Arabia accused Iran of supplying the Houthi rebels with ballistic missiles and imposed a blockade on Yemen in order to prevent the transfer of military goods to the Houthis. While Tehran has made no secret of its political support for the Shiite movement, it has repeatedly denied rumors of arming the Yemeni rebels. While Riyadh has insisted that the closure of Yemen's ground, air and sea ports by the Saudi-led coalition forces would not interfere with food deliveries to the country, the UN said that the blockade distorted the supply of humanitarian aid, which along with the destruction of the country's infrastructure, as a result of the fighting, has led to a massive famine.

News article:
Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi – Reuters CAIRO – 2 April 2018: Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi expressed his wishes of progress and success in a cable sent on Monday to his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fatah al-Sisi after winning a second term. Hadi asserted that his country shares deep-rooted and strong relations with Egypt, expressing his hope for more cooperation in various fields. In a press conference on Monday, the National Election Authority announced the victory of Sisi over Ghad Party Chairman Moussa Moustafa Moussa in the 2018 presidential election. President Sisi garnered 97.08 percent of valid votes in the presidential election last week, where more than 21.8 million people voted for him. His hardly-known competitor, Moussa Moustafa Moussa, received 656,534 votes, making up 2.9 percent of the valid ballots. The turnout stood at 24,254,152 voters, representing 41 percent of 50,078,138 registered voters. In a televised speech after winning the election, Sisi pledged to keep his promise in serving the nation and thanked all Egyptians for trusting him to lead the country. “With complete honesty, I pledge to keep my promise with you and to dedicate myself to spare no efforts for our great nation,” Sisi said on Monday. The national unity that was shown during the election was strong evidence of Egypt’s solid power against those who wanted to undermine the country, he added. Much like the 2014 election, when Sisi competed against well-known politician Hamdeen Sabahy, invalid votes ranked second in the poll. In the 2014 vote, 23.4 million people voted for Sisi, invalid votes accounted for one million ballots, and Sabahy won 740,000 votes. In 2018, invalid votes made up 7.27 percent of the total votes, accounting for 1.762 million ballots. If invalid votes are not excluded from the result, Sisi's share of the total votes would be 90 percent.

U.N. peacekeepers hold position at the MONUSCO base after dispersing demonstrators in Mavivi near Beni in North Kivu province October 22, 2014. REUTERS CAIRO – 5 April 2018: United Nations thanked Egypt on Wednesday evening for its cooperation with the UN by participating in peacekeeping missions. “Since 1948, more than a million women and men have served in the UN peacekeeping forces,” the UN wrote on Twitter, adding that Egypt participates in the peacekeeping missions with over 3,200 troops and policemen. The UN figures, as of February 28, 2018, show that Egypt provides UN peacekeeping forces with 2,293 troops, 775 policemen, 56 military experts and 63 state officers. The UN Peacekeeping forces are tasked with monitoring peace processes and agreements in post-conflict areas. Peacekeepers are deployed in parts of the Middle East, Mali, Pakistan, South Sudan, Lebanon, Darfur and Golan. The UN peacekeeping personnel consist of more than 90,000 military personnel, 13,000 police officers, in addition to more than 15,000 civilians, according to the UN. In January, head of a South Sudanese delegation in Cairo thanked President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the Egyptian government and people for their peacekeeping efforts in his country. South Sudan has been suffering a civil war for five years; tens of thousands were killed, while millions were displaced as the country plunged into famine.

News article:
PARIS, April 3 (Reuters) - France on Tuesday wished Abdel Fattah al-Sisi success for his next presidential term in Egypt and said it stood "resolutely" with the country on the fight against terrorism. Sisi, who had no real opposition, was re-elected for a second term with 97 percent of the vote, official returns showed. "France offers its wishes for the full success of President Sisi for his second mandate," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von Der Muhll said in a daily briefing. "It hopes that his reelection will allow him to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people for security, prosperity and the full expression of freedoms in a constitutional framework," she said without elaborating. With both France and Egypt concerned by the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt, the two countries have cultivated even closer economic and military ties under Sisi. Rights organizations have accused France under President Emmanuel Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi's government. After hosting Sisi in Paris in October, Macron said it was not up to him to "lecture" Egypt on civil liberties. "France stands resolutely alongside Egypt to face the common challenge of terrorism, to work for the solution of regional crises and to develop cooperation at the United Nations, in Africa and in the Mediterranean," von Der Muhll said. She added that Paris would continue its dialogue with Egypt on human rights and fundamental freedoms.

President of the Republic of Portugal Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa-Wikipedia, July, 17, 2017 CAIRO – 11 April 2018: Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa will meet Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmad al-Tayeb on Thursday as part of his visit to Egypt from Wednesday to Friday. On the sidelines of his meeting, the Portuguese president will take a tour of Al-Azhar Mosque, accompanied by al-Tayeb, to see its architectural and historic landmarks, particularly after its restoration. After his tour, he will give a lecture highlighting the relations between East and West, as well as the ways to enhance the values of coexistence and dialogue between different cultures and religions, referring to Portugal as a role model for coexistence among its community components. During his visit to Egypt, the Portuguese president will meet with President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, as well as Egyptian and Portuguese businessmen. Several economic and trade agreements are expected to be signed between Egypt and Portugal during the President de Sousa’s three-day visit, which started on Wednesday, April 11. According to a statement issued Wednesday by Egypt's State Information Service (SIS), President de Sousa is expected to meet with Sisi on Thursday. This is the first visit of a Portuguese president to Egypt in 24 years. De Sousa was elected president of Portugal in 2016. The SIS statement affirmed that this visit will be a great chance for both countries to enhance their economic, political, diplomatic and cultural cooperation. Egypt and Portugal are members of the intergovernmental organization Union for the Mediterranean, which includes 43 countries from Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Previously, Grand Imam al-Tayeb embarked on a tour on March 14 to visit Portugal and attend the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Islamic Society in Portugal. De Sousa praised the visit of Tayeb, stressing that he delivered a message of peace and tolerance. President Sisi, on the other hand, made an official visit to Portugal in December 2016, where he met President de Sousa, the prime minister and the mayor of Lisbon, along with representatives of a number of scientific and academic institutions and businessmen. The talks tackled the means of promoting political and diplomatic ties and boosting cooperation in the fields of economy, science, research and defense, along with regional and international issues, including the situation in the Middle East and ways to combat terrorism. Egypt has been looking into cooperation in military manufacturing with Portugal, as Egyptian Minister of State for Military Production Mohamed El-Assar discussed cooperation in the field of joint military and civil manufacturing with Portuguese Ambassador to Egypt Madalena Fischer in December 2017.

President of the Republic of Portugal Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa-Wikipedia, July, 17, 2017 CAIRO – 11 April 2018: Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa will meet Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmad al-Tayeb on Thursday as part of his visit to Egypt from Wednesday to Friday. On the sidelines of his meeting, the Portuguese president will take a tour of Al-Azhar Mosque, accompanied by al-Tayeb, to see its architectural and historic landmarks, particularly after its restoration. After his tour, he will give a lecture highlighting the relations between East and West, as well as the ways to enhance the values of coexistence and dialogue between different cultures and religions, referring to Portugal as a role model for coexistence among its community components. During his visit to Egypt, the Portuguese president will meet with President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, as well as Egyptian and Portuguese businessmen. Several economic and trade agreements are expected to be signed between Egypt and Portugal during the President de Sousa’s three-day visit, which started on Wednesday, April 11. According to a statement issued Wednesday by Egypt's State Information Service (SIS), President de Sousa is expected to meet with Sisi on Thursday. This is the first visit of a Portuguese president to Egypt in 24 years. De Sousa was elected president of Portugal in 2016. The SIS statement affirmed that this visit will be a great chance for both countries to enhance their economic, political, diplomatic and cultural cooperation. Egypt and Portugal are members of the intergovernmental organization Union for the Mediterranean, which includes 43 countries from Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Previously, Grand Imam al-Tayeb embarked on a tour on March 14 to visit Portugal and attend the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Islamic Society in Portugal. De Sousa praised the visit of Tayeb, stressing that he delivered a message of peace and tolerance. President Sisi, on the other hand, made an official visit to Portugal in December 2016, where he met President de Sousa, the prime minister and the mayor of Lisbon, along with representatives of a number of scientific and academic institutions and businessmen. The talks tackled the means of promoting political and diplomatic ties and boosting cooperation in the fields of economy, science, research and defense, along with regional and international issues, including the situation in the Middle East and ways to combat terrorism. Egypt has been looking into cooperation in military manufacturing with Portugal, as Egyptian Minister of State for Military Production Mohamed El-Assar discussed cooperation in the field of joint military and civil manufacturing with Portuguese Ambassador to Egypt Madalena Fischer in December 2017.

The International Finance Corporation's investments in Egypt reached nearly 1 billion dollars. Washington - Asharq Al-Awsat International Finance Corporation (IFC) announced Sunday that its investments to support Egypt’s private sector have amounted to nearly $1 billion during the current fiscal year. IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, indicated that Egypt's economic reforms affirmed its commitment to boost the Egyptian economy. IFC's Chief Business Officer Stephanie von Friedberg met Egypt's delegation headed by Minister of Investment and International Cooperation Sahar Nasr, to discuss ways to enhance private sector participation in economic development. Friedberg said Egypt implemented strong economic reforms that once again drew the interest of investors. “Reforms in the energy sector, in particular, helped attract a number of first-time investors and financiers to the country. Continuing reforms will help open up more sectors to private investment, which is vital to improve economic growth," she added. Egypt is one of IFC's largest investment portfolios in the Middle East and North Africa region, with investments of $2.9 billion from 2006 until 2017. IFC’s investments aim to support the private sector in the North African country, create jobs and promote economic growth. Investments include financial markets, infrastructure, oil and gas, agribusiness, manufacturing and healthcare. During 2018, IFC led a consortium to finance the construction of 13 solar power plants in Aswan worth $653 million. The corporation also provided a $100 million loan to help one of Egypt's leading banks to scale up the lending operations to customers and provided $150 million in Islamic financing to al-Marai, a dairy company, to help boost the country's food sector.

News article:
Cairo- Mohamed Abdu Hassanein Egypt’s government is looking forward to the World Bank's involvement in reconstruction efforts in the Sinai Peninsula, where the army is currently engaged in a fierce war to eliminate terrorist armed groups. The government is currently working on developing the Sinai Peninsula quickly, said International Investment and Investment Minister Sahar Nasr after meeting with World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim in Washington on Monday. In a statement on Monday, Nasr said that investing in humans is a top government priority. She also thanked the bank for supporting the strategy of developing education by 500 million dollars. The government is working on developing Sinai as soon as possible at the directives of President Sisi, Nasr added. Both sides discussed the bank's support to the sector of energy. A number of international financial institutions and Arab funds are working to support and finance Emaar’s Sinai project. The army launched an operation in February to crush terrorists who have waged an insurgency that has killed hundreds of soldiers, police and residents over many years. According to data released by military spokesmen since operations launched, clashes have killed at least 200 terrorists at least. Battles have also caused the death of over 30 soldiers, including officers, and wounded others. During spring WB meetings in Washington, President Kim lauded the success achieved in the Egyptian economy and laws passed for improving the investment environment. Kim said President Abdel Fattah El Sisi had courageously eliminated the challenges facing development in Egypt and set plans that contributed to the success of the Egyptian economy. The bank is working on investing in education, health and social protection to increase growth, Kim said. In December 2017, Sisi announced his intention to realize a $5.6 billion urban project in the Sinai Peninsula over the next two to three years. Sinai residents are suffering from living difficulties caused by the ongoing military operation, but the Egyptian government confirms that it covered the provision of food convoys and the distribution of large amounts of rations for citizens affected by the campaign.

Electricity pylons in northern England- REUTERS-Phil Noble CAIRO – 24 April 2018: Deputy Electricity Minister Osama Asran and First Undersecretary of the Ministry Mohammed Mossa Omran headed to Sudan on Monday to agree upon the terms of the electricity interconnection project between the two countries. An official source in the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy said that Asran is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with the energy officials in Sudan in preparation for signing contracts to start the project. The source pointed out that the capacity of the project will be 200-300 MW, according to the electricity needs of the Sudanese people, explaining that Egypt is able to complete the project within six months. Minister of Electricity Mohamed Shaker said earlier that Egypt is eager to support the African and Nile Basin countries’ needs of electricity in light of the higher capacity of Egypt’s national electricity network than the needs of Egyptians. Shaker added that Egypt is studying electricity interconnection with the African countries to benefit from the hydropower in Africa. The expected investment cost of the project in Egypt is $56 million (LE 990 million), Egyptian Electricity Transmission Co. (EETC) Chairman Gamal Abdel Rehem said, clarifying that Sudan will afford the cost of constructing electricity lines on its land. Abdel Rehem added that an interconnection between Egypt and Sudan will be the starting point for electrical linkage between Egypt and all Africa. Meanwhile, Egypt will sign the contracts of the electricity interconnection project with Saudi Arabia in June to start the implementation of the project. Electrical interconnection lines between Egypt and Saudi Arabia are scheduled to begin operation in the beginning of 2021, with a capacity of 3,000 MW. The Egyptian-Saudi project targets making Egypt a central hub for electricity among the Arab countries, aiming to establish an infrastructure for electricity trade between the Arab countries in preparation for the establishment of a common market for electricity. Egypt is already electrically interconnected with Jordon and Libya. Egypt signed a memorandum of understanding with Cyprus and Greece to interconnect electrically, which will make Egypt a central hub for electricity linkage between three continents. The electricity interconnection between Egypt and Jordon is currently working at capacities ranging between 400 and 450 MW. These capacities are currently being increased.

News article:
Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry is set to fly to South Sudan on Thursday to attend an opening session for a meeting by the South Sudan Liberation Movement's (SPLM) National Liberation Council, according to Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid. Shoukry will be attending the meeting on behalf of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi upon an invitation by the SPLM extended to “a limited number of African leaders who are guarantors of the Arusha accord for the movement's reunification.” The 12-page Arusha Accord, which was signed in Tanzania in January 2015 between representatives from three conflicting factions of the SPLM party, outlines key steps towards a reunification of the party. Abu Zeid said that the council’s invitation reflects the special relationship between Egypt and South Sudan, adding that the meeting, which will be held in Juba on 3-5 May, aims to support efforts to reunify the movement. The National Liberation Council is the second highest level in the SPLM after its political bureau, and consists of 170 members as representatives of different states in South Sudan, according to Abu Zeid. "The Egyptian participation comes in the framework of continued efforts to achieve peace and stability in South Sudan, as Egypt has voiced support for South Sudanese President Silva Kiir's initiative to establish a committee to facilitate the national dialogue," he added. Egypt has hosted talks on the course of implementing Arusha, sponsoring the discussions in correlation with Uganda. Last November, Egypt sponsored the signing of a declaration of unification between two factions of the SPLM at the headquarters of Egypt's intelligence agency in Cairo. The declaration, which supports peace efforts to end the dispute between the rival factions and stipulates the return of refugees displaced by conflict, was signed under the auspices of President El-Sisi and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman highlighted efforts by Egypt since 2005 to execute an integrated strategy to support development efforts since the inking of the Naivasha comprehensive peace agreement. Signed in 2005 by the SPLM and Sudan's government, Naivasha aimed to end the second Sudanese civil war through an immediate ceasefire between the SPLM and the government of Sudan. Egypt has provided aid to South Sudan, building four power stations and a number of schools and medical clinics, and has also provided aid in irrigation. This is the second visit to South Sudan by the Egyptian foreign minister in less than a month, as Shoukry recently visited Juba to sign a memo to establish a mechanism for political consultation. Shoukry's visit comes a few days after President El-Sisi received a phone call from his South Sudanese counterpart Kiir, where El-Sisi accentuated Egypt's support to South Sudan.

News article:
Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry is set to fly to South Sudan on Thursday to attend an opening session for a meeting by the South Sudan Liberation Movement's (SPLM) National Liberation Council, according to Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid. Shoukry will be attending the meeting on behalf of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi upon an invitation by the SPLM extended to “a limited number of African leaders who are guarantors of the Arusha accord for the movement's reunification.” The 12-page Arusha Accord, which was signed in Tanzania in January 2015 between representatives from three conflicting factions of the SPLM party, outlines key steps towards a reunification of the party. Abu Zeid said that the council’s invitation reflects the special relationship between Egypt and South Sudan, adding that the meeting, which will be held in Juba on 3-5 May, aims to support efforts to reunify the movement. The National Liberation Council is the second highest level in the SPLM after its political bureau, and consists of 170 members as representatives of different states in South Sudan, according to Abu Zeid. "The Egyptian participation comes in the framework of continued efforts to achieve peace and stability in South Sudan, as Egypt has voiced support for South Sudanese President Silva Kiir's initiative to establish a committee to facilitate the national dialogue," he added. Egypt has hosted talks on the course of implementing Arusha, sponsoring the discussions in correlation with Uganda. Last November, Egypt sponsored the signing of a declaration of unification between two factions of the SPLM at the headquarters of Egypt's intelligence agency in Cairo. The declaration, which supports peace efforts to end the dispute between the rival factions and stipulates the return of refugees displaced by conflict, was signed under the auspices of President El-Sisi and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman highlighted efforts by Egypt since 2005 to execute an integrated strategy to support development efforts since the inking of the Naivasha comprehensive peace agreement. Signed in 2005 by the SPLM and Sudan's government, Naivasha aimed to end the second Sudanese civil war through an immediate ceasefire between the SPLM and the government of Sudan. Egypt has provided aid to South Sudan, building four power stations and a number of schools and medical clinics, and has also provided aid in irrigation. This is the second visit to South Sudan by the Egyptian foreign minister in less than a month, as Shoukry recently visited Juba to sign a memo to establish a mechanism for political consultation. Shoukry's visit comes a few days after President El-Sisi received a phone call from his South Sudanese counterpart Kiir, where El-Sisi accentuated Egypt's support to South Sudan.

Egypt's state banks said they will start releasing this month the funds of clients who invested in high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) offered when the central bank floated the currency in late 2016. Egypt’s three state banks, Banque Misr, the National Bank of Egypt and Banque du Caire began offering 18-month CDs at 20 percent and three-year CDs at 16 percent in November 2016. The National Bank of Egypt will start to gradually return funds for 18-month CDs issued in November and December 2016, which are valued at EGP 188 billion, the bank’s deputy chairman Yehia Aboul Fotouh said on Saturday. The bank has raised a total of EGP 467 billion from the certificates, EGP 400 billion of which are from the 18-month CDs, Aboul Fotouh told satellite TV channel CBC. He said that more than a quarter of the money was raised from some 1.5 million new clients who joined the banking system for the first time. The bank is currently offering its clients three-year variable rate certificates of deposit at 17 percent, three-year fixed rate certificates at 15 percent and one-year certificates at 16.25. Banque Misr will return EGP 46 billion from the 18-month CDs issued in November 2016 to clients this month, the bank’s deputy head Atef Maghraby told Egyptian news website Al-Masry Al-Youm on Sunday. Maghraby said that alternatives offered by his bank include three-year fixed and variable rate certificates. The CDs are part of efforts to stabilise the Egyptian pound and attract clients who are keeping cash outside the banking system. Search Keywords: Short link:

Granite sphinx of Taharqo, 25th Dynasty from a temple at Kawa. Now residing in the British Museum, London via Wikimedia commons/ Jon Bodsworth CAIRO – 7 May 2018: Sudanese author Abdel Aal Hemat called on the Egyptian government to start teaching the Nubian language as part of its educational curriculum in schools, saying that this language is considered part of the historical heritage of the culture of Sudan and Egypt.“There is only one university in central Sudan that teaches the Nubian language; no other universities or schools teach it in all of Africa, which will affect the existence and significance of Nubian culture and history on the long term,” Hemat said in statements to media outlets on Monday.By 2020, some of the schools in North Sudan will start teaching this language as part of its educational curriculum, according to Hemat; however, he also wishes that Egypt takes a similar decision to protect the language, which has shaped a huge part of Egyptian and Sudanese history.He added that the Nubian language consists of 24 characters; each one needs at least four hours of good practice and learning to be perfectly understood and fluently spoken. “This language has a 5,000-year-old history. It’s one of the oldest languages ever spoken,” Hemat affirmed.Nubia currently is a region located between Aswan in southern Egypt and Khartoum in central Sudan. In the past, several old civilizations lived and thrived in this area, including the Kerma and Kush kingdoms, which were described by UNESCO as “great powers” that ruled Nubia.“Taharqa” was a Kush-Nubian pharaoh who ruled ancient Egypt as part of the 25th Dynasty and established several pillars inside the Karnak Temple complex, but only one pillar from his civilization has survived until now.Nubian people are trying to preserve their culture as much as possible by passing the language on to their children to prevent it from being lost; however, some Nubian people complain that there are no real measures being taken to preserve and guarantee the existence of this language.The Nubian language played a significant role during the 1973 October War as a secret code for the Egyptian army.

News article:
DP World, the world’s fourth-biggest ports operator, signed a preliminary agreement with Egypt’s Suez Canal Authority and the Egyptian government to jointly develop a new inland container depot near Cairo as part of efforts to spur the North African country’s economic growth. “Developing trade infrastructure to improve hinterland access for goods bound for Africa’s growing economic needs is essential,” said DP World group chairman and chief executive, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem. The Egyptian government is working to promote sustainable economic development for the country through a structural reform programme, funded in part through a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), awarded in 2016 when Egypt was grappling with a period of slow growth. The US-based lender projects stronger GDP growth for Egypt over the next two years in the context of the IMF-funded reforms, at 5.2 per cent in 2018 and 5.5 per cent in 2019. Under this week’s agreement, DP World, Egypt’s Holding Company for Maritime and Land Transport, and the Suez Canal Authority aim to develop the new container depot in Egypt’s 6th of October City, a satellite town in the Giza Governorate, part of the urban area of Cairo. ________________ Read more: [ IMF encourages Egypt to deepen economic reforms, pursue job creation ] [ Egypt seeks foreign investors for Red Sea projects as it targets pre-2011 tourism levels in 3 years ] [ Exclusive: DP World to maintain about $1bn capex for next three years ] ________________ The three partners, led by DP World, will bid for the government contract for the project later this year, the ports operator said on Monday. The proposed depot is intended to “increase the flow of cargo between ships and major land transportation networks in the country, creating a central distribution point”. The project – the result of a previous cooperation agreement between the three companies – will serve trade in Egypt by linking inland and marine ports, said Mohamed Ahmad Ibrahim Youssef, chairman of the Company of Maritime and Land Transport. “This partnership is aligned with Egypt’s strategy for sustainable development and the [government ministries’] policy to increase activities and investments of its companies in projects that raise developmental levels, create jobs for Egyptian youth and increase the profits of Egyptian companies to fuel local GDP,” the chairman said. UAE-based DP World already has a presence in Egypt – it has been operating the Sokhna Port for the past decade. Last year it signed a partnership agreement with the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) to form a joint venture company to develop a special economic free zone in Ain Sokhna. Under the agreement, SCZone is to hold 51 per cent of shares in the new vehicle and DP World the remaining 49 per cent.

Radi added, during his interview with TV host Tamer Amin on Al-Hayah satellite channel, that Museveni’s visit to Egypt comes within the framework of Egyptian-African relations, especially with countries of the Nile Basin. Ugandan President Museveni visited Egypt on Tuesday upon President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s invitation for a joint press conference that addressed countering terrorism, investment and establishing a new navigational course between African countries through the Nile River.

CAIRO – 9 May 2018: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) expects growth in Egypt to record 5.3 percent in 2018 and 5.5 percent in 2019, up from 4.3 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in 2017, with an increase of 0.8 percent.This came at the Bank’s new Regional Economic Prospects report that includes the predictions of the economic trends in 37 economies across three continents, from Estonia to Egypt and from Morocco to Mongolia.The report expected a growth rate of 3.3 percent in 2018 in all 37 countries to record 3.2 percent in 2019.“The economic momentum remained strong but that growth might now have peaked,” the report clarified.The EBRD’s Chief Economist, Sergei Guriev, said that the lower productivity growth reflected the fact that most EBRD economies had exhausted the growth levers that had delivered rapid expansion until the onset of the crisis.“In order to develop new sources of growth, these countries need to carry out structural reforms of product, capital and labour markets. They need to improve governance, promote integration into the global economy, and invest in human capital and sustainable infrastructure,” Guriev said.“The good news is that the current recovery provides a solid window of opportunity for such reforms,” he added.The bank depended on several risks to determine its forecasts, including: corporate debt levels, stock market levels, persistent security threats and geopolitical tensions as well as a high degree of concentration of sources of global growth.Planning Minister Hala el-Saeed said that Egypt’s growth rate pushed the government and international organizations to raise their expectations of the economic growth to 5.3 percent currently, up from 4.6 percent in 2017/2018 before implementing the reform program.Egypt had embarked on a bold economic reform program that included the introduction of taxes, such as the value-added tax (VAT), and cutting energy subsidies, all with the aim of trimming the budget deficit.The state floated its currency in November 2016; losing 50 percent of its value, as part of the economic reform program.She added that Egypt is targeting a growth rate of 5.8 percent, to be accelerated gradually to 8 percent by 2021/2022.HC Securities & Investment (HC) expects Egypt’s gross domestic product (GDP) to reach 5.3 percent in 2017/2018 and 6 percent in 2018/2019, reaching 6.2 percent in 2019/2020.The International Monetary Fund expected earlier that Egypt will record a GDP of 5.2 percent in the current fiscal year and to reach 5.5 percent next year, with an increase of 0.7 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.The IMF further anticipated the GDP to record 6 percent in 2023.The IMF’s executive board approved in November 2016 a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFT) loan to Egypt worth $12 billion to support its economic reform program.

Museveni’s two-day visit came on an invitation by Sisi and it aimed to discuss ways to promote bilateral relations, in line with Egypt’s keenness to coordinate and cooperate with its brotherly African countries in different fields. Trade Exchange between Egypt and Uganda increased 27 percent year-on-year to reach $66 million, Head of the Export Development Authority (EDA) Sherine el-Shorbagy said last week.

President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi during the celebration of Egyptian family at Cairo International Stadium Monday March 19, 2017 - Photo courtesy of YouTube CAIRO – 13 May 2018: The relations between Egypt and Sudan can be described as “Holy”, Sudanese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Information Ahmed Bilal Othman said in a press statement on Sunday. Othman said that the relation between the two countries is at its best as the communication channel is open between Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and his Sudanese counterpart, Omar Hassan al-Bashir. Othman asserted the importance of the Egyptian-Sudanese cooperation to confront terrorism, assuring that exchange of security information is one of the main areas of cooperation between the two countries. "Egypt has been fighting terrorism for a long time and it has gone a long way in combating terrorism," he added. The two Nile River neighbors, Egypt and Sudan, have common bonds of history, language and religion. But, diplomatic relations have been frosty over the past years due to various reasons. In March, Sisi received Sudanese President Bashir where they both discussed the most important issues of mutual interest, as based on the agreement reached at the recent Addis Ababa tripartite summit. “I firmly stress on the long-standing and close relationship between our brotherly countries, promoted by the historical ties and common aspirations,” said the Sudanese president. The one-day visit of the Sudanese president also focused on tackling cooperation across various fields, as well as issues of joint interest. Egyptian relations with Sudan were recently strained over the border area of Halaib and Shalatin. On December 23, 2017, Sudan filed a complaint to the United Nations Secretariat to protest a maritime border demarcation deal between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as the deal denotes the territory as Egyptian on maps. Halaib and Shalateen, or the Halaib Triangle, is an area of land measuring 20,580 square kilometers, located at the Egyptian-Sudanese border on the Red Sea coast. It is part of the Red Sea governorate and consists of three major towns – Halaib (which became a city in February 2014), Abu Ramad and Shalateen. The area belongs to Egypt politically and administratively, but has been one of the major sticking points in Egyptian-Sudanese relations since the demarcation of borders between the two countries were carried out during the British occupation of Egypt in 1899, at a time when Sudan was part of the Egyptian Kingdom. The issue re-emerged after Halaib and Shalateen declared electoral constituency in both Sudan and Egypt in 2014. Egypt affirmed that it has never concluded any international treaties or agreements, whether with the U.K. or Sudan, to give international status to the demarcation of administrative borders. The largest tribes that inhabit Hala'ib Triangle, including Rashaida, Alababdeh and Bashaira, rejected the Sudanese National Election Commission's decision that granted the people in Hala'ib the right to participate in Sudanese general elections. The three tribes asserted during the 6 October War victory celebration in 2009 that the area is 100 percent Egyptian.

Jerusalem – Guatemala will move its embassy to Jerusalem on May 16, two days after the United States moves its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The announcement of the date for the planned move came on Wednesday morning, in a post on Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat’s Facebook page. Barkat posted a photo of himself, meeting with Guatemala’s ambassador to Israel, Sarah Solis Castaneda, and CEO of the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry Maria Lucia Ramirez. He said that he met with the women to “discuss operations for the transfer of the embassy on 16 May to Jerusalem as per Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales.” Barkat concluded in his post: “I congratulate the president of Guatemala and the government of Guatemala for the brave decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem. I promised them as much as possible to allow a quick transfer of the embassy to Israel’s capital. I call for more countries to follow the U.S. and Guatemala and to move their embassy to Jerusalem!” Morales announced in May during the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, D.C., that Guatemala would move its embassy to Jerusalem for the second time. Guatemala was among the first nations to recognize Israel after it declared independence in 1948, and was the first country to establish an embassy in Jerusalem in 1959, before subsequently moving it.

News article:
Asunción – Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes pledged to relocate his country’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem at a special celebratory event in Asunción to mark Israel’s 70th anniversary. Cartes said that he would like the move to take place before he leaves office in mid-August. Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon tweeted about the statement under the heading “good news.” But he later said that it was still unclear if plans to relocate the embassy were in the works. Already in March Paraguay indicated that it would relocate its embassy if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to visit. Last September Netanyahu became the first sitting prime minister to visit Latin America, but he had not stopped in Paraguay. In December U.S. President Donald Trump made a dramatic shift in US policy toward Jerusalem when he stated that it was the capital of Israel and that he would move the country’s embassy there. The relocated embassy is expected to open in May. On Friday, Trump said that he may come to Israel for that event. “I may go. I am very proud of it. Jerusalem has been a subject that has been promised for many, many years by presidents. They all made campaign promises but they never had the courage to carry it out. I carried it out.” Guatemala is the only other country who definitely plans to follow through by opening its embassy in the capital in May just a day or two after the US. A few other countries have spoken of doing so, but final approvals for such a move have not been given. This includes Czech Republic, Romania, Honduras and Paraguay. The Czech Republic does intend to open an honorary consulate in Jerusalem but not an official embassy. The international community has largely opposed any declaration of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, including west Jerusalem which is located within the pre-1967 lines. Still initially some 24 countries had embassies in west Jerusalem. But they relocated them after the Knesset’s passage in 1980 of the Jerusalem Law, which formally annexed east Jerusalem. The European Union has been particularly opposed to relocation of any embassies to Jerusalem, holding that this is something that should happen only after a final status agreement is reached for a two-state resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Both the Czech Republic and Romania are European Union states. They would be breaking with EU foreign policy should they relocate their embassies. The Czech Foreign Ministry explained last week, that it did not believe such a step was contrary to EU policy. “This step in no way prejudges the final agreement concerning Jerusalem, the same way as it is not being prejudged by diplomatic representations of several European countries that are seated in East Jerusalem,” it said. “The Czech Republic fully respects common policy of the European Union, which considers Jerusalem as the future capital of both the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine.” According to WAFA, the Palestinian news agency, EU foreign policy chief Fedrica Mogherini has said that none of the EU member states will relocate their embassies.

Guatemala on Wednesday started to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, transferring furniture and other equipment into a yet-unfinished office in the capital’s Malha Technology Park. Earlier this week, the Guatemalan flag was raised outside the building. “I was moved to see the flag of Guatemala waving in Jerusalem in advance of the opening of the Guatemalan embassy later this month,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted. “Dear friends, welcome back to our eternal capital!” The Central American country’s president, Jimmy Morales, and foreign minister, Sandra Jovel, are scheduled to attend the embassy’s official opening on May 14. They will arrive in Israel a day earlier in order to attend a festive event at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem to celebrate the inaugurations of the new Guatemalan and US embassies. On Wednesday around noon, a hired worker was busy painting one of the rooms as Carlos Meyer, the Guatemalan embassy’s first secretary, arrived with an aide to coordinate the arrival of office chairs and other pieces of furniture.

Meyer, one of two Guatemalan diplomats stationed in Israel, has already moved to a new apartment in the capital’s Nahlaot neighborhood. The ambassador, Sara Solís Castañeda, is expected to commute to Jerusalem from her Herzliya residence until she finds a new home in the capital. Outside the building, four journalists from Guatemala were busy taking photographs of their country’s flag. Advertisement Israel celebrated the hoisting of the flag earlier this week on various social media channels, but neglected to point out that it was waving next to Old Glory as well as the flags of other countries — Great Britain, Austria and Denmark — that are unlikely to move their embassies to Jerusalem in the near future. Last month, Netanyahu promised that the first ten countries relocating their embassies to Jerusalem will receive “preferential treatment.” “We’ll help you!” he pledged during a speech for foreign diplomats at the President’s Residence. However, Guatemalan diplomats were said to have complained that they received less assistance than they had hoped for. Guatemala’s embassy did not respond to several requests for comment. The Foreign Ministry also declined to comment on whether it had provided any assistance to Guatemala in the relocation process. A spokesperson for the Jerusalem municipality told The Times of Israel, “The Jerusalem Municipality provided assistance and guidance as requested by the Guatemalan foreign mission throughout the entire process, which has been smooth and efficient. Advertisement “The Municipality is ready and willing to assist any country that chooses to stand on the side of truth and relocate their embassy to our eternal capital, Jerusalem.”

News article:
The Ambassador of Palestine to Uruguay Walid Abdel–Rahim told Sputnik, that recent decision of several Latin American countries to move their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is “illegal” and violates international law. “There is a UN resolution which calls on states not to open diplomatic missions in Jerusalem because, according to the international law, it is considered an occupied territory. Thus, having decided to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the country breaches the law. We cannot understand how a president or a country can take such a step,” – he stressed. This comes as a spokesman of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Emmanuel Nahshon, said in a statement that "Paraguay President Horacio Cartes plans to come to Israel by the end of the month to open an embassy in Jerusalem." However, this information contradicts an announcement made by Paraguay's foreign ministry, which stated that such a decision had not yet been made.

News article:
Asuncion – Paraguay’s Foreign Ministry confirmed on Wednesday that the country will shift its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, following the U.S. and Guatemala in a change long sought by Israel’s government but opposed by Palestinians. The ministry said in a statement that it “has begun the process” of carrying out the order by President Horacio Cartes. Israel’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said earlier this week that Cartes would attend the opening ceremony, which he said would occur by the end of May. However, the spokeswoman for Paraguay’s Foreign Ministry, Elvio Venega, said no date has been determined. The Paraguayan statements did not indicate if Cartes would go to Israel for the ceremony. The president, whose five-year term ends Aug. 15, is expected to resign within a few weeks so that he can be sworn into a seat to which he was elected in Paraguay’s Senate. The constitution forbids officials to hold two posts simultaneously. The U.S officially opens its embassy in Jerusalem on May 14 followed two days later by Guatemala. President Donald Trump overturned decades of U.S. policy last year by announcing the Jerusalem move. Israel claims the entire city as its eternal capital. Palestinians want east Jerusalem as their future capital and were infuriated by the declaration. Most countries maintain embassies in Tel Aviv and have balked at moving them until the international legal status of the city has been resolved. Cartes’ decision irked some within Paraguay as well. Luis Castiglioni, who has been designated as the future foreign minister by President-elect Mario Abdo Benitez, told the Mil radio station that “it would have been better to consult with the president-elect in this case, which could have geopolitical consequences.”

News article:
(JTA) — US President Donald Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital drew wide international criticism, with 128 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada voting in favor of a United Nations resolution condemning it. But several countries saw Trump’s decision in a different light: as an example to follow. Shortly after the United States officially moves its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday, it will be joined by Guatemala and Paraguay. Both countries are planning to make the move this month, and Honduras may be next: Its Congress recently passed a resolution urging its foreign ministry to move its embassy. Along with the Czech Republic, whose president said last month it will begin the process of moving its embassy to Jerusalem, these countries belong to a small club (albeit one with a superpower). On a visit to Venezuela on Monday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas urged other Latin American countries not to move their embassies. So how come? Why do these Latin American countries go where others fear to tread? Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Observers suggest a number of reasons, or a combination thereof: The countries are likely motivated by a desire to curry favor with the Trump administration, their leaders’ personal views of the Jewish state and strong historic ties to Israel. In the cases of Guatemala and Honduras, both countries are facing or recently faced political crises — Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales is mired in a corruption scandal and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez’s recent re-election was dogged by allegations of voter fraud. Their leaders are looking to the US for support, said Arie Kacowicz, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem specializing in Latin America. “They pretty much need and want support and legitimacy from the US and one way of achieving that is by being on friendly, cordial or even extraordinary terms with Israel,” he told JTA. “So if the U.S. is showing the way on this particular issue of Jerusalem, the natural candidates to follow would be those two Central American countries.” Advertisement Though the countries are looking to strengthen ties with Israel, that is not their primary focus, Kacowicz said. “For Guatemala and Honduras, the US is primordial. It’s much more important than Israel,” he said. The two countries also have large immigrant populations in the US that are facing threats of deportation. Those immigrants contribute to their home countries’ economies — for example, one-tenth of Guatemala’s gross domestic product comes from remittances sent back by Guatemalans living abroad. It makes sense to want to be on the Trump administration’s good side. Moving their embassies or expressing support for doing so “is a show of good will” to Trump and the US, agreed Mariano de Alba, associate director of the Adrianne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focusing on international affairs. The embassies of Guatemala, Paraguay and Honduras in Washington, DC, did not respond to requests for comment by JTA in time for publication. Trump has signaled that it cares about how other countries respond to its policies regarding Jerusalem. In December, the president said the US was watching the votes of its allies on the UN condemning his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. One hundred and twenty eight countries voted to pass the resolution with only nine — including Guatemala and Honduras — voting against it and 35 countries abstaining — including Paraguay. The resolution asserted the traditional position that “Jerusalem is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.” Advertisement Following the vote, UN ambassador Nikki Haley even threw a party for the 65 countries that did not support the resolution. The event was labeled as a means to thank the countries for “their friendship to the United States,” according to a copy of the invite obtained by CNN. But it’s not all about Trump. The three countries have ties to Israel that date back to its founding. Latin American countries were largely sympathetic to Israel in its early days, said Dina Siegel Vann, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Arthur and Rochelle Belfer Institute for Latino and Latin American Affairs. “Most Latin American countries are relatively young, and they were very much captivated by Israel’s story, a young country beating the odds after destruction in the Holocaust, and trying to make it in a very hostile environment,” Vann said. Guatemala and its UN ambassador Jorge Garcia Granados played a crucial role in the adoption of the UN partition plan for Palestine in 1947, which recommended creating a Jewish and an Arab state in pre-state Israel. In 1948, Guatemala became the first in Latin America to recognize Israel, setting off a domino effect in the region. Following Israel’s establishment, the country focused on achieving international recognition of Jerusalem as its capital, said Jonathan Grossman, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Israel Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. He has researched ties between Israel and Latin America. “Latin America was a major target in this struggle because they were mostly very friendly toward Israel,” Grossman said. The campaign was successful and some 11 Latin American countries opened up embassies in Jerusalem, starting with Guatemala in 1948. Advertisement But ties soured in 1967, following the Six-Day War, which drew wide international condemnation. Then in 1980, when the Knesset passed a law that declared the entire city of Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, all the Latin American countries as well as the Netherlands and Haiti, decided to move their embassies out of Jerusalem. Venezuela turned hostile under its late dictator, Hugo Chavez, and ties between Argentina and Israel have blown hot and cold since the the 1992 terrorist attack on Israel’s embassy in and the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish center, both in Buenos Aires. The last 15 years have once again seen improved ties between Israel and some Latin American countries, including Guatemala, Honduras and Paraguay, said Daniel Mariaschin, CEO of B’nai B’rith International, which has projects in Latin America. “The leadership in these countries in this past 15-year period has made the point of reaching out to Israel, as Israel has reached out to them,” Mariaschin said. In addition to trade interests, each of the countries’ leaders also have personal reasons for supporting Israel. Morales of Guatemala is an evangelical Christian, as is 40 percent of Guatemala’s population, and evangelicals have strong religious attachments to Israel. Paraguay’s president, Horacio Cartes, has close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and one of his campaign advisers, Ari Harow, is an Israeli-American who previously served as Netanyahu’s chief of staff. Hernandez of Honduras participated early in his career in an outreach program by Mashav, Israel’s Agency for International Development Cooperation. Grossman said that Trump’s decision opened the door for Latin American countries that have good relations with Israel to follow suit. Advertisement “This move kind of removes the barrier for many of those small countries who have excellent relations with Israel, very developed trade relations and security cooperation,” he said. Will the upcoming moves by Guatemala and Paraguay spark a trend? De Alba said it is “very highly unlikely” that a large number of Latin American countries will follow suit because such a move is seen as “too forceful.” “The position of the majority of the Latin American countries will be not to do so and try not to take sides on the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict,” he said. Meanwhile Mariaschin thinks the Latin American countries’ decisions may lead others to at least rethink their policies. “I think these moves will spur other countries to reconsider because there’s a critical mass which is assembling here, not only in Latin America but in other places as well.”

(JTA) — US President Donald Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital drew wide international criticism, with 128 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada voting in favor of a United Nations resolution condemning it. But several countries saw Trump’s decision in a different light: as an example to follow. Shortly after the United States officially moves its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday, it will be joined by Guatemala and Paraguay. Both countries are planning to make the move this month, and Honduras may be next: Its Congress recently passed a resolution urging its foreign ministry to move its embassy. Along with the Czech Republic, whose president said last month it will begin the process of moving its embassy to Jerusalem, these countries belong to a small club (albeit one with a superpower). On a visit to Venezuela on Monday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas urged other Latin American countries not to move their embassies. So how come? Why do these Latin American countries go where others fear to tread? Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Observers suggest a number of reasons, or a combination thereof: The countries are likely motivated by a desire to curry favor with the Trump administration, their leaders’ personal views of the Jewish state and strong historic ties to Israel. In the cases of Guatemala and Honduras, both countries are facing or recently faced political crises — Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales is mired in a corruption scandal and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez’s recent re-election was dogged by allegations of voter fraud. Their leaders are looking to the US for support, said Arie Kacowicz, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem specializing in Latin America. “They pretty much need and want support and legitimacy from the US and one way of achieving that is by being on friendly, cordial or even extraordinary terms with Israel,” he told JTA. “So if the U.S. is showing the way on this particular issue of Jerusalem, the natural candidates to follow would be those two Central American countries.” Advertisement Though the countries are looking to strengthen ties with Israel, that is not their primary focus, Kacowicz said. “For Guatemala and Honduras, the US is primordial. It’s much more important than Israel,” he said. The two countries also have large immigrant populations in the US that are facing threats of deportation. Those immigrants contribute to their home countries’ economies — for example, one-tenth of Guatemala’s gross domestic product comes from remittances sent back by Guatemalans living abroad. It makes sense to want to be on the Trump administration’s good side. Moving their embassies or expressing support for doing so “is a show of good will” to Trump and the US, agreed Mariano de Alba, associate director of the Adrianne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focusing on international affairs. The embassies of Guatemala, Paraguay and Honduras in Washington, DC, did not respond to requests for comment by JTA in time for publication. Trump has signaled that it cares about how other countries respond to its policies regarding Jerusalem. In December, the president said the US was watching the votes of its allies on the UN condemning his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. One hundred and twenty eight countries voted to pass the resolution with only nine — including Guatemala and Honduras — voting against it and 35 countries abstaining — including Paraguay. The resolution asserted the traditional position that “Jerusalem is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.” Advertisement Following the vote, UN ambassador Nikki Haley even threw a party for the 65 countries that did not support the resolution. The event was labeled as a means to thank the countries for “their friendship to the United States,” according to a copy of the invite obtained by CNN. But it’s not all about Trump. The three countries have ties to Israel that date back to its founding. Latin American countries were largely sympathetic to Israel in its early days, said Dina Siegel Vann, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Arthur and Rochelle Belfer Institute for Latino and Latin American Affairs. “Most Latin American countries are relatively young, and they were very much captivated by Israel’s story, a young country beating the odds after destruction in the Holocaust, and trying to make it in a very hostile environment,” Vann said. Guatemala and its UN ambassador Jorge Garcia Granados played a crucial role in the adoption of the UN partition plan for Palestine in 1947, which recommended creating a Jewish and an Arab state in pre-state Israel. In 1948, Guatemala became the first in Latin America to recognize Israel, setting off a domino effect in the region. Following Israel’s establishment, the country focused on achieving international recognition of Jerusalem as its capital, said Jonathan Grossman, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Israel Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. He has researched ties between Israel and Latin America. “Latin America was a major target in this struggle because they were mostly very friendly toward Israel,” Grossman said. The campaign was successful and some 11 Latin American countries opened up embassies in Jerusalem, starting with Guatemala in 1948. Advertisement But ties soured in 1967, following the Six-Day War, which drew wide international condemnation. Then in 1980, when the Knesset passed a law that declared the entire city of Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, all the Latin American countries as well as the Netherlands and Haiti, decided to move their embassies out of Jerusalem. Venezuela turned hostile under its late dictator, Hugo Chavez, and ties between Argentina and Israel have blown hot and cold since the the 1992 terrorist attack on Israel’s embassy in and the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish center, both in Buenos Aires. The last 15 years have once again seen improved ties between Israel and some Latin American countries, including Guatemala, Honduras and Paraguay, said Daniel Mariaschin, CEO of B’nai B’rith International, which has projects in Latin America. “The leadership in these countries in this past 15-year period has made the point of reaching out to Israel, as Israel has reached out to them,” Mariaschin said. In addition to trade interests, each of the countries’ leaders also have personal reasons for supporting Israel. Morales of Guatemala is an evangelical Christian, as is 40 percent of Guatemala’s population, and evangelicals have strong religious attachments to Israel. Paraguay’s president, Horacio Cartes, has close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and one of his campaign advisers, Ari Harow, is an Israeli-American who previously served as Netanyahu’s chief of staff. Hernandez of Honduras participated early in his career in an outreach program by Mashav, Israel’s Agency for International Development Cooperation. Grossman said that Trump’s decision opened the door for Latin American countries that have good relations with Israel to follow suit. Advertisement “This move kind of removes the barrier for many of those small countries who have excellent relations with Israel, very developed trade relations and security cooperation,” he said. Will the upcoming moves by Guatemala and Paraguay spark a trend? De Alba said it is “very highly unlikely” that a large number of Latin American countries will follow suit because such a move is seen as “too forceful.” “The position of the majority of the Latin American countries will be not to do so and try not to take sides on the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict,” he said. Meanwhile Mariaschin thinks the Latin American countries’ decisions may lead others to at least rethink their policies. “I think these moves will spur other countries to reconsider because there’s a critical mass which is assembling here, not only in Latin America but in other places as well.”

News article:
Following the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem this coming Monday, Guatemala is planning to make a similar move on Wednesday and open its own new embassy in Jerusalem’s Malha Technological Park. “Historically, we believe this is the right step and the right thing to do,” Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales told Israel Hayom in an exclusive interview. The embassy move comes on a particularly hectic week: In a downpour of diplomatic and security events, Israel will hold Jerusalem Day celebrations on Sunday, the Palestinians will commemorate “Nakba Day” on Monday (Nakba meaning “catastrophe” in Arabic, refers to the calamity that befell the Palestinians with the establishment of Israel), and Muslims will mark the start of Ramadan on Wednesday. Guatemala, a small and relatively little-known Central American country, indicated it would follow America’s lead just two days after U.S. President Donald Trump’s historic announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel last December. Ahead of a historic state visit to Israel, Morales revealed what prompted his decision: “When I heard that President Trump decided to sign and approve the transfer of the embassy, I said to myself that that’s a brave step.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “Of course, then the usual problems began … There was opposition in the United Nations and many people did not like it, but we said that we believe this is how it should be. So we also declared our intention to bring our embassy back to Jerusalem. It is important to note this word choice, ‘bring back,’ as our first embassy, which opened after the founding of the State of Israel, was in Jerusalem.” Q: Correct. About 40 years ago, Guatemala’s former President Eugenio Garcia transferred the Guatemalan Embassy to Tel Aviv. In hindsight, do you believe that this move was a mistake? A: These are presidential decisions, and many people would judge each and every one. This was the presidential decision then, and now we are coming to another presidential decision. Q: When I interviewed President Donald Trump in the White House after his first year in office, I asked him what he felt was the highlight of his presidency, and he answered without hesitating: “Having Jerusalem be your great capital.” What would you describe as the highlight of your term? A: One of the biggest highlights, without a doubt, is bringing back our embassy to Jerusalem. Besides that, we have historical matters, such as the territorial conflict we have with Belize, which is a problem we have had for over 200 years. Recently we conducted a referendum to decide whether to submit this matter to an international court. I believe that these are the biggest decisions I made as president. Q: Following up on this historic decision, did you speak about this subject with other Latin American countries? A: Yes, there are many conversations being held on the subject and much curiosity on the part of other leaders. I understood that a lot of leaders are considering similar moves, and I assume that some of them will declare similar moves soon, but I must keep the conversations confidential. Q: You returned recently from Costa Rica. Is Costa Rica next to relocate its embassy? We’ll keep it between us … A: I don’t know. This is relatively new, I don’t know how he [Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado] will move forward on this matter. I do know that our people are pleased with our decision to go from talk to action. That is what history judges. Q: Everything has a price. Israelis are pleased, but the Palestinians less so, as are some other countries. Since arriving at this decision, have there been repercussions? A: Decisions always come with a price. We support our allies and we support the countries that we view as our friends—as our brothers in many ways. It is customary to say, “Always love your friends,” so when Israel needs us more than ever, like now, we show up. The Republic of Guatemala—five times the size of Israel with a population that numbers some 16 million people—is considered a small country on a global scale. But it had a big hand in the historical U.N. vote to establish the State of Israel 70 years ago. Guatemala’s ambassador to the U.N. at the time worked to enlist the support of Latin American states for the partition plan. Out of 17 states within the bloc, 11 voted in favor and none opposed. Q: Israel and Guatemala are very far from one another geographically, but are close in their political positions. How do you explain this? A: Our countries are very close at heart, and we have between us a connection of thought, like with other countries. The U.S., Israel and Guatemala, we all love freedom. I believe that Guatemala has strong roots in accepting the Jewish people. It has a lot to do with faith. Here, more than 93 percent of the citizens are Christian—49 percent are Catholic and 45 percent are evangelical. Our passion for religion comes with great appreciation and admiration for peoples like the people of Israel. If we talk about historical matters or right decisions we must remember that in 1947, Guatemala voted in favor of the State of Israel in its struggle over its founding and since then we have maintained very warm relations—political, diplomatic, cultural and economic. Today, even though many political commentators criticize our decision on the embassy as wrong, the vast majority of our people are pleased that this is happening. This will provide the two countries with motivation to strengthen the ties between them. Q: After your current move, can Israel expect Guatemala to vote in international organizations, such as the U.N., alongside the U.S. and Israel? A: We gave support unequivocally in this matter, and we will continue doing so on every vote on the matter. Clearly we will consider every vote in and of itself, because we are responsible. As president of Guatemala, my biggest responsibility is to Guatemala and the principle that guides me is to do what is right for us. The decision to bring our embassy back to Jerusalem is the right step, and it also will strengthen our international standing and our relationship and ties with Israeli. Q: Ahead of your visit to the region there is a threat of bombs and rockets. The situation with Syria and Iran is not at all quiet, to put it mildly. A: I know that the situation is not simple at the moment, but I hope that everything will be all right soon. James Ernesto Morales Cabrera, 49 years old, legally changed his name to Jimmy Morales in 2011, at the peak of his career as a successful comedian in a popular Guatemalan television series. That year, he also crossed the lines and entered politics with a run for municipal elections and, only four years later, in October 2015, was elected in a landslide victory of 73 percent to become the 37th president of Guatemala. Q: When you won the 2015 election, you were not the leading candidate and this was a surprise to many people. You come from the outside, from the world of television and comedy. Meanwhile, leaders like Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and 31-year-old Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz have been elected. In your opinion, what is going on in the world now that people have gotten fed up by politicians and now want a new kind of leader? How would you explain this phenomenon? A: Apparently, the modern world needs new figures who can do things differently than the politicians who came before them. The proof is that presidential decisions are different than what previous presidents have decided. I think that the wishes of the different peoples were translated into different decisions and actions than what we are used to, and they will be judged by history.

Morales' visit comes amid violent protests in the Gaza Strip triggered by the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, when Israel celebrated its 70th anniversary. Over 60 protestors, including several children, were killed and more than 2,700 others were injured in clashes with Israeli forces. The latter has blamed the Hamas Palestinian militant group for the erupted violence by organizing provocations. The militants, in their turn, have sent indirect messages to Israel hinting that it can tone down the massive Gaza protests which are expected to be further galvanized on Tuesday. According to the latest IDF report, at least 24 people, whose involvement in terrorism-related activities has been documented, were killed on Monday by Israeli servicemen. "IDF and ISA [Israel Securities Authority] inquiries reveal that at least 24 terrorists with documented terror backgrounds were killed during the violent riots along the Gaza border on Monday. Most were active Hamas terror organization operatives, and some were active operatives of Palestinian Islamic Jihad," the IDF said on its Twitter account. Yesterday afternoon, the IDF received intelligence that Hamas operatives were preparing to cross through the security fence from northern Gaza. IDF special forces arrived at the scene, & 8 armed terrorists hurled pipe bombs & grenades at the soldiers & the security fence. pic.twitter.com/8G73DjEvZl — IDF (@IDFSpokesperson) May 15, 2018 ​READ MORE: WATCH Palestinian Protesters Rally in Gaza, Bethlehem During Nakba Day Israel considers Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern districts of the city, which the Israelis seized from Jordan during the Six-Day War in 1967.

News article:
Jerusalem – Guatemala festively opened its new embassy in Jerusalem on Wednesday, becoming the second country to do so after the United States, and giving Israel a diplomatic boost as it faces international criticism for the deadly violence on the Gaza border. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales dedicated the embassy just two days after a high-powered American delegation also marked the transfer of its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was fitting since Guatemala also followed the U.S. to be the second country to recognize Israel 70 years ago. “You were always among the first,” he said at the ceremony. “We remember our friends and Guatemala is our friend, then and now.” President Donald Trump announced his decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the American embassy there, triggering a joyous reaction from Netanyahu’s government. Israel has always claimed Jerusalem as its capital yet most countries opted to place their embassies in coastal Tel Aviv because of the holy city’s contested status. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and view the relocation of the embassy as a one-sided move that invalidates the U.S. as a Mideast peace broker. The embassy move added fuel to the weekly Palestinian protests in Gaza demanding the right of return to Israel and the lifting of a decade-old naval blockade. They culminated Monday when Israel killed nearly 60 Palestinians in clashes along the border. The Gaza protesters set tires ablaze, sending up thick plumes of black smoke, and hurled firebombs and stones toward Israeli troops across the border. The Israeli military, which has come under international criticism for firing on unarmed protesters, said Hamas militants tried to carry out bombing and shooting attacks under the cover of the protests and released video of protesters ripping away parts of the barbed-wire border fence. The military said 14 of those killed Monday were actively involved in carrying out attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel did everything it could to prevent civilian casualties but that Gaza’s Hamas rulers were to blame for using them as human shields. “The Hamas leadership is a group of cannibals who treat their children as armament,” he said during a visit to a military base in southern Israel. “They have rocket armament, personal armament and another kind of armament — their children and women.” Since the Hamas-led protests began on March 30, more than 110 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,500 wounded by live fire, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say the vast majority of the casualties have been unarmed protesters. The heavy death toll Monday, along with hundreds of wounded, made it by far the bloodiest day of cross-border violence since a devastating 2014 war between Israel and Hamas. It also triggered a diplomatic backlash against Israel. The U.N. Security Council held a special session that began with a moment of silence for the Palestinians who were killed. In Geneva, the U.N. human rights office said Israel has repeatedly violated international norms by using deadly live fire to repel protesters. Turkey expelled Israel’s ambassador and consul general and several European countries summoned the Israeli ambassadors to their foreign ministries for questioning and called for an international investigation. The diplomatic spat with Turkey intensifed after what Israel called the humiliating treatment of its ambassador, who was subjected to a severe security screening upon his departure from the airport in Istanbul. The event was intentionally captured by Turkish media. In response, Israel has summoned a top Turkish diplomat to be reprimanded. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long been a fierce critic of Israel and dramatically ratcheted up his rhetoric this week over Gaza and the U.S. embassy move. Netanyahu retorted that a “man whose hands are drenched in the blood of countless Kurdish civilians in Turkey and Syria is the last one who can preach to us about military ethics.” At the same time, Israel has found other nations following the U.S. lead and rallying to its defense. Besides Guatemala, Paraguay says it will also relocate its embassy to Jerusalem and Romania, the Czech Republic and Honduras have said they are considering doing the same. At Wednesday’s ceremony, Morales said his country was bringing a message of “love, peace and fraternity” to Israel. The Guatemalan Congress recently passed a law marking May 14 as “Israel-Guatemala Friendship Day.” Marking the move, the Jerusalem municipality illuminated the walls of the Old City walls late Tuesday with flags of Guatemala, Israel and the United States and a message thanking Morales.

News article:
JERUSALEM (JTA) — Guatemala inaugurated its embassy in Jerusalem, the second country to move its main diplomatic mission from Tel Aviv. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales attended the opening Wednesday morning of the embassy in the Technological Park of southern Jerusalem’s Malha neighborhood. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Morales and his delegation in Spanish with “Buenas Dias,” which means good day in Spanish, before switching to English. “This is the beginning of something extraordinary, or I would say, the re-beginning of something extraordinary, which is the relationship between Guatemala and Israel,” he said. Netanyahu noted that Guatemala was the second country behind the United States to recognize Israel’s independence after the partition vote in the United Nations. The United States opened its Jerusalem embassy in the southern Jerusalem’s Arnona neighborhood on Monday. Netanyahu told Morales that he would visit Guatemala on his next trip to Latin America. Guatemala previously had an embassy in Jerusalem, the first country in the world to open an embassy in the city in 1956. It closed in 1980 following a United Nations Security Council resolution that called for such closures. Before the ceremony, Netanyahu and Morales held a private meeting. They were scheduled to meet after the ceremony with their entourages. Paraguay is scheduled to open a Jerusalem embassy on May 21 with its president, Horacio Cartes, due to be in attendance.

News article:
Earlier it was reported that Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales arrived in Israel amid violent protests in the Gaza Strip triggered by the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem. Over 60 people, including several children, were killed and more than 2,700 others were injured in clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli forces. Israel considers Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern districts of the city, which the Israelis seized from Jordan during the Six-Day War in 1967. The international community does not recognize the annexation of East Jerusalem and believes that the status of the city should be determined based on an agreement with the Palestinians, which claim the eastern part of Jerusalem.

News article:
Israeli security forces stand guard outside the US consulate in Jerusalem. AFP Tel Aviv - Asharq Al-Awsat Paraguay's Foreign Minister Eladio Loizaga Caballero has said that his country will open the country's new embassy to Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday, following similar steps by the United States and Guatemala. But the minister denied that the embassy opening was linked to the US and Guatemalan decision to inaugurate their missions in Jerusalem. He told the Israeli media on Thursday that the decision on the embassy move was taken for “technical reasons” eight months ago. The Paraguayan decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem does not stop the country from having “strong and close relations” with the Palestinians, the minister insisted. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said that all embassies in Tel Aviv would move to Jerusalem within the coming years. She thanked the US administration for “exerting strong efforts to convince our friends in several countries to move their embassies to Jerusalem because it knows its importance for Israel.” In December, US President Donald Trump sparked global controversy by announcing that the United States would move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

News article:
Jerusalem – Paraguay opened its new embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, following in the footsteps of the United States and Guatemala. President Horacio Cartes dedicated the embassy, making Paraguay the third country to transfer its diplomatic mission in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Romania, the Czech Republic and Honduras have said they are also considering doing the same. President Donald Trump’s announcement on Jerusalem in December was welcomed by the Israeli government. But it infuriated the Palestinians, who claim Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem as their future capital. The U.S. Embassy move added fuel to the weekly Palestinian protests in Gaza demanding the right of return to Israel and the lifting of a decade-old naval blockade. The protests culminated last Monday, when Israeli forces killed nearly 60 Palestinians in clashes along the border. The heavy death toll triggered a diplomatic backlash, with Turkey expelling Israel’s ambassador and consul general and several European countries summoning the Israeli ambassadors to their foreign ministries for questioning. But the U.S. Embassy move has also sparked others to rally in support of Israel. The entrance to Jerusalem was lined with the flags of Paraguay on Wednesday and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the ceremony that he was there to “salute” a great friend. The opening of the embassy was “a great day for Israel, a great day for Paraguay, a great day for our friendship,” Netanyahu said.

GUATEMALA CITY — United States casino magnate Sheldon Adelson provided Guatemala’s official delegation a Boeing 767 to travel to Israel for the relocation of its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a Guatemalan government official said Friday. Guatemalan foreign minister Sandra Jovel said Adelson provided the plane last week to carry government officials and guests, including religious leaders. Jovel made the comments on radio show ConCriterio, ending days of speculation in Guatemala about who paid for the trip. Manfredo Marroquin, director of civil society organization Citizen Action, said President Jimmy Morales’s administration violated Guatemalan law, which forbids accepting such gifts. Guatemala’s human rights prosecutor, Jordan Rodas, also said the arrangement with Adelson was concerning.

News article:
An Alexandria military court issued on Tuesday preliminary death sentences against 36 people convicted of involvement in deadly bombings on two Egyptian churches in Alexandria and Tanta in April 2017. The case involves 48 defendants, 31 of whom are in custody and 17 are fugitives. The court has referred the case to the country's Grand Mufti for his non-binding opinion on the death sentence as per Egyptian law. The verdict is subject to appeal. According to the prosecution, a number of the defendants formed an illegal group that calls for the suspension of the law and the constitution, the obstruction of state institutions from carrying out their duties, and assaulting the personal freedom of citizens. The prosecution charged three of the defendants with training a number of the group’s members in manufacturing explosives, using weaponry, and combat tactics at training camps. The defendants were convicted of a number of terrorist attacks against civilians and policemen in 2016 and 2017. In April 2017, suicide bombers attacked St George's Church in Tanta and St Mark's Cathedral in Alexandria on Palm Sunday, killing 46 people and injuring dozens. Both attacks were claimed by the Daesh terrorist group. One day after the April attacks, the interior ministry said that police had killed seven members of a terrorist cell involved in the bombings in a shootout in Upper Egypt's Assiut governorate. A three-month state of emergency – which has since been renewed every three months – was declared by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi on the day of the church attacks. The defendants were also charged with participating in a January 2017 attack on a security checkpoint in Egypt’s New Valley governorate near the Western Desert, killing eight policemen. The attack on the Naqb checkpoint took place some 80 kilometres away from the provincial capital of Al-Kharga, and more than 600 kilometres southwest of Cairo. Search Keywords: Short link:

People look at the damage caused by the bomb in front of a church in Alexandria, Egypt in April 2017. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s military criminal court referred on Tuesday the cases of 36 members of the ISIS terrorist group to the Grand Mufti after they were sentenced to death for attacks against churches in the country. The defendants are suspected of involvement in bombings that hit three Coptic churches - one at Cairo’s Coptic Cathedral in December 2016 that killed at least 25, and two that hit churches in Alexandria and Tanta on the same day in April 2017 and killed more than 45 people. Egypt requires that courts refer cases to the Grand Mufti for consideration of the death penalty ahead of a final verdict although his decision is non-binding. The court will issue a final verdict on May 15. Eleven of the 36 are being tried in absentia, a lawyer involved in the case told Reuters. Public prosecutor Nabil Sadek said previously that some of the suspects held leadership positions in ISIS and formed cells in Cairo and the southern province of Qena to carry out the church attacks. Some of the defendants are also accused of carrying out an attack on a checkpoint in Egypt’s Western Desert that killed at least eight policemen in 2017.

Egypt's former anti-corruption chief Hisham Geneina speaks with AFP in Cairo on June 23, 2016 Egyptian former anti-corruption chief Hisham Geneina will face military trial after saying a presidential candidate he supported had documents damning to state officials, his lawyer said on Thursday. The military had detained Geneina in February following his remarks in an interview with Huffpost Arabi, the Arabic version of the US news site. He will stand trial on April 16 on charges of "spreading news that harms the armed forces," his lawyer Ali Taha said. Geneina had been a top campaign aide to Sami Anan, whom the military also detained after he announced he would stand in last month's presidential election against incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who won overwhelmingly. Geneina had said the documents Anan allegedly possessed "revolve around political events and crises Egyptian society has passed through" since the January 2011 uprising which toppled veteran strongman Hosni Mubarak. He said they were held at a "secure" place abroad and could be released if Anan is harmed. Moataz Wadnan, the journalist who conducted the interview, has also been arrested.

Former Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie - Photo by: Kareem abdelAziz/Egypt Today CAIRO – 13 April 2018: Egypt’s Court of Cassation will hand down on Saturday its unchallenged ruling on the retrial of former Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie over charges of inciting violence in the “Rabaa operation room case”. Badie, along with 17 other defendants, have appealed against court verdicts ranging from life imprisonment to five years in jail. The defendants were charged of orchestrating a plan to spread chaos and violence across Egypt following the dispersal of the 2013 Rabaa and Nahda sit-ins. On May 8, 2017, the Giza Criminal Court sentenced Badie and two other defendants to life imprisonment (25 years). Meanwhile, 15 other defendants were sentenced to five years in prison each, and 21 others were acquitted. The 18 convicts have challenged the Giza Court’s ruling before the Court of Cassation. The defendants were charged with setting up an operations room to direct the movement and actions of the Brotherhood’s members in the streets after the August 2013 dispersal, and ordering the arson of churches and public properties. Badie, 74, was the eighth leader of the banned Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organization. He became leader of the organization in 2010 after the death of his predecessor, Madi Akef. He was arrested on August 19, 2013 as part of a nation-wide crackdown on Brotherhood leaders in the wake of increasing violence and protests after two Brotherhood sit-ins were forcefully dispersed on August 14, 2013. Badie was found guilty in the trial of “cutting-off Qalyoub Road”, in which 36 others were also convicted in October 2016. He is still being tried in 11 known cases, mainly over charges of “inciting violence.” However, he stated in a hearing over charges of inciting violence in Minya that he is facing 48 trials, Masrawy reported on February 28. Arab Police Station Case On May, 9 2017, the Court of Cassation revoked verdicts ranging from 10 years in prison to life against Badie and 49 co-defendants over charges of inciting violence in August 2013. The court accepted only 50 defendants’ appeals against charges of inciting violence outside the Al-Arab police station in the coastal city of Port Said; the court ordered a retrial. In August 2015, the Port Said Criminal Court handed down sentences of 25 years in prison against 95 Brotherhood leaders (19 in absentia and 76 fugitives), and 10 years in prison against 28 others; in the same trial, a total of 68 other defendants were acquitted of the charges. Espionage for Hamas Badie and former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, with 20 co-defendants, are being retried over charges of “spying” for Palestine’s Gaza-based Hamas movement. According to the prosecution, the defendants are charged with “leaking classified information” to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Hamas and Hezbollah about national security and the Armed Forces. In the first trial, Badie was sentenced to life imprisonment, while Brotherhood leader Khairat al-Shater and two others were sentenced to death. Rabaa Dispersal Case The Criminal Court of Cairo is considering another case that is publicly known as the “Rabaa sit-in dispersal case”, in which Badie is being charged with “staging an armed gathering in Rabaa Square, illegally possessing and handling weapons, blocking driveways, and deliberately vandalizing public property, along with other counts relating to murdering policemen and citizens.” Prison Break He and 27 co-defendants are being tried in the case of breaking into Egyptian prisons, known as the break-in of the eastern border in 2011. The retrial of the defendants came after the Court of Cassation overturned in November the sentences issued by the Criminal Court to execute Morsi, Badie, his deputy Rashad al-Bayoumi, Morsi's adviser Mohye Hamed, former Parliament Speaker Mohamed el-Katatny and leading MB figure Essam el-Erian, and to punish 20 other defendants with life imprisonment. Guidance Bureau Incidents Badie and 12 other defendants are being retried by the Cairo Criminal Court over charges of inciting murder against peaceful demonstrators outside the MB Guidance Bureau in Moqattam, Cairo in 2013. In February 2015, Badie and Shater were sentenced to life imprisonment, while four others were handed down death verdicts. In January 2016, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts and ordered the retrial. Al-Bahr Al-Azam Case On May 27, the Cairo Criminal Court will issue its ruling in the “al-Bahr al-Azam case”, in which Badie and 13 other Brotherhood members are being retried. In September 2014, the defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment over charges of “inciting clashes” in al-Bahr al-Azam district, Giza, causing death of five people. However, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts on November 8, 2015. Istiqama Mosque Following the ouster of former President Morsi on July 3, 2013, pro-Muslim Brotherhood protests calling for his reinstatement clashed with security forces and residents outside Istiqama Mosque in Giza. Badie and 13 co-defendants were charged with killing 10 and attempting to murder 20 others in the clashes. On August 30, 2014, Badie and seven others were sentenced to life imprisonment, while six others were sentenced to death. The rulings were also overturned and a retrial was ordered. El Idwa Incidents Following the Rabaa sit-in dispersal on August 14, 2013, the city of El Idwa in Minya governorate witnessed acts of violence and vandalism, during which a police station was attacked and a police officer was killed. Badie is being charged over inciting violence in the clashes. The prosecution showed a violence-inciting statement signed by him. However, Badie has denied the charges. The case also includes 682 co-defendants. They are also charged with storming a number of state-owned institutions, such as the agriculture unit, veterinary center and the real estate office in the city. In April 2014, the Minya Criminal Court sentenced all defendants to death. However, a retrial was ordered after overturning the ruling by the Court of Cassation. Ismailia Incidents A total of 105 defendants, including Badie, are being tried in the “Ismailia incidents case”. They face charges of inciting violence, and killing and injuring people in clashes between pro-Muslim Brotherhood supporters and security forces outside the Brotherhood office in Ismailia in July 2014. Badie and 35 co-defendants were handed down life imprisonment sentences in May 2016. However, a retrial was ordered. Suez Incidents Badie and Brotherhood members Mohamed El-Beltagy and Safwat Hegazy were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a military court in December 2015 over charges of inciting riots. Following the Rabaa dispersal, clashes erupted between the protesters and security forces, killing five people. In 2015, the court also sentenced a total of 90 co-defendants to life imprisonment in absentia and acquitted 50 others. The appeal submitted by Badie against the ruling was accepted and a retrial was ordered. Beni Suef Incidents The Beni Suef Criminal Court is considering a retrial against Badie and 92 other defendants over charges of “setting fire” to state institutions, including a police station, a school and a prosecution building, following the dispersal of the Rabaa sit-in.

Badie, 74, was the eighth leader of the banned Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organization. He became leader of the organization in 2010 after the death of his predecessor, Madi Akef. He was arrested on August 19, 2013 as part of a nation-wide crackdown on Brotherhood leaders in the wake of increasing violence and protests after two Brotherhood sit-ins were forcefully dispersed on August 14, 2013. Badie was found guilty in the trial of “cutting-off Qalyoub Road”, in which 36 others were also convicted in October 2016. He is still being tried in 11 known cases, mainly over charges of “inciting violence.” However, he stated in a hearing over charges of inciting violence in Minya that he is facing 48 trials, Masrawy reported on February 28. Arab Police Station Case On May, 9 2017, the Court of Cassation revoked verdicts ranging from 10 years in prison to life against Badie and 49 co-defendants over charges of inciting violence in August 2013. The court accepted only 50 defendants’ appeals against charges of inciting violence outside the Al-Arab police station in the coastal city of Port Said; the court ordered a retrial. In August 2015, the Port Said Criminal Court handed down sentences of 25 years in prison against 95 Brotherhood leaders (19 in absentia and 76 fugitives), and 10 years in prison against 28 others; in the same trial, a total of 68 other defendants were acquitted of the charges. Espionage for Hamas Badie and former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, with 20 co-defendants, are being retried over charges of “spying” for Palestine’s Gaza-based Hamas movement. According to the prosecution, the defendants are charged with “leaking classified information” to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Hamas and Hezbollah about national security and the Armed Forces. In the first trial, Badie was sentenced to life imprisonment, while Brotherhood leader Khairat al-Shater and two others were sentenced to death. Rabaa Dispersal Case The Criminal Court of Cairo is considering another case that is publicly known as the “Rabaa sit-in dispersal case”, in which Badie is being charged with “staging an armed gathering in Rabaa Square, illegally possessing and handling weapons, blocking driveways, and deliberately vandalizing public property, along with other counts relating to murdering policemen and citizens.” Prison Break He and 27 co-defendants are being tried in the case of breaking into Egyptian prisons, known as the break-in of the eastern border in 2011. The retrial of the defendants came after the Court of Cassation overturned in November the sentences issued by the Criminal Court to execute Morsi, Badie, his deputy Rashad al-Bayoumi, Morsi's adviser Mohye Hamed, former Parliament Speaker Mohamed el-Katatny and leading MB figure Essam el-Erian, and to punish 20 other defendants with life imprisonment. Guidance Bureau Incidents Badie and 12 other defendants are being retried by the Cairo Criminal Court over charges of inciting murder against peaceful demonstrators outside the MB Guidance Bureau in Moqattam, Cairo in 2013. In February 2015, Badie and Shater were sentenced to life imprisonment, while four others were handed down death verdicts. In January 2016, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts and ordered the retrial. Al-Bahr Al-Azam Case On May 27, the Cairo Criminal Court will issue its ruling in the “al-Bahr al-Azam case”, in which Badie and 13 other Brotherhood members are being retried. In September 2014, the defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment over charges of “inciting clashes” in al-Bahr al-Azam district, Giza, causing death of five people. However, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts on November 8, 2015. Istiqama Mosque Following the ouster of former President Morsi on July 3, 2013, pro-Muslim Brotherhood protests calling for his reinstatement clashed with security forces and residents outside Istiqama Mosque in Giza. Badie and 13 co-defendants were charged with killing 10 and attempting to murder 20 others in the clashes. On August 30, 2014, Badie and seven others were sentenced to life imprisonment, while six others were sentenced to death. The rulings were also overturned and a retrial was ordered. El Idwa Incidents Following the Rabaa sit-in dispersal on August 14, 2013, the city of El Idwa in Minya governorate witnessed acts of violence and vandalism, during which a police station was attacked and a police officer was killed. Badie is being charged over inciting violence in the clashes. The prosecution showed a violence-inciting statement signed by him. However, Badie has denied the charges. The case also includes 682 co-defendants. They are also charged with storming a number of state-owned institutions, such as the agriculture unit, veterinary center and the real estate office in the city. In April 2014, the Minya Criminal Court sentenced all defendants to death. However, a retrial was ordered after overturning the ruling by the Court of Cassation. Ismailia Incidents A total of 105 defendants, including Badie, are being tried in the “Ismailia incidents case”. They face charges of inciting violence, and killing and injuring people in clashes between pro-Muslim Brotherhood supporters and security forces outside the Brotherhood office in Ismailia in July 2014. Badie and 35 co-defendants were handed down life imprisonment sentences in May 2016. However, a retrial was ordered. Suez Incidents Badie and Brotherhood members Mohamed El-Beltagy and Safwat Hegazy were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a military court in December 2015 over charges of inciting riots. Following the Rabaa dispersal, clashes erupted between the protesters and security forces, killing five people. In 2015, the court also sentenced a total of 90 co-defendants to life imprisonment in absentia and acquitted 50 others. The appeal submitted by Badie against the ruling was accepted and a retrial was ordered. Beni Suef Incidents The Beni Suef Criminal Court is considering a retrial against Badie and 92 other defendants over charges of “setting fire” to state institutions, including a police station, a school and a prosecution building, following the dispersal of the Rabaa sit-in.

CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian top court on Tuesday removed 31 members and supporters of the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group from the terrorist list over a case related to the deadly protests in 2014. The Court of Cassation removed the 31 Brotherhood loyalists from the terror list over charges of involvement in the violent protests in Cairo's Ain Shams district in early 2014 that left three citizens dead, including a female journalist, a Christian woman and a child, the official MENA news agency reported. The 2014 protests erupted after then army chief Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, now the newly reelected president, announced running for president a year after he ousted former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the same case, Cairo Criminal Court sentenced in February 17 defendants to 25 years in jail, nine to 15 years, four to 10 years and two to seven years while acquitting 15 of the charges of committing acts of violence. Since Morsi's ouster in early July 2013, Egypt has been facing a wave of terror attacks that have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, as well as civilians. A Sinai-based militant group affiliated with the regional terror group Islamic State has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces have killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by Sisi following Morsi's ouster.

CAIRO (Reuters) - A Cairo criminal court on Saturday sentenced 13 policemen to between three and five years in prison for breaking an assembly law when they gathered to demand higher wages and better working conditions in 2015 and 2016. The policemen were also convicted of detaining another police officer they claimed had mistreated a colleague in their home province of Sharqiya, in the Nile Delta.

Separately the Cairo court of Cassation, the country’s highest civil court, confirmed death sentences passed on six people, and life sentences on 59 others, accused of storming and setting fire to a police station in the southern province of Minya in 2013, judicial sources said.

The court of cassation also reduced the execution verdicts against three defendants to 25-year imprisonment, upheld the 25-year jail for 59 defendants and acquitted 47 others. The rulings are final and unappealable, as they have been issued in response to a previous appeal by the defendants against the initial rulings of a criminal court. According to the court, the convicts stormed a police station in Minya's Matay town, stole the weapons inside, killed a senior policeman, attempted to murder others, allowed detainees to escape and finally set fire to the police station. Being supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, the convicts committed the acts of violence following the massive security dispersal of two major pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo and nearby Giza in August 2013 that left hundreds dead and thousands arrested. Morsi was removed by the army in early July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his currently blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood group. A lot of Brotherhood leaders, members and supporters, including Morsi himself and the group's top chief Mohamed Badie, are currently jailed and many have received appealable death sentences and life imprisonments over various charges varying from inciting violence and murder to espionage and jailbreak. Morsi is now serving a 20-year prison sentence over inciting deadly clashes between his supporters and opponents in late 2012 and a 25-year jail term over leaking classified documents to Qatar. Since Morsi's ouster, Egypt has been facing a wave of terror attacks that have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers as well as civilians. A Sinai-based militant group affiliated with the Islamic State regional terrorist group has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces have killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief then, following Morsi's ouster.

An Egyptian criminal court has placed 169 members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood group on the country's terror list. The defendants are facing charges of conspiring to infiltrate state institutions with the aim of overthrowing the regime by force and spreading chaos in the country. The court’s decision is based on state security investigations, which revealed that the defendants attempted to revive the group's activities by recruiting new members to its armed wings, spread rumors and provided financial and logistical assistance to the Brotherhood, which was designated a terrorist group in 2013. Under the country’s anti-terrorism law, any person placed on the terror list is subject to a travel ban and having their assets frozen. Egypt's terror list contains over 1,500 names, including top Brotherhood leaders. The list includes Egypt’s former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, the group’s supreme guide Mohamed Badie, and the Brotherhood's deputy supreme guide Mahmoud Ezzat, who fled Egypt in 2013. The list also includes Ibrahim Mounir, the Brotherhood's secretary-general in London, who has been convicted of planning attacks in Egypt from abroad. Search Keywords: Short link:

Rights group says arrest of Amal Fathy is a "new low in Egypt's crackdown on freedom of expression" CAIRO, May 11 (Reuters) - Egyptian police on Friday detained an activist after she posted a video on social media criticising the government for failing to protect women against sexual harassment and over worsening living conditions, Amnesty International said. The rights group said the arrest of Amal Fathy, a member of the now banned April 6 youth movement which played a role in 2011 mass protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak out of office, was a "new low in Egypt's crackdown on freedom of expression". Egyptian police could not immediately be reached for comment, but a security source said Fathy had been detained over a complaint that she had insulted the Egyptian state through an offensive social media posting. Human rights groups have repeatedly criticised Egypt's human rights situation, saying conditions in the country have continued to deteriorate under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power in 2013 after the army overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Morsi following protests against his rule. Amnesty International said that in the video posted on Facebook May 9, Fathy spoke about the prevalence of sexual harassment in Egypt, criticized the government's failure to protect women and for deteriorating human rights, socioeconomic conditions and public services. "It is a dark day when the Egyptian authorities are more concerned with silencing a woman who speaks out about sexual harassment than taking steps to address the issue," said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International. Sisi's supporters say his tough security and economic measures are needed to keep the country stable as it recovers from political chaos and tackles grave economic challenges and the Islamist insurgency. Amnesty said Fathy was detained from her home at 2:30 A.M. on Friday, together with her husband, Mohamed Lotfy -- a human rights lawyer, and were taken to a police station in Maadi in southern Cairo. Lotfy was freed some three hours later but Fathy was kept in custody to allow a prosecutor to examine her case. A prosecutor later ordered her detained for 15 days for questioning on charges of incitement to overthrow the ruling system, publishing lies and misusing social media, according to a lawyer at the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, where her husband works. Egyptian media had earlier slammed Fathy, saying she had used foul language in the 12-minute recording in which she seemed to express her anger at poor public services at a local bank, over heavy traffic, sexual harassment by a local taxi driver and over a general deterioration in living conditions. An Egyptian security source said: "She is accused and wanted for arrest in relation to complaints accusing her of insulting the Egyptian state, by publishing a posting that contained swearing and defamation against Egypt."

Cairo: An Egyptian court on Sunday acquitted two police officers of torturing to death a lawyer while in detention three years ago in a case that triggered protests from his colleagues. The ruling was issued by the Cairo Criminal Court in a retrial of the two officers, legal sources said. The ruling can be appealed, they added. The case dates back to 2015 when Kareem Hamdi, a 27-year-old lawyer, had been arrested on suspicion of belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood and involvement in its violence. He later died inside a police station in the northern Cairo district of Matariya, a stronghold of Islamists. Lawyers accused police of torturing Hamdi to death allegedly to extract confessions from him. They staged anti-government protests. The country’s chief prosecutor ordered both officers from the National Security Agency to stand trial on charges of torturing the lawyer to death. In December 2015, a court sentenced the two to five years in prison each. In October 2016, the Court of Cassation, Egypt’s top appeals tribunal, revoked the verdict and ordered a retrial for both defendants. Egyptian authorities have pursued a relentless crackdown on Islamists since 2013 when the military toppled president Mohammad Mursi of the Brotherhood following massive protests against his rule. Rights groups have repeatedly accused the government of ignoring police’s purported violations. Authorities have downplayed the alleged abuses as isolated acts, vowing to bring any wrongdoer to justice. In recent years, several policemen have been handed down varying jail terms in separate torture cases in Egypt. Police abuses were seen as a major catalyst for the 2011 revolt that forced long-time president Hosni Mubarak out of power.

Muslim Brotherhood members have been placed on terror lists in Egypt. (Getty Images) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat A Cairo court in Egypt ordered on Saturday that 20 Muslim Brotherhood members be placed on terrorist lists for the next five years. The court based its decision on proof that the accused were terrorists because some of them were leaders of the Brotherhood. Others were accused of joining and funding the group to carry out terror attacks and promote its ideology. Egypt labels the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. Several charges have been laid against the 20 terror suspects, including purchasing weapons and arms. They also received some of their funds through Brotherhood leaderships abroad In a separate development, the Cairo Criminal Court set August 4 as the date for the retrial of seven defendants in the so-called Tanta terror cell case. The suspects are charged with forming a terror cell in the western city of Tanta for the purpose of attacking the army and police. In 2016, the suspects were originally given death or prison sentences. The northern Cairo criminal court then accepted the defendants’ appeal in 2017 and ordered a retrial.

An Egyptian court has acquitted two police officers of charges of torturing and murdering a prominent lawyer in 2015. Karim Hamdi was beaten to death at a Cairo police station in 2015 following a pro-democracy rally, with officials alleging he was part of the group. He died two days after his arrest sparking outrage amongst the country's lawyers. The two officers, a lieutenant colonel and captain with the national security service, were sentenced to five years in prison in December 2015, but yesterday successfully appealed the conviction. Yesterday, Egypt's prosecutor also referred some 278 terror suspects to a military court on charges of joining two breakaway Muslim Brotherhood factions. Since the ousting of Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned and designated a terror organisation by the government. Hundreds endure unfair trials, with many subsequently sentenced to death; some six people were awarded the death sentence last month for their participation in protests in 2013. Read: Egypt beefs up security outside metro stations after fare rise protests The news of the overturned conviction comes amid controversy over a leaked video released last week that appears to show a child being executed at close range in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula by an army officer, dating back to 2015. In February Amnesty International condemned the escalating "human rights crisis" in Egypt in its annual World Report, citing the country's endemic arbitrary arrests and detentions of hundreds, as well as the new legal restrictions imposed on NGOs and authorities turning a blind eye to torture. Egypt has repeatedly criticised the findings of many NGOs accusing them of being deliberately "misleading" on human rights abuses. In September, the Egyptian government pledged to take action against Human Rights Watch after it released a damning report on state torture. The Egyptian Human Rights Committee denied the allegations, claiming that no political prisoners had ever reported incidents of torture. The foreign ministry also accused the NGO of bias, alleging it received support from the Muslim Brotherhood. Two weeks later, President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi told US officials in New York that human rights should not be judged from a Western perspective, arguing that Egypt had taken numerous measures to ensure the economic and social wellbeing of its citizens.

News article:
Algiers - Asharq Al-Awsat Amnesty International has asked the Algerian authorities to release a blogger who faces the death penalty on “espionage charges.” In a post early last year, Merzoug Touati interviewed an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson in which he disputes accusations by the Algerian authorities that the Israeli authorities were involved in protests in Algeria. The trial of Touati “on trumped-up espionage charges based on online posts is yet another stain on the country’s human rights record,” Amnesty International said on Wednesday on the eve of the opening hearing. Touati, 32, “faces charges relating to a Facebook post and YouTube video that authorities claim encouraged civil unrest. He has been in detention since January 2017,” it said. “Amnesty International has reviewed the court documents which list as 'evidence' the posts published by Touati before his Facebook account and website were deleted, and found that there was no incitement to violence or advocacy of hatred, rather his posts were covered by freedom of expression in relation to his work as a citizen-journalist,” according to the US-basked human rights organization. “Amnesty International therefore considers Merzoug Touati a prisoner of conscience held solely for expressing his peaceful opinions,” it said. Heba Morayef, Middle East and North Africa regional director at Amnesty International, said that every day “Touati spends in prison ... is a further stain on Algeria’s human rights record.” “It is ludicrous that a Facebook post expressing peaceful opinion could lead to the death penalty. Touati represents the broken dreams of a generation in a country where freedom of expression has been repeatedly undermined,” she added.

An Algerian blogger who was jailed after interviewing an Israeli diplomat has appealed his 10-year sentence, his lawyer says, after global rights groups condemned the severity of the punishment. Merzoug Touati was convicted on Thursday of providing intelligence to “agents of a foreign power” likely to damage Algeria, by a court in Bejaia, east of Algiers. The 30-year-old blogger submitted his appeal the following day and was feeling “optimistic,” his lawyer Boubakeur Esseddik Hamaili says. “I have seen my client, he is doing well and is a tower of strength. He proclaims his innocence as he has done nothing but exercise his rights guaranteed by the constitution,” the lawyer adds. Touati has been in prison since his arrest in January 2017, over an online video interview with an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman and a Facebook post in which he called for protests against a new financial law. — AFP

CAIRO, May 30 (Reuters) - Egypt’s state security prosecutor on Wednesday ordered four Egyptian officials detained for four days for questioning on suspicion of taking bribes from commodities trading firms, a judicial source said. State news agency MENA reported on Tuesday the officials had been arrested. They include the chairman of the state Food Industries Holding Company (FIHC), a supply ministry adviser responsible for coordination with parliament, a supply ministry spokesman and an official in the FIHC chairman’s office, MENA said. FIHC, a state buyer that has historically handled a broad sweep of commodities, tendering locally and internationally for staples like vegetable oils and sugar, has in recent years seen its role reduced in favour of state grain-buyer GASC. Egypt is the world’s largest importer of wheat and a major buyer of staples like corn and vegetable oils. (Reporting by Haitham Ahmed, writing by John Davison, editing by Larry King)

News article:
An Egyptian court has adjourned the trial of the Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide until 4 July. Mohamed Badei and other members of the movement are charged with murder, attempted murder and inciting violence in incidents dating back to 2013. The case revolves around protests and clashes that erupted on 30 June, 2013 outside the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters, the Guidance Bureau. Protesters were demanding the ouster of then-President Mohamed Morsi while Morsi's supporters insisted that he should remain in power until the end of his presidential term in 2016. The anti-Morsi protests were followed on 3 July by a military coup in which the democratically-elected President, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was overthrown. Since Morsi's ouster, the Egyptian authorities have outlawed the movement as a "terrorist organisation" and launched an unprecedented crackdown on its members, supporters and sympathisers. The crackdown has spread to include democrats and human rights defenders among its victims. Numerous Brotherhood members have been arrested and prosecuted in cases that are described by observers and human rights groups as "political". The Egyptian government blames the Brotherhood for a wave of violence and militant insurgency that has gripped the country since the coup. The movement denies the accusations.

Carmelo Zuccaro, the chief prosecutor of the Sicilian port city of Catania, looks on as he speaks before the Senate defense committee in Rome, Italy May 3, 2017. REUTERS/Remo Casilli CAIRO – 1 June 2018: An Italy-based Egyptian citizen has been acquitted of human trafficking charges that he was previously indicted on, according to Italian website AKI, citing Italian security sources on Thursday. The 27-year-old Egyptian citizen, whose name is Assa’ad Nassif Hajaj Mohamed Ghareb, was arrested in 2014 on charges of facilitating smuggling immigration to Italy. Ghareb’s indictment came as part of a broader investigation launched into an Italian-Egyptian smuggling group that used to smuggle to Italy hundreds of citizens coming from African and Middle Eastern countries, according to the report of AKI. The report added that Ghareeb is currently working and living normally in Italy. The Egyptian Parliament approved in October 2016 a new illegal-immigration and smuggling law, including tough penalties on whoever assists and facilitates the process of illegal immigration. The law was drafted by the Cabinet in 2015, and was sent in June 2016 to the Parliament for discussion. The Parliament’s efforts to approve the law came following the boat that capsized off the coast of Rashid in Beheira governorate while heading to Europe, killing dozens of people.

CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court sentenced on Thursday 28 defendants up to 15 years in prison over storming a police station following the removal of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, official MENA news agency reported. Giza Criminal Court sentenced 18 defendants to 15 years in jail and 10 others to five years for breaking into a police station in Atfih district in Giza province near the capital Cairo. The defendants also faced charges of assaulting the police station chief and other policemen, as well as setting fire to 15 police vehicles, burning down 65 seized private cars and stealing police weapons. Morsi was removed by the military in early July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule. Later security crackdown on his supporters, mostly from the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, left hundreds dead and thousands arrested. Newly re-elected President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi led Morsi's ouster as the army chief then. A lot of Brotherhood leaders, members and supporters, including Morsi himself and the group's top chief Mohamed Badie, are currently jailed, and many have received appealable death sentences and life imprisonments over various charges varying from inciting violence and murder to espionage and jailbreak. Since Morsi's ouster, Egypt has been facing a wave of terror attacks that have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, as well as civilians, with a Sinai-based militant group affiliated with the regional Islamic State terrorist group claiming responsibility for most of them. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces have killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by Sisi following Morsi's removal.

News article:
BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it would “open its door wider” to German businesses, giving a warm reception to visiting Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has wooed Beijing to counterbalance trade threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Germany and China, two exporting nations that run large trade surpluses with the United States, have found themselves in Trump’s firing line and are scrambling to preserve the multi-lateral order on which their prosperity rests. Merkel faces a delicate balancing act on the trip to show Chinese-German solidarity over trade and the Iran nuclear deal without harming ties with long-term ally Washington. In the latest U.S. trade move that has alarmed Beijing and Berlin alike, the Trump administration announced on Wednesday a national security investigation on into car and truck imports that could potentially lead to tariffs. The announcement hurt share prices of both European and Asian carmakers. China vowed to protect its interests. European countries are also concerned that their exporters could be hurt if China instructs importers to buy more U.S. goods to ease trade disputes with the Trump administration. China has already signaled to state companies to buy more U.S. oil and soybeans, trade sources told Reuters. Premier Li Keqiang, in a joint media appearance with Merkel at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, said China and Germany both upheld global free trade, and stressed the huge potential for cooperation between them. Though the two countries had problems, they could be overcome, Li said. “China’s door is open. You can say it will open even wider,” Li said. Trump’s “America First” trade policy, his administration’s professed disdain for the World Trade Organization, as well as his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have pushed China and Germany into closer alignment, German officials say. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang review the guard of honour during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee However, Merkel’s government also shares many of the Trump administration’s concerns about Chinese business practices, including what many Western countries say are state-backed efforts to push foreign companies to give up trade secrets. In Copenhagen, the chief executive of Maersk MAERSKb.CO, the world's biggest container shipper, said China was "becoming more and more assertive about its own agenda – a China that uses its competition laws for own benefit" in the shipping sector. “We look with concern at the growing protectionist rhetoric around the world,” Soren Skou said. “The EU will be the decisive driving force in free trade, not the least at a time when it seems the United States doesn’t want to take the lead.” “STRIDING FORWARD” Li said Beijing would protect the interests of German firms investing in China and adjust its rules if needed: “If they come across any problems during their investment, especially when it comes to legal protections, I can clearly tell you that China is striding forward to being a country with rule of law.” German companies have complained for years about barriers to the Chinese market and intellectual property theft. Merkel welcomed China’s recent announcements that it would further open its financial sector to foreign participation and reduce Chinese joint venture requirements in sectors such as automobiles. But German industry said it was now up to China to deliver on its promises of greater openness. “China must rigorously reduce the asymmetries in market access,” said Hubert Lienhard, head of the Asia Pacific Committee of German Industry (APA). Trump has also driven Europe to work more closely with China by pulling out of a 2015 deal to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program. European countries, Russia and China, all parties to the deal, are searching for a way to salvage it by continuing to offer economic benefits to Iran in return for its compliance, despite U.S. sanctions. Merkel, who personally lobbied Trump not to pull out of the pact but was rebuffed, said Germany and China were “united in the view that we do not want to put this agreement in doubt”. In a nod to China, Merkel said that if U.S. sanctions force European companies to reduce business with Iran, “this creates the possibility for others to then get more into Iran.”

News article:
German Chancellor Merkel has stressed that improved ties with China are a much-needed step toward solving international crises. Merkel's delegation is also seeking greater market access for German companies in China. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday that close cooperation between the two countries was essential to solving the world's crises. Merkel's trip to China comes amid rising tensions in both Beijing and the European Union over trade relations with the United States, as well as US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. Merkel said both Berlin and Beijing would stand behind the existing 2015 deal that saw Tehran give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions being lifted on Iran. While admitting that the Iran deal is not perfect, Merkel added that the alternatives are even more uncertain. She also said the imposition of US sanctions could force some European countries away from business with Iran. Read more: China takeovers in Germany follow one major pattern: study Expanding German-Chinese cooperation, even on human rights The leaders agreed that dialogue should continue with North Korea after both Washington and Pyongyang threatened to call off what would be a historic summit scheduled for June 12. Merkel said she hoped for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and that she had seen "very hopeful things recently." The chancellor told Li during their meeting at Beijing's Great Hall that there was scope for closer cooperation between Germany and China and that the two sides should hold regular bilateral meetings, not just on business and trade, but also on human rights. "Then our conversations can center on really where there are still problems, what the solutions are and what the opportunities are," Merkel said. "Then we can play our part in a global, multilateral system." Addressing the human rights situation in China, Li said the country's constitution respects human rights and added that he hoped China and Germany could discuss rights issues on a case-by-case basis. He did not mention Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, who has been under house arrest since 2010 without being charged with a crime. The chancellor also stressed her continued commitment to the trans-Atlantic partnership with the United States, despite facing increased tensions and less common ground with Washington. Both Berlin and Beijing have decried Trump's decision to walk away from the Iranian nuclear accord, while both also face being slapped with punitive trade tariffs by Trump administration. The chancellor is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later on Thursday for further talks. Merkel vying for greater Chinese market access On Friday, Merkel is slated to travel to China's technology hub of Shenzhen with a German business delegation. German business leaders and lawmakers have long protested the uneven playing field. Some businesses have said they feel they are being squeezed out as China's workforce reaches a higher level of expertise, albeit without always playing by international rules or respecting international copyright and patent laws.

Those complaints have grown more vocal in recent years, particularly as China's investment into Europe has jumped from €700 million ($819 million) in 2008 to €35 billion just eight years later. However, Merkel also lauded China for its fast-paced economic growth and its technological development during talks with Li.

He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions. Darius Shahtahmasebi is a New Zealand-based legal and political analyst who focuses on US foreign policy in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific region. He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions. Germany has had enough of American foreign policy. Angela Merkel’s visits to Russia and China are a testament to that. On May 10, 2018, German Chancellor Angela Merkel openly said that Europe can no longer count on the United States to protect it, hinting that the European continent would begin to “take destiny into its own hands.” The comments were, of course, a direct reference to US President Donald Trump’s ludicrous but anticipated decision to completely nuke the Iranian nuclear accord, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “It is no longer such that the United States simply protects us, but Europe must take its destiny in its own hands. That's the task of the future," Merkel reportedly said during a speech honoring French President Emmanuel Macron. Eerily enough, approximately a year ago, Merkel offered almost the exact same sentiments, stating that Europe “really must take our fate into our own hands.” In the weeks since, Merkel has certainly proved that this was no idle threat. The German chancellor has made trips to both Russia and China, and the outcomes of those meetings appear to suggest a complete restructuring of the balance of power in Europe and Asia respectively. China and Germany see eye to eye Just this Thursday, China has already said it would “open its door wider” to German businesses after giving Merkel a warm reception. Both China and Germany have a common interest in defeating Trump’s plan to kill trade surpluses that countries have with the United States, as they are both equally affected by Trump’s threats. Each time Trump opens his mouth, it seems that European and Asian businesses are instantly affected. Germany is the largest auto exporter to the US out of any European country, and is China’s biggest European trading partner which was worth $179 billion just last year alone. Both Merkel and Macron tried their hand at persuading the Trump administration not to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal completely. The leaders even issued a joint statement with British Prime Minister Theresa May, someone whose hawkish attitude towards Iran should not go unnoticed. Not surprisingly, according to Reuters, German officials have said that “Trump’s America First’ trade policy, his administration’s professed disdain for the World Trade Organization, as well as his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have pushed China and Germany into closer alignment.” It is not clear if the Trump administration is that incompetent or if this is done on purpose, in full knowledge that its actions will only further isolate the United States on the world stage and push states that previously held more adversarial positions closer and closer together. If it is done on purpose, one has to wonder what sort of mindset is behind the leadership which is on a self-destruct mission, and how it expects to maintain its worldwide empire, all the while irking its traditional allies. It is quite clear that Trump’s decision to axe the Iran deal will only pave the way for China to take advantage of the financial opportunities flowing out of Iran if sanctions present a buffer to German interests. China has already been assisting Iran to out-maneuver US-led sanctions through, for example, the use of credit lines using the Yuan. In that context, does Donald Trump want to contain China or empower it? You can only go so far serving the interests of Saudi Arabia and Israel while ignoring strong European states who would rather ink financial deals than turn Iran into a glass crater, a strong point of difference between Merkel and say, newly appointed US national security adviser John Bolton. The lifting of sanctions on Iran already led to an increase in trade between Germany and Iran from €2.7 billion in 2014 to €3.5 billion last year. It is also worth noting that Iran will now start accepting euros for its oil in an attempt to not only avoid the US dollar, but in a move that will directly threaten it. This topic is probably best suited for another article, but it is definitely something worth keeping an eye on – and will most likely only bolster Germany’s resolve to protect Iran. Either way, Germany and China have both agreed to stick to the Iran deal. Think for a second what this means: John Bolton openly warned European companies and countries against continuing business with Iran, stating that they could be targeted by sanctions. The newly appointed ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, also immediately warned Germany directly that German companies must halt their business activities with Tehran or face sanctions. The German-Chinese announcement also came just after Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, issued a set of demands of its own, stating that the Europeans also could not be trusted. Germany and China have essentially given the US the political middle finger in response, and arguably kowtowed to Iranian interests instead. German-Russian relations to continue Not too long ago, the US also warned Germany that sanctions may also target the German-Russia pipeline known as the Nord Stream 2 Project. If you ever needed proof that the underlying reasons for US-led wars were driven by money and natural gas, this is it. Why prevent Germany and Russia from working on this monumental project? Germany needs the gas, and Russia, relatively close-by, can supply it. Despite the fact that the two countries continue to hold a number of disputes (including sanctions that continue to target Russia), Merkel’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin demonstrates that it is still possible to meet with one’s counterpart and discuss those issues amicably, an idea that seems almost completely lost on the current Trump administration. “If you want to solve problems, you have to talk to each other,” Merkel said alongside Putin midway through the talks. One Russian presidential aide reportedly suggested that the meeting went ahead because the two world leaders now found themselves on the same page, stating that “when opinions coincide, then countries at the very least become a bit closer to one another.” According to a senior German official with knowledge of the chancellery’s strategy, rapprochement with Russia is now a core policy objective in Berlin. Polls are already suggesting that Germans trust Russia under Putin more than they trust the United States under Trump. That is some amazing 4D chess President Trump is playing. READ MORE: Trump’s withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal gives Europe a choice: Become vassals or be independent It is also worth noting that Germany did not participate in Trump, Macron, and Theresa May’s grandiose attack on Syria in April this year. Perhaps Germany is seeing less and less in common with the US, and has less of an intention of waging war to see its interests met, unlike the US, which apparently sees violence as the logical solution to all its problems. Not to mention that – agitating Germany even further – in a recent cabinet meeting in Washington attended by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump singled out Germany as a country not contributing enough, all the while warning that countries allegedly not paying their dues will be “dealt with.” Sheez. It should be no wonder that in this context, Germany has been secretly building a European Army of its own, already announcing the integration of its armed forces with Romania and the Czech Republic, baby steps to creating a European army under German leadership.

China and Germany see eye to eye Just this Thursday, China has already said it would “open its door wider” to German businesses after giving Merkel a warm reception. Both China and Germany have a common interest in defeating Trump’s plan to kill trade surpluses that countries have with the United States, as they are both equally affected by Trump’s threats. Each time Trump opens his mouth, it seems that European and Asian businesses are instantly affected. Germany is the largest auto exporter to the US out of any European country, and is China’s biggest European trading partner which was worth $179 billion just last year alone. Both Merkel and Macron tried their hand at persuading the Trump administration not to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal completely. The leaders even issued a joint statement with British Prime Minister Theresa May, someone whose hawkish attitude towards Iran should not go unnoticed. Not surprisingly, according to Reuters, German officials have said that “Trump’s America First’ trade policy, his administration’s professed disdain for the World Trade Organization, as well as his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have pushed China and Germany into closer alignment.” It is not clear if the Trump administration is that incompetent or if this is done on purpose, in full knowledge that its actions will only further isolate the United States on the world stage and push states that previously held more adversarial positions closer and closer together. If it is done on purpose, one has to wonder what sort of mindset is behind the leadership which is on a self-destruct mission, and how it expects to maintain its worldwide empire, all the while irking its traditional allies. It is quite clear that Trump’s decision to axe the Iran deal will only pave the way for China to take advantage of the financial opportunities flowing out of Iran if sanctions present a buffer to German interests. China has already been assisting Iran to out-maneuver US-led sanctions through, for example, the use of credit lines using the Yuan. In that context, does Donald Trump want to contain China or empower it? You can only go so far serving the interests of Saudi Arabia and Israel while ignoring strong European states who would rather ink financial deals than turn Iran into a glass crater, a strong point of difference between Merkel and say, newly appointed US national security adviser John Bolton. The lifting of sanctions on Iran already led to an increase in trade between Germany and Iran from €2.7 billion in 2014 to €3.5 billion last year. It is also worth noting that Iran will now start accepting euros for its oil in an attempt to not only avoid the US dollar, but in a move that will directly threaten it. This topic is probably best suited for another article, but it is definitely something worth keeping an eye on – and will most likely only bolster Germany’s resolve to protect Iran. Either way, Germany and China have both agreed to stick to the Iran deal. Think for a second what this means: John Bolton openly warned European companies and countries against continuing business with Iran, stating that they could be targeted by sanctions. The newly appointed ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, also immediately warned Germany directly that German companies must halt their business activities with Tehran or face sanctions. The German-Chinese announcement also came just after Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, issued a set of demands of its own, stating that the Europeans also could not be trusted. Germany and China have essentially given the US the political middle finger in response, and arguably kowtowed to Iranian interests instead. German-Russian relations to continue Not too long ago, the US also warned Germany that sanctions may also target the German-Russia pipeline known as the Nord Stream 2 Project. If you ever needed proof that the underlying reasons for US-led wars were driven by money and natural gas, this is it. Why prevent Germany and Russia from working on this monumental project? Germany needs the gas, and Russia, relatively close-by, can supply it. Despite the fact that the two countries continue to hold a number of disputes (including sanctions that continue to target Russia), Merkel’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin demonstrates that it is still possible to meet with one’s counterpart and discuss those issues amicably, an idea that seems almost completely lost on the current Trump administration. “If you want to solve problems, you have to talk to each other,” Merkel said alongside Putin midway through the talks. One Russian presidential aide reportedly suggested that the meeting went ahead because the two world leaders now found themselves on the same page, stating that “when opinions coincide, then countries at the very least become a bit closer to one another.” According to a senior German official with knowledge of the chancellery’s strategy, rapprochement with Russia is now a core policy objective in Berlin. Polls are already suggesting that Germans trust Russia under Putin more than they trust the United States under Trump. That is some amazing 4D chess President Trump is playing. READ MORE: Trump’s withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal gives Europe a choice: Become vassals or be independent It is also worth noting that Germany did not participate in Trump, Macron, and Theresa May’s grandiose attack on Syria in April this year. Perhaps Germany is seeing less and less in common with the US, and has less of an intention of waging war to see its interests met, unlike the US, which apparently sees violence as the logical solution to all its problems. Not to mention that – agitating Germany even further – in a recent cabinet meeting in Washington attended by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump singled out Germany as a country not contributing enough, all the while warning that countries allegedly not paying their dues will be “dealt with.” Sheez. It should be no wonder that in this context, Germany has been secretly building a European Army of its own, already announcing the integration of its armed forces with Romania and the Czech Republic, baby steps to creating a European army under German leadership.

After the Whistler meeting, the attending finance officials agreed on the need to take “decisive action” on the tariffs issue at the upcoming G7 summit in Charlevoix, Quebec. Speaking at a separate news conference, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that President Trump is trying to “rebalance our trade relationships.” He added that he had informed Trump about some of the comments made by America’s main trade partners and that the president would discuss these issues with his fellow G7 leaders. EU Reforms German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters that the conflict over US over steel and aluminum tariffs encourage EU countries’ desire to speed up reforms in the bloc. "There were several issues discussed at the G7 over which there was no agreement. That's really quite unusual in the history of the G7," Scholz said. The EU ministers also voiced their concern about the effect the new US sanctions against Iran may have on European firms working in the Islamic Republic. “Total Incomprehension” Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he told Mnuchin it was "our absolute view that this is absurd, that Canada could in any way be a security risk." "We're concerned that these actions are actually not conducive to helping our economy, they actually are destructive, and that is consistently held across the six countries that expressed their point of view to Secretary Mnuchin," Morneau added. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso criticized Washington’s decision as "deeply deplorable," adding that it was the "US against everyone else." His opinion was echoed by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire who said that Mnuchin was alone on the tariff issue, with the group becoming a "G6 plus one" as the other six G7 members had expressed "total incomprehension" over Washington’s move. READ MORE: Canada Files WTO, NAFTA Litigation to Counter US 'Illegal' Tariffs Trade frictions between the United States and the EU have heightened since Washington imposed a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports in March. The US move has also invited strong criticism from China which retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on imported US goods.

They also agreed to amend the existing nuclear agreement with Iran by putting additional curbs on Tehran’s weapons development program. After all these offers were rejected by Washington, EU leaders have turned to Moscow. “I do think we have to reconnect with Russia,” Juncker told an audience in Brussels. “I am not very happy with the state of our relations. We will never accept what Russia did with Crimea or eastern Ukraine. But nevertheless, we have to have in mind that the entire territory of the European Union is about 5.5 million square kilometers. Russia [is] 70.5 million [sq. km],” he added. In an interview with Sputnik, Dmitry Abzalov, director of the Center for Strategic Communications in Moscow, said that Russia should try to make the best of the situation and press for concessions from Brussels. “The EU could put Nord Stream 2 on the list of its strategic projects. A similar status for the Turkish Stream would not hurt either. If Germany and France want to work closer with Russia and will use their leverage in Ukraine, the very reason for the [anti-Russian] sanctions would be gone,” Abzalov noted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has shown a similar readiness to reconnect with Moscow. During their recent meeting in Moscow Merkel and Putin underscored the mutual importance of going ahead with the Nord Stream 2 project. Interviewed by Sputnik, the director of the Russian Council for International Affairs Andrei Kortunov said that this was a distinct possibility. “Détente between Russia and the EU is possible. There are factors that are prodding both sides towards this. The mere fact that [French President Emmanuel] Macron and Merkel visited Moscow is a very positive sign because it had been a long time since either of them had been here. The very state of international affairs calls for a rapprochement because Moscow and Brussels see eye to eye on things like the Iranian nuclear deal and the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem,” Kortunov said.

News article:
The Angela Merkel that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with on Monday is not the same Angela Merkel he worked with when she first took office nine years ago. Germany’s chancellor no longer holds the reins of power in Europe. Although the Christian Democratic Union of Germany party won the last elections, it took Merkel six months to form a new government—a precedent indicative of the growing threat to the political establishment in the country. While Merkel ultimately formed a government with the rival Social Democratic Party, one cannot be sure internal tensions will allow the government to continue for very long. The face of Europe has also changed dramatically in the past two years. Many believe it is now French President Emmanuel Macron, and not Merkel, who sets the tone for the European Union. Macron aspires to introduce reforms to the E.U. that would strengthen its federal character, in particular as concerns its financial management, at the expense of the sovereignty of member states. Merkel has become the main force obstructing these reforms. The rise of the populist right, which opposes the idea of a “United States of Europe,” and supports in principle, a Europe of nation-states instead, seems to have made it clear to Merkel that if she hopes to prevent the break-up of the E.U. and the weakening of Germany’s senior status, the E.U. must navigate a new course. There is growing anti-German sentiment in France, Italy, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Even Austria is grumbling over Berlin’s seemingly authoritative role. In Germany itself, the third-largest party in the Bundestag opposes the E.U. Many of its supporters feel disappointed by Merkel, especially since she let 2 million “refugees” into Germany. Italy’s vague political future could prove significant for the E.U. in a year in which Britain is set to voluntarily leave the union. Add to that growing tension between Brussels, and Eastern and Central European states, pressure on the E.U. to accept Balkan states as members, conflicts with the E.U.’s greatest ally, the United States, and, of course, the ever-present Russian threat. A significant portion of talks Netanyahu will hold in Berlin, Paris and London will obviously center on convincing the E.U. to obligate Iran to agree to vital additions to the nuclear deal, and significantly reduce its subversive activities in the Middle East and in particular on Israel’s borders. Although there are those in the European Union who have challenged the E.U. line that holds the union must remain in the accord, countries who are set to gain financially from the deal, like France, Germany, Italy and Austria, will continue to insist the E.U. honor its commitments, i.e. business deals and investments, towards Tehran. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories One cannot ignore the fact that, in light of Iranian provocations in Syria and Palestinian provocations in the Gaza Strip, the new German government has expressed full support for Israel’s unconditional right to protect its citizens, borders and territory. This support is a stark contrast from the weak language of the E.U. Commission. This refreshing change comes not just from Merkel’s office, from which a number of officials with problematic views on Israel have recently departed, but as a result of a generational shift led by the Christian Democrats’ social democratic partner. The older generation, which had an uncontrollable urge to preach morality to Israel, was sent home.

News article:
Richard Allen Grenell has sparked uproar just weeks into his posting as US ambassador to Berlin A member of the German government on Tuesday accused the new US ambassador in Berlin of meddling in domestic politics and aggravating already tense ties, as left-wing parties called for the staunch ally of Donald Trump to be expelled. Richard Grenell took up his Berlin posting on May 8 and immediately irked Germany when he tweeted the same day that German companies should stop doing business with Iran as Trump quit the nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic. He stoked further outrage last weekend with reported comments to right-wing news website Breitbart of his ambition to "empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders." Grenell also raised eyebrows with his plan to host a June 13 lunch for Austria's arch-conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, described by the US envoy as a "rock star." The ambassador "is interfering in our internal affairs," said Peter Beyer, coordinator for transatlantic cooperation in Angela Merkel's government, in an interview with regional newspaper the Rheinische Post. "He should pay attention to the fact that we consider his start as ambassador to be difficult," added the conservative politician, who will be present on Wednesday for a visit by the diplomat to the foreign ministry. Former chief of the Social Democratic Party and ex-European Parliament president Martin Schulz told national news agency DPA: "What this man is doing is unheard of in international diplomacy. "If a German ambassador were to say in Washington that he is there to empower the Democrats, he would have been kicked out immediately. "I hope that Kurz's visit will lead Mr Grenell's tenure as ambassador in Germany to be short," added Schulz, playing on the German word for short -- "kurz." Schulz had earlier tweeted that the US envoy did not behave like a diplomat but rather like a "far-right colonial officer." Amid the row, Germany's foreign ministry is seeking clarification from Grenell about his comments, with the topic to be raised at a pre-arranged meeting Wednesday between the envoy and senior official Andreas Michaelis. "There will certainly be a lot to discuss and that's why it's good that the ambassador will be a guest tomorrow of state secretary Michaelis," said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. - 'Awful interview' - But in Washington, the Trump administration was standing by its controversial envoy. "Ambassadors have a right to express their opinion," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters who asked whether Grenell had expressing the views of the administration. "They're representatives of the White House, whether it's this administration or other administrations, and we hear them voicing their opinions," she said. "And they're sometimes opinions that people may or may not like. And there is the right to free speech as well." The appointment of Grenell, a hawkish supporter of Trump's "America First" stance, was long held up by US senators who objected to his allegedly disparaging tweets on female politicians and apparent refusal to take seriously claims of Russian meddling in the US election. The controversy comes as ties between Germany and the United States are strained after Trump ditched the Iran nuclear deal and imposed punishing tariffs on European aluminium and steel. Underlining the souring transatlantic relationship, Merkel has warned that Europe can no longer rely on the US to protect it and must "take its destiny into its own hands." Politicians in the US too baulked at Grenell's comments. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy tweeted that the envoy's interview with Breitbart was "awful -- ambassadors aren't supposed to 'empower' any political party overseas." - 'Why is he ambassador'? - For Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman of Merkel's centre-right bloc, Grenell is simply seeking to weaken the EU. The US wants to prevent "the European Union from further integrating and becoming a stronger political and economic power," Hardt told broadcaster hr-Info. Although Merkel herself belongs to the conservative camp, commentators said Grenell was not trying to bolster the chancellor's party base, but rather its opponents from the far-right. "It is bad enough if that's what he is thinking, let alone saying it," said the daily Berliner Zeitung. Media outside Germany also weighed in, with Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum arguing that Grenell clearly intended to back "nativist, pro-Russia and anti-pluralist" forces in Europe. Grenell had certainly fulfilled his task if he was sent to Germany to destabilise Merkel's coalition or the Atlantic alliance, she said, "but if those are not his orders... then a different set of questions has to be asked." "Why is the US ambassador in Germany giving an interview to Breitbart? Why is he involving himself in partisan politics? For that matter, why is he an American ambassador at all?" Applebaum added. The Financial Times urged Berlin to respond to Grenell's "undiplomatic behaviour" by holding its line on adhering to the Iran nuclear deal, responding firmly to US tariffs as well as stepping up to its defence responsibilities.

News article:
Jens Stoltenberg warned that splits between America and European NATO members over trade is threatening the alliance NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday he was battling to stop the increasingly bitter row between Europe and the US spilling over into the alliance, warning of 'serious disagreements' among member countries. European countries are at loggerheads with Washington over punishing new US tariffs on steel and aluminium as well as President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. NATO defence ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday to approve plans to beef up the alliance's ability to mobilise forces quickly in the event of a crisis, as concern about the threat from Russia shows no sign of abating. They will also sign off on two new command centres - one to protect Atlantic shipping lanes, based in Norfolk, Virginia, and another to coordinate troop movements around Europe, located in the southern German city of Ulm. But the meeting, just five weeks out from a full summit of NATO leaders, looks set to be overshadowed by the spat between European countries and their longtime ally across the Atlantic. 'There are now serious disagreements with NATO allies on serious issues,' Stoltenberg told reporters, saying he was working hard to minimise the fallout. 'As long as they're not solved I have to be focused on how to reduce, limit the negative consequences for NATO.' Stoltenberg, who held talks with Trump in Washington last month, insisted the 'transatlantic bond' remained strong and pointed to the way NATO survived major differences among members over the Iraq war in 2003 and the Suez crisis of 1956. President Trump has angered allies in the EU by imposing steep trade tariffs on aluminium and steel, with the trading bloc vowing to retaliate 'What we have seen again and again is that we have been able to unite around NATO's core task, to protect and defend each other despite those differences,' he said. The US ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, insisted 'the strength of our alliance is not in jeopardy'. The Suez crisis In 1956 Britain, France and Israel invaded Egypt in an attempt to regain control of the Suez Canal which had been nationalized by Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. While the invasion was a tactical success it led Egypt to close the canal to shipping, which drew the ire of the United States and Soviet Union. Heavy political pressured from the US and USSR, including the threat by President Eisenhower to crash the British economy by selling off government bonds, eventually led the invaders to withdraw. Advertisement 'We are strong together, we will have disagreements on other issues but we will not have disagreement about the strength of NATO and the importance of deterrence and defence for NATO and for North America,' she told reporters. The leaders of all 29 NATO members will meet in Brussels for the summit in July when all eyes will be on Trump, who has repeatedly attacked European countries for not pulling their weight in the alliance. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has suffered the worst of Trump's wrath for its failure to live up to a pledge by all NATO countries to try to spend at least two percent of gross domestic product on defence. NATO is modernising its command structure and beefing up its defences in response to growing fears about Russia, following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Thousands of NATO troops are already stationed on standby in the Baltic states and Poland as deterrent and on Thursday defence ministers will give the go-ahead to a new US initiative called '30-30-30-30' or 'four 30s'. Under the plan, by 2020 NATO will have 30 batallions, 30 air squadrons and 30 warships ready to be used within 30 days to back up existing rapid response forces. 'This is about establishing a culture of readiness and we need that because we have a more unpredictable security environment, we have to be prepared for the unforeseen,' Stoltenberg said.

Seeking to soothe feathers ruffled by comments from the US ambassador to Berlin, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert only made it worse by citing the Allied landings in Normandy as an example of US ties with Germany. “We have a very strong relationship with the government of Germany,” Nauert said at a press briefing on Tuesday. “Looking back in the history books, today is the 71st anniversary of the speech that announced the Marshall Plan. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the D-Day invasion. We obviously have a very long history with the government of Germany, and we have a strong relationship with the government of Germany.” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert today cited "the D-Day invasion" when talking about the long history between the American and German governments. https://t.co/UbCqKJymNipic.twitter.com/jvN2ODk3rA — Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher) June 5, 2018 Nauert’s choice of D-Day as an example raised eyebrows at CNN and MSNBC, but also among those who know a thing or two about the Second World War. The landing of some 150,000 US, British, Canadian and other Allied troops on the beaches of German-occupied France 74 years ago was certainly part of a “long history” between the US and Germany, but hardly a good illustration of a “strong relationship.” Yes, because D-day was all about liberating Germany from the iron grip of the French, right, Ms. Nauert? — Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) June 6, 2018 The bumbling answer came after a barrage of questions were asked about statements made by Richard Grenell, the recently-appointed US ambassador to Germany. In an interview with Breitbart published on Sunday, Grenell said that conservatives from all over Europe told him there was a feeling of resurgence following the election of US President Donald Trump. “I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders. I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left,” he said, adding that Trump’s election has “empowered individuals and people to say that they can’t just allow the political class to determine before an election takes place, who’s going to win and who should run.” Grenell himself denied that this amounted to an overt endorsement of any particular person or political party, while Nauert argued that ambassadors have freedom of speech, just like any other American. “Look, we’re not supporting any political party. That’s not what we do. We support democracy. We support countries figuring out for themselves who they want to vote in for office,” Nauert said, apparently ignoring the long history of US meddling in other countries’ elections, “color revolutions” and forcible regime change. Grenell has been the US envoy to Berlin for less than six weeks, but he has already managed to offend the Germans by demanding they cease trading with Iran after Trump announced the US would unilaterally abandon the 2015 nuclear deal. Nauert also had to defend US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who told reporters covering the deadly protests along the border with Gaza to “just keep your mouths shut until you figure it out.” Friedman was “explaining his opinion that some in the media, not all, but some in media organizations have not done that balanced job of reporting,” Nauert argued, blaming the Islamist organization Hamas for the casualties in Gaza. While Grenell and Friedman’s words have attracted attention as unusually undiplomatic, they are hardly the first US diplomats to meddle in the affairs of host countries or even order their governments around. Ambassadors to Belgrade, Sarajevo and Skopje have done so repeatedly. In January, for example, US Ambassador to Kosovo Greg Delawie threatened “specific and harsh consequences” to the ethnic Albanian government running that renegade Serbian province if they passed a law that Washington did not approve of.

News article:
Two former advisors from within the Canadian and US administrations have warned of the economic threat posed by US President Donald Trump ahead of the G7 summit in Canada, which kicks off today. Roland Paris, a former top foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is chairing the G7 meeting that begins Friday, and Daniel Price, a former personal representative of George W. Bush at G8 and G20 summits, think there is a chance that US President Donald Trump might cancel his participation in the summit of world leaders at the last minute. Their assessment underlines both the unpredictability of the US president and the state of affairs between the US and its major allies. "It's unlikely, but anything is possible," said Paris, responding to whether he thought Trump could skip what is shaping up to be a moment of reckoning for the president who could face stiff blowback for his recent tariff decisions. Paris drafted the foreign policy strategy for the Trudeau administration prior to its 2015 election win. Price, who served as President Bush's top international trade advisor and as his so-called "sherpa" in preparation for various international summits, added that a Trump cancellation would be "very unfortunate if it were to happen." Deep divisions The G7 summit, which will bring together the leaders of Canada, the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, comes at a time that many view as a moment of historic division between Washington and its major allies in North America, Europe and Asia. Just days ago the Trump administration slapped stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on five of its six G7 partners. It also recently kicked off a trade investigation that could trigger additional tariffs on imported cars. The tariffs are based on what is widely seen as a spurious justification, namely that the imports present a threat to US national security, even though all countries present at the G7 meeting are NATO members alongside the US or have a long-standing security partnership with Washington like Japan. Read more: Donald Trump's EU tariffs 'foolish' and 'damaging' While the tariffs, which Europe and Canada fought hard to prevent, are the most recent, they are just the last in an increasingly long list of deep disagreements between the US and its allies. Not long before the tariff move, the Trump administration — again against the joint opposition of its allies — pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. And in a previous signature decision that rocked relations with its allies, Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accords after making his inaugural appearance at a G7 summit last year in Italy. Six of the seven G7 finance ministers publicly rebuked the US tariffs Image: picture-alliance/The Canadian Press/J. Hayward Public rebuke While Trump was already characterized in the US media as "the odd man out" at the last G7 meeting, divisions between the US president and the other leaders have only grown wider since. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau recently all failed to convince Trump not to impose tariffs on the allies. In a sign of how deep the rift is, six of the seven G7 finance ministers last weekend took the unusual step of issuing a joint a message rebuking Washington for imposing the tariffs. "It is true that the administration's unilateral actions on trade against US allies are eroding the longstanding bonds of mutual trust," said Price. "And when you take that together with the withdrawal from the JCPOA [the official acronym for the Iran deal — the eds.] and the threatened imposition of sanctions on our allies who want to preserve the deal, the US is looking increasingly isolated in the G7." Read more: Iran deal: Compromise with US is 'far away,' says Germany For Paris, the former Trudeau adviser, now a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, the current division between the US and Canada is more fundamental than any previous disagreements between the neighboring countries. Unprecedented low in US-Canadian ties "I think the situation now is unprecedented in Canada-US relations," he said. "There have been moments of tensions before, but no US administration has ever characterized Canadian imports as threats to US national security." Despite the friction between the US and its allies, which neither Price nor Paris said they believe will be resolved, they think the G7 meeting can still be valuable — if only to air the differences between the two sides. Still, the former top advisers are under no illusion that major tangible results, for example on trade, can be achieved at the meeting. Already at the previous G7 meeting in Italy Trump was characterized as 'odd man out' Image: picture-alliance/dpa/AP/E. Vucci Avoiding conflict, 'open rupture' a success "I would consider it a success if there is an honest and forthright exchange of views, and if it is brought home to the United States president how divisive and destructive his trade policy actions have been," said Price. "Under the circumstances, I would consider this summit a success if it does not produce an open rupture between the United States and its allies," said Paris. "Everything else is gravy."

Deep divisions The G7 summit, which will bring together the leaders of Canada, the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, comes at a time that many view as a moment of historic division between Washington and its major allies in North America, Europe and Asia. Just days ago the Trump administration slapped stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on five of its six G7 partners. It also recently kicked off a trade investigation that could trigger additional tariffs on imported cars. The tariffs are based on what is widely seen as a spurious justification, namely that the imports present a threat to US national security, even though all countries present at the G7 meeting are NATO members alongside the US or have a long-standing security partnership with Washington like Japan. Read more: Donald Trump's EU tariffs 'foolish' and 'damaging' While the tariffs, which Europe and Canada fought hard to prevent, are the most recent, they are just the last in an increasingly long list of deep disagreements between the US and its allies. Not long before the tariff move, the Trump administration — again against the joint opposition of its allies — pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. And in a previous signature decision that rocked relations with its allies, Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accords after making his inaugural appearance at a G7 summit last year in Italy. Six of the seven G7 finance ministers publicly rebuked the US tariffs Image: picture-alliance/The Canadian Press/J. Hayward Public rebuke While Trump was already characterized in the US media as "the odd man out" at the last G7 meeting, divisions between the US president and the other leaders have only grown wider since. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau recently all failed to convince Trump not to impose tariffs on the allies. In a sign of how deep the rift is, six of the seven G7 finance ministers last weekend took the unusual step of issuing a joint a message rebuking Washington for imposing the tariffs. "It is true that the administration's unilateral actions on trade against US allies are eroding the longstanding bonds of mutual trust," said Price. "And when you take that together with the withdrawal from the JCPOA [the official acronym for the Iran deal — the eds.] and the threatened imposition of sanctions on our allies who want to preserve the deal, the US is looking increasingly isolated in the G7." Read more: Iran deal: Compromise with US is 'far away,' says Germany For Paris, the former Trudeau adviser, now a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, the current division between the US and Canada is more fundamental than any previous disagreements between the neighboring countries. Unprecedented low in US-Canadian ties "I think the situation now is unprecedented in Canada-US relations," he said. "There have been moments of tensions before, but no US administration has ever characterized Canadian imports as threats to US national security." Despite the friction between the US and its allies, which neither Price nor Paris said they believe will be resolved, they think the G7 meeting can still be valuable — if only to air the differences between the two sides. Still, the former top advisers are under no illusion that major tangible results, for example on trade, can be achieved at the meeting. Already at the previous G7 meeting in Italy Trump was characterized as 'odd man out' Image: picture-alliance/dpa/AP/E. Vucci Avoiding conflict, 'open rupture' a success "I would consider it a success if there is an honest and forthright exchange of views, and if it is brought home to the United States president how divisive and destructive his trade policy actions have been," said Price. "Under the circumstances, I would consider this summit a success if it does not produce an open rupture between the United States and its allies," said Paris. "Everything else is gravy."

News article:
European leaders are fighting back against U.S. President Donald Trump after the American leader threw a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialized nations into disarray by withdrawing his endorsement of a statement he initially had accepted. Late on June 9, Trump tweeted that based on “false statements” by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who hosted the G7 summit in Quebec, he had instructed U.S. representatives not to endorse the final communique, which the Canadian leader had said was agreed to by all G7 nations. In recent weeks, trading partners of the United States have criticized new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by the Trump administration. At a news conference after the summit, Trudeau reiterated his opposition to the U.S. tariffs and vowed to "move forward with retaliatory measures" in July. "I have made it very clear to the president that it is not something we relish doing, but it something that we absolutely will do," he said. "Canadians, we're polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around." As Trump flew from the summit to a planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, he lashed out at Trudeau, saying he “acted so meek and mild during our G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’” “Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of [sic] 270% on dairy!” Trump wrote. Trudeau’s office released a statement quoting the prime minister as saying that he said nothing at the G7 that he hadn’t told Trump in person and voiced publicly before. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on June 10 that Trump's revocation of support for the joint communique was "sobering and a little depressing." "It's hard, it's depressing this time, but that's not the end" of the G7, she said in an interview with ARD public television, adding that the European Union is preparing countermeasures against U.S. tariffs. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas made a veiled barb at Trump, tweeting: "With one tweet, an unsettling amount of trust can be very quickly destroyed." "It is even more important that Europe stands together and even more aggressively represents its interests," Maas added. In Paris, a French presidency official said France and Europe stood by the G7 communique and anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their "incoherence and inconsistency." "International cooperation cannot depend on being angry and on sound bites. Let's be serious," the official said. But Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told CNN that Trudeau "stabbed us in the back." "There is a special place in hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door," White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland later said that Canada "does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks." "We don't think that that is a useful or productive way to do business, and perhaps we refrain particularly from ad hominem attacks when it comes to our relationship with our allies," she added. The eight-page G7 communique issued earlier stated that “we stand ready to take further restrictive measures to increase costs on Russia” if its behavior makes it necessary. It also demanded that Russia "cease its destabilizing behavior, to undermine democratic systems, and its support of the Syrian regime." The communique was issued after tumultuous summit that mainly had Washington squaring off against its longtime allies over Russia, trade, climate issues, and the Iran nuclear accord. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed criticism by the G7 as "creative babbling" and said at a summit in China on June 10 that it was time for all sides to resume cooperation. "I believe it's necessary to stop this creative babbling and shift to concrete issues related to real cooperation," Putin told reporters when asked to comment on the joint statement. He added that the G7 countries had "again" failed to provide any evidence that Russia was behind the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Britain in March. Because of the disputes, many observers were not certain a statement would be issued under all seven countries' names. Still, the meeting did not appear to bring the sides much closer together. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, and the United States. Trump had shocked many of allies with repeated calls for Russia to be readmitted into the group, which was known as the G8 when Moscow was a member of the association of the world’s leading industrial nations. Trump told journalists on June 9 that "it would be an asset to have Russia back in." In response, Putin said on June 10 that Russia did not choose to leave the group and would be happy to see its member countries in Moscow. He also said he's ready to meet with Trump once the White House is ready for a summit. Many states have voiced an interest in hosting the meeting, including Austria, Putin said. It would be the first bilateral summit between the two leaders since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump and Putin have only ever spoken briefly on the sidelines of major events. European Union countries, which make up four of the group's seven members, agreed ahead of the summit that "a return of Russia to the G7-format summits can't happen until substantial progress has been made in connection with the problems with Ukraine," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said as the summit began on June 8. At the summit's end, Trudeau said he told Trump that he was "not remotely interested" in seeing Russia return to the G7. British Prime Minister Theresa May also welcomed that the G7 statement recognized the need to maintain sanctions on Russia. The statement made no reference to Russia being invited back into the G7, but the leaders did say they would continue "to engage with Russia on addressing regional crises and global challenges, where it is in our interests." Russia was expelled from the group four years ago after annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and fueling a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least 10,300 people. Trump was asked if he thought Russia's control over Crimea should be recognized by the international community, but he avoided answering directly and instead blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the situation. "Crimea was let go during the Obama administration and, you know, Obama can say all he wants, but he allowed Russia to take Crimea," Trump said. "But, with that being said," he added, "it's been done a long time." Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on June 9 said Moscow was not seeking to rejoin the group. He added that Russia was "working fine in other formats," such as the G20. Although Merkel said the “common view" in Europe was to continue to exclude Russia, Italy's new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, echoed Trump's call for returning Russia to the "negotiating table" in a post on Twitter. U.S. allies said they were stunned by Trump's friendly gesture toward Russia, especially considering his move last month to cite "national security" reasons for threatening to impose tariffs on the steel imports of major U.S. allies. Many U.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have also expressed concern about Trump's departure from past U.S. views on trade, Russia, and the international order. Trump has been open on his desires for better relations with Moscow. Republican Senator John McCain, who has been at loggerheads with Trump over many issues lately, tweeted his displeasure at the president’s actions in Quebec. “To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn’t,” he wrote. The G7 leaders also said they were "committed to permanently ensuring that Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful in line with its international obligations and commitments to never seek, develop, or acquire a nuclear weapon." "We condemn all financial support of terrorism including terrorist groups sponsored by Iran. We also call upon Iran to play a constructive role by contributing to efforts to counter terrorism and achieve political solutions, reconciliation, and peace in the region," the statement added. It did not specifically mention the 2015 nuclear accord, which provided Tehran with relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. Trump withdrew from the pact in May against the wishes of the allies and Russia and China. With reporting by AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, and the BBC

News article:
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald Trump, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's President Emmanuel Macron chat during a family photo at the G7 Summit in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, June 8, 2018. (Xinhua/REUTERS) QUEBEC CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G7) summit, which kicked off here on Friday, is expected to be a tough meeting between the United States and its allies amid raising concerns over U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The leaders of the G7, the world's most powerful industrialized countries including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Japan and the United States, meet every year to discuss collaboration on issues like world economy, climate change, security and peace. Upon his arrival in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, U.S. President Donald Trump had a brief discussion with French President Emmanuel Macron on issues concerning trade and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), according to media reports. The official themes for this year's summit include increasing investments and creating jobs to boost growth and advancing gender equality. However, the confrontation over Washington's unilateral decision to impose metal tariffs on imports from the European Union (EU) and Canada might dominate the summit. Trump's rejection of the global climate accord and Iran nuclear deal have also divided the G7. "It appears to be one against six since none of the other countries took aggressive action against the U.S. and it is the U.S. attacking its own allies," said Perrin Beatty, president and chief executive officer of the 200,000-member Canadian Chamber of Commerce, in an interview. The head of Canada's largest business association is at a nearby media center looking for signs as to whether Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- and the European Union (EU) as a participant -- can convince the United States to rethink its anti-trade strategy. "What we have is a president who has undermined the trust of the other six leaders around the table, and that will make it much more difficult to have a common front on other issues as well," said Beatty, a former senior Canadian cabinet minister. In response to the U.S. import tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada followed the EU's lead and threatened to impose its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Canada has announced import duties against U.S. steel and aluminum as well as 71 categories of consumer and industrial goods that target the home states of prominent Republican members of Congress, such as fruit jams from Wisconsin -- the home state of House Speaker Paul Ryan -- and whiskies from Kentucky, -- the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. "We are hurt and we're insulted," said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland in a recent CNN interview on the U.S. tariffs against Canada. Beatty credited the Canadian government with crafting the tariffs -- which would come into effect on July 1 if the Trump administration didn't withdraw its import taxes -- to "maximize the impact within certain regions of the U.S. while minimizing the impact on Canada, and trying to find, wherever possible, a Canadian or other supplier to provide the products." However, he said Canada's business community has a "real concern" with how Trump is attacking what should be the goal of having "free and open" trade. "We've seen a succession of measures taken by the president directed at close allies and friends of the U.S. that are destructive, and that will inflict serious and direct damage on the U.S. economy as well as its partners' economies," said Beatty. "Yet he seems oblivious to the consequences." A tariff the U.S. Commerce Department imposed earlier this year on Canadian newsprint has increased costs for newspaper publishers and now imperils the fate of local papers across the United States, Beatty said. The Trump administration has also slapped tougher tariffs on Canada's softwood lumber industry, but that has resulted in driving up the cost of housing and furniture in the United States and making American furniture manufacturers less competitive, Beatty said. The trade war could heat up further if Trump next targets Canada's auto industry, which exports about 80 percent of the vehicles it manufactures to the United States, or Canada's dairy industry, based on the president's recent tweet that "Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time." All of these actions further erode any hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement, currently under renegotiation by the United States, Canada and Mexico, will survive, according to Beatty. "President Trump has made it clear that he is less interested in having an agreement when the United States wins than in having one where everyone loses," he said. "It is a great irony that he casts himself as a businessman. In business, whether you are a customer or a supplier, you want to ensure that both have a fair deal that is mutually beneficial and you never want a situation where someone feels victimized." "Yet this seems to be President Trump's strategy. He sees trade as a zero-sum game in which the United States can advance only if others lose," he said. Beatty said he has never before witnessed such rancor directed from a U.S. government to its Canadian counterpart since coming to Ottawa in 1972 when he was elected to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for the then-Progressive Conservative Party at the age of 22. "I have never seen an instance like this where doing trade with each other is a bad thing - particularly when Canada is a close trading partner with the U.S., and has the closest relationship with the U.S. militarily, diplomatically, culturally and economically than with any other country in the world," he said. The White House said that Trump will miss the G7 meeting on climate change as he will leave the two-day meeting earlier than originally planned. Trump on Friday fired off tough tweets directed at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Macron and the EU on trade issues, saying he is looking forward to "straightening out unfair Trade Deals" with the G7 countries. At the end of the summit, the leaders hope to sign a joint statement detailing the policy positions and initiatives they agree on. France and Germany have warned that they will not sign the final agreement unless Washington makes some major policy concession. The summit took place against a backdrop of Trump creating the highest level of tension between the United States and its allies in decades, from trade to the Iran deal to NAFTA, according to an article published on the latest issue of the New Yorker. On Thursday morning, Trump tweeted that he was "getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade." But other G7 leaders were preparing for an America more alone than ever before, and now Trump faces the very real risk of allies teaming up against him, the article said. "The American president may not mind being isolated, but neither do we mind signing a 6 country agreement if need be," Macron tweeted later on Thursday. "Under Trump, 'America first' really is turning out to be America Alone," the New Yorker's article said. Before departing to Canada for this year's G7 summit, Trump told media that Russia should be invited back into the G7 meeting. His claim was unanimously opposed by the European members of the G7, the French president's office said Friday.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald Trump, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's President Emmanuel Macron chat during a family photo at the G7 Summit in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, June 8, 2018. (Xinhua/REUTERS) QUEBEC CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G7) summit, which kicked off here on Friday, is expected to be a tough meeting between the United States and its allies amid raising concerns over U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The leaders of the G7, the world's most powerful industrialized countries including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Japan and the United States, meet every year to discuss collaboration on issues like world economy, climate change, security and peace. Upon his arrival in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, U.S. President Donald Trump had a brief discussion with French President Emmanuel Macron on issues concerning trade and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), according to media reports. The official themes for this year's summit include increasing investments and creating jobs to boost growth and advancing gender equality. However, the confrontation over Washington's unilateral decision to impose metal tariffs on imports from the European Union (EU) and Canada might dominate the summit. Trump's rejection of the global climate accord and Iran nuclear deal have also divided the G7. "It appears to be one against six since none of the other countries took aggressive action against the U.S. and it is the U.S. attacking its own allies," said Perrin Beatty, president and chief executive officer of the 200,000-member Canadian Chamber of Commerce, in an interview. The head of Canada's largest business association is at a nearby media center looking for signs as to whether Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- and the European Union (EU) as a participant -- can convince the United States to rethink its anti-trade strategy. "What we have is a president who has undermined the trust of the other six leaders around the table, and that will make it much more difficult to have a common front on other issues as well," said Beatty, a former senior Canadian cabinet minister. In response to the U.S. import tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada followed the EU's lead and threatened to impose its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Canada has announced import duties against U.S. steel and aluminum as well as 71 categories of consumer and industrial goods that target the home states of prominent Republican members of Congress, such as fruit jams from Wisconsin -- the home state of House Speaker Paul Ryan -- and whiskies from Kentucky, -- the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. "We are hurt and we're insulted," said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland in a recent CNN interview on the U.S. tariffs against Canada. Beatty credited the Canadian government with crafting the tariffs -- which would come into effect on July 1 if the Trump administration didn't withdraw its import taxes -- to "maximize the impact within certain regions of the U.S. while minimizing the impact on Canada, and trying to find, wherever possible, a Canadian or other supplier to provide the products." However, he said Canada's business community has a "real concern" with how Trump is attacking what should be the goal of having "free and open" trade. "We've seen a succession of measures taken by the president directed at close allies and friends of the U.S. that are destructive, and that will inflict serious and direct damage on the U.S. economy as well as its partners' economies," said Beatty. "Yet he seems oblivious to the consequences." A tariff the U.S. Commerce Department imposed earlier this year on Canadian newsprint has increased costs for newspaper publishers and now imperils the fate of local papers across the United States, Beatty said. The Trump administration has also slapped tougher tariffs on Canada's softwood lumber industry, but that has resulted in driving up the cost of housing and furniture in the United States and making American furniture manufacturers less competitive, Beatty said.

News article:
Frankfurt – One viral photo is telling it all about tensions at the G-7 summit. A picture of U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel displaying less-than-friendly body language is turning out to be a defining image of the contentious meeting of the Group of Seven leaders of the world’s advanced economies. The picture, snapped Saturday by German government photographer Jesco Denzel, shows a standing Merkel with her hands firmly planted on a table staring down at Trump, who is seated with his arms folded and eyes glaring. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stands next to Trump, also with folded arms, as French President Emmanuel Macron leans in next to Merkel. The photo was tweeted by Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert. Shortly afterward, the White House issued a separate photo showing a sitting Trump speaking as Merkel, Abe and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listen. The BBC parsed the picture by identifying all nine individuals in it, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is barely visible, and Larry Kudlow, head of Trump’s National Economic Council as well as several Japanese officials and U.S. national security adviser John Bolton. Another image of the same gathering however suggests a more relaxed interaction, with Merkel smiling and Trump making eye contact. The G-7 — an informal annual summit of democracies with highly developed economies — took place Friday and Saturday in the Quebec resort town of Charlevoix in Canada, which holds the rotating leadership this year. Saturday’s picture was not the first awkward moment between Trump and Merkel, who makes no secret of her disagreement with the American leader’s approach on trade, his rejection of the deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program and his decision to take the United States out of the global Paris deal to fight climate change. Merkel’s March 2017 visit to the White House was marked by Trump either not hearing or ignoring her offer to shake hands in the Oval Office. A subsequent visit in April this year warranted only a working lunch for the German leader, several days after fellow EU leader Macron got the full, formal state dinner treatment from Trump. The Charlevoix G-7 summit was marked by sharp disagreements over Trump’s decision to impose higher import taxes on aluminum and steel imports. The measure hits EU trading partners even though the main target is overcapacity at state-backed Chinese producers, who Europe and the U.S. have long complained have flooded markets with cheap steel. The G-7 summit participants managed to patch over their disagreements and agree to disagree on some issues in a joint final statement. Yet after leaving the summit, Trump tweeted that he would instruct U.S. officials not to endorse the G-7 statement, after objecting to comments from summit host Trudeau.

* Twitter messages can destroy trust in seconds-German minister * France, Germany stand by G7 communique (Adds quotes) By Michael Nienaber BERLIN, June 10 (Reuters) - Germany and France on Sunday sharply criticised U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to abruptly withdraw his support for a Group of Seven communique, accusing him of destroying trust and acting inconsistently. Having left the G7 summit in Canada early, Trump's announcement on Twitter that he was backing out of the joint communique torpedoed what appeared to be a fragile consensus on a trade dispute between Washington and its top allies. Trump also took aim at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and said he might double down on import tariffs by hitting the sensitive auto industry, throwing the G7's efforts to show a united front into disarray. G7 members Germany and France said they stood by the communique despite Trump's decision. "In a matter of seconds, you can destroy trust with 280 Twitter characters," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said when asked about Trump's U-turn, adding it would take much longer to rebuild lost trust. Trump's conduct was "actually not a real surprise, we have seen this with the climate agreement or the Iran deal," Maas, a senior member of the Social Democrats, a partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition, told reporters in Berlin. France and Europe are standing by the G7 communique, a French presidency official said, adding anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their "incoherence and inconsistency". "International cooperation cannot depend on being angry and on sound bites. Let's be serious," the French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Trump has infuriated the European Union, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Trump and European allies are also at odds over Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement to combat global warming. "We have to keep a cool head now and draw the right conclusions," Maas said. Europe's answer must be to stick even closer together, defend its interests and strengthen alliances with countries such as Japan and Canada, he said. "Europe united is the answer to America First," Maas said in a tweet. A German government spokesman said that Berlin continues to support the G7 communique despite Trump's decision. "Germany stands by the jointly agreed communique," spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. The top White House economic adviser accused Canada's prime minister on Sunday of betraying Trump with "polarising" statements on U.S. trade policy that risked undermining the American leader on the eve of a historic summit with North Korea. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, lashed out at Trudeau as "amateurish" and "sophomoric" for a news conference he gave after Trump left the G7 summit on Saturday. In his press conference, Trudeau had spoken of retaliatory measures that Canada would take next month in response to Trump's decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

* Twitter messages can destroy trust in seconds-German minister * France, Germany stand by G7 communique (Adds quotes) By Michael Nienaber BERLIN, June 10 (Reuters) - Germany and France on Sunday sharply criticised U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to abruptly withdraw his support for a Group of Seven communique, accusing him of destroying trust and acting inconsistently. Having left the G7 summit in Canada early, Trump's announcement on Twitter that he was backing out of the joint communique torpedoed what appeared to be a fragile consensus on a trade dispute between Washington and its top allies. Trump also took aim at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and said he might double down on import tariffs by hitting the sensitive auto industry, throwing the G7's efforts to show a united front into disarray. G7 members Germany and France said they stood by the communique despite Trump's decision. "In a matter of seconds, you can destroy trust with 280 Twitter characters," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said when asked about Trump's U-turn, adding it would take much longer to rebuild lost trust. Trump's conduct was "actually not a real surprise, we have seen this with the climate agreement or the Iran deal," Maas, a senior member of the Social Democrats, a partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition, told reporters in Berlin. France and Europe are standing by the G7 communique, a French presidency official said, adding anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their "incoherence and inconsistency". "International cooperation cannot depend on being angry and on sound bites. Let's be serious," the French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Trump has infuriated the European Union, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Trump and European allies are also at odds over Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement to combat global warming. "We have to keep a cool head now and draw the right conclusions," Maas said. Europe's answer must be to stick even closer together, defend its interests and strengthen alliances with countries such as Japan and Canada, he said. "Europe united is the answer to America First," Maas said in a tweet. A German government spokesman said that Berlin continues to support the G7 communique despite Trump's decision. "Germany stands by the jointly agreed communique," spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. The top White House economic adviser accused Canada's prime minister on Sunday of betraying Trump with "polarising" statements on U.S. trade policy that risked undermining the American leader on the eve of a historic summit with North Korea. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, lashed out at Trudeau as "amateurish" and "sophomoric" for a news conference he gave after Trump left the G7 summit on Saturday. In his press conference, Trudeau had spoken of retaliatory measures that Canada would take next month in response to Trump's decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

© Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg U.S. Isolationism Migration Tensions Chancellor Angela Merkel made a forceful pitch for Europe to play a more assertive role in global affairs as U.S. President Donald Trump dismantles the post-World War II order, setting the stage for a potential tense standoff at the Group of Seven summit this week.The German leader again questioned the durability of trans-Atlantic relations by referring to eye-raising comments she made over a year ago in which she said that "the times when we could fully rely on others are to some extent over." Those words, spoken at a beer-tent election rally, were a reaction to Trump hectoring European leaders for not spending enough on defense at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels. Since then, more fuel has been added to the fire."That was my takeaway from the NATO summit, and in the meantime I continue to feel confirmed by my statement," Merkel said in Munich on Wednesday, this time to a meeting of the European People's Party, a grouping of center-right parties in the European Parliament.In addition to the disruptive effects of the rift in NATO and Trump's exit from the Paris global climate treaty, Merkel pointed to the fresh conflict over trade and the U.S. leader's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord last month.Merkel told the EPP.The German chancellor has taken a firmer stance leading up to the two-day G-7 gathering in Canada, which starts Friday. Earlier on Wednesday, Europe's most experienced government leader vowed to challenge Trump on trade and climate, saying the lack of room for compromise means leaders may fail to agree on a final statement.Trump's "America First" doctrine shows that "we have a serious problem with multilateral agreements," Merkel told German lawmakers, adding that failure to reach common ground could lead to the highly unusual step of host Canada issuing a concluding statement not agreed to by all participants.With Trump's unpredictable leadership and the U.S. turn toward isolationism , Merkel said that the European Union needs to hone its response to a raft of issues in an environment in which global institutions need to be "newly proven."The 28-member bloc -- soon to lose the U.K. after the 2016 referendum to exit the EU -- managed to grapple with a financial meltdown and the biggest influx of refugees since World War II only with "great effort," Merkel said. "But we don't have a sufficient foundation to confront crises of the future," she added, underscoring her push for reforms.To give the region more political heft, she called for joint action on security and migration, saying the bloc should "Europeanize" its presence on the United Nations Security Council. A rotating group of about 10 member states could work with veto-power France and the European Commission in order to "speak with one European voice" on the global stage, the chancellor said.The effort involves resolving tensions over migration. The contentious issue has driven a wedge between states calling for asylum seekers to be distributed within the bloc and those -- particularly in central and eastern Europe -- insisting migrants must be kept out.Merkel said, citing freedom of movement across the EU's borders.

News article:
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/12512/germany-russia-sanctions President Trump is taking flak for having introduced a subject to the G-7 meeting that our European friends wanted to keep under the table. Russia. The allies expressed horror when Mr. Trump said, “Why are we having a meeting without Russia? We have a world to run… We should have Russia at the negotiating table.” Aside from the hyperbole over who actually runs the world, his comment and the allied response are only shocking if one thinks the Europeans have been boycotting Russia. There are sanctions on Moscow since it illegally invaded and seized Ukraine and Crimea, but sanctions are one thing and trade is another. Germany leads the pack in trade with Russia. This may have something to do with the fact that Germany, in particular but not only, stays warm in the winter with Russian natural gas meeting about 40% of its requirements. This is an old story. The Reagan administration objected to Russian-European plans to build the natural gas Yamal Pipeline from Siberia to Germany from which gas would be distributed to much of Western Europe. The American position was that, In the middle of the Cold War, having the USSR control a majority of the supply of natural gas to Germany’s industrial heartland would make it difficult for Germany to resist Russian political and military demands. But the Europeans wanted to sell Russia the machinery for the pipeline, making money as they mortgaged their energy future to Moscow. After a bitter fight, the Yamal pipeline was partially blocked and only one strand of two was built. Post-Soviet, the Russians were able, with European support, to build the second strand. In the early 2000’s Europe bought into yet another Russian-originated pipeline — an undersea project called Nord Stream — again providing manufacturing jobs and pipeline work for Europe as well as gas. Early in 2018, Bloomberg reported, “Russia, which shipped some $38 billion of gas to its most lucrative markets in Europe last year, has diminished thoughts that other suppliers could ensure supplies in Europe anytime soon.” Nord Stream, and its successor Nord Stream 2, will give Russia the same influence its predecessor, the USSR, would have had. Russia is now a fine partner for Europe. The Vice President of the Bundestag Thomas Opperman said, “Nord Stream 2 is an important economic project, which we support and it should not be threatened by sanctions from third countries.” Mrs. Merkel would agree, no doubt, not only for the warmth, but because the pipeline will enter Germany at Greifswald in the old East Germany, part of her constituency. The underwater Nord Stream 2 will reduce the price of natural gas by about 40% compared to overland pipelines, benefitting Germany, the UK, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands — among the countries most outspoken about the invasion of Ukraine. But to make Nord Stream 2 work, Gazprom has to get out of old contracts with Ukraine and Poland. Gazprom is presently suing Ukraine in the international arbitration court in Stockholm to cancel both its gas supply and transit contracts, stiffing Kiev. Ukraine won the first round, but Russia appealed. In the wake of the Ukrainian victory, the EU offered to “mediate” between the two. Mediate away a favorable judgment for Ukraine? Isn’t this whole Russia-boycott project about Putin’s interference in Ukraine’s march to democracy? Talk about collusion. So, now that we are clear on Germany and the EU’s interest in maintaining economic ties with Russia, consider why they are pretending to keep Putin out in the hallway. Russia, they say, is out because of its horrendous behavior in Ukraine, but — while no additional sanctions have been imposed for Russian support for the Syrian war criminal regime of Bashar Assad (which may make Moscow complicit in war crimes) — Syria is on European minds. Germany, in particular, has had harsh words for Russia over its veto of 12 UN Security Council Resolutions on Syria. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters, “We can’t go on like this… So, we’re keeping up the political pressure on Russia and we’d like to increase it further. Getting Russia to change its behavior is a condition for solving the Syria conflict.” Germany has backed allied air strikes on Syria as “necessary and appropriate.” While claiming to be appalled by Russia’s behavior in Syria, however, Germany continues to push trade not only with Russia, but with Russia’s partner in the Syrian genocide, Iran. European firms raced to enter Iran under the terms of the 2015 JCPOA; American firms were less aggressive. But since the U.S. has withdrawn from the never-signed deal, major European companies have been winding down or winding up operations in Iran. At the same time, though, the EU has begun to update its ” blocking statute,” the most powerful response it has to prevent European companies from complying with impending Iran sanctions. In what Mrs. Merkel has said is a bid to “protect European companies” in Iran, the statute will nullify in Europe punishment the U.S. imposes for sanctions violations and allows EU companies to sue for damages caused by leaving Iran for fear of U.S. sanctions. So, the EU will use its leverage to keep companies in a country, Iran, that hangs gay people from cranes in the street, holds American hostages, threatens democratic Israel with annihilation, participates fully in the Syrian genocide, and actively seeks nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. And as Iran seeks military technology, Germany obliges. In 2016, with government permission, the German company Krempel sold electronic press boards to Iranian companies. The German newspaper Bild reported that Krempel parts were discovered at the site of a Syrian government chemical attack on its civilian population. The Jerusalem Post said the technology was used in the rockets that delivered the chemicals . Krempel didn’t deny it, telling Bild the company was “shocked” to find its product in Syria. A 2018 German intelligence report confirms that Iran is currently seeking nuclear technology in Germany. Since the 2015 JCPOA, Germany, has been Iran’s largest European trading partner: 2.9 billion euros in 2016 according to the German government and 3.6 billion euros in 2017. Interestingly, the trade goes only one way: in 2016, Germany exported 2.6 billion euros worth to Iran and took back only 300 million euros. According to Deutsche Welle, Germany imports dried fruits, pistachios, rugs and industrial raw materials from Iran and sends machinery and equipment, cars, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical products, and takes back Chemicals, machinery, industrial raw materials for Iran’s mullahs. What could go wrong? In sum, then, President Trump’s faux pas appears to be having the temerity to suggest that Russia — a key German trading partner — have a place at the table for international trade talks. Perhaps it would be better to leave the hypocritical Germany out in the hallway.

In what Mrs. Merkel has said is a bid to “protect European companies” in Iran, the statute will nullify in Europe punishment the U.S. imposes for sanctions violations and allows EU companies to sue for damages caused by leaving Iran for fear of U.S. sanctions. So, the EU will use its leverage to keep companies in a country, Iran, that hangs gay people from cranes in the street, holds American hostages, threatens democratic Israel with annihilation, participates fully in the Syrian genocide, and actively seeks nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. And as Iran seeks military technology, Germany obliges. In 2016, with government permission, the German company Krempel sold electronic press boards to Iranian companies. The German newspaper Bild reported that Krempel parts were discovered at the site of a Syrian government chemical attack on its civilian population. The Jerusalem Post said the technology was used in the rockets that delivered the chemicals . Krempel didn’t deny it, telling Bild the company was “shocked” to find its product in Syria. A 2018 German intelligence report confirms that Iran is currently seeking nuclear technology in Germany. Since the 2015 JCPOA, Germany, has been Iran’s largest European trading partner: 2.9 billion euros in 2016 according to the German government and 3.6 billion euros in 2017. Interestingly, the trade goes only one way: in 2016, Germany exported 2.6 billion euros worth to Iran and took back only 300 million euros. According to Deutsche Welle, Germany imports dried fruits, pistachios, rugs and industrial raw materials from Iran and sends machinery and equipment, cars, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical products, and takes back Chemicals, machinery, industrial raw materials for Iran’s mullahs. What could go wrong? In sum, then, President Trump’s faux pas appears to be having the temerity to suggest that Russia — a key German trading partner — have a place at the table for international trade talks. Perhaps it would be better to leave the hypocritical Germany out in the hallway.

News article:
The head of NATO has warned that splits between the U.S. and its European allies risk endangering the trans-Atlantic security alliance. In an editorial in The Guardian, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg writes that "the ties that bind us are under strain." He said: "We must continue to work hard to settle our differences—and where differences persist, we must limit any negative impact on our security cooperation." Stoltenberg's warning follows attacks on German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday by President Donald Trump, who criticized Germany over its immigration policy and taunted Merkel over a cabinet crisis that threatens her leadership. Trump tweeted Monday that Germans are "turning against their leadership" over immigration and falsely claimed that immigrants had caused a spike in crime rates. Stoltenberg's message comes less than a month before NATO leaders are set to meet in Brussels. In the article, he enumerated deep divisions between the U.S. and Europe, but he expressed his belief that NATO leaders could overcome their differences and the alliance could endure. "Since the alliance was created almost 70 years ago, the people of Europe and North America have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. But, at the political level, the ties which bind us are under strain. "There are real differences between the United States and other allies over issues such as trade, climate change and the Iran nuclear agreement. "These disagreements are real and they won't disappear overnight. In fact, nowhere is it written in stone that the transatlantic bond will always thrive. That doesn't, however, mean that its breakdown is inevitable. We can maintain it, and all the mutual benefits we derive from it." Trump's attacks on Europe came as he faces fierce domestic criticism over his administration's policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexican border and holding them in mass detention centers. Trump also clashed with Europe after pulling out of the Paris climate deal in the first year of his presidency, and in May after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. He has also castigated European nations for failing to meet their NATO military spending commitments, and for what he claims are unfair trade practices.

News article:
Europe seeks to pin down President Trump – and America Caroline Glick http://carolineglick.com/europe-seeks-to-pin-down-president-trump-and-america/ National Security Advisor John Bolton said last Wednesday that while discussion of President Donald Trump’s decision to leave the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has centered on the administration’s revulsion with its institutional anti-Israel bias, the move was really about restoring American control over U.S. foreign policy. In his words: “We did talk about Israel [in setting out our reasons for leaving the UNHRC] because it’s singled out unfairly. But in many respects, Israel is, as the saying goes, ‘the canary in the mine shaft’ for the United States. Countries that attack Israel do so because they think it’s easier, but much of their criticism is really aimed at us.” Bolton added, “Getting off of the council is an assertion of America’s determination to stick to its Constitution and not to recognize that there’s some ‘higher authority’ at the UN … to judge our performance or to give us advice on how to implement the constitution … That’s what this is about: self-government.” The Trump administration’s determination to restore American power and independence in the international arena places it on a collision course with the European Union, whose perspective on the proper goal of international affairs is diametrically opposed to the administration’s. American power abroad rests on military and economic power. Since the end of the Second World War, Europe has been militarily dependent on the U.S. Rather than build their own military power to secure their interests and enable them to play a leading role in world affairs, European leaders have based their international position on their power as a voting bloc in international and transnational institutions, and on their collective financial power. Since the mid-1970s, Europe has used its power in international institutions and its financial power to advance one consistent policy position: hostility towards Israel. The UNHRC is a perfect vehicle for advancing Europe’s foreign policy. Its name gives it a do-gooder halo effect. The notion that a “human rights council” could be anything but a force for good in the world is hard to accept. But a year after it was established, the council focused its efforts not on protecting human rights, but on attacking the human rights of Jews in Israel. In 2007, the UNHRC passed Permanent Agenda Item 7. Item 7 created a separate standard for judging the Jewish state. Under Item 7, Israel is automatically subjected to condemnation for every action it takes to defend itself. Under Item 7, the council automatically embraces every Palestinian libel against Israel. To get a sense of how this agenda item has perverted the council, from 2006-2016, the council passed 135 resolutions in total. 68 were condemnations of Israel. Syria was condemned 20 times, North Korea nine, and Iran six. In her remarks Tuesday explaining America’s decision to leave the UNHRC, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley expressed frustration at the fact that Europe had refused to assist in the U.S.’s efforts to reform the UNHRC by, among other things, cancelling Agenda Item 7. In her words: There are several countries on the Human Rights Council who do share our values. Many of them strongly urged us to remain engaged in the council. They are embarrassed by the obsessive mistreatment of Israel. … Ultimately, many of these likeminded countries were unwilling to seriously challenge the status quo. We gave them opportunity after opportunity and many months of consultations, and yet they would not take a stand unless it was behind closed doors. Some even admittedly were fine with the blatant flaws of the council as long as they could pursue their own narrow agenda within the current structure. Haley attributed their refusal to help to cowardice – or what she called “moral compromise.” Haley’s explanation for Europe’s refusal to work with the U.S. on what she thought was a common goal of ending the UNHRC’s anti-Semitism was reasonable, but wrong. And her mistake was understandable. The EU and its member nations go to great lengths to hide the fact that they are on the opposite side of the fence from the U.S. in regards to Israel specifically and the issue of nationalism and U.S. independence more broadly. The day before Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the U.S. withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson addressed the body. His speech was a case study in how this double game works. Johnson began his address by offering fulsome praise for the UNHRC. Johnson said, “Britain considers this Council to be part of the rules-based international system in which we believe and that we strive to protect.: He then proceeded to pay lip service to America’s opposition to the council’s institutional bias against Israel. “I will say that we share the [U.S.] view that a dedicated agenda item focused solely on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories is disproportionate and damaging to the cause of peace and unless things change, we shall move next year to vote against all resolutions introduced under Item 7.” Then he went back to roundly praising the council. “But I stress that that does not mean that we in the UK are blind to the value of this Council – including the work it could do on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict under the right agenda item – and we support its emphasis on freedom of religion and expression and the empowerment of women.” Johnson devoted the rest of his remarks to an impassioned call for universal K-12 education for girls worldwide as a means to “solve the majority of the world’s most serious problems.” Three things stand out in Johnson’s speech. First, while he said that Britain supports a “rules-based international system,” he effectively endorsed the destruction of all rules in the international system. Permanent Agenda Item 7 created a set of rules that it applies only to Israel. Under the rules it set up, Israel is always guilty of abusing human rights. By setting up a system of rules it applies only to the Jewish state, Item 7 abolished the entire notion of international law. After all, if there is one law for Jews, and another law for everyone else, then there is no rule of law at all. If his statement about Britain’s commitment to the “rules-based international system,” were serious, then Britain would have withdrawn from the council with the U.S. By remaining in, and praising, the UNHRC, Johnson made clear that Britain couldn’t care less about a “rules-based international system.” The second thing that stands out in his speech is the disingenuousness of his opposition to Item 7. Johnson said that the UK opposes Item 7 because it is “disproportionate and damaging to the cause of peace.” Let us leave aside the fact that Item 7 scuppers the entire system of international law and judge Johnson’s credibility within the limited scope of his statement. Johnson said that due to the “disproportionate” character of anti-Israel resolutions, Britain will stop voting in favor of those drafted in the framework of Item 7 in six months. Why the long wait? If Britain really views Item 7 as damaging to the cause of peace, then in the interest of peace Britain must oppose all Item 7 resolutions effective yesterday. The six-month waiting period tells us that Britain is not serious about peace, and that it is not at all upset with the fact that Item 7 is “disproportionate” (whatever that means). The final notable aspect of Johnson’s speech was his ode to universal female education. Johnson’s impassioned cri de coeur speech was remarkable for its irrelevance. True, educating girls would have a positive impact on many of the world’s major problems. But the UNHRC has about as much power to bring about K-12 education for the girls of Nigeria and Yemen as Micronesia has of dictating world oil prices. Apparently, in presenting his pie-in-the-sky plan, Johnson was advocating on behalf of what Haley referred to as a “narrow agenda,” which he apparently believes is so important it justifies remaining in an institutionally anti-Semitic body. In short, Johnson pretended to side with the U.S in its opposition to the UNHRC’s antisemitism while he substantively endorsed that antisemitism. Finally, Johnson pretended that Britain cares about human rights with his plea for universal K-12 education for girls. But actually, he was just bloviating. Three days before he made his manipulative speech, Israel’s Channel 10 reported that Johnson is trying to organize a meeting of European and Arab foreign ministers with Trump’s senior advisor Jared Kushner, who is leading the U.S. team forming a new U.S. plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for July. It is supposed to serve as an opportunity for the Europeans and the Arabs to present their “red lines” for peace. In light of Europe’s institutional hostility towards Israel, and given the collective Arab rejection of Israel’s right to exist, it is obvious that Johnson doesn’t want this meeting because he is keen to advance the cause of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He is working to set up a meeting where the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan gang up on the U.S. and tell the President’s son-in-law that they will not accept any plan that doesn’t reflect their animus towards Israel. Kushner, for his part, reportedly responded to Johnson’s attempt to railroad the White House into giving the EU veto power over U.S. Middle East policy by saying that while he is open to outside input in the U.S. peace plan, the President will decide its contents. Kushner’s response hit the proper note. But it bears pointing out that Johnson’s speech at the UNHRC, like his attempt to build a coalition to ensnare the White House in a Middle East policy predicated on hostility towards Israel, show that Europe’s refusal to back the U.S.’s positions at the UNHRC was not a simple disagreement about the best way to achieve common ends. Rather, Johnson’s efforts reveal a much more basic and unbridgeable conflict between the U.S. and Europe about the proper ends of foreign policy, and the sovereign right of the U.S. to advance its goals in the international arena.

Europe seeks to pin down President Trump – and America Caroline Glick http://carolineglick.com/europe-seeks-to-pin-down-president-trump-and-america/ National Security Advisor John Bolton said last Wednesday that while discussion of President Donald Trump’s decision to leave the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has centered on the administration’s revulsion with its institutional anti-Israel bias, the move was really about restoring American control over U.S. foreign policy. In his words: “We did talk about Israel [in setting out our reasons for leaving the UNHRC] because it’s singled out unfairly. But in many respects, Israel is, as the saying goes, ‘the canary in the mine shaft’ for the United States. Countries that attack Israel do so because they think it’s easier, but much of their criticism is really aimed at us.” Bolton added, “Getting off of the council is an assertion of America’s determination to stick to its Constitution and not to recognize that there’s some ‘higher authority’ at the UN … to judge our performance or to give us advice on how to implement the constitution … That’s what this is about: self-government.” The Trump administration’s determination to restore American power and independence in the international arena places it on a collision course with the European Union, whose perspective on the proper goal of international affairs is diametrically opposed to the administration’s. American power abroad rests on military and economic power. Since the end of the Second World War, Europe has been militarily dependent on the U.S. Rather than build their own military power to secure their interests and enable them to play a leading role in world affairs, European leaders have based their international position on their power as a voting bloc in international and transnational institutions, and on their collective financial power. Since the mid-1970s, Europe has used its power in international institutions and its financial power to advance one consistent policy position: hostility towards Israel. The UNHRC is a perfect vehicle for advancing Europe’s foreign policy. Its name gives it a do-gooder halo effect. The notion that a “human rights council” could be anything but a force for good in the world is hard to accept. But a year after it was established, the council focused its efforts not on protecting human rights, but on attacking the human rights of Jews in Israel. In 2007, the UNHRC passed Permanent Agenda Item 7. Item 7 created a separate standard for judging the Jewish state. Under Item 7, Israel is automatically subjected to condemnation for every action it takes to defend itself. Under Item 7, the council automatically embraces every Palestinian libel against Israel. To get a sense of how this agenda item has perverted the council, from 2006-2016, the council passed 135 resolutions in total. 68 were condemnations of Israel. Syria was condemned 20 times, North Korea nine, and Iran six. In her remarks Tuesday explaining America’s decision to leave the UNHRC, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley expressed frustration at the fact that Europe had refused to assist in the U.S.’s efforts to reform the UNHRC by, among other things, cancelling Agenda Item 7. In her words: There are several countries on the Human Rights Council who do share our values. Many of them strongly urged us to remain engaged in the council. They are embarrassed by the obsessive mistreatment of Israel. … Ultimately, many of these likeminded countries were unwilling to seriously challenge the status quo. We gave them opportunity after opportunity and many months of consultations, and yet they would not take a stand unless it was behind closed doors. Some even admittedly were fine with the blatant flaws of the council as long as they could pursue their own narrow agenda within the current structure. Haley attributed their refusal to help to cowardice – or what she called “moral compromise.” Haley’s explanation for Europe’s refusal to work with the U.S. on what she thought was a common goal of ending the UNHRC’s anti-Semitism was reasonable, but wrong. And her mistake was understandable. The EU and its member nations go to great lengths to hide the fact that they are on the opposite side of the fence from the U.S. in regards to Israel specifically and the issue of nationalism and U.S. independence more broadly. The day before Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the U.S. withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson addressed the body. His speech was a case study in how this double game works. Johnson began his address by offering fulsome praise for the UNHRC. Johnson said, “Britain considers this Council to be part of the rules-based international system in which we believe and that we strive to protect.: He then proceeded to pay lip service to America’s opposition to the council’s institutional bias against Israel. “I will say that we share the [U.S.] view that a dedicated agenda item focused solely on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories is disproportionate and damaging to the cause of peace and unless things change, we shall move next year to vote against all resolutions introduced under Item 7.” Then he went back to roundly praising the council. “But I stress that that does not mean that we in the UK are blind to the value of this Council – including the work it could do on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict under the right agenda item – and we support its emphasis on freedom of religion and expression and the empowerment of women.” Johnson devoted the rest of his remarks to an impassioned call for universal K-12 education for girls worldwide as a means to “solve the majority of the world’s most serious problems.” Three things stand out in Johnson’s speech. First, while he said that Britain supports a “rules-based international system,” he effectively endorsed the destruction of all rules in the international system. Permanent Agenda Item 7 created a set of rules that it applies only to Israel. Under the rules it set up, Israel is always guilty of abusing human rights. By setting up a system of rules it applies only to the Jewish state, Item 7 abolished the entire notion of international law. After all, if there is one law for Jews, and another law for everyone else, then there is no rule of law at all. If his statement about Britain’s commitment to the “rules-based international system,” were serious, then Britain would have withdrawn from the council with the U.S. By remaining in, and praising, the UNHRC, Johnson made clear that Britain couldn’t care less about a “rules-based international system.” The second thing that stands out in his speech is the disingenuousness of his opposition to Item 7. Johnson said that the UK opposes Item 7 because it is “disproportionate and damaging to the cause of peace.” Let us leave aside the fact that Item 7 scuppers the entire system of international law and judge Johnson’s credibility within the limited scope of his statement. Johnson said that due to the “disproportionate” character of anti-Israel resolutions, Britain will stop voting in favor of those drafted in the framework of Item 7 in six months. Why the long wait? If Britain really views Item 7 as damaging to the cause of peace, then in the interest of peace Britain must oppose all Item 7 resolutions effective yesterday. The six-month waiting period tells us that Britain is not serious about peace, and that it is not at all upset with the fact that Item 7 is “disproportionate” (whatever that means). The final notable aspect of Johnson’s speech was his ode to universal female education. Johnson’s impassioned cri de coeur speech was remarkable for its irrelevance. True, educating girls would have a positive impact on many of the world’s major problems. But the UNHRC has about as much power to bring about K-12 education for the girls of Nigeria and Yemen as Micronesia has of dictating world oil prices. Apparently, in presenting his pie-in-the-sky plan, Johnson was advocating on behalf of what Haley referred to as a “narrow agenda,” which he apparently believes is so important it justifies remaining in an institutionally anti-Semitic body. In short, Johnson pretended to side with the U.S in its opposition to the UNHRC’s antisemitism while he substantively endorsed that antisemitism. Finally, Johnson pretended that Britain cares about human rights with his plea for universal K-12 education for girls. But actually, he was just bloviating. Three days before he made his manipulative speech, Israel’s Channel 10 reported that Johnson is trying to organize a meeting of European and Arab foreign ministers with Trump’s senior advisor Jared Kushner, who is leading the U.S. team forming a new U.S. plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for July. It is supposed to serve as an opportunity for the Europeans and the Arabs to present their “red lines” for peace. In light of Europe’s institutional hostility towards Israel, and given the collective Arab rejection of Israel’s right to exist, it is obvious that Johnson doesn’t want this meeting because he is keen to advance the cause of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He is working to set up a meeting where the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan gang up on the U.S. and tell the President’s son-in-law that they will not accept any plan that doesn’t reflect their animus towards Israel. Kushner, for his part, reportedly responded to Johnson’s attempt to railroad the White House into giving the EU veto power over U.S. Middle East policy by saying that while he is open to outside input in the U.S. peace plan, the President will decide its contents. Kushner’s response hit the proper note. But it bears pointing out that Johnson’s speech at the UNHRC, like his attempt to build a coalition to ensnare the White House in a Middle East policy predicated on hostility towards Israel, show that Europe’s refusal to back the U.S.’s positions at the UNHRC was not a simple disagreement about the best way to achieve common ends. Rather, Johnson’s efforts reveal a much more basic and unbridgeable conflict between the U.S. and Europe about the proper ends of foreign policy, and the sovereign right of the U.S. to advance its goals in the international arena.

© European Jewish Congress European Council President Donald Tusk says the European Union must prepare for the worst due to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, asIn a pre-summit invitation letter to the leaders of EU countries Wednesday, Tusk wrote thatTusk, who chairs the two-day summit starting Thursday in Brussels, said thatIt is my belief that, while hoping for the best, we must be ready to prepare our Union for worst-case scenarios," he wrote.Earlier this month, Trump imposed tariffs on imports of European steel and aluminum.which the EU insists is pure protectionism, and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal - an agreement the Europeans say is vital to their security-Trump is also threatening to introduce tariffs on cars, which could heavily impact Germany.EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said that while the EU does have higher tariffs on cars than the U.S. - around 10 percent versus 2 percent - the tariffs only apply to a fraction of the car market, around 15 percent. The U.S. has higher tariffs on trucks and other products, she said.Malmstrom said the EU cannot lift its car tariffs for the United States or it would have to do so for the rest of the world, and "there's no way" EU member countries would agree to that.

Topic: Security Region: Americas Tags: NATOAlliancesAlliesNational SecurityDonald Trump Alliances allow America to effectively restrain its allies from large conflicts. Recently, following a meeting with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) G7, United States President Donald Trump used Twitter to express his frustrations with the European alliance network. The president noted that the United States pays “close to the entire cost of NATO— protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade.” He also said that “Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP.” In these tweets, Trump echoes two large myths about America’s alliance system. These myths are that NATO allies free ride off the United States and that American allies provide little-to-no security benefit. The idea that European allies free ride off U.S. security spending is long-standing. George Kennan posited that a united Europe would effectively balance against the Soviet Union, but politicians are less trusting. Dwight Eisenhower frequently lamented that European allies were not spending enough for their defense. Furthermore, historical documents show that, when England cut its defense spending in the mid-1960s, the Johnson administration was noticeably frustrated. Moreover, according to Pew Research Center’s surveys conducted since the end of the Cold War, most Americans support NATO, but a large proportion believes Washington’s policymakers spend too much money helping the organization. In other words, Americans think that NATO allies are paying their “fair share” on defense, and thereby take advantage of U.S. security spending. Consequently, there is broad acceptance regarding the myth of a free riding NATO. The problem is that this myth ignores Kennan’s still-standing Cold War logic. For Kennan, the central idea of NATO was to de-securitize Western European states and, paradoxically, strengthen European security. This meant that by reducing the Europeans’ state-led processes of increasing power, European states would focus on “collective security” instead of just their own. Such a plan was compelling because, after World War II, European states faced a threat from communism and the Soviet Union. Accordingly, they were willing to avoid things like building nuclear weapons so that they could join Washington’s “security umbrella.” Furthermore, this increased European collective security. Additionally, for the United States, this reduced the likelihood of war between its European allies and provided a way to balance against the Soviet Union. In the present, while there is no Soviet threat, avoiding a European security dilemma is advantageous for Washington. G. John Ikenberry’s book After Victory examines the history of “world order.” He finds that liberal, rules-based orders—like that established by the United States after World War II—last longer and are significantly more peaceful than both hegemonic rule and “balance of power” systems. Two of the most critical contemporary threats to the rules-based order is Russia’s and China’s rising power and their expanding interests throughout Europe. NATO serves to counteract those threats, and in doing so, maintains the international system’s stability. Therefore, retrenching from Europe is another grave threat facing the U.S.-led international order, and one Trump should take seriously. The second myth that Trump’s statements feed is that United States’ alliances provide minimal benefits. Individuals who agree with this argue that Washington’s commitments to its friends both limit America’s ability to establish its supremacy and entrap it into conflict because of contractual obligations. Consequently, by retrenching from formal defense pacts, the United States could elongate its unipolar status. Inverting this logic, however, shows the reality of the situation. First, allies limiting American primacy is a net benefit. Frankly, reducing the amount of war and conflict is inherently advantageous, and can preserve U.S. economic and military strength. In his 2015 article, “The Myth of Entangling Alliances,” Michael Beckley argues that U.S. defense pacts reduce the risks of conflict. This is because, by having many allies across the world, America faces conflicting commitments and needs to restrain itself militarily so that it can satisfy these varying agreements. The offsetting obligations allow Washington to avoid unnecessary conflict. Thus, similar to investment portfolios, America’s significant number of alliances reduce the risk of future war. Furthermore, because of Washington’s dominant position in its alliance hierarchies, it can effectively restrain its allies from great conflicts. Smaller countries that do not want to increase their security risk will not engage in wars that their stronger allies wish to avoid. These small countries see a security benefit from great power alliances, and the former is subservient to the latter. For example, in Asia after World War II, Washington restrained South Korea from attacking North Korea and Taiwan from fighting China via threats to reduce American military and economic support. Moreover, the United States threatened to end its arms sales to Iran, thus forcing Tehran to avoid joining the 1973 oil embargo. Accordingly, America’s alliances provide it leverage that increases its immediate security and decrease global conflict. Overall, Trump and other critics fundamentally misunderstand the benefit to the U.S. alliance network. NATO and other allies serve to maintain the current rules-based international order, reduce Washington’s risk of war, and decrease levels of global conflict. Therefore, abandoning U.S. allies under the guise of “America first” would harm American security, and just mean “America alone.” Jordan Cohen is a Political Science Ph.D. student at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government.

News article:
Ahead of the Brussels summit, the U.S. President Donald Trump lambasted the leaders of NATO allies in harsh letters, warning that the U.S. is losing patience with their failure to meet security obligations within the alliance, widening the rift between its European allies. Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO allies for failing to meet a 2014 commitment to spend two percent of GDP on defense by 2024, accusing them of leaving the U.S. to shoulder an unfair burden for defending Europe. Currently, the U.S. accounts for nearly 72 percent of all defense spending in NATO and only three European countries hit the two percent GDP target, Britain, Greece and Estonia. He was reported saying during the G7 summit in Canada earlier this month that NATO is "as bad as NAFTA." However, Germany, which has had tense ties with the U.S. in recent months, has already indicated it will be unable to meet that goal. German defense spending is currently at 1.22 percent, according to the figures released by NATO. In response, the Trump administration has started evaluating the costs of transferring or withdrawing troops from Germany, where the United States has its biggest contingent outside the country, The Washington Post reported earlier. Among the options under consideration are rep atriating a large contingent of the approximately 35,000 active duty troops, or a full or partial move of the military personnel from Germany to Poland, according to the Post. Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper stressed that the study was only an internal examination of options at this stage. "Continued German underspending on defense undermines the security of the alliance and provides validation for other allies that also do not plan to meet their military spending commitments, because others see you as a role model," Trump said in an individual letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, The New York Times reported. Trump's move came after he rattled his G7 allies with blistering rhetoric about their trading relationships with the United States and a series of scathing remarks about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in response to what he calls unfair trade practices from Europe, Canada, and other allies around the world, who have responded with retaliatory sanctions in kind. Trump has been complaining about the unfair treatment of international organizations and multilateral agreements. First he withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal three days after his inauguration last January and then wanted NAFTA to be renegotiated. Now, U.S. membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is under question as it could greatly hurt global trade, widening the rift between its European allies. His decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was another important factor for the deteriorating ties between the U.S. and its European allies. Trump piled pressure on close allies with a threat to sanction European companies that do business with Iran.

News article:
HAPPENING TODAY: Mattis is scheduled to have lunch today with Trump at the White House. The Pentagon says Mattis, who is just back from his trip to China, as well as consultations with allies South Korea and Japan, is said to have basically cleared his schedule to prepare for the NATO summit July 11-12. Tonight, Trump delivers remarks at the Salute to Service dinner in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. POMPEO TO PYONGYANG: The White House yesterday confirmed reports from last week that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will leave for North Korea on Thursday for a meeting with Kim Jong Un and his “team.” Pompeo will be seeking specific commitments and timetables for North Korea to show it’s serious about meeting a vague commitment it made last month in Singapore “to work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The White House yesterday refused to confirm widely reported U.S. intelligence assessments that the North was preparing to conceal the extent of its nuclear arsenal and related programs. “We aren’t going to confirm or deny any intelligence reports,” said press secretary Sarah Sanders. “What I can tell you is that we’re continuing to make progress. In the last eight months, you haven’t seen missile launches. You haven’t seen nuclear detonations. And again, these conversations are continuing to evolve.” Pompeo plans to wrap up his talks in Pyongyang in time to joint Trump and Mattis at the NATO summit in Brussels. BEIJING BRUSH OFF: Meanwhile, China is dismissing those intel assessments, touting instead the “momentum” behind the denuclearization process. “I don’t know where they come from or on what basis those U.S. officials made the relevant comments,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. “I think you may have to seek clarification from them.” THE ‘CODSPREY’ COMETH: U.S. troops and supplies will have a new way to arrive on aircraft carriers now that the Pentagon has inked a new $4 billion aircraft contract. The contract with Boeing and Bell Helicopter includes 39 of a new Navy variant of the Osprey aircraft, called the CMV-22B, that would land on the massive ship decks and act as a transport. The Marine Corps is set to get 34 of its own “B” variant Osprey aircraft and Japan will buy four under the contract. The carrier transport job is now handled by C-2A Greyhound turboprop aircraft that make catapult launches, harrowing dives and jarring arrested stops onto the carriers. Known as the carrier onboard delivery aircraft, or COD, the Greyhounds were introduced in the 1960s and have had a stellar safety record, despite last year’s emergency water landing in the Philippine Sea that claimed the lives of three crew members. But the CODs were notoriously hot, noisy and uncomfortable, with passengers strapped in backward and given only two small porthole windows. The new “Codsprey” CMV-22B tilt-rotor aircraft will have an enlarged fuel tank for longer range and be able to hover and land on the carriers like a helicopter. HIGH-POWERED ARMY LASER: It may be only a $10 million defense contract, but who doesn’t love laser weapons? Raytheon announced it won the contract to demonstrate a combat-strength 100-kilowatt laser to be mounted on Army trucks, specifically what the service calls its family of medium tactical vehicles. “This system is being designed to knock out rockets, artillery or mortar fire, or small drones,” Roy Azevedo, vice president of intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance systems with the Raytheon space and airborne systems business unit, said in a statement. NO IRAN WAIVERS FOR ALLIES? The United States will not hesitate to enforce sanctions on countries doing business with Iran despite deep concern among allies in Europe, the State Department said Monday. “We will not hesitate to take action when we see sanctionable activity and that is consistent with our policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Iran,” said Brian Hook, the department’s director of policy planning. Waivers for the allies could undermine the Trump administration’s aim of curbing Tehran’s malign activities in the Middle East, Hook said. But he also hinted there might be some flexibility, saying that countries making an effort to reduce Iranian imports such as oil could be considered. CRIMEA NOT IN PLAY: The Kremlin says Russian President Vladimir Putin has no intention of discussing the status of Crimea, a region annexed from Ukraine in 2014, during his summit with Trump. “Crimea cannot and will never be on the agenda because Crimea is an integral part of Russia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said yesterday. “We do not recognize Russia’s attempt to annex Crimea,” Sanders said at the White House yesterday. “We agree to disagree with Russia on that front, and our Crimea sanctions against Russia will remain in place until Russia returns the peninsula to the Ukraine.” TERROR LABEL: The Trump administration is considering designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of Iran’s military, as a foreign terrorist organization, CNN reports. The move is controversial among senior Cabinet officials, as some caution it could jeopardize U.S. personnel and installations overseas. For example, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that the new label could present challenges to U.S. forces. OPERATION ROUNDUP: The U.S. military says the operation to eradicate the remaining elements of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is gaining momentum. In a release yesterday, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve said the coalition and its partners have accelerated offensive activity against ISIS targets in both Iraq and Syria. “Since the May 1 start of Operation Roundup, Syrian Democratic Forces resumed major offensive operations in the Middle Euphrates River Valley,” the statement said. “Since then, the SDF has continued to gain ground through offensive operations coupled with precision Coalition strike support.” The coalition says ISIS morale is “sinking on the frontlines as privileged [ISIS] leaders increasingly abandon their own fighters on the battlefield, taking resources with them as they flee.” TAKING THE MEASURE OF MATTIS: Talk Radio News Pentagon correspondent Tom Squitieri spent some quality time with Mattis on his Asia trip last week, and had an interesting take on how Mattis approached the Chinese. “Mattis is a true soldier. He has fought and led others to victory. For all its strengths and paper prowess, the Chinese military is untested. It may train well yet that guarantees nothing,” Squitieri writes, observing it was Mattis’ legendary military career that was his “secret weapon” to get the Chinese to pay attention to what he said. “The Chinese also know all this about him. It is that war fighting experience, that battlefield success, that they value, that makes his words ones they were open to hearing. That permitted Mattis to press Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders on China’s buildup of military bases on disputed islands in the South China Sea — even as Xi defiantly stated Beijing would not give up ‘an inch of sovereignty,’ according to Chinese media. Mattis did not blink. He pressed the issue of China’s broken promise not to militarize the islands in every meeting except that with the president. In the meeting with Xi, he played his straight flush of geography, history, experience, calmness, and steadfastness.” McMASTER’S NEXT ACT: Former national security adviser retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has been named a visiting fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, beginning Sept. 1. McMaster, who was fired by tweet in March by Trump, will also serve as a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in management. “I am delighted to welcome H.R. McMaster back to the Stanford community,” said FSI Director Michael McFaul, in a statement. “In addition to his insights regarding national security strategy for the academic and policy worlds, we look forward to his contributions to the education and training of future foreign policy leaders from Stanford University.” THE RUNDOWN Bloomberg: Pentagon Hyped $1.2 Billion F-35 Savings Claim, Senators Say Defense News: US spy planes are breaking down ― and lawmakers want answers Stars and Stripes: Former Army Europe boss: Pulling US troops from Germany would be a big win for Russia Business Insider: Trump is trying to increase the pressure on Iran, but that means 'threading the needle' with a major ally Foreign Policy: The EU and NATO and Trump — Oh My!

News article:
President Donald Trump reportedly greeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a massive bill when she visited him soon after he entered the White House. Related: Watch: Angela Merkel looks unamused as Trump brags about saving money on Jerusalem embassy building "Angela, you owe me $1 trillion," Trump said, referring to the gulf between what Germany agreed to contribute to its defense under a NATO arrangement and what it actually spent over the previous 14 years, an official briefed on the meeting told The Wall Street Journal in a story published Sunday. Trump's brash remark to Merkel more than a year ago showcases his insistence that U.S. allies pay more for their defense—a stance he has maintained ahead of the NATO summit later this week. "The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable," Trump tweeted Monday morning. "While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%." The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%, and NATO benefits....... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2018 He continued by arguing that NATO benefits Europe "far more than it does the U.S." "By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment," Trump tweeted. "On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S., with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!" Trump has complained about NATO since 2016 when he was on the campaign trail and said the U.S. could decline to meet its commitment to mutual defense because allies have not paid 2 percent of their gross domestic product, as agreed. Since his initial meeting with Merkel, the relationship between the two leaders has become only more tense. When Merkel visited the White House in April, Trump said, "Angela, you need to stop buying gas from Putin," referring to a Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, according to an official at the meeting. Merkel responded that she wanted to broaden natural gas purchases and said she would try to convince members of the European Union to include this in trade talks. The divide between the two has often been painfully visible. The chancellor in April looked unamused during a joint press conference in which Trump boasted at length about how he had negotiated a lower price for the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.

President Donald Trump reportedly greeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a massive bill when she visited him soon after he entered the White House. Related: Watch: Angela Merkel looks unamused as Trump brags about saving money on Jerusalem embassy building "Angela, you owe me $1 trillion," Trump said, referring to the gulf between what Germany agreed to contribute to its defense under a NATO arrangement and what it actually spent over the previous 14 years, an official briefed on the meeting told The Wall Street Journal in a story published Sunday. Trump's brash remark to Merkel more than a year ago showcases his insistence that U.S. allies pay more for their defense—a stance he has maintained ahead of the NATO summit later this week. "The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable," Trump tweeted Monday morning. "While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%." The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%, and NATO benefits....... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2018 He continued by arguing that NATO benefits Europe "far more than it does the U.S." "By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment," Trump tweeted. "On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S., with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!" Trump has complained about NATO since 2016 when he was on the campaign trail and said the U.S. could decline to meet its commitment to mutual defense because allies have not paid 2 percent of their gross domestic product, as agreed. Since his initial meeting with Merkel, the relationship between the two leaders has become only more tense. When Merkel visited the White House in April, Trump said, "Angela, you need to stop buying gas from Putin," referring to a Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, according to an official at the meeting. Merkel responded that she wanted to broaden natural gas purchases and said she would try to convince members of the European Union to include this in trade talks. The divide between the two has often been painfully visible. The chancellor in April looked unamused during a joint press conference in which Trump boasted at length about how he had negotiated a lower price for the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Germany is among several countries that urged the U.S. not to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. At the G-7 summit in Quebec last month, a photo went viral of Trump sitting with his arms crossed and smirking as Merkel stared him down.

News article:
Protestors carry placards as they take part in a rally in Brussels on July 7, 2018, against the forthcoming NATO summit and scheduled visit of U.S. President Donald Trump on July 11 and 12. (Xinhua/AFP) by Xinhua writers Liu Chen, Guo Yina WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The current U.S.-Europe relations are at a "difficult" time with a looming trade war and lingering political disputes, said a U.S. expert on the trans-Atlantic ties. It's hard to predict their future right now, Frances Burwell, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, a U.S. think tank, told Xinhua in an interview ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels. "A LOT MORE BARK THAN BITE" The United States' relations with Europe, its traditional closest ally, have been bumpy since President Donald Trump took office in 2017, as Washington kept lashing out at Europe's "unfair trade practices" amid their disagreements on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump, in his first year of presidency, has already started to complain about imports of German cars and almost anywhere where the United States has a "trade imbalance," said Burwell. It was "a lot more bark than bite," the expert said. But now, "the bite is becoming as loud as the bark," Burwell noted. Recently, Trump has shaken up the world trading system by imposing tariffs on nearly all steel and aluminum imports for "national security reasons," including those from its European Union allies. Now Washington is considering doing the same for imports of automobiles. Linking the trade disputes to a "national security threat" is something that is "very difficult" for the Europeans to understand, Burwell, who once served as director of the Program on Transatlantic Relations at the Washington D.C.-based think tank, told Xinhua. The scholar warned that the disruption that the "bite" can cause should not be underestimated. She pointed out that the Europeans used to see Americans "as law-abiding, as trustworthy allies," a viewpoint she is not sure whether the Europeans are still holding. "We are now at a place where over the next couple of years ... we will see whether that public sympathy for us continues," the expert said. DIPLOMACY OR CAMPAIGN PROMISE For Burwell, the upcoming July 11-12 NATO summit in Brussels, which will gather leaders of the 29-nation security bloc, can be a chance for Trump to mend ties with the European allies. The defense spending is no doubt among the major topics for the summit. Trump has long been scolding those NATO countries which have not met the 2-percent-of-GDP benchmark. "I think most of the countries can make a very good case of that by 2024," the expert said. However, Burwell told Xinhua that what worried her most was the issues "that are not directly related to NATO," particularly "since the G7 (Group of Seven) summit ended as it did." Amid criticism from Germany and France, Trump unexpectedly withdrew his support for a G7 communique inked at a Canadian summit in early June, after calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau "very dishonest and weak." "If there is a revisiting of that and then that could be a challenge for the NATO summit," Burwell commented. For Burwell, Trump's understanding of U.S. foreign policy may not be of anything similar to his predecessors. "We need to understand that a lot of the things that he (Trump) says are directed at his base of support," said Burwell. "And they're not necessarily really based on familiarity with international issues as much as they are on reaffirming the messages that he sent during the campaign," the expert added. Meanwhile, Burwell believed that Trump holds a personalistic view of international politics. "Trump sees himself as a deal maker," believing that the personal touches could make the deal, the expert said. However, when it comes to Europe, it is more like a system based on institutions rather than personalities. Obviously, "the president is much more interested in personalities," said Burwell, hinting that it can somehow explain Trump's unease when dealing with Europe. CONNECTIONS BUILT IN DECADES Despite current disputes and name-calling rhetoric, Burwell still observes close cooperation on security across the Atlantic. "In fact, we were seeing more U.S. engagement in military exercises, more deployment in Europe, and more funding behind the deployments," said the scholar. After all, the trans-Atlantic connections "have been built up over many decades," she said. Meanwhile, Burwell also admitted that Washington and its European allies are "at a difficult place," where, differing from those "bad places" they had before, the problems come "from the president himself." Given Trump's unpredictable temperament, it is really difficult to say if there will be "moments of reconciliation" in the coming high-level encounters like the NATO summit, said Burwell. "We just don't know at this point," she added.

© Francois Lenoir / Reuters European Council President Donald Tusk called on Donald Trump to be more respectful towards America's allies ahead of a NATO summit, arguing that they are now in short supply."Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many," Tusk said after signing a statement on cooperation between the EU and NATO.The declaration was signed ahead of a two-day meeting of NATO members in Brussels starting Wednesday, in which Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, will represent the European Union.Trump brushed aside Tusk's criticism as he was leaving the US for a trip to Europe, which will include a NATO summit, a visit to the UK and his first dedicated bilateral meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin:The US leader has been repeatedly voicing his unease about NATO partners. He once branded the bloc a vehicle used by European allies to abuse America's generosity and gain military protection while failing to pull their weight financially. The rhetoric sparked fears in Europe that the US may announce the downgrading of its military presence on the continent during this week's meeting.The abrasive personal style and US-centered policies of the US president put long-established ties between America and its closest allies under strain. Critics say Trump undermined US global leadership less than half-way through his first term.Some European nations, including heavyweight Germany, have been targeted by the Trump administration for energy trade with Russia. Washington threatened European companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with sanctions. In Germany the threat is perceived as an attempt to push the expensive liquefied natural gas produced by the US to the European market.Threats of sanctions are also used by the US to push Europeans away from Iran after Trump withdrew America from a key multilateral deal with Tehran over its nuclear program. Negotiated under Barack Obama, the 2015 deal offered Iran the lifting of economic sanctions and new business opportunities in Europe in exchange for placing significant restrictions and a transparency mechanism on its nuclear industry. The withdrawal came against vocal criticism from other participants of the agreement, including Russia, China and the EU.

News article:
Trump's attacks on Germany have become routine, but they have strengthened rather than weakened the chancellor at home. So, does Trump merely have a personal problem with Merkel, or does he have other motives? Donald Trump seems to have a Germany obsession, the country's biggest newspaper, Bild, said on Thursday. Whether it's the country's refugee policy (Merkel is "ruining Germany," he tweeted in 2015), luxury cars (he told Playboy as long ago as 1990 that he would like to tax them more heavily), or its NATO contributions, the US president has consistently picked on Germany when he needs a foreign power to lash out at. The latest rock was thrown on Wednesday night, when Trump took to Twitter to repeat his blustering opening tirade before NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels. For the US president, Germany's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline deal with Russia was at odds with its defense budget, which he thinks is too low. Defending Merkel Once Merkel had delivered her own reaction, in the form of a history lesson and her personal history in East Germany, other German government politicians lined up to reject Trump's criticisms. First Foreign Minister Heiko Maas vehemently rejected Trump's description of Germany as a "captive of Russia." Germany was one of the "guarantors of the free world," he told reporters in Brussels. "We're not captives — neither of Russia nor the US." Meanwhile, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen pointed out to US radio station NPR that Trump's assertion that Germany gets 70 percent of its energy from Russia was "simply not true." The actual figure, the German government said, is around 9 percent. Merkel's coalition partners also circled the wagons. "The accusations of the American president against Germany because of the building of Nord Stream 2 are not objective and immoderate," said Rolf Mützenich, senior MP of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), in a statement. "They simply follow his trade policy instincts." Mützenich went on to explain patiently why building a new gas pipeline from Russia to Europe made economic sense for Germany, and contrasted Trump's "intimidation attempts" with the more diplomatic approach from Ukraine, whose government has its own concerns about Nord Stream 2. Read more: Opinion: A NATO summit in Trump's parallel universe Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen pointed out the facts to Donald Trump Image: Reuters/R. Krause Germany's former foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, also of the SPD, accused Trump of angling for a "regime change" in Berlin. "America under Trump cannot be relied upon," Gabriel told the Spiegel news magazine. "Trump is giving the North Korean dictator a survival guarantee and wants regime change in Germany at the same time." He also urged Germany to strengthen its stance and issue "clear, firm, and above all, unified European responses," to Trump. "We can't stand for this," Gabriel said. "If he demands billions of dollars for US military expenses, then we have to demand the return of billions spent on refugees that were created by failed US military intervention in Iraq." Strengthening Merkel It's no secret that Trump and Merkel have a poor personal relationship, but German political analysts don't think she is Trump's real target. "He sees Germany as the entry point to try to crack the European Union," said Josef Janning, head of the Berlin bureau of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). "Because if you want to crack a pack, you attack the alpha animal." But even if Trump succeeds in weakening the EU, Janning thinks it is having the opposite effect on Merkel herself – especially in the rift between herself and those on the right of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and the domestic forces who would like to see the end of the Merkel era. "Within her own government she is closing the ranks, very clearly," he told DW. "When she is under obviously unfair attack from the outside, that will bring at least the mainstream together behind her." Janning argued that Trump's stark overstatements, be it on trade, on defense spending or on Russia, might play well with voters supporting the fringes of the German political spectrum, but not with Merkel's own CDU voters – even the more conservative ones. Undermining the world order But for other analysts, all this is beside the point. Claudia Major, senior researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), thinks the criticism of Germany is just a sideshow. "It's not about Merkel or Russia or energy or pipelines, or any of that," she told DW. "That's just an excuse for Trump. For him it's about completely undermining the multilateral trans-Atlantic order as we know it. And I think that the scale of the problem we have hasn't yet been realized in Germany. If he valued NATO, and if he felt that its survival was important, he wouldn't act this way." Read more: Can the trans-Atlantic relationship survive Donald Trump? Major pointed out that Trump had taken up a different position to most of his European partners on nearly every major international issue, from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement to moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. "Trump rejects the entire multilateral, rule-based architecture — like NATO, WTO, EU — which is based on solidarity," she said. "What he wants is not alliances but deals." She also had little optimism about the apparent agreement on Thursday that NATO partners would raise their defense expenditure. "Do you think he's going to be happy with 2 percent?" she asked. "The core function of NATO — as a defensive alliance — has already been enormously undermined by all this bickering. Even if he says now that 2 percent is great — the damage has been done." "I think he has Germany especially in his sights because Germany stands for everything he thinks is stupid," Major added. "But at the end of the day, Germany is just the hook — it's about much more."

"He sees Germany as the entry point to try to crack the European Union," said Josef Janning, head of the Berlin bureau of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). "Because if you want to crack a pack, you attack the alpha animal." But even if Trump succeeds in weakening the EU, Janning thinks it is having the opposite effect on Merkel herself – especially in the rift between herself and those on the right of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and the domestic forces who would like to see the end of the Merkel era. "Within her own government she is closing the ranks, very clearly," he told DW. "When she is under obviously unfair attack from the outside, that will bring at least the mainstream together behind her." Janning argued that Trump's stark overstatements, be it on trade, on defense spending or on Russia, might play well with voters supporting the fringes of the German political spectrum, but not with Merkel's own CDU voters – even the more conservative ones. Undermining the world order But for other analysts, all this is beside the point. Claudia Major, senior researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), thinks the criticism of Germany is just a sideshow. "It's not about Merkel or Russia or energy or pipelines, or any of that," she told DW. "That's just an excuse for Trump. For him it's about completely undermining the multilateral trans-Atlantic order as we know it. And I think that the scale of the problem we have hasn't yet been realized in Germany. If he valued NATO, and if he felt that its survival was important, he wouldn't act this way." Read more: Can the trans-Atlantic relationship survive Donald Trump? Major pointed out that Trump had taken up a different position to most of his European partners on nearly every major international issue, from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement to moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. "Trump rejects the entire multilateral, rule-based architecture — like NATO, WTO, EU — which is based on solidarity," she said. "What he wants is not alliances but deals." She also had little optimism about the apparent agreement on Thursday that NATO partners would raise their defense expenditure. "Do you think he's going to be happy with 2 percent?" she asked. "The core function of NATO — as a defensive alliance — has already been enormously undermined by all this bickering. Even if he says now that 2 percent is great — the damage has been done." "I think he has Germany especially in his sights because Germany stands for everything he thinks is stupid," Major added. "But at the end of the day, Germany is just the hook — it's about much more."

News article:
Trump's attacks on Germany have become routine, but they have strengthened rather than weakened the chancellor at home. So, does Trump merely have a personal problem with Merkel, or does he have other motives? Donald Trump seems to have a Germany obsession, the country's biggest newspaper, Bild, said on Thursday. Whether it's the country's refugee policy (Merkel is "ruining Germany," he tweeted in 2015), luxury cars (he told Playboy as long ago as 1990 that he would like to tax them more heavily), or its NATO contributions, the US president has consistently picked on Germany when he needs a foreign power to lash out at. The latest rock was thrown on Wednesday night, when Trump took to Twitter to repeat his blustering opening tirade before NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels. For the US president, Germany's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline deal with Russia was at odds with its defense budget, which he thinks is too low. Defending Merkel Once Merkel had delivered her own reaction, in the form of a history lesson and her personal history in East Germany, other German government politicians lined up to reject Trump's criticisms. First Foreign Minister Heiko Maas vehemently rejected Trump's description of Germany as a "captive of Russia." Germany was one of the "guarantors of the free world," he told reporters in Brussels. "We're not captives — neither of Russia nor the US." Meanwhile, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen pointed out to US radio station NPR that Trump's assertion that Germany gets 70 percent of its energy from Russia was "simply not true." The actual figure, the German government said, is around 9 percent. Merkel's coalition partners also circled the wagons. "The accusations of the American president against Germany because of the building of Nord Stream 2 are not objective and immoderate," said Rolf Mützenich, senior MP of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), in a statement. "They simply follow his trade policy instincts." Mützenich went on to explain patiently why building a new gas pipeline from Russia to Europe made economic sense for Germany, and contrasted Trump's "intimidation attempts" with the more diplomatic approach from Ukraine, whose government has its own concerns about Nord Stream 2. Read more: Opinion: A NATO summit in Trump's parallel universe Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen pointed out the facts to Donald Trump Image: Reuters/R. Krause Germany's former foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, also of the SPD, accused Trump of angling for a "regime change" in Berlin. "America under Trump cannot be relied upon," Gabriel told the Spiegel news magazine. "Trump is giving the North Korean dictator a survival guarantee and wants regime change in Germany at the same time." He also urged Germany to strengthen its stance and issue "clear, firm, and above all, unified European responses," to Trump. "We can't stand for this," Gabriel said. "If he demands billions of dollars for US military expenses, then we have to demand the return of billions spent on refugees that were created by failed US military intervention in Iraq." Strengthening Merkel It's no secret that Trump and Merkel have a poor personal relationship, but German political analysts don't think she is Trump's real target.

News article:
Trump and Europe: Friend or Foe? By Jamie Dettmer July 17, 2018 Europeans have reacted with a mixture of alarm and relief to Monday’s summit between President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. They are relieved the U.S. leader did not give away any aces but they remain queasy about Trump’s apparent eagerness to get on with the Russian leader while displaying to them a combativeness normally reserved for opponents rather than allies. Their mood was downcast even before the summit kicked-off, disheartened by President Trump denouncing the European Union as a greater "foe" than Russia and China in a media interview just hours before the summit in Finland’s capital Helsinki. Beforehand, there was alarm in Europe on whether the U.S. President would be lured by the more experienced and disciplined summiteer Putin into giving ground on the Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula or Moscow's fomenting of rebellion in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. But the Russian president apparently secured no concessions on Crimea, no public promise to re-admit Russia into the G7, and no reversal on Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. And Trump maintained opposition to the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline, which will be increasing Russian energy exports to Germany. But what Trump described as a "deeply productive dialogue" and a first step in improving strained relations between the U.S. and Russia has prompted accusations in Europe that, in his eagerness to be an international deal-maker, he overlooks Kremlin aggression – including alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 White House race. The summit dominated the front pages of Europe’s newspapers Tuesday with Spain’s ABC running a full-page picture of the leaders of the world’s biggest nuclear-armed nations shaking hands, under the tart headline: "Trump and Putin: Such friends." The paper said the two leaders had buried the Cold War and the issue of Russian interference in America’s election – at least "for now." Another Spanish newspaper, El País, said Trump was befriending Putin while bashing the EU. And Belgium’s Le Soir argued Trump had "aligned himself" with Putin over his own authorities on the subject of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Some newspapers were less indignant. Belgium’s De Morgen wrote that the leaders were "working on their relationship" in a story headlined: "On to a better future." But Britain’s Daily Telegraph, a newspaper that has generally been sympathetic to Trump, especially over his spats with Europe, said the U.S. leader’s aim to establish peace was laudable. At the same time, it warned the summit was a big win for the Kremlin. "By affording him [Putin] the trappings of an equal partner Mr. Trump has given President Putin what he craved most: respect… The relationship has been reset without the Russians having to change anything," the paper said in an editorial. The reaction of European leaders and officials to Trump has been subdued. Few have gone public with their thoughts, preferring to stay out of the furious fight between the U.S. president and his critics in the U.S. over the summit. But privately there is indignation at Trump’s blaming the West as much as Russia for the strained relations, with German officials saying the summit advances their fears of a widening rift between Europe and Trump-led America. Privately, they worry that Trump’s determination to forge a personal bond with Putin is adding to a shift in the dynamics of America’s relationship with Europe. "I am relieved there were no concessions," said a senior British diplomat. "But it is unnerving to see the U.S. President being friendlier with Putin than with America’s traditional allies," he said. Speaking to Britain's Sky News, Jeremy Greenstock, a former British ambassador to the U.N., said he regarded Trump's effort to forge better relations with Putin a "good thing." But faulted the U.S. leader, saying, "he is doing it naively and is taking too much from President Putin at face value." Coming on the back of a pre-summit interview during which Trump described the EU as a "foe," European officials and analysts are still scrambling to understand what he meant and whether the U.S. and Europe are set on a path of separation. Some officials console themselves by saying Trump seems to use "foe" and "competitor" as interchangeable. And they point to the formal paperwork of diplomacy as more reassuring, like the 23-page communique agreed at last week’s NATO summit, which reaffirmed the alliance’s principle of collective defense and rebuked Russia. "We are confronted with that dilemma that we have often had with the Trump administration," said Mark Leonard of the European Council for Foreign Relations. "The president is a raging bull, he makes all sorts of statements, yet the policy beneath him doesn’t look that dramatically different than traditional American policy. And so people are left trying to figure out who they should believe – the policy or the President of the United States." In some ways, the Europeans have no alternative but to hold fast to the idea that the transatlantic relationship remains solid – their security assumptions are based on it and they are not ready to go it alone, say analysts. In the margins of last week’s summit, U.S. senators and government officials went out of their way to reassure America’s formal European allies and to soothe frayed nerves, saying they should discount Trump’s freewheeling statements and not interpret them at face value, arguing it is the way he wheels-and-deals, pursuing tactics of disruption to get what he wants. "It isn’t personal; it is business, I was told by a White House aide," a European minister told VOA. Cutting through Trump’s transactional approach, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed the "unbreakable trans-Atlantic bond," underscoring after NATO’s tumultuous summit Washington’s enduring commitment to peace and prosperity on the European continent at a meeting of southern European security ministers in Zagreb, Croatia. But some European officials see an emerging trend with U.S. policy decisions and actual decisions being colored – or telegraphed – by the presidential tweets, pointing to Trump’s early social-media threats of a trade war with Europe and his subsequent hiking of tariffs on imported European metals. "President Trump has personally made criticism of Europe, and particularly the European Union, pivotal to his foreign policy," according to Robin Niblett of Britain’s Chatham House. "Europe is the poster child for his thesis that America has been taken advantage of for the past 30 years," Niblett said in an expert comment posted on the Chatham House web-site. "Trump doesn’t believe in allies," argued Mark Leonard in a podcast. "If you think about America First and you think about the transactional approach, it means you work with the countries you can work with at that moment. You don’t really have long-term relationships. Allies are a problem. They are sort of like relatives who show up at your house to borrow money and stay all day and won’t leave your pool," he says.

A file picture shows children walking past damaged homes in the West Bank Bedouin camp of Khan al-Ahmar on April 7, 2016 after Israeli authorities demolished four houses they said were built without permission Israel's supreme court ruled Thursday in favour of demolishing a Palestinian Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, despite a campaign by European governments to save it. Campaigners said the hearing had been the final appeal open to the village of Khan al-Ahmar, located close to several Israeli settlements east of Jerusalem. It was unclear when the demolition of the village home to around 180 residents would take place. In its ruling the court said it found "no reason to intervene in the decision of the minister of defence to implement the demolition orders issued against the illegal structures in Khan al-Ahmar." The residents would be relocated elsewhere, it added, in a move critics say amounts to forcible transfer. The court ruled that the village was built without the relevant building permits. Such permits are nearly impossible to obtain for Palestinians in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank. "This verdict takes away the absolute minimal protection the Bedouin communities received until recently from the court," Shlomo Lecker, the lawyer representing the village, said in a statement. "By any standard of international humanitarian law, the verdict is an approval by the Israeli court of a crime against humanity." The decision was likely to be met with anger by European governments, who had been fighting to save the village. Last week the head of the British consulate-general in Jerusalem visited the village and said in a video clip published online that the planned demolition was a "matter of great concern for the UK and indeed for the European Union." Earlier Thursday Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced 2,500 new settlement units in the West Bank. All settlements are considered illegal under international law.

A file picture shows children walking past damaged homes in the West Bank Bedouin camp of Khan al-Ahmar on April 7, 2016 after Israeli authorities demolished four houses they said were built without permission Israel's supreme court ruled Thursday in favour of demolishing a Palestinian Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, despite a campaign by European governments to save it.

Students walk home from school in the Palestinian village of Khan al-Ahmar. Their village and school will be destroyed to make way for Israeli settlements. Faiz Abu Rmeleh ActiveStills Israel’s high court this week approved the forced displacement of residents from Khan al-Ahmar village in the occupied West Bank. Their village will be destroyed to make way for the expansion of Israeli settlements. That is a war crime under international law, human rights groups have warned. Israel issued expulsion orders to residents of Khan al-Ahmar multiple times in the past year, even though legal proceedings were ongoing in Israeli courts. The Israeli authorities were waiting for the high court’s blessing to complete the forcible transfer. Following this week’s verdict, the village can be destroyed “any time the government sees fit as of next month,” the Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz reported. Residents had devised an alternative plan for their community but it was rejected by Israel’s defense ministry. A village leader, Eid Khamis Jahalin, said that residents of the community do not accept the court’s decision, according to Quds News Network. He stressed that there is no alternative for the community other than to return to the Naqab region of historic Palestine, from which they were originally displaced by the Israeli military in the 1950s. “Israel has not made a counteroffer for the issue to be resolved without a demolition,” The Times of Israel reported. Khan al-Ahmar is home to members of the Jahalin Bedouin tribe. It includes 32 families, numbering more than 170 people, half of them children. The entire community will be forcibly displaced to an area near the garbage dump for the Palestinian village of Abu Dis to make way for Israeli settlement expansion. Palestinian schoolchildren pose for a picture in Khan al-Ahmar. Israel is planning to demolish their school, which serves 160 children from five villages. Faiz Abu Rmeleh ActiveStills A judge on the case, Noam Sohlberg, said he was aware that the forced displacement of the community near the landfill “does not suit their needs as residents and as schoolchildren.” The judge added, however, that the jury in the case was not concerned with the plan for the community but in assessing the legality of the proposed demolition. Khan al-Ahmar’s school was built in 2009 out of rubber tires and mud with the help of an Italian organization – in an attempt to evade Israel’s restriction on Palestinians using cement for construction – and has been under constant threats of demolition. It is the “only school accessible to 160 children from five villages in the area,” Human Rights Watch has stated. Making way for illegal settlements Khan al-Ahmar is located in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank. Area C remains under complete Israeli military rule under the terms of the Oslo accords signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s. Israel has refused to permit nearly all Palestinian construction in Area C, forcing Palestinians to build without permits and to live in constant fear that their homes will be demolished. Khan al-Ahmar also lies between the Israeli settlements of Maaleh Adumim and Kfar Adumim. This land east of Jerusalem, the so-called E1 area, is where Israel plans to expand its mega-settlement of Maaleh Adumim, completing the isolation of the northern and southern parts of the West Bank from each other. All of Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law. International calls The high court’s decision also comes after numerous international calls to stop the demolition. More than 70 US lawmakers wrote a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 21 May urging him to halt the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar and Susiya, a second village. “Instead of forcibly evicting Palestinian communities, we encourage your government to fairly re-evaluate their requests for building rights,” the letter states. It follows a letter written last year by 10 US senators who also appealed to Netanyahu to halt the demolitions. European Union delegations have paid visits to Khan al-Ahmar in the past year to also show support for the community. The EU has funded some construction projects in the neighborhood. EU Heads of Missions in Jerusalem and Ramallah visited Khan al Ahmar. They are deeply concerned about the stated intention of Israeli authorities to demolish & force relocation of the community.

News article:
Israeli authorities have resumed excavation work at the historic Bab Al-Rahma cemetery, just outside the eastern wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israel's Nature And Parks Authority (INPA) reportedly began digging up graves about three weeks ago in order to establish "a national park on parts of the cemetery's land," Wafa said. The centuriesold cemetery has great religious significance and is the site of the graves of Ubada ibn as-Samit and Shadad ibn Aus, companions of the Prophet Muhammad. Wafa said INPA last month fenced off the parts of the cemetery it plans to annex, including the land on which the Muslim leaders are buried. Several Palestinians were reportedly injured by Israeli police as they tried to stop the demolition of the graves over the weekend. Demolition at Bab Al-Rahma began in 2015, when Israeli authorities announced they would seize sections of the cemetery to build a national park trail. Israel has no legal rights to annex land in occupied East Jerusalem, according to several United Nations resolutions. However, such desecration of holy sites – both Muslim and Christian – is routinely carried out by Israel.

News article:
Israeli authorities have resumed excavation work at the historic Bab Al-Rahma cemetery, just outside the eastern wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israel's Nature And Parks Authority (INPA) reportedly began digging up graves about three weeks ago in order to establish "a national park on parts of the cemetery's land," Wafa said. The centuriesold cemetery has great religious significance and is the site of the graves of Ubada ibn as-Samit and Shadad ibn Aus, companions of the Prophet Muhammad. Wafa said INPA last month fenced off the parts of the cemetery it plans to annex, including the land on which the Muslim leaders are buried. Several Palestinians were reportedly injured by Israeli police as they tried to stop the demolition of the graves over the weekend. Demolition at Bab Al-Rahma began in 2015, when Israeli authorities announced they would seize sections of the cemetery to build a national park trail. Israel has no legal rights to annex land in occupied East Jerusalem, according to several United Nations resolutions. However, such desecration of holy sites – both Muslim and Christian – is routinely carried out by Israel.

A number of Israeli settlers yesterday seized a Palestinian house in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, local media reported. The spokesman of the Youth Against Settlements (YAS) movement, Mohammed Azghir, told Safa that the settlers took over a Palestinian house in the neighbourhood of Qaitun. "The house is currently occupied by the settlers and is being guarded by the occupation's military forces," Azghir added. He explained that the area has been besieged by the Israeli forces since 2001, noting that Palestinians have not been allowed to access it. In 2016, the UN Security Council overwhelmingly approved Resolution 2334 which considered Israeli settlements in the 1967 occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, as "illegal". Fourteen States voted in favour, while the United States abstained without using its power of veto. Read: Israel approves construction of 261 settlement units in Hebron

Israeli Supreme Court Issues Decision to Demolish Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Community, East of Jerusalem Ref: 58/2018 The Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) condemns the Israeli Supreme Court’s decision to demolish Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Community, east of occupied Jerusalem, and expresses its concern over implementing this decision at any moment by Israeli forces. PCHR calls upon the international community to immediately intervene and assume its legal and moral responsibilities to stop the implementation of this serious scheme that is in favor of the settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). According to PCHR’s investigations, on Thursday, 24 May 2018, the Israeli Supreme Court Justices Noam Solberg, ‘Anat Brown and Yael Fellner, issued a decision that allow Israel to demolish the houses of Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Community, east of the city, and to transfer them from their houses to what is known as “Jerusalem Gate” in al-‘Izariyah village, east of the City. The demolition decision included all the Bedouin community houses, including a mosque and a school that were built of mud bricks and rubber tires. ‘Eid Khamis Jahaleen, Head of Khan al-Ahmar Bedouin community, said that he was informed of the court’s decision on Thursday, 24 May 2018. He also stated that the court held a hearing on 25 April 2018 to consider the challenge on the displacement decision. At that time, a decision was issued to give the Bedouin Community residents 10 days to find another place. ‘Eid Jahaleen expected the demolition and displacement decisions will be implemented at any moment. Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Community, which is near “Ma’ale Adumim” and “Kefar Adumim” settlements established east of Jerusalem, shelters around 35 families comprised of 190 persons who live in tin-plate houses and tents. Regarding the school, it is the only one in the community that includes around 170 students and 16 teachers. The number of the Bedouin communities, east of Jerusalem, is 23 communities where around 5,000 civilians live. This Bedouin area in East Jerusalem is one of those areas that have been targeted by the colonization for decades. The Israeli Government has unprecedentedly accelerated its settlement, particularly in East Jerusalem and its surroundings. On 16 November 2017, the Organization and Construction Department of the Israeli Civil Administration issued orders to evacuate the residents of Pope Mountain Community in al-‘Izzariyha village near “Ma’aleh Adumim” settlement. This community is inhabited by 57 families comprised of 320 members; half of them are children. In the same date, the Israeli Prime Minister issued a decision ordering the Palestinian Bedouins living in communities to evacuate their houses in the vicinity of occupied Jerusalem, near Street No. (1) and relocate them to the Dead Sea. The later Israeli Supreme Court’s decision came in favor of the settlement projects in that area. PCHR believes that the targeting and transferring the Bedouin communities, east of occupied Jerusalem by the Israeli authorities came in favor of their settlement projects, which unprecedentedly escalated last year, particularly in East Jerusalem and its surroundings. The (E1) Settlement Plan comes at the forefront of these projects, seeking to annex the settlements established, east of the city, within the boundaries of the Israeli municipality and so separating the north of West Bank from the south of it and burry any possibility of a viable Palestinian state. In light of the above, PCHR: Calls upon the international community to intervene in order to oblige Israel to stop all its settlement activities in the oPt, particularly in East Jerusalem; Emphasizes East Jerusalem is an occupied territory, and all the measures taken by the Israeli authorities following the 1967 occupation of it do not change its legal status as an occupied territory; Confirms that all Israeli settlement activities in occupied East Jerusalem are considered a crime against humanity according to the international humanitarian law; Calls upon the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions to fulfill their obligation under Article 1 to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances; and Believes that the conspiracy of silence practiced by the international community has encouraged Israel to commit further violations of international human rights and international humanitarian laws, including the efforts made to create a Jewish majority in occupied East Jerusalem.

Israeli forces demolish a home in Kobar village, August 16, 2018. Photo credit: Bahaa Nasr for WAFA. Even if Palestinians fulfill the appeal requirements put in place by military order 1797, Israeli authorities maintain complete authority to proceed with demolition. Two Jerusalem legal aid organizations will petition the Israeli Supreme Court to overturn a new military order which makes it possible for Israeli forces to demolish Palestinian homes in Area C within 96 hours after delivering demolition orders. The petition follows a formal letter the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC) and the St. Yves Society sent to the Israeli defense ministry on June 4, 2018 in which they argue that the military order “blatantly violates…international law and contravenes existing local legislation.” The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Occupied Territories (COGAT) issued military order 1797 on April 17, 2018. COGAT, under the direct control of the Israeli defense ministry, runs civil affairs in the occupied West Bank. Order 1797 will go into effect on June 19, 2018. Under the order, COGAT excuses itself from informing Palestinian homeowners directly that their homes are slated for demolition. JLAC and St. Yves explain in a joint press release that Israeli authorities only require demolition orders be placed “next to” relevant structures 96 hours before Israeli forces arrive to execute demolitions. If a homeowner does catch wind of an impending demolition, he or she must present an approved master plan and building permit to appeal the demolition. Israel’s discriminatory housing policies in the West Bank ensure that this is an almost impossible requirement for the 300,000 Palestinians living in Area C, 60 percent of the West Bank, to fulfill. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between 2010 and 2014, for example, Israel approved 1.5 percent of building applications in Area C. Israeli authorities, however, routinely approve of settlement master plans and even halt demolitions of settler outposts citing the existence of master plans, JLAC and St. Yves point out. Indeed, since 2017 Israeli officials have approved nearly 14,000 settlement units in the West Bank. In addition to having to produce an approved master building plan within four days, Palestinian residents of Area C attempting to forestall demolition must prove that construction on their home or home addition has been completed for six months or that the structure has been inhabited for thirty days. By requiring that Palestinians produce so many documents in such a short period of time, this military order “virtually strips the affected residents of the right to due process and the capacity to challenge the demolition orders through legal avenues, by requiring that objections to the demolition order be accompanied with a valid building permit,” JLAC and St. Yves wrote in their press release. Moreover, COGAT remains the sole arbiter of these appeals. Put differently, even if Palestinians fulfill the appeal requirements put in place by military order 1797, COGAT empowers itself to proceed with demolition anyway. St. Yves and JLAC emphasize that this new military order violates international law, including Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which defines forcible transfer of occupied populations as a crime against humanity. The order also violates Article 43 of the 1907 Hague Regulations, which requires that an occupying power respect the laws in the country that it occupies. In this case, that means the Jordanian Planning and Construction Law, which allows residents to retroactively legalize home constructions in the face of a demolition order stemming from illegal construction. One area that may be acutely impacted by this new military order is the E1 corridor, which sits between the Jerusalem municipality’s borders and the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim. For years, Israeli politicians have proposed incorporating this area, which is in Area C, into the Jerusalem municipality. Such developments are key to maintaining what Israel euphemistically calls a “demographic balance” in Jerusalem, i.e. restricting the Palestinian population to 30 percent of the city’s total population. Palestinian presence in Jerusalem today likely constitutes at least 40 percent of the city’s population. The Palestinian Authority condemned military order 1797 when it was first announced. “This illegal development would generate more crimes against Palestinian rights of access to a safe and stable living environment and would worsen the already dire conditions of 393,000 Palestinian citizens,” the government said in a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.

Israeli authorities have recently resumed work on the park and have been seen digging up and marking graves, removing trees and fencing off areas to halt future burials.

News article:
Israeli occupation forces scuffle with protesters during the eviction of 15 illegal Jewish settler families from the illegal outpost of Netiv Ha’avot in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday (Reuters photo) NETIV HA’AVOT, West Bank — Israeli occupation forces on Tuesday began evicting illegal Jewish settlers from 15 homes which Israel’s highest court ruled were built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. Under a supreme court order, the 15 dwellings are to be demolished within the next few days. Hundreds of young pro-settlement hard-liners gathered on Tuesday in several of the homes slated for demolition. Some of the protesters climbed onto the roof of one dwelling and hoisted Israeli flags. A few scuffles ensued with police but for the most part, demonstrators offered passive resistance and were carried away by officers who grabbed hold of their arms and legs. Most countries consider all Israeli settlements built in the West Bank and other land captured in the 1967 war as illegal. There are now about 500,000 illegal Israeli settlers living among some 2.6 million Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. The entire Netiv Ha’avot settlement was built without official Israeli authorisation, but the government has retroactively agreed to allow the rest of the community to stay once the 15 homes built on private Palestinian land come down. Palestinians dismissed the dismantling of a small number of homes as an empty gesture. Wassel Abu Youssef, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official said: “All settlement is illegal and must be removed. Israel is trying to fool world public opinion by removing some homes here and there while it continues to build settlements.” The Israeli government has announced a plan to pay compensation to the families whose homes are to be razed and rehouse them on adjacent tracts not owned by individual Palestinians. The remainder of Netiv Ha’avot, where some 20 houses stand on land not covered by the court ruling, is to be granted legal status and designated a neighbourhood of an Israeli government-recognised settlement, Elazar, the Cabinet decided in February. Israeli occupation authorities have carried out similar evictions in the past under court order. In February 2017, some 300 illegal settlers were removed from the unauthorised outpost of Amona in the West Bank. But settlement expansion, which has drawn Palestinian and international condemnation, has continued, with little objection from the administration of US President Donald Trump, in contrast to criticism voiced by his predecessor Barack Obama. Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and say Israeli settlements are intended to deny them a viable and contiguous country. Israel’s refusal to halt settlement expansion was one of the reasons peace talks collapsed in 2014.

Israeli army forces reportedly ordered a Palestinian farmer in the Jordan Valley to evacuate his land on Tuesday, with forces saying they were going to raze the land. WAFA agency said, according to Ma’an, that Ahmad Assi Damra, from Hijlet al-Zour, east of Jericho, was ordered to evacuate his 25 dunam (six acre) plot of land, which is planted with palm trees, in order raze it. A similar order was reportedly made to another Palestinian farmer, Suleiman al-Zayed, who has planted his four dunam plot in the village of Nuweimeh, north of Jericho, with olive trees. The majority of the Jordan Valley is under full Israeli military control, despite being within the West Bank. Meanwhile, at least 44 percent of the total land in the Jordan Valley has been appropriated by Israeli forces, for military purposes and training exercises. Forming a third of the occupied West Bank and with 88 percent of its land classified as Area C, the Jordan Valley has long been a strategic area of land unlikely to return to Palestinians following Israel’s occupation in 1967.

News article:
About three weeks ago, Supreme Court Justices Noam Sohlberg, Anat Baron and Yael Willner allowed the state to destroy the Palestinian community of Khan al-Ahmar and expel its citizens to a site near a dumpster in Abu Dis. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter A total of 32 families—173 persons, including 92 children—will be expelled. All structures, including a school serving more than 150 children from Khan al-Ahmar and from neighboring Palestinian communities, will be demolished. Khan al-Ahmar is but one of dozens of Palestinian communities under threat of expulsion. It will be the first such community in many years to be forcibly expelled in its entirety and relocated deep into the enclaves the state created for its Palestinian subjects in the West Bank, though such mass forcible transfers are rare in the West Bank. Khan al-Ahmar (Photo: Amit Gilutz, B'Tselem) In recent decades, however, Israeli policymakers have been trying to silently transfer Palestinians from all of Area C (the 60 percent of the West Bank that Israel exploits as though it were its own). The upcoming war crime in Khan al-Ahmar is merely an extreme example of an expulsion strategy that Israel is undertaking vis-a-vis all Palestinian communities in Area C, to create an environment that will coerce them into leaving. The mechanical details of this environment are simple: The state forbids residents from connecting to infrastructural networks like water, sewage and electricity, prevents them from building legally, demolishes homes that residents had to build without permits, destroys basic infrastructure laid by them (such as solar panels, water containers and unpaved paths) and holds military training exercises that include firing live ammunition and shelling on agricultural land, in pastures and even within residential areas and between houses. As in the case of Khan al-Ahmar, the state does not spare educational establishments: In the last year alone, the Civil Administration demolished two schools and one kindergarten in Area C—in Jub a-Dib in the Bethlehem area, in Jabal al-Baba in the Ma’ale Adumim area and in Khirbet Zanutah in the South Hebron Hills. This left 138 children with no educational framework. Today, 45 schools in Area C are under threat of partial or full demolition. The vast majority of Palestinians in Area C cannot build legally without master plans. These do not fall from the sky, but have to be approved by the Civil Administration (spoiler alert: it never approves them). In discussing the future of Khan al-Ahmar, the Supreme Court’s basic assumption was that the residents are criminals who built their homes illegally. Yet in the West Bank, Palestinians do not have the privilege of building legally outside the small, crowded enclaves the state allocates for them. The master plans they submit for approval are rejected time after time and when they do build, having run out of options, Israel responds with demolition. In other words: The state has created an unbearable daily reality for Palestinians in Area C in order to make them leave as though of their own free will. These actions are part of a deliberate, premeditated policy aimed at expelling Palestinian residents from Area C and building (and expanding) settlements in their place. A Western-liberal state in theory; silent transfer of an entire population in practice. If we take a few steps back and look at Israel’s policy in the Occupied Territories since the Oslo Accords, a clear picture emerges. Israel is trying to concentrate Palestinians in the tiniest enclaves possible, while taking over as much land as it can. This policy is twofold: For Palestinians, creating unbearable living conditions to make them transfer themselves; for Jews, building and expanding settlements. Think about it. No infrastructure, no running water, no electricity and no educational framework for your children. You live under the constant whir of projectiles fired by training military forces, and all the while, the state destroys the few buildings and basic infrastructure you managed to lay out. Would you stay? Although Israel has been carrying out this policy of silent expulsion for years, the forcible transfer of Khan al-Ahmar’s residents to the dumpster in Abu Dis is a horrific escalation. No more coercion, no more leaving-as-though-freely, but a violent transfer out in the open. By the book. There is no telling how this decision might affect other Palestinian communities in Area C. However, Israel’s heightened motivation to accelerate the process of expulsion, coupled with the green light given by the Supreme Court in the case of Khan al-Ahmar, is a bad omen for other Palestinian communities—especially those that have legal processes pending a Supreme Court decision. These include Khirbet Umm al-Jamal and Khirbet Ein al-Hilweh in the Northern Jordan Valley, Abu a-Nuwar and Jabal al-Baba in the Ma’ale Adumim area, and the residents of Susiya and the South Hebron Hills in general. At the end of the day, whether this policy of expulsion is enacted silently over many years, and whether it morphs into open forcible transfer in Khan al-Ahmar and elsewhere, Israeli policymakers bear criminal liability for it. The prime minister, the minister of defense and the head of the Civil Administration are all responsible. The fact that Supreme Court justices openly authorized this war crime exposes the complicity of Israel’s legal system with dispossession and forcible transfer.

News article:
Source: Xinhua| 2018-06-17 19:13:39|Editor: ZD Video Player Close JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli pro-settlement activists attacked and injured Israeli police officers during a court-ordered eviction of an illegal outpost in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, the police said. The clashes started as hundreds of police officers arrived in Tapuah Maarav, a Jewish outpost in the northern West Bank, to evict 10 houses that were built without permits. The Supreme Court ruled that these houses were built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land and should be evicted by the end of June. A police statement said that by noon, some 11 police officers were injured and six settlers were arrested for rioting. Under the international law, all Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, are illegal. However, Israel charges that the settlements, home to some 600,000 Israelis who live in heavily guarded communities among about 3 million Palestinians, are legal. Outposts like Tapuah Maarav are settlements built without official permits from the Israeli authorities and are also deemed illegal under the Israeli law.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the postponement of the evacuation and demolition of five illegal buildings in the Palestinian village of Khirbet Susya in South Mount Hebron. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The demolition, which was scheduled for Tuesday morning, is being postponed following international pressure, Ynet has learned. This is the third time in the past few months that the evacuation is put off. Illegal construction in the Palestinian village of Kuirbet Susya (Photo: Regavim) Everything was already prepared for the evacuation. The Central Command and the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories had prepared an operation order, and hundreds of police officers and soldiers were recruited and placed on high alert. The Defense Ministry had hired civilian execution contractors and heavy equipment for the explosive demolition. But at around 10 pm Monday, an order arrived from the Prime Minister’s Office to stop the evacuation. The demolition of illegal Palestinian homes in Khirbet Susya is seen as one of the symbols of the Palestinian battle in the West Bank, and Israel has been under heavy international pressure—mainly in recent weeks—to prevent the evacuation which would have received wide international coverage. The demolition may have also been postponed due to the upcoming visit of US President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Jason Greenblatt, and his special advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, this weekend. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ‘Demonstrating weakness and zero action against the PA’s intensive and illegal activity’ (Photo: Marc Israel Sellem) The timing of the demolition, which has been postponed to an unknown date, is politically sensitive too. In the past week, the security forces evacuated two Jewish outposts in the West Bank—Netiv Ha’avot in Gush Etzion and Tapuach West in Samaria. The Regavim movement, which led the High Court petition against the Palestinian outpost, offered the following comment: “In the past week, Netanyahu implemented the demolition of the Netiv Ha’avot neighborhood and Tapuach West, but avoided demolishing the Palestinian Authority’s outpost in South Mount Hebron. “Netanyahu can’t just blame the High Court and the left-wing organizations, when he is essentially imposing strict enforcement against the settlements while demonstrating weakness and zero action against the Palestinian Authority’s intensive and illegal activity.”

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed indefinitely the scheduled demolition of a Bedouin Palestinian village in the West Bank, deemed illegal by authorities, reportedly due to intense international pressure. Foreign lawmakers and ministers have urged Jerusalem to refrain from razing houses built without a permit in Sussiya. Hundreds of police and soldiers were put on standby for the demolition, scheduled for Tuesday morning, but late Monday Netanyahu ordered a halt to the operation, according to the Ynet website. It is the third delay of the village’s court-approved demolition in the last two years. Israel maintains that the community was built illegally, but its plans to raze the villages have sparked a sustained international outcry. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms A group of 74 Democratic lawmakers from the US last month urged Netanyahu to halt the demolition of Sussiya and another village, Khan al-Ahmar. In a letter sent to Netanyahu they wrote that the “destruction and displacement of such communities would run counter to shared US and Israeli values, while further undermining long-term Israeli security, Palestinian dignity and the prospects for peacefully achieving two states for two people.” It said demolishing Sussiya and Khan al-Ahmar “endangers Israel’s future as a Jewish democracy,” and urged the government to “fairly reevaluate” Palestinian requests for building rights. Advertisement J Street, a liberal Jewish Mideast lobbying group that helped promote the appeal on Capitol Hill, welcomed the letter at the time, calling it the most significant criticism of Israeli settlement expansion by Congress ever. It followed a similar letter to Netanyahu signed by 10 Democratic senators, including such prominent figures as Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Dianne Feinstein of California. The Ynet report said Tuesday that some believe the decision to delay the demolition came due to the planned visit in Israel of US administration officials Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, ahead of the unveiling of US President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan. The postponement was blasted by right-wing groups, who drew a comparison between the nixed demolition of the Palestinian villages and the razing of homes in two Israeli settlements in the past week, which were carried out as planned. “Netanyahu cannot only blame the High Court and the left-wing organizations, when in practice he employs strict enforcement for settlements but shows helplessness and zero action against the intensive illegal actions by the Palestinian Authority,” declared the pro-settler group Regavim, which spearheaded the High Court petition against Sussiya. Settler leader Yohai Damari, head of the Har Hebron Regional Council, decried the government’s “foolishness.” “I call on the Israeli government to do the right thing, stop making one-sided decisions, and have it as a top priority to safeguard state land for the benefit of the state and its citizens,” he said in a statement Tuesday. Advertisement Damari added that the repeated delays were a “clear message to the other side that we are turning a blind eye, and proof of that is the dozens of illegal houses built systematically every month in Area C.” Sussiya, in the southern West Bank, has been under threat of demolition for several years after Israel found that homes there had been built without authorization. The town’s residents argue that they had no choice but to build illegally because Israel’s Civil Administration rarely grants permits to Palestinians in the West Bank’s Area C, a zone officially under Israeli security and administrative control per the 1993 Oslo peace accords. A master plan devised by residents was rejected by the Defense Ministry. Israel has not made a counteroffer for the issue to be resolved without a demolition. Some 300 people live in Sussiya. They reside mainly on farmland and their community has had no running water or electricity since they were expelled from the village’s original location 30 years ago, when there were about 25 families living at the site. A number of traditionally nomadic Bedouin communities are based east of Jerusalem, where some rights groups fear demolitions could eventually clear the way for further Israeli settlement construction. Eric Cortellessa and Jacob Magid contributed to this report.

Israeli soldiers invaded, Monday, the al-Jawaya area, east of Yatta town, south of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, and handed orders halting the construction of a home and a well. Rateb Jabour, the coordinator of the Popular Committee against the Annexation Wall and Colonies in southern West Bank, said the targeted property belongs to Issa Hasan Shawaheen, and is being built on his own land. He added that the army issued, over the past few months, more than ten orders, including demolition warrants, targeting Palestinian homes and structures in that area alone. The Israeli army said the Palestinian did not obtain permits from the Israeli Civil Administration Office, which runs the administrative aspect of Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank. Israel has been preventing the Palestinians from building, or expanding existing property, in Area C of the occupied West Bank, under full military and administrative control. Area C is more than %60 of the West Bank and is also subject to the seriously-escalating construction and expansion of Israel’s illegal colonies, in direct violation of International Law and the Fourth Geneva Convention.

News article:
Palestinian Bedouin children play on May 30 in the Khan al-Ahmar village, a Bedouin village which is located between the West Bank city of Jericho and Jerusalem and is under an Israeli demolition order. (AFP Photo) RAMALLAH, July 3 (Xinhua) --- The Palestinian authorities said on Tuesday that Israel's threat to forcibly transfer the Bedouin community on the periphery of East Jerusalem constitutes a "war crime." On May 24, the Israeli High Court reached a verdict to raze the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar in East Jerusalem, where 200 homes and community structures are slated for demolition. The ruling "is another testament to Israel's culture of impunity that allows it to continue endangering the very existence of the Palestinian people on their land and to commit further grave violations of international law," the Secretariat of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian presidency said in a joint statement. "There will be a war crime being committed before the eyes of the entire international community," the statement warned. The Palestinian authorities also appealed to the international community to "take concrete action to stop the Israeli occupation and to protect the Palestinian people." "Israel must be held accountable for its grave violations of the International Humanitarian Law, UN resolutions and the human rights of the Palestinian people," it said. Meanwhile, the top Palestinian political bodies accused the United States of giving the green light to Israel's threats. Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the EU's acquiescence pushed the Israeli government to "advance its annexation plans which affect vast occupied areas of vital importance for Palestine," the statement said. The community in the Khan al-Ahmar village is one of the 46 Bedouin communities in the central West Bank which the United Nations considers at the risk of forcible transfer.

Oren Ziv ActiveStills Israel’s destruction of the community of Khan al-Ahmar may be imminent, human rights defenders are warning. On Tuesday, the UN’s human rights office said it was concerned that residents of the community were “at high risk of forcible transfer” in coming days. Israeli forces arrived in the occupied West Bank village on Sunday, heightening fears among its almost 200 residents. Soldiers measured homes and road barriers and listed possessions, all of which is typically done prior to a demolition, according to Jahalin Solidarity, a group that advocates for the rights of the Jahalin Bedouin community. Israeli police told residents that they would be better off if they left “voluntarily,” according to Israeli human rights group B’Tselem.

This land east of Jerusalem, the so-called E1 area, is where Israel plans to expand its mega-settlement of Maaleh Adumim, completing the isolation of the northern and southern parts of the West Bank from each other. In May, Israel’s high court approved the forced displacement of the community to make way for Israeli settlement expansion. Their village will be destroyed and residents will be forced to an area near the garbage dump of the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. Residents had devised an alternative plan for their community but it was rejected by Israel’s defense ministry. Forced displacement is a war crime under international law, human rights groups have affirmed. No option to challenge demolitions Khan al-Ahmar is located in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank. Area C remains under complete Israeli military rule under the terms of the Oslo accords signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s. Israel has refused to permit nearly all Palestinian construction in Area C, forcing Palestinians to build without permits and to live in constant fear that their homes or communities will be demolished. Israel is escalating its moves to force Palestinians off their lands. On 17 June, it imposed a new military order removing “any option for Palestinians to challenge demolition orders that the civil administration issues for new structures, allowing Israel to demolish homes summarily,” according to B’Tselem. The civil administration is the name Israel gives to the military bureaucracy that rules Palestinians in the occupied West Bank by force. Under the new order, the military can order the demolition of any uncompleted building, or any structure that has been completed in the last six months. This includes unoccupied buildings as well as homes whose residents moved in within the last 30 days. The military may even order the demolition of a property that has a building permit. Palestinians have just four days to appeal, after which the army can proceed with the destruction and seizure of property. “The new military order removes the façade of judicial review over demolition orders and over Israel’s planning and building policy in the West Bank,” according to B’Tselem. Fast-tracking expulsions B’Tselem pointed out that this is not the first time Israel has stripped away the façade of legal proceedings to fast-track expulsions and demolitions. In 2017, Israel began bypassing its own legal formalities in order to expedite the expulsion of Palestinians from land targeted for Israeli colonization. Previously Israel issued demolition orders for individual buildings. The expedited procedures include wholesale demolition orders for entire communities.

News article:
A liberal pro-Israel lobbying group in the United States on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government of using the American July 4 holiday as a “cover” to advance the court-ordered demolition of a West Bank hamlet. Clashes broke out earlier in the day between police and protesters at the illegally built Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, east of Jerusalem, which is due to be demolished. The J Street organization said in a statement it was “outraged by the Israeli government’s dispatch of bulldozers today.” “Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government seems intent on using the July 4th holiday as cover to move forward with demolition plans that have been opposed by dozens of US lawmakers, hundreds of rabbis and thousands of pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans,” the group said in a statement. “Netanyahu and his government should know: Even on July 4th, Americans are watching their destructive actions in the West Bank, with deep frustration and concern for the damage they are doing to the future of both Israelis and Palestinians,” J Street said, noting that on July 2 it delivered a letter with 7,000 signatures to the Israeli embassy in Washington opposing the demolition.

Three police officers were lightly injured in the confrontation, the force said, and some 35 protesters were hurt, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.

Critics say building permits are nearly impossible to obtain for Palestinians in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank and the demolition is meant to clear the way for new Jewish settlements. Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis. Bedouin villagers say the location is unsuitable for their way of life, and have asserted that residents of Abu Dis have warned them not to come there. According to the UN, the village has 180 residents.

Scuffles broke out on Wednesday between Israeli authorities and protesters who feared preparations were underway to raze a Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank, despite international calls for a reprieve. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block a bulldozer and scuffled with police at Khan al-Ahmar on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem. Some climbed onto the bulldozer in protest. Israeli rights group B'Tselem said nine people were arrested -- five from the village and four others, including the organisation's own head of field research. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported 35 people injured, with four taken to hospital. Police reported two arrests and said stones were thrown at officers. The incident came after activists said the Israeli military had issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday, authorising itself to seize access roads to the village. Heavy equipment was seen around the village on Wednesday, prompting speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. "Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents," Amit Gilutz, spokesman for B'Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers an alternative site. The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Britain's minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. He warned that any forced relocation "could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned." Such an action would be considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Khan al-Ahmar is located east of Jerusalem near several major illegal Israeli settlement blocs and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two. In another Bedouin village in the same region, Abu Nuwar, Israel carried out a series of demolitions Wednesday on what it described as illegally built structures. B'Tselem said nine residential structures and three agricultural ones were demolished, leaving 62 people homeless. The Israeli defence ministry's COGAT unit for civilian affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories said the demolitions had taken place after the "owners of the buildings failed to utilise the planning procedures to their fullest extent". "This despite the fact that they were given the opportunity to enquire in the matter and were told that if they did not, the illegal construction would be demolished," it said in a statement.

European countries are joining forces to prevent the demolition of the Bedouin community at Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank, said British Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt on Wednesday in Parliament. France and Ireland have both has since echoed Britain's resignations in a similar statement from their foreign ministries. More European countries are expected to voice their concerns. The UN also expressed its dismay over recent Israeli actions. The office of Nikolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, tweeted that the envoy "condemns the demolitions at Abu Nuwar and preparations to demolish Khan Al Ahmar." UN envoy Nikolay Mladenov condemns Israeli actions against Bedouin village Credit: UNSCO / Twitter "Israel should stop such actions and plans for relocating Bedouin communities in the occupied West Bank," the tweet read. "Such actions are contrary to international law and undermine the two-state solution." Open gallery view Palestinians protesting the planned demolition of Khan al-Ahmar, Wednesday, July 4, 2018 Credit: Majdi Mohammed/AP The European Union joined the criticism early on Thursday, saying in a statement that the demolitions "together with plans for new settlement construction for Israelis in the same area, exacerbate threats to the viability of the two-state solution and further undermine prospects for a lasting peace." The statement further said that the EU "expects the Israeli authorities to reverse these decisions and fully meet its obligations as an occupying power under International Humanitarian Law." Britain noted that it reiterated its concerns to the Israeli government over the planned demolitions, a fact that Alistair Burt mentioned in response to a parliamentary question from Labour MP Richard Burden. “This morning, officials from our embassy in Tel Aviv and from our consulate general in Jerusalem visited Khan al-Ahmar to express our concern and demonstrate the international community’s support for that community,” said Burt. “In accordance with our long-standing policy, we therefore condemn such a move, which would strike a major blow to prospects for a two-state solution with Jerusalem as a shared capital.” He revealed that the British ambassador had protested the matter on Monday to Israeli National Security Adviser Meir Ben Shabbat. “This should not be happening and need not be happening,” added Burt. Other members of Parliament joined in the discussion. While some spoke as friends of Israel who were worried about the lack of progress in the peace process with the Palestinians, others called for Britain to immediately and unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state in response to the evacuation of Khan al-Ahmar, and what they called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to abide by international law. A similar statement released by French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnès Von Der Mühll chided the action as going against international humanitarian law, and said the demolition makes the already precarious living conditions of the villages' residents more difficult. "The villages are also located in an area which is essential for the continuity of a future Palestinian state and thus the viability of the two-state solution, which has been undermined today by the Israeli authorities’ decisions," the statement said. France urged the Israeli authorities to "refrain from any measures aimed at extending [Israeli] settlements in the Occupied Territories or making them permanent, in contravention of international law, as United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 reaffirms. France, in conjunction with its European partners, will continue to keep a close eye on the issue." Ireland has also joined the condemnation of Israel's plan to demolish the village, with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney saying on Wednesday night that he was "extremely worried about the imminent threat to the Bedouin community of Khan al Ahmar." "The eviction of families and demolition of their homes is an action which has a strong historical resonance in Ireland, and which brings discredit on Israel," Coveney added. Coveney said that "Ireland has made these points clearly to Israeli representatives... I have also made Ireland's views on settlements known directly to the Prime Minister of Israel." He added that in light of his previous statements, he found it "deeply disappointing that Israel is nonetheless proceeding with this reprehensible action." In Israel, Joint List chairman, MK Ayman Odeh, called the planned demolition a "war crime which will leave entire families without a roof over their heads. People already evicted twice by the state, struggling now for their home and their school which gives them hope." This is not only a human injustice, Odeh said, but a political maneuver by the government to sever and dismantle the Arab settlements in C areas, and to expand the Israeli settlement blocs, "thus preventing any chance for a Palestinian state and peace." Eleven people were arrested after throwing stones Wednesday in Khan al-Ahmar. Dozens of Palestinian were wounded, according to the Red Crescent. Four were taken to the hospital, and three police officers were lightly wounded, one of whom received medical care on the scene. Representatives of Israel's Civil Administration hung notices around Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank on Tuesday evening, warning the village's inhabitants of their impending expulsion. By Wednesday morning there were bulldozers on the scene and clashes broke out. The expulsion of several dozen Bedouin families from Khan al-Ahmar is seen as enabling future expansion of the settlement of Kfar Adumim. The notes announcing the imminent eviction do not provide a certain timeline for intervention by authorities, though sources in the defense establishment told Haaretz that it could happen in weeks, or even days. Meanwhile, the area around Khan al-Ahmar has been closed to the general public until the end of July. The Civil administration is planning to build a road to the place for the purposes of the eviction. The works are supposed to start within days and the eviction can't begin until the road is ready. The residents are supposed to be moved to Al Jabel, a village near the Abu Dis garbage dump that the state allocated for the permanent settlement of the villagers. Earlier this week, Civil Administration officers, accompanied by police officers, took measurements in Khan al-Ahmar and reportedly counted the flocks of sheep as part of a close inspection. The village houses several dozen families from the Bedouin clan of Jahalin, who moved there after their expulsion from the Negev in the 1950s. They then built their homes in Khan al-Ahmar on state-owned land. Though in theory their homes could be legalized retroactively, the state declined to go down that route and offered them alternative housing in the nearby village of Al Jabel. On May 24, following a lengthy legal campaign, Supreme Court Justices Noam Sohlberg, Anat Baron and Yael Willner allowed the state to demolish the village’s homes.

European countries are joining forces to prevent the demolition of the Bedouin community at Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank, said British Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt on Wednesday in Parliament. France and Ireland have both has since echoed Britain's resignations in a similar statement from their foreign ministries. More European countries are expected to voice their concerns. The UN also expressed its dismay over recent Israeli actions. The office of Nikolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, tweeted that the envoy "condemns the demolitions at Abu Nuwar and preparations to demolish Khan Al Ahmar." UN envoy Nikolay Mladenov condemns Israeli actions against Bedouin village Credit: UNSCO / Twitter "Israel should stop such actions and plans for relocating Bedouin communities in the occupied West Bank," the tweet read. "Such actions are contrary to international law and undermine the two-state solution." Open gallery view Palestinians protesting the planned demolition of Khan al-Ahmar, Wednesday, July 4, 2018 Credit: Majdi Mohammed/AP The European Union joined the criticism early on Thursday, saying in a statement that the demolitions "together with plans for new settlement construction for Israelis in the same area, exacerbate threats to the viability of the two-state solution and further undermine prospects for a lasting peace." The statement further said that the EU "expects the Israeli authorities to reverse these decisions and fully meet its obligations as an occupying power under International Humanitarian Law." Britain noted that it reiterated its concerns to the Israeli government over the planned demolitions, a fact that Alistair Burt mentioned in response to a parliamentary question from Labour MP Richard Burden. “This morning, officials from our embassy in Tel Aviv and from our consulate general in Jerusalem visited Khan al-Ahmar to express our concern and demonstrate the international community’s support for that community,” said Burt. “In accordance with our long-standing policy, we therefore condemn such a move, which would strike a major blow to prospects for a two-state solution with Jerusalem as a shared capital.” He revealed that the British ambassador had protested the matter on Monday to Israeli National Security Adviser Meir Ben Shabbat. “This should not be happening and need not be happening,” added Burt. Other members of Parliament joined in the discussion. While some spoke as friends of Israel who were worried about the lack of progress in the peace process with the Palestinians, others called for Britain to immediately and unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state in response to the evacuation of Khan al-Ahmar, and what they called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to abide by international law. A similar statement released by French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnès Von Der Mühll chided the action as going against international humanitarian law, and said the demolition makes the already precarious living conditions of the villages' residents more difficult. "The villages are also located in an area which is essential for the continuity of a future Palestinian state and thus the viability of the two-state solution, which has been undermined today by the Israeli authorities’ decisions," the statement said. France urged the Israeli authorities to "refrain from any measures aimed at extending [Israeli] settlements in the Occupied Territories or making them permanent, in contravention of international law, as United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 reaffirms. France, in conjunction with its European partners, will continue to keep a close eye on the issue." Ireland has also joined the condemnation of Israel's plan to demolish the village, with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney saying on Wednesday night that he was "extremely worried about the imminent threat to the Bedouin community of Khan al Ahmar." "The eviction of families and demolition of their homes is an action which has a strong historical resonance in Ireland, and which brings discredit on Israel," Coveney added. Coveney said that "Ireland has made these points clearly to Israeli representatives... I have also made Ireland's views on settlements known directly to the Prime Minister of Israel." He added that in light of his previous statements, he found it "deeply disappointing that Israel is nonetheless proceeding with this reprehensible action." In Israel, Joint List chairman, MK Ayman Odeh, called the planned demolition a "war crime which will leave entire families without a roof over their heads. People already evicted twice by the state, struggling now for their home and their school which gives them hope." This is not only a human injustice, Odeh said, but a political maneuver by the government to sever and dismantle the Arab settlements in C areas, and to expand the Israeli settlement blocs, "thus preventing any chance for a Palestinian state and peace." Eleven people were arrested after throwing stones Wednesday in Khan al-Ahmar. Dozens of Palestinian were wounded, according to the Red Crescent. Four were taken to the hospital, and three police officers were lightly wounded, one of whom received medical care on the scene. Representatives of Israel's Civil Administration hung notices around Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank on Tuesday evening, warning the village's inhabitants of their impending expulsion. By Wednesday morning there were bulldozers on the scene and clashes broke out. The expulsion of several dozen Bedouin families from Khan al-Ahmar is seen as enabling future expansion of the settlement of Kfar Adumim. The notes announcing the imminent eviction do not provide a certain timeline for intervention by authorities, though sources in the defense establishment told Haaretz that it could happen in weeks, or even days. Meanwhile, the area around Khan al-Ahmar has been closed to the general public until the end of July. The Civil administration is planning to build a road to the place for the purposes of the eviction. The works are supposed to start within days and the eviction can't begin until the road is ready. The residents are supposed to be moved to Al Jabel, a village near the Abu Dis garbage dump that the state allocated for the permanent settlement of the villagers.

MORE than 170 children at Al Khan Al Ahmar in the West Bank have lost their school following a demolition carried out by Israeli authorities today. Forty-four schools in the West Bank at risk of demolition – Save the Children calls for immediate commitments to protect schools and the right to learn for thousands of children across the West Bank. This follows the Israeli High Court of Justice’s 24 May decision to overturn the injunction protecting the community, marking an end to many years of legal efforts and leaving virtually no legal options1 to protect local Bedouin residents from having their community demolished, including their school. Thousands more Palestinian children living under Israeli occupation are at risk of losing their right to learn, as well as their homes. According to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), there are currently 44 schools that have been issued demolition orders, further threatening children’s ability to access education in the Palestinian Territory. Jennifer Moorehead, Save the Children’s Country Director in the occupied Palestinian territories, warned the demolitions could have a grave psychological impact on children. “The impact these demolitions have on the wellbeing of children, and their ability to learn and feel safe, cannot be understated and must not be accepted,” Ms Moorehead said. In the first seven months of 2018, four schools have been demolished. This is already more than the total number of demolitions that took place in 2017, indicating a sharp increase in the demolition of educational facilities. On top of this, in many locations children and teachers face daily violence, injuries, humiliation or even arrests on their way to school or during the school day. Nabil*, 15, has been attending the Khan Al Ahmar school for eight years.“All my siblings went to this school and all the community helped build the school, so we had many memories here. This demolition will ruin our future,” Nabil* said. Like many others Nabil* worries about how he will continue his education without a nearby school and faced with forced relocation. "School will be far away because we will be living on the mountain, and we will have to walk really far to get there. There is no one there, no friends, nobody and it will be hard on us," Nabil* said. The principle of Al Khan Al Ahmar school, Haleema a- Zahuyqa, said her students – some as young as six years old – would lose their basic rights to a safe home, including play, protection and education. "The children are under pressure – particularly emotional pressure. They are not sleeping, they are tense, and they have headaches and are scared,” Ms Ali said. Moorehead said the demolition was a breach of international law and internationally recognised provisions to protect schools in conflict areas. “Schools must be safe havens where children are able to learn and shape their future,” Moorehead said. She also warned this demolition could be a watershed case that would open the door for more to follow. “A line must be drawn to ensure that no further demolitions occur and that even more children do not see their education in jeopardy,” Moorehead said. “The Israeli government must make every effort to allow for the unhindered passage of students and school staff through checkpoints on their way to and from schools, and to ensure that schools are recognised as protected, safe places for children. “We also urge the Israeli government to take measures to protect children’s right to education and sign up to the Safe Schools Declaration. “Education is a human right that no child should be denied.” *Name changed for protection reasons For spokespersons please contact: Alex Sampson alex.sampson@savethechildren.org.au+962 (0) 791799287 or Antonia Roupell: antonia.roupell@savethechildren.org +44(0) 7879885327 Out of hours: +44 (0) 7831650409 Note to editors: ** In the first quarter of 2018 alone, there were 78 incidents of education-related violence across the West Bank affecting 26,569 children; including 17 cases of tear gas firing in/around schools, affecting 5,423 students. In 2016 there were 3 partial demolitions of classrooms in schools in the West Bank. For one of the schools, Abu Nuwwar, the classrooms were demolished twice. In 2017 three schools were demolished, and in 2018 four schools were demolished (including Al Khan Al Ahmar) to date. All of these schools were in the West Bank. Israeli Authorities argue that the buildings in the community of Al Khan Al Ahmar were illegally constructed. However, figures show that it is nearly impossible for Palestiniansto obtain building permits in Area C of the West Bank. Available figures of approved development permits across the West Bank show that between January and June 2016, only 0.5 per cent of the 428 requests were approved. In 2015, only seven out of 385 requests were approved, i.e. 1.81 per cent; and there were nine approved out of 440 requests, or 2.04 per cent, in 2014. Since 2009, the EU and its Member States have provided more than 300,000 Euros of assistance to Khan Al Ahmar community, including contributions to the school. Save the Children has been active in the area for more than 50 years, focussing on quality education, protection for children, greater access to health care and employment opportunities for youth. After a school is demolished, it also provides school materials and psychosocial support to children in schools. The Safe Schools Declaration is a political document, which provides countries the opportunity to express political support for the protection of students, teachers, schools, and universities during times of armed conflict. The Declaration contains a number of commitments aimed at strengthening the prevention of, and response to, attacks on education during armed conflict. This includes improving reporting of attacks on schools; collecting reliable data on attacks and military use of schools and universities; providing assistance to victims of attacks; investigating allegations of violations of national and international law and prosecuting perpetrators where appropriate; developing and promoting “conflict sensitive” approaches to education.

"School will be far away because we will be living on the mountain, and we will have to walk really far to get there. There is no one there, no friends, nobody and it will be hard on us," Nabil* said. The principle of Al Khan Al Ahmar school, Haleema a- Zahuyqa, said her students – some as young as six years old – would lose their basic rights to a safe home, including play, protection and education. "The children are under pressure – particularly emotional pressure. They are not sleeping, they are tense, and they have headaches and are scared,” Ms Ali said. Moorehead said the demolition was a breach of international law and internationally recognised provisions to protect schools in conflict areas. “Schools must be safe havens where children are able to learn and shape their future,” Moorehead said. She also warned this demolition could be a watershed case that would open the door for more to follow. “A line must be drawn to ensure that no further demolitions occur and that even more children do not see their education in jeopardy,” Moorehead said. “The Israeli government must make every effort to allow for the unhindered passage of students and school staff through checkpoints on their way to and from schools, and to ensure that schools are recognised as protected, safe places for children. “We also urge the Israeli government to take measures to protect children’s right to education and sign up to the Safe Schools Declaration. “Education is a human right that no child should be denied.” *Name changed for protection reasons For spokespersons please contact: Alex Sampson alex.sampson@savethechildren.org.au+962 (0) 791799287 or Antonia Roupell: antonia.roupell@savethechildren.org +44(0) 7879885327 Out of hours: +44 (0) 7831650409 Note to editors: ** In the first quarter of 2018 alone, there were 78 incidents of education-related violence across the West Bank affecting 26,569 children; including 17 cases of tear gas firing in/around schools, affecting 5,423 students. In 2016 there were 3 partial demolitions of classrooms in schools in the West Bank. For one of the schools, Abu Nuwwar, the classrooms were demolished twice. In 2017 three schools were demolished, and in 2018 four schools were demolished (including Al Khan Al Ahmar) to date. All of these schools were in the West Bank. Israeli Authorities argue that the buildings in the community of Al Khan Al Ahmar were illegally constructed. However, figures show that it is nearly impossible for Palestiniansto obtain building permits in Area C of the West Bank. Available figures of approved development permits across the West Bank show that between January and June 2016, only 0.5 per cent of the 428 requests were approved. In 2015, only seven out of 385 requests were approved, i.e. 1.81 per cent; and there were nine approved out of 440 requests, or 2.04 per cent, in 2014. Since 2009, the EU and its Member States have provided more than 300,000 Euros of assistance to Khan Al Ahmar community, including contributions to the school. Save the Children has been active in the area for more than 50 years, focussing on quality education, protection for children, greater access to health care and employment opportunities for youth. After a school is demolished, it also provides school materials and psychosocial support to children in schools. The Safe Schools Declaration is a political document, which provides countries the opportunity to express political support for the protection of students, teachers, schools, and universities during times of armed conflict. The Declaration contains a number of commitments aimed at strengthening the prevention of, and response to, attacks on education during armed conflict. This includes improving reporting of attacks on schools; collecting reliable data on attacks and military use of schools and universities; providing assistance to victims of attacks; investigating allegations of violations of national and international law and prosecuting perpetrators where appropriate; developing and promoting “conflict sensitive” approaches to education.

News article:
The High Court of Justice on Thursday night issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from carrying out plans to demolish a West Bank Bedouin village. Following an urgent petition submitted by Alaa Mahajna on behalf of the Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar, the court froze the demolition of the village, giving the state until July 11 to respond. The petition says the Civil Administration, in charge of construction permits in the West Bank, never offered any plans to legalize the village, and refused to review a plan submitted by the villagers. After a years-long legal battle, the Supreme Court approved the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar in May. The state says the structures were built without the relevant building permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway. But activists say the villagers — who have lived at the site since the 1950s after the state evicted them from their Negev homes — had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as these are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Israel has pledged to resettle the residents, which the UN says number 180 people. Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump in the nearby Palestinian town of Abu Dis. Bedouin villagers say the location is unsuitable for their way of life, and have also said residents of Abu Dis have warned them not to come there. Advertisement On Tuesday, activists said, Israel issued orders authorizing the seizure of access roads to the village. Heavy equipment has since been seen there, and on Thursday bulldozers could be seen widening the access road to the village, feeding speculation that a road was being prepared to facilitate the evacuation and demolition. On Wednesday clashes broke out between police and protesters at the village. Residents and activists attempted to block construction equipment from advancing, leading to violent scuffles. Police said in a statement that 11 people were arrested during disturbances at the site, and that rocks were thrown at officers. Israeli rights group B’Tselem said the detainees included the organization’s own head of field research. And on Thursday European diplomats tried to pay a solidarity visit to the village, but police barred them from reaching a school there. Diplomats from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Switzerland sought to visit the school which is funded by several European countries, but they were turned back at the village entrance. Advertisement Police at the scene said the area had been declared a closed military zone. “We were briefed by local leaders but refused access by security forces to the school,” the Irish representative office to the West Bank wrote on its official Twitter feed. “We wanted to show our solidarity with this village which is threatened with destruction, for humanitarian reasons and because it is a major issue of international law,” the Consul General of France in Jerusalem, Pierre Cochard, told journalists at the scene. He said that demolishing the village would be a violation of the Geneva convention, laying out the obligations of an occupier toward those under its control. It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added. Opponents of the demolition say it is part of an effort to to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea.

Turkey on Thursday "strongly" condemned the Israeli army's demolition of the Palestinian Bedouin houses in Abu Nuwar. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry also condemned "the start of preparations for demolishing in the Bedouin region of Khan Al-Ahmar in the occupied Palestinian territories". "These acts carried out by the Israeli authorities with impunity jeopardize the contiguous and independent Palestinian State perspective," it said. The ministry urged Israel to end "its illegal activities which exacerbate tensions in the region and undermine the two-state solution vision." Under 1995 Oslo agreement between Israel and Palestine, the West Bank was divided into A, B and C areas. The administrative and security authority of the area A was given to Palestine while the administration of area B was given to Palestine but security to Israel, while in area C areas, both administration and security authority, were given to Israel. The 700-person strong Abu Nuwar Bedouin community, who are in the area C, refused to leave their villages despite continuous threats and pressures from the Israeli authority.

The UN Human Rights Office and many European countries have slammed Israel’s decision to demolish a small Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank. Activists claim Israel wants to use the land to expand settlements. Israeli authorities have moved three bulldozers to Khan al-Ahmar, a Bedouin herding village in the West Bank, following a court’s ruling that declared the settlement illegal under Israeli law. The military already left a land confiscation notice there on Tuesday, local media reported. The Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. The village had been built without an Israeli permit, but Palestinians say they are impossible to obtain. Protests erupted at the village on Wednesday, descending into clashes with Israeli police. Two people were arrested and over 30 were injured, according to a Palestinian ambulance service. Meanwhile, high-ranked EU and international officials began pounding Israel with condemnation of the looming demolition. Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said that “international humanitarian law prohibits the destruction or confiscation of private property by the occupying power.” Maja Kocijancic, the EU spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, lamented the West Bank demolitions, saying they “exacerbate threats to the viability of the two-state solution and further undermine prospects for a lasting peace.” The French Foreign Ministry asserted that bulldozing Khan al-Akhram, which is located in an area “essential for the continuity of a future Palestinian state,” goes against international humanitarian law. Its statement has also accused Israel of undermining peace prospects for Palestine. Jamie McGoldrick, the UN Development and Humanitarian Coordinator in Palestine, had also called upon Tel Aviv to reverse the demolition. “Like many Palestinians in Area C, the residents of Khan al Ahmar have fought for years to live with dignity, to protect their children, their homes, and their community,” he said, urging support for people who “have struggled in the face of tremendous daily pressure.” In light of today's worrying developments in Khan al Ahmar and Abu Nuwar, I reiterate my https://t.co/QNit6u4uVf abandon plans to demolish and transfer #Palestinian communities pic.twitter.com/Q7jtQLWHch — Jamie McGoldrick (@jamiemcgoldric8) July 4, 2018 Sarit Michaeli, an international advocacy officer with B'Tselem, uploaded images of Khan al-Ahmar bracing for the demolition. “This is what a war crime looks like,” she tweeted.

Israel is planning to construct a belt of Jewish settlements around Jerusalem in so-called Area C, the major part of West Bank which it completely controls and administers, and Khan al-Ahmar is a likely building site.

Diplomats from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the European Union sought to visit the school in the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar which is funded by several European countries, but they were turned back at the village entrance.

It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added.

Activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. The army said on Thursday that following the court ruling the process of enforcing eviction and demolition orders was under way, but did not say when the buildings would be razed. "The organisations responsible for the matter, including security forces, have begun preparing for the execution of demolition warrants that were issued against illegal buildings in Khan al-Ahmar," it said in an English-language statement "Accordingly, the preparation of the routes necessary to enforce the warrants has begun, as well as infrastructure works in an alternative area for the residents who will be evacuated." Activists expect the demolition to happen within the next few days. Scuffles broke out Wednesday as a bulldozer went to work levelling ground next to the village in what residents believed was preparation for an imminent eviction operation. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block the bulldozer and tussled with police. Some climbed onto the machine in protest. The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Dozens of journalists and activists stood at the edge of the village on Thursday. "What the Israeli authorities are doing is a population transfer contrary to the Rome and Geneva conventions," Palestinian lawyer Munji Abdallah, 50, told AFP. Khan al-Ahmar is located near several major Israeli settlements and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two. Search Keywords: Short link:

The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Dozens of journalists and activists stood at the edge of the village on Thursday. "What the Israeli authorities are doing is a population transfer contrary to the Rome and Geneva conventions," Palestinian lawyer Munji Abdallah, 50, told AFP. Khan al-Ahmar is located near several major Israeli settlements and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two. Search Keywords: Short link:

Related Scuffles as Israel readies to demolish Palestinian Bedouin village European diplomats on Thursday tried to pay a solidarity visit to a West Bank village under threat of demolition by Israel but police barred them from reaching a school there. Diplomats from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the European Union sought to visit the school in the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar which is funded by several European countries, but they were turned back at the village entrance. Police at the scene said the area had been declared a closed military zone. "We were briefed by local leaders but refused access by security forces to the school," the Irish representative office to the West Bank wrote on its official Twitter feed. "We wanted to show our solidarity with this village which is threatened with destruction, for humanitarian reasons and because it is a major issue of international law," the Consul General of France in Jerusalem, Pierre Cochard, told journalists at the scene. He said that demolishing the village of 173 residents, east of Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, would be a violation of the Geneva convention laying out the obligations of an occupier toward those under its control. It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. Activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. The army said on Thursday that following the court ruling the process of enforcing eviction and demolition orders was under way, but did not say when the buildings would be razed. "The organisations responsible for the matter, including security forces, have begun preparing for the execution of demolition warrants that were issued against illegal buildings in Khan al-Ahmar," it said in an English-language statement "Accordingly, the preparation of the routes necessary to enforce the warrants has begun, as well as infrastructure works in an alternative area for the residents who will be evacuated." Activists expect the demolition to happen within the next few days. Scuffles broke out Wednesday as a bulldozer went to work levelling ground next to the village in what residents believed was preparation for an imminent eviction operation. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block the bulldozer and tussled with police. Some climbed onto the machine in protest.

Protesters at an illegal Bedouin encampment erupted in violence against Israel soldiers on Wednesday as forces moved in to demolish the illegal building, in accordance with a Supreme Court order. Protesters and residents of Khan al-Ahmar in the Judean Desert tried to block construction equipment from paving an access road to facilitate the demolition, and rocks were thrown at officers. No injuries or damage were reported. The Supreme Court approved the demolition in May after years of legal battles, finding that the makeshift village was built illegally and posed a threat to residents due to its proximity to a highway. Among the buildings to be demolished is a school that residents put together in partnership with an Italian pro-Palestinian eco-building organization using old tires, mud and used cooking oil. Israel has pledged to resettle the estimated 180 residents near the Jerusalem Arab neighborhood of Abu Dis. The villagers have rejected the plan. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said demolishing Khan al-Ahmar would be a violation of international law, adding that Israel, an “occupying power,” should “respect the rights of residents to remain on their land.” The commission has never issued statements regarding the demolition of Jewish buildings that Israel’s courts have determined are illegal. J Street, a left-wing group in the United States that describes itself as “pro-Israel,”” brought a petition against the demolition to the Israeli Embassy in Washington, decrying the move as “a major blow to prospects for a two-state solution.” The radical left-wing B’Tselem organization reported that reported that Israeli security forces arrived at the Bedouin camp of Abu Nawwar near the Judean desert city of Ma’ale Adumim and demolished an additional nine houses. The organization also reported that Israeli security forces arrived in the southern Hebron hills community of Susiya, preparing to demolish another seven illegal Bedouin buildings slated for demolition.

Israeli police scuffled with activists protesting the planned demolition of a Bedouin hamlet in the West Bank on Wednesday amid international opposition to the razing of the site. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said 11 people were arrested in the “disturbance” including several for throwing stones at officers in Khan al-Ahmar. He said three officers were injured, including one evacuated to a hospital for treatment. Advertisement Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator, said four protesters were injured. “This is a vicious, barbaric attack on peaceful demonstrators and they are trying to demolish Khan Al-Ahmar,” he said. Israel says the structures that make up the Khan al-Ahmar encampment of corrugated shacks and tents were illegally built and pose a threat to residents because of their proximity to a highway. Police could be seen dragging a handcuffed woman and pushing a Bedouin man. A construction vehicle flattened earth near the site. The Bedouin village outside the Kfar Adumim settlement, is set to be demolished at an unknown date after Israel's Supreme Court approved the move in May. Residents and activists voiced concern on Wednesday that Israel is set to raze the Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank ignoring international calls for a reprieve. Activists said the Israeli military issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday authorizing it to seize access roads to the village. Heavy equipment, including at least one bulldozer, was seen around the village on Wednesday, leading to speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. “Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents,” Amit Gilutz, spokesperson for Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally and in May, the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits as the documents are near impossible for Palestinians to obtain for that part of the occupied West Bank. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers a relocation site. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Britain’s minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. He warned that any forced relocation “could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned.” Forcible transfer is considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Khan al-Ahmar is located east of Jerusalem near several Israeli settlements along a road leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two.

News article:
Jerusalem, 5 July 2018 Today, the Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Jamie McGoldrick, the Head of West Bank Operations for UNRWA, Mr. Scott Anderson, and the Head of the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. James Heenan, expressed serious concern over demolitions and related events in vulnerable Palestinian communities in the central West Bank Yesterday, Israeli forces began levelling access routes in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Khan al Ahmar-Abu al Helu, home to more than 180 people, 95 per cent of whom are Palestine refugees. The work comes in advance of the expected demolition of the entire community. Israeli forces injured thirty-five Palestinians and arrested others, including residents, in confrontations that ensued while bulldozers were levelling all entry and exit points. One Israeli soldier was also reported injured as well. Today, the Israeli authorities have declared Khan al Ahmar a closed military area, and are heavily restricting movement of residents and preventing the entry of others to the community. “What we are seeing unfold on the ground is deeply disturbing,” said Mr. McGoldrick. “Demolitions have a devastating impact on families and on communities. These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs. I call again on the Israeli authorities to cease demolitions and other measures that may result in the forcible transfer of Palestinians.” This situation occurs on the backdrop of a wave of demolitions across the West Bank in recent days. Since 1 July, eleven incidents have occurred, displacing 59 Palestinians, including 37 children, and affecting more than 200 others. Included within this is the demolition of 19 structures, including nine homes, in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Abu Nuwar (around 600 residents, 88 per cent Palestine refugees). As a result, 51 people, including 33 children, were displaced and another 13 people, including five children, who had family property destroyed, were directly affected. Also, one home was destroyed today in Susiya, displacing a family of five. “The escalation of events in the last few days – the demolitions in Abu Nuwar, the declaration of the Khan al Ahmar community as a closed military zone, the violence and large presence of armed Israeli forces – makes life in these communities virtually untenable. The latest developments are of serious concern as it is evident that they are undertaken with the objective of relocating the concerned communities, as well as causing serious distress to the vulnerable residents who are watching what appear to be preparations for the demolition of their community,” said Mr. Scott Anderson. “These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees – originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev. They should not be forced to experience a second displacement against their will.” “The demolitions in the community will have serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences,” said Mr. Heenan. “There is high risk of forced evictions of individuals, destruction of private property as well as a dramatic increase in the coercive environment under which the community already lives, in turn raising the risk of forcible transfer.” END For more information, please contact Mr. Ofir Feuerstein, +972 (0) 54 33 11 836, feuerstein@un.org (mailto:feuerstein@un.org) Background: Khan al Ahmar – Abu al Helu and Abu Nuwar are among the 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities (8,100 people) at risk of forcible transfer in the central West Bank and among the more than 3,500 residents living in 18 communities located in the area slated for the E1 settlement plan that seeks to connect the Ma’ale Adummim settlement bloc with East Jerusalem. International humanitarian law (IHL) requires an occupying power to protect the population of the territory that it occupies, ensure its welfare and wellbeing, as well as the respect for its human rights. Any destruction of property by the occupying power is prohibited, except when rendered absolutely necessary by military operations, which is not relevant in the West Bank where there are currently no active hostilities. The extensive demolition of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, may be a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and may amount to a war crime. Other than for the security of the population or imperative military reasons, IHL further prohibits the transfer of the population of an occupied territory without the genuinely and fully informed consent of the affected people, regardless of the motive. Consent is not considered genuine in an environment marked by the use or threat of physical force, coercion, fear of violence or duress. In the absence of such consent, the transfer is forcible and constitutes a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

KHAN AL-AHMAR, Palestinian Territories: Scuffles broke out on Wednesday between Israeli authorities and protesters who feared preparations were underway to raze a Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank, despite international calls for a reprieve. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block a bulldozer and scuffled with police at Khan al-Ahmar on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem. Some climbed onto the bulldozer in protest. Israeli rights group B´Tselem said nine people were arrested — five from the village and four others, including the organisation´s own head of field research. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported 35 people injured, with four taken to hospital. Police reported two arrests and said stones were thrown at officers. The incident came after activists said the Israeli military had issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday, authorising itself to seize access roads to the village. Heavy equipment was seen around the village on Wednesday, prompting speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. “Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents,” Amit Gilutz, spokesman for B´Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers an alternative site. The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Britain´s minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. He warned that any forced relocation “could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned.” Such an action would be considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions.

Heavy equipment was seen around the village on Wednesday, prompting speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. “Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents,” Amit Gilutz, spokesman for B´Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers an alternative site. The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Britain´s minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. He warned that any forced relocation “could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned.” Such an action would be considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions.

KHAN AL-AHMAR, Palestinian Territories: Scuffles broke out on Wednesday between Israeli authorities and protesters who feared preparations were underway to raze a Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank, despite international calls for a reprieve. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block a bulldozer and scuffled with police at Khan al-Ahmar on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem. Some climbed onto the bulldozer in protest. Israeli rights group B´Tselem said nine people were arrested — five from the village and four others, including the organisation´s own head of field research. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported 35 people injured, with four taken to hospital. Police reported two arrests and said stones were thrown at officers. The incident came after activists said the Israeli military had issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday, authorising itself to seize access roads to the village.

Israel's top court today suspended the planned demolition of a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank whose fate has become a focus of Palestinian protests and international concern, a lawyer for the residents said, Reuters reports. The Supreme Court injunction, issued a day after Israeli security forces violently attacked protesters in Khan Al-Ahmar, gave the state until 11 July to respond to the villagers' contention that they had been unfairly denied building permits, lawyer Alaa Mahajna told Reuters. The court spokesman could not be reached for comment. Around 180 Bedouin, raising sheep and goats, live in tin and wood shacks in Khan Al-Ahmar. Demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar: Another chapter in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine Last year Israeli authorities informed the High Court that they plan to seize the land where the community is located and displace its residents, although the land is registered as owned by Palestinian citizens from the nearby town of Anata. The land is set to be used to expand nearby illegal Jewish only settlements. The residents of Khan Al-Ahmar, known as Al-Jahhalin Bedouins, are refugees from the Negev desert who have lived in the area south of Jerusalem since their displacement by the Israeli army in 1967. Israel has refused to recognise Al-Jahhalin Bedouin communities or grant them building permits.

Israel has long sought to clear Bedouin from the area between the two settlements, and the Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. Israel police violently attack and evict Palestinians near Jerusalem Removing the Bedouin, human rights groups say, would create a bigger settlement pocket near Jerusalem and make it more difficult for Palestinians to achieve territorial contiguity in the West Bank, a territory they seek along with the Gaza Strip for a future state. Israel said it plans to relocate the residents to an area about 12 kilometres (seven miles) away, near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. The new site is adjacent to a landfill and rights advocates say that a forcible transfer of the residents would violate international law applying to occupied territory. The United Nations and European Union have come out against the plan. Why is Israel ignoring the West Bank protests to lift Gaza sanctions? Most countries regard settlements Israel has built in the West Bank as illegal. Israel disputes this. Khan al-Ahmar's residents belong to the Jahalin tribe of Bedouin who were expelled from southern Israel by the military in the 1950s. Interviewed before the Supreme Court injunction on Thursday, Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan signalled that the Khan al-Ahmar demolition might not be imminent. Noting the level of international opposition to the move, Erdan told the Ynet news site: "I hope this decision will be implemented in the coming weeks."

Israel's Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the demolition of a Palestinian Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, following growing international concerns over the move. The order, issued on Thursday night, stops the Israeli authorities razing Khan al-Ahmar until at least July 11 to give the state time to respond, according to a copy of the document posted Friday on the court website. "A temporary injunction is hereby granted forbidding the implementation of the demolition orders," it said. Attorney Shlomo Lecker, representing villagers, told AFP that the respite followed a new petition by residents who submitted a planning application to rebuild the village at its present location. The present village consists mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is generally the case with Bedouin sites. There has been strong international pressure on Israel to reverse its plans to raze Khan al-Ahmar, which the Israeli authorities say was built illegally. In May, the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. Activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits that are almost never issued to Palestinians in the parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. - Diplomatic pressure - Israeli rights activist Angela Godfrey-Goldstein said she believed that diplomatic pressure played a role in the stay of execution. Diplomats from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the European Union tried Thursday to visit Khan al-Ahmar's school, which is funded by several European countries, but they were turned back at the village entrance. The consul general of France in Jerusalem, Pierre Cochard, told journalists at the scene that demolishing the village of 173 residents would be a violation of the Geneva convention which lays out the obligations of an occupying power toward those under its control. It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added. Police said the area had been declared a closed military zone. The army had said on Thursday that the process of enforcing eviction and demolition orders was under way, but did not give a date when the buildings would be razed. The U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Jamie McGoldrick, has condemned the move. "These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs," he said in a statement on Thursday. Khan al-Ahmar is located near several major Israeli settlements and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Right-wing Israeli NGO Regavim which supports Jewish settlements, called on Friday for the government to press ahead with dismantling the village. "European countries initiated and funded illegal construction throughout this area," it said in a statement. "Adding insult to injury, they now exert completely inappropriate pressure, through radical leftist organizations and the cynical abuse of Israel's judicial system." "The case of Khan al Ahmar has become a litmus test for the State of Israel," it added. "The government must take a firm stand in the face of the pressure campaign that is being waged against it." Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two.

News article:
Senior United Nations officials on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory yesterday urged Israel to halt its demolition of Palestinian properties, expressing "serious concern" over events in Khan Al-Ahmar, a village slated for destruction. Humanitarian Coordinator, Jamie McGoldrick, the Head of West Bank Operations for UNRWA, Scott Anderson, and the Head of the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, James Heenan, spoke out as Israeli forces began preparations this week for the planned demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar and the expulsion of its residents. The Israeli Supreme Court – which has previously approved the demolition – yesterday issued a temporary injunction. McGoldrick said: What we are seeing unfold on the ground is deeply disturbing. Demolitions have a devastating impact on families and on communities. He added: "These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs. I call again on the Israeli authorities to cease demolitions and other measures that may result in the forcible transfer of Palestinians." Demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar: Another chapter in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine The UN press release noted that "a wave of demolitions across the West Bank in recent days", with 59 Palestinians displaced since 1 July, including 37 children. "The escalation of events in the last few days – the demolitions in Abu Nuwar, the declaration of the Khan Al-Ahmar community as a closed military zone, the violence and large presence of armed Israeli forces – makes life in these communities virtually untenable," said Anderson. "The latest developments are of serious concern as it is evident that they are undertaken with the objective of relocating the concerned communities, as well as causing serious distress to the vulnerable residents who are watching what appear to be preparations for the demolition of their community." 17 Palestinians homeless as Israel demolishes their flats He added: "These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees – originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev. They should not be forced to experience a second displacement against their will." "The demolitions in the community will have serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences," said Heenan. "There is high risk of forced evictions of individuals, destruction of private property as well as a dramatic increase in the coercive environment under which the community already lives, in turn raising the risk of forcible transfer." According to the UN,

2. Key Information/Sub-event: The image shows a large Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank. The settlement is located on a hilltop and overlooks the Palestinian village of Khan Al-Ahmar, which is slated for demolition by the Israeli authorities. The image highlights the stark contrast between the two communities: the Israeli settlement is large, well-developed, and has a modern infrastructure, while the Palestinian village is small, impoverished, and lacks basic services.
3. News Event Perspective: The image provides a visual representation of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the human rights violations that are being committed against the Palestinian people. The image shows how the Israeli settlements are expanding into Palestinian territory, while the Palestinian villages are being demolished. The image also highlights the fact that the Israeli settlements are often located in areas that are strategically important, such as on hilltops that overlook Palestinian villages. This gives the Israeli settlers a military advantage over the Palestinians and makes it difficult for the Palestinians to resist the occupation.

"The community is terrified that the bulldozers will be back."This community has already suffered so much and the impending threat of demolition is having a huge impact on the psychological wellbeing of the children," she added, noting that Khan al-Ahmar is home to school that serves some 170 Palestinian children living in Bedouin communities in the area.However, Human Rights Watch notes that "the Israeli military refuses to permit most new Palestinian construction in the 60 percent of the West Bank where it has exclusive control over planning and building, even as the military facilitates settler construction".Walid Assaf, head of the National Committee to Resist the Wall and Settlements, credited activists on the ground for the injunction. He also thanked foreign diplomats and lawyers who worked on the case and visited the community regularly in support.Assaf was quoted as saying by official Palestinian news agency Wafa.In a statement published by the PLO's Negotiations Affairs Department on Thursday, Khan al-Ahmar residents had called on the international community to "hold Israel accountable for its crimes"."The issue of Khan al-Ahmar illustrates Israel's objective of widespread and systematic forcible displacement of Palestinians and replacement with Israeli settlers, as part and parcel of Israel's broader scheme of creeping annexation," the statement said.On Thursday, prior to the court's decision, the United Nations warned that displacing Palestinian villagers has "serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences"."These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees - originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev.

© Shadi Hatem/APA Images The villages Khan al-Ahmar, and Abu Nuwar are home to just around 2,000 Bedouins, but the impact of their removal would be lasting, making a Palestinian state no longer possible, advocates of the two-state solution warned.Today, bulldozers demolished nine homes and three farm buildings in Abu Nuwar and clashed with Bedouin residents in Khan al-Ahmar. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society Israeli police injured 35, of whom 4 were hospitalized. Founder of Rabbis for Human Rights, Rabbi Arik Ascherman posted a video of the encounter on social media, writing, "You can see some of the violence at the end of this video. My battery died, and I didn't get the worst of it. The police were swinging wildly and kicking viciously, until their commanding officer got a hold of them."Activists on the ground say they fear the demolitions of the towns will be completed overnight, in darkness and after media and European consular officials, who were on site today, head home.Angela Godfrey-Goldstein who heads the group Jahalin Solidarity told Mondoweiss, "This demolition is Trump's gift to Netanyahu for July Fourth. But it has backfired. I don't think Trump understands what he has set in motion, which is why it's so dangerous." She warned the eviction would move Israel onto a path of "full fledged apartheid statehood, with no sustainable future ahead. SoAlso this morning Israeli authorities were spotted at Jabal West with construction materials. Jabal West is a proposed relocation site outfitted with an apartment building and buffered by a city dump. Spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem Amit Gilutz said in a statement that demolishing the Bedouin towns and then moving them to another location constitutes forcible transfer, a violation of international law."No military order or court ruling can make the transfer of these residents lawful or moral. Forcible transfer of Palestinian communities is a war crime, and all who are involved in approving or implementing it bear personal liability," Gilutz said.While demolitions were on-going today the UK's Parliament met for an emergency discussion on the demolitions. Lawmakers from Britain's Labour party called for a decisive response, weighing recognizing Palestinian statehood and banning trade with Israeli companies that operate in the settlements.Labour party parliamentarian Richard Burden said, "Speaking plainly, it is state sponsored theft. A theft that will cut the West Bank into two, making a continuous Palestinian state near impossible and the prospects of a two state solution so more remote."Bedouins Khan al-Ahmar and Abu Nuwar are from the Jahalin tribe, Palestinian herders and shepherds who lived in lands that became southern Israel until the 1950s. At that time Israel's military government transferred them to the hilltops outside of Jerusalem, where they live today."Words of warning to Israel are not enough. If there is no serious intervention from the international community towards the Israeli government and its belligerent military occupation, other villages will be next, and more Palestinian men, women and children will be displaced for another 70 years to come," she said.

News article:
The High Court of Justice agreed on Thursday to hold a hearing on a petition filed by residents of Khan al-Ahmar against the state’s decision to demolish the Bedouin village near the West Bank settlement of Ma’ale Adumim. The top legal body ordered that a hearing on the matter be held by August 15, meaning the demotion of the hamlet — originally green-lighted by the court in May — will be further delayed until after the session takes place and a decision is handed down. In the beginning of July, the state began its preparations to raze the village, where none of the structures have been granted permits. Security forces were deployed to the village and construction workers began paving an access road that would facilitate the demolition and evacuation. With the eviction appearing just days away, attorneys representing Khan al-Ahmar submitted an urgent petition last Wednesday that claimed the Civil Administration — the Defense Ministry body in charge of construction permits in the West Bank — never offered any plans to legalize the village, and refused to review a plan submitted by the villagers. The High Court ordered the state to respond to the petition, which it did earlier this week. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In its response, the state argued that the Supreme Court, in its initial ruling, discussed the option of legalizing the village but ultimately ruled against it. Moreover, the state claimed that village leaders had themselves never submitted any plans for the Civil Administration’s approval. In light of that response, the High Court had the option to either accept the claims of the state by rejecting the Khan al-Ahmar petition or hold a hearing to gain more clarity on the matter. It chose to do the latter, giving some weight to the claims of the Bedouin residents. An additional petition was filed on Monday by the same group of attorneys representing the village. That appeal claimed that no eviction orders were ever filed against the residents, as required before any village is cleared. Instead, the Palestinian attorneys asserted that only demolition orders were submitted. Advertisement In response to the petition, the High Court issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from carrying out its plans to evacuate Khan al-Ahmar, and ordered the state to respond by July 16. Also offering the village a reprieve, the Defense Ministry body responsible for overseeing the demolition announced that it was going on strike beginning next Sunday, due to what it says is the Finance Ministry’s failure to implement improvements to workers’ pension plans promised nearly three years ago. In their letter announcing the indefinite strike, the Civil Administration committee stated that among the projects that will not be carried out prior to their return to work is the Khan al-Ahmar evacuation. Residents say this means they will be able to begin the new school year in the village on July 15 as originally planned. The hamlet has gained international attention for its school buildings made from tires, mud, and used cooking oil due to Israeli restrictions on construction. After a years-long legal battle, the Supreme Court approved the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar in May. The state says the structures, mostly makeshift shacks and tents, were built without the relevant building permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway. But activists say the villagers — who have lived at the site, then in Jordan, since the 1950s, after the state evicted them from their Negev homes — had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as they are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Advertisement Israel has pledged to resettle the residents, whom the UN says number 180 people. Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump belonging to the nearby Palestinian town of Abu Dis. But the villagers say the location is unsuitable for their way of life, and have also said residents of Abu Dis have warned them to stay away. Opponents of the demolition also argue that it is part of an effort to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem almost to the Dead Sea, a move critics say will bisect the West Bank, and make a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Last week, the IDF issued orders authorizing the seizure of access roads to the village. Heavy demolition equipment has since been moved there, and last Thursday bulldozers could be seen widening the access road to the village, feeding speculation that a road was being prepared to facilitate the evacuation and demolition. On the day prior, clashes broke out between police and protesters at the village. Residents and activists attempted to block construction equipment from advancing, leading to violent scuffles. Police said in a statement that 11 people were arrested during disturbances at the site, and that rocks were thrown at officers. Israeli rights group B’Tselem said the detainees included the organization’s own head of field research. Two of demonstrators were released shortly thereafter. Advertisement On Sunday, an Ofer Military Court judge ordered the conditional release of eight more Palestinians. On Thursday, the judge ordered the last suspect, who is accused of throwing stones at troops, be released to house arrest.

Israel's Supreme Court has postponed until mid-August the Israeli authorities' planned demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar, a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank. Last week, the court issued an injunction against the demolition, after villagers said their efforts to secure retroactive building permits had been ignored by the Israeli authorities. Israel systematically denies such permits to Palestinian residents of "Area C" of the West Bank, at the same time as encouraging the growth of settlements built in contravention of international law. Yesterday, according to agency reports, the court summoned both sides for a session by 15 August, "effectively putting the demolitions on hold". Demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar: Another chapter in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine Israel intends to forcibly displace Khan Al-Ahmar's residents, as part of a long-standing plan to expand nearby Israeli settlements. Israel's policy of demolitions and displacement are grave violations of its responsibilities as an occupying power, and human rights groups have said the destruction of Khan al-Ahmar will amount to a war crime.

Israel finally built an access road to the West Bank village of Khan al-Ahmar last week, after half a century of delays.If one community has come to symbolize the demise of the two-state solution, it is Khan al-Ahmar.It was for that reason that a posse of European diplomats left their air-conditioned offices late last week to trudge through the hot, dusty hills outside Jerusalem and witness for themselves the preparations for the village's destruction. That included the Israeli police viciously beating residents and supporters as they tried to block the advance of heavy machinery.Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have submitted a formal protest. Their denunciations echoed those of more than 70 Democratic lawmakers in Washington in May - a rare example of US politicians showing solidarity with Palestinians.It would be gratifying to believe that Western governments care about the inhabitants of Khan al-Ahmar - or the thousands of other Palestinians who are being incrementally cleansed by Israel from nearby lands but whose plight has drawn far less attention.After all,But in truth, Western politicians are more concerned about propping up the illusion of a peace process that expired many years ago than the long-running abuse of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.Western capitals understand what is at stake. Israel wants Khan al-Ahmar gone so that Jewish settlements can be built in its place, on land it has designated as "E1".That would put the final piece in place for Israel to build a substantial bloc of new settler homes to sever the West Bank in two.The erasure of Khan al-Ahmar has not arrived out of nowhere. Israel has trampled on international law for decades, conducting a form of creeping annexation that has provoked little more than uncomfortable shifting in chairs from Western politicians.Khan al-Ahmar's Bedouin inhabitants, from the Jahalin tribe, have been ethnically cleansedby Israel, but these war crimes went unnoticed.The first time was in the 1950s, a few years after Israel's creation, when 80 percent of Palestinians had been driven from their homes to clear the path for the creation of a Jewish state.Although they should have enjoyed the protection of Israeli citizenship, the Jahalin were forced out of the Negev and into the West Bank, then controlled by Jordan, to make way for new Jewish immigrants.A generation later in 1967, when they had barely re-established themselves, the Jahalin were again under attack from Israeli soldiers occupying the West Bank. The grazing lands the Jahalin had relocated to with their goats and sheep were seized to build a settlement for Jews only, Kfar Adumim, in violation of the laws of war.Ever since the Jahalin have dwelt in a twilight zone of Israeli-defined "illegality". Like other Palestinians in the 60 percent of the West Bank declared under Israeli control by the Oslo peace process, they have been denied building permits, forcing three generations to live in tin shacks and tents.Israel has also refused to connect the village to the water, electricity and sewage grids, in an attempt to make life so unbearable the Jahalin would opt to leave.When an Italian charity helped in 2009 to establish Khan al-Ahmar's first school - made from mud and tires - Israel stepped up its legal battle to demolish the village.Now, the Jahalin are about to be driven from their lands again, as though they are nothing more than wayward cattle. This time they are to be forcibly resettled next to a waste dump by the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, hemmed in on all sides by Israeli walls and settlements.In the new location, they will be forced to abandon their pastoral way of life. As a resident, Ibrahim Abu Dawoud observed: "For us, leaving the desert is death."In another indication of the Palestinians' dire predicament, the Trump administration is expected to propose in its long-awaited peace plan that the slum-like Abu Dis, rather than East Jerusalem, serve as the capital of a future pseudo-Palestinian state - if Israel ever chooses to recognize one.Khan al-Ahmar's destruction would be the first demolition of a complete Palestinian community since the 1990s when Israel ostensibly committed to the Oslo process.. It wants to annex the lands on which villages like Khan al-Ahmar stand and remove their Palestinian populations.There is a minor hurdle. Last Thursday, the Israeli supreme court tried to calm the storm clouds gathering in Europe by issuing a temporary injunction on the demolition works.The reprieve is likely to be short-lived. A few weeks ago the same court - in a panel dominated by judges identified with the settler movement - backed Khan al-Ahmar's destruction.The Supreme Court has also been moving towards accepting the Israeli government's argument that decades of land grabs by settlers should be retroactively sanctioned - even though they violate Israeli and international law - if carried out in "good faith".Whatever the judges believe, there is nothing "good faith" about the behavior of either the settlers or Israel's government towards communities like Khan al-Ahmar.Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians' veteran peace negotiator, recently warned that Israel and the US were close to "liquidating" the project of Palestinian statehood.Sounding more desperate than usual, the Europe Union reaffirmed this month its commitment to a two-state solution, while urging that the "obstacles" to its realization be more clearly identified.As Khan al-Ahmar demonstrates all too clearly, there will be no end to the slow-motion erasure of Palestinian communities until western governments find the nerve to impose biting sanctions on Israel.

He contributed this article to PalestineChronicle.com. Visit: www.jonathan-cook.net. Israel finally built an access road to the West Bank village of Khan al-Ahmar last week, after half a century of delays.If one community has come to symbolize the demise of the two-state solution, it is Khan al-Ahmar.It was for that reason that a posse of European diplomats left their air-conditioned offices late last week to trudge through the hot, dusty hills outside Jerusalem and witness for themselves the preparations for the village's destruction. That included the Israeli police viciously beating residents and supporters as they tried to block the advance of heavy machinery.Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have submitted a formal protest. Their denunciations echoed those of more than 70 Democratic lawmakers in Washington in May - a rare example of US politicians showing solidarity with Palestinians.It would be gratifying to believe that Western governments care about the inhabitants of Khan al-Ahmar - or the thousands of other Palestinians who are being incrementally cleansed by Israel from nearby lands but whose plight has drawn far less attention.After all,But in truth, Western politicians are more concerned about propping up the illusion of a peace process that expired many years ago than the long-running abuse of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.Western capitals understand what is at stake. Israel wants Khan al-Ahmar gone so that Jewish settlements can be built in its place, on land it has designated as "E1".That would put the final piece in place for Israel to build a substantial bloc of new settler homes to sever the West Bank in two.The erasure of Khan al-Ahmar has not arrived out of nowhere. Israel has trampled on international law for decades, conducting a form of creeping annexation that has provoked little more than uncomfortable shifting in chairs from Western politicians.Khan al-Ahmar's Bedouin inhabitants, from the Jahalin tribe, have been ethnically cleansedby Israel, but these war crimes went unnoticed.The first time was in the 1950s, a few years after Israel's creation, when 80 percent of Palestinians had been driven from their homes to clear the path for the creation of a Jewish state.Although they should have enjoyed the protection of Israeli citizenship, the Jahalin were forced out of the Negev and into the West Bank, then controlled by Jordan, to make way for new Jewish immigrants.A generation later in 1967, when they had barely re-established themselves, the Jahalin were again under attack from Israeli soldiers occupying the West Bank. The grazing lands the Jahalin had relocated to with their goats and sheep were seized to build a settlement for Jews only, Kfar Adumim, in violation of the laws of war.Ever since the Jahalin have dwelt in a twilight zone of Israeli-defined "illegality". Like other Palestinians in the 60 percent of the West Bank declared under Israeli control by the Oslo peace process, they have been denied building permits, forcing three generations to live in tin shacks and tents.Israel has also refused to connect the village to the water, electricity and sewage grids, in an attempt to make life so unbearable the Jahalin would opt to leave.When an Italian charity helped in 2009 to establish Khan al-Ahmar's first school - made from mud and tires - Israel stepped up its legal battle to demolish the village.Now, the Jahalin are about to be driven from their lands again, as though they are nothing more than wayward cattle. This time they are to be forcibly resettled next to a waste dump by the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, hemmed in on all sides by Israeli walls and settlements.In the new location, they will be forced to abandon their pastoral way of life. As a resident, Ibrahim Abu Dawoud observed: "For us, leaving the desert is death."In another indication of the Palestinians' dire predicament, the Trump administration is expected to propose in its long-awaited peace plan that the slum-like Abu Dis, rather than East Jerusalem, serve as the capital of a future pseudo-Palestinian state - if Israel ever chooses to recognize one.Khan al-Ahmar's destruction would be the first demolition of a complete Palestinian community since the 1990s when Israel ostensibly committed to the Oslo process.. It wants to annex the lands on which villages like Khan al-Ahmar stand and remove their Palestinian populations.There is a minor hurdle. Last Thursday, the Israeli supreme court tried to calm the storm clouds gathering in Europe by issuing a temporary injunction on the demolition works.The reprieve is likely to be short-lived. A few weeks ago the same court - in a panel dominated by judges identified with the settler movement - backed Khan al-Ahmar's destruction.The Supreme Court has also been moving towards accepting the Israeli government's argument that decades of land grabs by settlers should be retroactively sanctioned - even though they violate Israeli and international law - if carried out in "good faith".Whatever the judges believe, there is nothing "good faith" about the behavior of either the settlers or Israel's government towards communities like Khan al-Ahmar.Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians' veteran peace negotiator, recently warned that Israel and the US were close to "liquidating" the project of Palestinian statehood.Sounding more desperate than usual, the Europe Union reaffirmed this month its commitment to a two-state solution, while urging that the "obstacles" to its realization be more clearly identified.As Khan al-Ahmar demonstrates all too clearly, there will be no end to the slow-motion erasure of Palestinian communities until western governments find the nerve to impose biting sanctions on Israel.

On April 13, a new era of combat commenced as part of the ongoing conflict between Israel and residents of the Gaza Strip'. Several incendiary kites flown into Israel, under the auspices of the violent riots on the Gaza border fence, caused a fire in the kibbutz of Nahal Oz. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Since then, the "aerial terror offensive" against the Gaza border communities has continued with greater vigor, including some 300 incendiary kites flown into Israel's territory, 100 fires and more than 3,000 acres of wheat destroyed, causing millions of shekels worth of damage to the farmers of the area. Incendiary kites destroying wheat fields The Eshkol and Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Councils' communities and farmlands under attack include Kissufim and Be'eri forests, Kibbutzim Nir Oz, Kerem Shalom, Sufa, Kfar Aza, Sa'ad, Mefalsim, Erez, and Gevim. Incendiary kites cause fires across Gaza border communities X The Eshkol and Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Councils' communities and farmlands under attack include Kissufim and Be'eri forests, Kibbutzim Nir Oz, Kerem Shalom, Sufa, Kfar Aza, Sa'ad, Mefalsim, Erez, and Gevim. The modus operandi has been the same in all the incidents causing fires: During the Gaza border riots, terrorists attached Molotov cocktails and other incendiary objects to kites and flew them into Israel. Terror kites being assembled in Gaza (Photo: AFP) Hundreds of drones were developed and purchased within several days by the IDF to aid intercept the incendiary kites. Incendiary kite cause fire in Be'eri forest The Defense Ministry's Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) managed to provide within several days new operational solutions assembled on existing drones and on those which are being currently developed by the "Aeronautics" security industry, such as the "Pegasus 120." "Pegasus 120" can carry up to 75 Kg, and was tested for the purpose of carrying cargo supplies, ammunition and fuel to forces maneuvering deep inside the enemy's territory as part of the Northern Command's military exercise last year. Drone meant to intercept incendiary kites Nevertheless, it seems the incendiary kites phenomenon is growing stronger. Last Wednesday, several kites flown into Israel caused serious fires across the Gaza border communities. Drone intercepting incendiary kites X The Gaza border communities' farmers are dealing on a daily basis with putting out fires instead of taking care of their harvest. Recently, they decided to hold the harvest earlier than planned so the wheat wouldn't be destroyed by fires caused by the kites. "We are frustrated with the situation, it has become real terror. We are coping with this phenomenon on a daily basis," one of the farmers said. "When a fire breaks out, we don't wait for the firefighting forces and use our own equipment (to put out the fire) otherwise the wheat would be completely destroyed and entire fields would disappear," he explained. "The right thing is to collaborate with the firefighting forces, but without our efforts the damage would have been much more severe," he added. Kites terror causes entire wheat field to be destroyed (Photo: AFP) Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon visited the western Negev communities two weeks ago and said, "Those who fly incendiary kites must be treated with the same severity as those who launch rockets into Israel." Kahlon was accompanied by a property tax representative during his visit and promised that farmers would be compensated for the damages caused to their wheat fields. In addition, the region authorities' heads have sent messages demanding the government to compensate them for their damaged "down to last shekel." They have also asked for the matter to be among IDF's top priorities. The fight against the relatively new threat consists of both offensive and defensive actions by the IDF including aerial attack of Hamas's posts as retaliation to launching incendiary kites into Israel. The IDF's Spokesperson's Unit said after one of the retaliatory attacks, "The IDF will continue to fight against terror above and below the ground. "The IDF considers the Hamas terror organization as solely responsible for what is happening in Gaza and outside of it," the statement added.

News article:
Jerusalem – Teams of firefighters worked throughout the day on Sunday putting out large brush fires in fields belonging to communities in southern Israel, after they had been hit by flaming-kites launched from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Hundreds of acres of land was burnt near the communities of Nir Am, Or Haner and Be’eri after one such kite triggered a fire in the Sha’ar Hanegev Regional Council’s Simhoni Forest. The fire caused the southbound lane of Route 34 to be closed to traffic, and Israel Railways shut down the Ashkelon-Netivot route, stopping trains coming from the north at Ashkelon railway station and trains coming from the south at the Netivot station. The fires came a day after some 500 to 750 acres of a nature reserve next to Kibbutz Carmiya were destroyed by kites. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat to push forward a process that will subtract the amount of money the government must pay to Gaza-area communities for the damages caused by the fires, from the Palestinian tax money Israel transfers each month to the Palestinian Authority. According to Hebrew media, Israel Nature and Parks estimates that at least one-third of the reserve was destroyed on Saturday, despite four air tankers and 12 firefighting teams working to put out the flames. Gazans have been protesting along the border since March 30 as part of the Great March of Return, with demonstrators throwing stones and Molotov cocktails towards troops and launching incendiary kites and balloons towards Israeli territory. Late Saturday night, the Israel Air Force attacked 15 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip following mortar fire against southern Israeli communities on Saturday evening. The military said the strikes were a response to the earlier rocket fire as well as “terror incidents led and made possible by the Hamas terror organization over the course of the weekend,” which included the throwing of grenades, improvised explosive devices, attempts to infiltrate into Israel by damaging the security fence and the burning of Israeli fields by incendiary kites. The mortar fire was the first violation of a fragile cease-fire and two days of relative quiet in southern Israel after the most significant escalation between the IDF and the terrorist groups in the coastal enclave in four years. The first round of sirens was activated Saturday in several nearby communities in the Eshkol Regional Council at around 8 p.m., with one mortar falling in open territory and the other intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. Additional sirens sounded several times in the same communities, as well as in communities within the Sha’ar Hanegev and Hof Asheklon regions and in the city of Sderot, following additional rocket fire from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. According to the military, the IAF bombed targets across the entire Gaza Strip in three Hamas compounds, including two weapon-production and storage sites, as well as targets belonging to Hamas’s naval force. If Hamas “chooses to follow a path of terrorism and not solve the difficulties of the people of Gaza, it will continue to pay a heavy price that will only become steeper as much as needed,” read the statement released by the IDF. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that residential homes were damaged when Israeli jets targeted one site in the al-Waha area northwest of Gaza City with three missiles. The Hamas-affiliated Shehab news agency reported that Israeli jets struck targets in Gaza City’s Shejaia neighborhood as well as in the Nuseirat refugee camp near Deir al-Bireh. Another target was struck outside the southern Gazan city of Rafah. Earlier in the evening, Israeli jets bombed locations in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood of Gaza City as well as targets in Khan Yunis and Rafah. Meanwhile, the IDF announced Sunday morning that a large scale exercise across the southern part of the country would begin despite the heightened tensions in the area. Residents of southern Israel should expect to see an increased presence of troops as well as military equipment and aircraft in the skies over southern Israel. The drill, which will last throughout Wednesday, was planned in advance “to preserve the fitness and preparedness of the troops,” the military said. The Israel Air Force will also be holding a separate drill throughout the country that is set to last until Thursday.

Police sappers were called to neutralize a combustible object that was attached to an incendiary kite flown from Gaza. The kite was found by children in the Sdot Negev Regional Council on Monday. The combustible object was neutralized by a police robot. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The police said the combustible object was likely meant to cause casualties and called on the citizens of the south to exercise caution and to stay away from suspicious objects including kites. Police robot neutralizes combustible object attached to an incendiary kite "The public has to show responsibility and immediately call for the police sappers, without risking its own safty," the police reiterated following the aforementioned incident. The police instructed the public to immediately evacuate from the scene and call the police emergency line in case that a suspicious object is found. The police stressed that the neutralization of suspicious objects has to be executed by the police sappers only. Incendiary kites launched from Gaza instigated fires in 11 different locations near Kibbutzim Be'eri and Kissufim in the Eshkol Regional Council. Jewish National Fund's (JNF) firefighting crews and the area's security elements attempted to gain control of the fire. The Kite terror has caused over the two past months an extensive environmental damage across Israel's communities of the south, culminating last Friday with 45 fires sparked across the Gaza border communities. All the fires were caused due to incendiary kites and Molotov cocktails attached to balloons flown from Gaza. Palestinians launch incendiary kites into Israel (Photo: AFP) The southern communities' residents have been instructed to treat the incendiary kites as suspicious objects over the past few days. "The kites flown from Gaza are causing extensive damage to the area (of the south). When (an incendiary) kite or any other unidentified object are detected, they have to be treated as suspicious objects," according to the instruction given to the Gaza border communities' residents. "Any resident that happens to come across (an incendiary) kite is requested to immediacy distance himself and others from it, and notify the security elements as soon as possible."

News article:
Kibbutz Nir Am – After years of rocket attacks and militant infiltrations from Gaza, residents of southern Israel are now coping with a new kind of threat: incendiary kites and balloons that have damaged farmlands and nature reserves. The crude devices launched by Palestinians inside the blockaded territory have not been lethal. But they have sparked fires that have damaged agriculture, killed wildlife and whipped up considerable indignation. “It’s caused significant economic damage but more than that it is emotional,” said Itzik Ebbo, 78, a member of Kibbutz Nir Am, a collective farming community. “These are crops we poured our hearts into. These are fields we hiked with our children and grandchildren.” Sullen locals have become a fixture on Israeli TV, guiding reporters around smoldering fields and lamenting the loss of life among snakes, turtles and the like. The phenomenon is the latest twist in nearly three months of intermittent Palestinian border protests. To many Israelis the “kite terrorism” is yet more evidence of implacable — and creative — Palestinian hostility. But viewed another way it is a desperate ploy on behalf of the 2 million Palestinians largely penned into the impoverished seaside strip. A decade-old blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt to weaken Gaza’s ruling Hamas militant group has ravaged the local economy and caused widespread despair. Israeli forces have killed more than 120 Palestinians and wounded over 3,800 since the protests began on March 30. Israel says it’s the only way to prevent mass breaches of the border that would include militants. But the vast majority of the Palestinian casualties have been unarmed, drawing heavy international criticism of Israel’s open-fire orders. Israel blames Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers for the bloodshed. Drifting aimlessly over the border, the kites have caused more than 450 fires over the past month, torching some 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares) of land and causing some $2 million in damages. Israel says it plans to deduct from tax funds it collects for the Palestinians to compensate farmers, and the military has been stepping up its measures in recent days by firing warning shots at launchers. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman vowed Monday that “kite terrorism cannot continue.” But Israel’s decision-makers must also consider the risk of sparking all-out war, as happened four years ago. Israel accuses Hamas, a militant group that seeks its destruction, of using the protesters as cover in an effort to engineer violent infiltrations. The current round of violence has yet to claim any serious Israeli casualties. Israel’s Iron Dome defense system has neutralized much of the rocket fire. A nearly-completed underground barrier and new technological means have thwarted or destroyed much of the Hamas tunnel network. But Israel has struggled with the low-tech kites and balloons drifting over the border. Gazans began flying kites with burning rags or cotton-stuffed cans attached to them several weeks ago and have since added helium-filled balloons with incendiary material attached. Aided by the hot and windy conditions, the devices have dropped in dry brush, destroying wheat and sunflower fields and sending animals scurrying away. Palestinian activists argue such economic damage is not unlike that caused to them by the blockade. The launchers seem to take pride in their project. One of the leaders, an 18-year-old who asked to withhold his name for fear of Israel targeting him, said it started with bored teens flying Palestinian flags. “We wanted to provoke the Israelis more, so we attached a burning rag to the kite. Thanks to God’s will, the thread was cut and the kite fell on the other side and started a fire. This is how we got the idea,” he said, adding that a kite only cost $1 to make and a balloon just 50 cents. “Unless there are 15 to 20 fires, we don’t consider this a good day,” he added. The military says drones intercept some 90 percent of the devices and it has also fired shots near kite launchers, targeting what it says are vehicles and Hamas posts used to launch the kites. “These are not toys. These are dangerous weapons that are used in order to terrorize Israeli civilians,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman. Conricus would not comment on calls by hard-line government ministers to kill kite launchers on the spot, as Israel does to those firing rockets. Meanwhile the fires rage daily. Terrain along the border is pockmarked with black spots of scorched hillsides and charred palm trees. In Nir Am, which abuts Gaza’s northeast border, the fires have inched dangerously close to adjacent train tracks and a gas station. Residents and visiting firefighting crews are on standby to deploy at a moment’s notice. “Balloons and kites should be something fun, not something to avoid,” said Betty Gavri, 77. In an effort to shift the narrative, kibbutz residents and their children recently floated colorful balloons and kites toward Gaza in what they said was a message of peace. They’ve also begun a replanting drive to replace the damaged fields. But Gavri is skeptical much will improve until larger changes in the region take place and the lives of Palestinians in Gaza improve as well. “I’m convinced that until they have something to lose there won’t be a big change on our doorstep,” she said. Kobi Sofer, a ranger for Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority, said vegetation could rebound relatively quickly but it will likely take many years, if at all, for the entire ecosystem of plants, predators and prey to recover. Sofer says he has seen scorched porcupines, snakes, turtles, lizards and other rodents and insects, not to mention their feeding grounds. Touring the area, the only animals in sight were birds pecking at charred carcasses. “All the years of rocket fire and military maneuvering never left anything like this,” said Sofer, a 17-year veteran ranger, as he gestured toward a scorched hilltop overlooking Gaza. “It’s a helpless feeling.”

Fresh fires broke out Sunday in Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip as a result of flaming airborne devices launched from the Palestinian enclave. Firefighters extinguished the fire near Kibbutz Kissufim and were working to put out a pair of blazes near the farming communities of Be’eri and Nir Am. Earlier in the day, a suspicious balloon landed in the yard of a home in the southern city of Sderot, police said. Police said officers arrived at the house and closed off the area following a report from a Sderot resident who saw the balloon land. Police sappers were called to the scene to inspect the suspicious object.

Palestinian media reported that Israeli military aircraft fired warning shots on Saturday near a group of Palestinians in Gaza launching incendiary devices toward Israel. There were no reported injuries as a result of the warning shots east of Gaza City. Advertisement Since March 30, Palestinians in Gaza have launched hundreds of kites and helium balloons bearing flammable materials, and occasionally explosives, sparking near-daily fires that have burned thousands of acres of land in southern Israel. The Israeli military has carried out multiple warning strikes in recent weeks at groups of Gazans preparing to launch incendiary devices toward Israel. The army has said repeatedly that it will act to prevent the launch of the airborne incendiary devices and explosives. Israeli leaders on Wednesday evening warned the Hamas terrorist group, which rules Gaza, and other terror groups in the Strip, that the military was prepared to take more intense offensive action as well. “The intensity will increase as necessary,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a graduation ceremony for new IDF officers. “We are prepared for every scenario, and it’s best that our enemies understand this right now.” “The steel fist of the IDF will strike hard at anyone who attempts to harm us,” he added. Israeli leaders were split on how to respond to those responsible for the airborne arson attacks, with some calling for the IDF to shoot the kite flyers and balloon launchers on sight, while others argued that this was a step too far.
