News article:
Israeli police said Sunday they had arrested 30 demonstrators after thousands rallied in Jerusalem demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, chanting "Crime Minister" and "You're fired." The demonstrators, some playing musical instruments, gathered in front of the premier's official residence on Saturday night. Local media estimated the crowd at around 10,000. A police statement released early Sunday morning said there were outbreaks of violence during the rally and that officers were hurt. "During the protests, three policemen were injured by protesters," police said. Three of those arrested would appear in court on Sunday, the statement added. Protests demanding that Netanyahu resign over several corruption indictments and his handling of the coronavirus crisis have been mounting in recent weeks, and the premier has been scathing in his counterattack. Earlier this month, Netanyahu accused Channel 12 and another private TV station, Channel 13, of "delivering propaganda for the anarchist left-wing demonstrations" through extensive coverage of the rallies. Israel won praise for its initial response to the coronavirus pandemic, but the government has come under criticism amid a resurgence in cases after restrictions were lifted starting in late April. Netanyahu has acknowledged that the economy was reopened too quickly.

News article:
Protesters and police were gearing up for another night of demonstrations outside the Jerusalem residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday evening, a week after scuffles broke out at last week’s protest, and some 30 people were arrested amid allegations of incitement and police violence. According to Yishai Hadas, a leader of Crime Minister, one of the main groups leading the weekly mass demonstrations against Netanyahu, the biggest fear going into the protest Saturday is that the violence will escalate and someone will get seriously injured. “We have dozens, maybe hundreds of people who have been lightly injured and… a few cases where it was a little more serious; but up until now, there has not been irreversible harm [done] to anyone,” Hadas told The Times of Israel. He hoped there would not be an “escalation in police violence” on Saturday which would change this situation. Hadas was one of three protest representatives at the Knesset’s Internal Affairs and Environmental Protection Committee hearing on Monday on police violence. The hearing was Hadas’ idea, and featured testimony by both protesters and Jerusalem police chief Doron Yedid. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The hearing was called after public outcry following the events of last Saturday, especially the conduct of Chief Superintendent Niso Guetta. In one widely circulated video, Guetta was seen shoving and hitting one protester and then pushing people to the side as he chased down another demonstrator, whom he hit in the face before pushing him to the ground. Guetta and other officers then dragged the person along the pavement before hauling him off. Other photographs showed him kneeling on a supine protester and pushing his head to the ground with his elbow. Advertisement Guetta claims he was assaulted by the demonstrators and that he did not use excessive force. However, despite an ongoing investigation by the Justice Ministry’s Police Internal Investigations Department, Yedid told lawmakers that Guetta went back to work following a 24-hour suspension, and that he would be present at the Saturday protest. A number of the groups behind the protests said the decision to let Guetta return amid an ongoing investigation was unacceptable. On Tuesday, the Crime Minister group and the Black Flags movement petitioned the High Court of Justice asking that Guetta not be allowed to return to the protests until the investigation into the case was completed by the Justice Ministry’s Police Internal Investigations Department. Amir Haskel, the leader of the Ein Matzav (No Way) group, was present at the Knesset hearing and said he was frustrated by the decision. Haskel added that he was concerned about the effect Guetta’s presence could have on the protests. “Why do you need to insist on bringing back Guetta? This is what will provoke people [on Saturday]. It’s clear to you what will happen when he comes here and people see him. Why do that? It is not smart,” he told The Times Of Israel Advertisement Haskel said he believed the decision stemmed from the police’s desire to publicly display backing for subordinates, but that in his opinion, this “automatic” support was a mistake. On Friday, when asked about why Guetta was being brought back to the protests, police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld insisted that Guetta returning to duty was according to protocol and that his case “was out of their hands.” No trust Saturday’s protest comes at a time when trust between police and the protesters seems to be at an all-time low. Last Thursday, police raised protesters’ ire when a protest encampment in front of the Prime Minister’s residence was forcibly cleared in preparation for a rally of Netanyahu’s supporters, which ultimately attracted just a few hundred demonstrators. According to Haskel, despite promises, the equipment that was taken by the police has still not been returned. During Monday’s Knesset committee discussion, a suggestion was made that protesters and police sit at a round table and reach an understanding. But Haskel insisted that in order to sit at a round table “there needs to be a minimum amount of trust between the sides.” Crime Minister, which is known for being less willing to work with the police than Haskel’s Ein Matzav, announced this week that it would no longer communicate with the police. Hadas said that his main takeaway from the Knesset committee was that “the Jerusalem police has turned into Netanyahu’s last line of defense.” Several signs decrying the police as “political” and “bad” could be seen interspersed among protesters’ signs during Friday afternoon’s protest in Jerusalem. According to organizers, some 4,000 people attended that demonstration, a large number compared to the typical weekly protest on that day. Advertisement On Wednesday, Deputy State Prosecutor Nurit Litman signed a new policy directive aimed at reducing the number of protesters brought before the courts. The directive calls on police to scale back the number of protesters charged with minor offenses such as participation in illegal gatherings, the Haaretz daily reported. Such a charge would be reserved for more serious incidents, such as using violence while protesting. There are early signs that protesters may be looking to capitalize on this policy directive. One of the protest leaders, Or-ly Barlev, tweeted a message to her followers Saturday afternoon saying that there were plans circulating to sit quietly without making noise after 11:00 p.m, when police usually begin dispersing the protests. The rationale, it seems, is that if protesters merely sit without making noise, the police will have no reason to disperse them. Noise Regulations One of the reasons for the violence at last Saturday’s protests was likely a decision by police to begin enforcing noise regulations, and thus their decision to start clearing the protest earlier than in the past. This new policy came following a Supreme Court decision, after complaints were filed by local neighborhood residents about the protests. Attorney Gonen Ben-Yitzhak, another leader of the Crime Minister group, tweeted a message to his followers ahead of Saturday’s protest calling on them to abide by the regulations to stop making excessive noise with air horns and other equipment from 9:30 p.m. and to stop using speakers at 11:00 p.m. “It is an annoying rule, but that is the ruling and we must respect it,” he wrote. He also reminded protesters that the police are not the target and urged protesters not to “curse them or scream at them.” However, Hadas and Haskel explained that they had limited control over Saturday’s crowds, which have surpassed 15,000 participants in recent weeks. “This protest is completely decentralized,” said Hadas. “This protest is conducted with no management in the field, we do not have a speaker system, we do not have means of control. Advertisement “There are many organizations of people who bring [out] their rage spontaneously and in the way they see fit, and the messages are diverse,” Hadas added. Police have said that any violence on their part was a response to protesters’ actions. Although Times of Israel reporters have not witnessed physical violence by demonstrators at recent protests, there have been curses and angry calls toward the police. On Friday, acting police commissioner Motti Cohen released a statement saying that he was “aware of the conversation” surrounding the Israeli police. “To some of it we must listen deeply, as legitimate criticism; but unfortunately there is also a conversation that is incendiary and destructive, that sometimes even verges on incitement, which must be stopped immediately,” Cohen said. Between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem On Saturday, protesters plan to hold a march from the capital’s Chords Bridge to the Prime Minister’s residence, where they will link up with the rest of the protesters, despite the fact they have not received a permit from the police to move through the city. Last week, despite the ban on marches, an estimated 1,500 walked through the city, and although police attempts to stop the procession led to scuffles and to seven arrests, protesters were eventually allowed to proceed to the area near the Prime Minister’s Residence. Demonstrators are also expected to stand at over 300 bridges across the country as part of the weekly Black Flag protest. During Friday’s protest, Haskel took to the stage and told the crowd about the policing he saw at a protest a day earlier in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square. “I saw with my own eyes a different [kind of] police. A police that does not trap the protesters in barricades, a police that allows the protesters to march without receiving permission to march [in advance], a police that knows how to solve problems, a police that does not use water cannons, a police that speaks about democracy and a police that protects democracy,” Haskel said. However, police spokesperson Rosenfeld insisted that the differences were simply due to the forces in the two cities dealing with different situations on the ground. “There is no differentiation whatsoever between police in Jerusalem and police in Tel Aviv. The orders are the same orders. The response of the police is to what takes place on the scene, and each scene is different,” Rosenfeld said.

News article:
Joe Biden and his national security adviser Tony Blinken are blocking efforts by grassroots Democrats eager to improve the Democratic platform on Palestinian rights. Jonathan Ernst Reuters On 17 July, the AP finally called New York’s 16th congressional district primary in favor of Jamaal Bowman over long-time incumbent and staunch Israel supporter Eliot Engel. Bowman is overwhelmingly expected to win the general election in November. I’m a Black man who was raised by a single mother in a housing project. That story doesn’t usually end in Congress. But today, that 11-year old boy who was beaten by police is about to be your next Representative. pic.twitter.com/YIkfSecbXD — Jamaal Bowman (@JamaalBowmanNY) July 17, 2020 His victory has put anti-Palestinian racists such as Newsweek op-ed editor Josh Hammer on notice. One of the last remaining pro-Israel Democrats is put out to political pasture. https://t.co/LihiIX5beW — Josh Hammer (@josh_hammer) July 17, 2020 He added: “Just as the police force is a violent intimidating force in so many Black communities, I can connect to what it feels like for Palestinians to feel the presence of the military in their daily lives in the West Bank.” As a Black man in America, I know what it’s like to feel occupied in my own community. https://t.co/ppUfoZCmbF — Jamaal Bowman (@JamaalBowmanNY) July 17, 2020 DNC’s anti-Palestinian racism The Democratic National Committee’s platform drafting committee, however, does not share Bowman’s courage. Its first platform draft didn’t even note the Israeli occupation. The draft seen by The Electronic Intifada on Tuesday still omits that word. (The entire platform can be seen here or below, including the final three paragraphs where Israeli and Palestinian concerns are raised.) There’s a generational and racial chasm between Bowman, an African American previously subjected to police brutality, and presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, some 30 years his senior. By comparison, Biden was instrumental in writing the 1994 crime law and so delighted in its becoming law that he boasted Democrats were now for “60 new death penalties,” “70 enhanced penalties,” “100,000 cops” and “125,000 new state prison cells.” Biden is a career politician who has been in politics for decades and has provided military aid and excuses for Israel for nearly as long. He is also a white man with frequent words of praise for his experiences working with white segregationist leaders. But today Biden is leading a Democratic Party that is rapidly changing around him. He seems unwilling to keep up when it comes to holding Israel accountable for denying Palestinians their freedom and rights. Zogby worked on the 2016 platform and was a member of the executive committee of the DNC from 2001-2017. The draft supports a two-state solution and opposes Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank. Yet it refuses to take any concrete action against annexation by failing to touch the $3.8 billion in annual US military aid to Israel. “Our commitment to Israel’s security, its qualitative military edge, its right to defend itself and the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding is ironclad,” the draft document states. It rejects the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian freedom and equal rights save as a free speech right. In the words of the draft: “We oppose any effort to unfairly single out and delegitimize Israel, including at the United Nations or through the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement, while protecting the Constitutional right of our citizens to free speech.” The free speech protection is an improvement over the 2016 platform. Much like 2016, when Zogby and public intellectual Cornel West raised profound concerns about Israeli actions on behalf of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, this time it fell to Sanders’ senior adviser Josh Orton to voice objections. Biden and his platform accomplices are, for the most part, trying to drag the party backwards – or at least prevent a progressive plank from being passed. “The Israeli right wing and, unfortunately, their US supporters, have long sought to erase the occupation,” Orton noted. “We shouldn’t help them. And a growing and just movement within our party believes that US aid should not be used to facilitate annexation and violate Palestinian rights.” He added, “At a time when hundreds of thousands of Americans have been marching in our streets for equality and civil rights, it is absolutely necessary for the Democratic Party to speak truthfully to the Palestinians’ efforts to secure those same rights.” Last week over 200 Democratic delegates pushed back with a letter voicing their concerns. They “fully support efforts to withhold $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel as it unilaterally annexes the Israeli-occupied Jordan Valley.” That annexation has not yet occurred, but has been repeatedly threatened. Notably, they also urged support for the efforts of Congresswomen Pramila Jayapal, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who “are calling on the US government to place conditions and limitations on the continuation of military aid to Israel for settling and stealing the Jordan Valley from the Palestinians.” That theft is routine – as it is in Jerusalem – and is sure to continue whether or not annexation occurs. California Democratic National Convention delegate Sam Hindi, who helped draft the letter, said, “We felt that some in the Democratic Party leadership have been out of step with Democatic voters on this issue for some time. With potential annexation looming, it is past time for the Party to reaffirm the position of Democratic voters and support human rights and self-determination for Palestinians.” Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian American human rights attorney and a national delegate to the Democratic National Convention, told The Electronic Intifada that “the language reflects an intent to continue uncritical support of Israel” as it refuses “to hold Israel accountable for its rampant human rights violations and abuses.” She noted it also opposes the “efforts of others to hold Israel accountable.” Changing views Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) has presented its own recent polling which flies in the face of Democratic trendlines and Hindi’s view by suggesting that Democrats overwhelmingly support a strong pro-Israel platform. In fact, a staggering 81 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents say if a two-state solution is not an option, “I favor Israel’s democracy more than its Jewishness. I support a single democratic state in which Arabs and Jews are equal even if that means Israel would no longer be a politically Jewish state.” Shibley Telhami, Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development and Director of the Critical Issues Poll at the University of Maryland, also noted that in an October poll 66 percent of Democrats “back sanctions or stronger measures against Israeli settlements,” while in a March poll 81 percent of Democrats agreed it’s “acceptable” or even the “duty” of members of Congress to “question the U.S.-Israeli relationship.” But Biden’s Democratic Party is stuck in antiquated views of the rights of Palestinians. Tony Blinken, Biden’s foreign policy adviser, in May told a DMFI online audience that Biden “would not tie military assistance to Israel to any political decisions that it makes, period, full stop.” While over 500 Palestinian children, including four boys playing on a beach six years ago this month, were being killed during Israel’s 2014 military onslaught on Gaza, Blinken viewed the matter through the prism of Israeli military concerns – and continues to do so. Exactly. Israel's ambassador asked for emergency replenishment late on a Thursday night. Friday morning i conveyed the request to Pres. Obama and VP Biden. Three word response: get it done. By Tuesday, with VP making key calls, we had $250 million from Congress. https://t.co/w0AXx8RgPY — Antony Blinken (@ABlinken) July 20, 2020 6 years ago today, Israel's military killed 4 young Palestinian boys on a beach in Gaza. In 2018, I reviewed a secret Israeli military police report which showed that Israeli drone operators admitted responsibity for killing the boys, all aged 10 or 11, but none were ever charged https://t.co/Oj6G9ANXo0 — Robert Mackey (@RobertMackey) July 16, 2020 Biden is willing to concede that annexation is a problem, but he’s unwilling to take meaningful measures against it. Likewise, he’s willing to concede that American activists have a free speech right to pursue BDS, but he’s unprepared to recognize that Israel’s actions to destroy the two-state solution require moving on to a campaign for equal rights for all between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea. Biden and Blinken are living in the past and lack the courage to take meaningful actions in the present. If victorious against the vicious but inept Donald Trump in the midst of a raging pandemic that has overwhelmed the president and his incompetent subordinates in the White House, Democrats should anticipate that Biden will reject unilateral Israeli actions in the West Bank (minus occupied East Jerusalem). But he can be expected to back the Israeli military vigorously in its subjugation of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. That means more pain and death for Palestinians subjected to the might of the US-funded Israeli military. Trump’s actions on Jerusalem will not be reversed. Finally, Biden will fight the BDS movement while demanding that Palestinians display an inexhaustible reserve of patience in the face of oppression, inequality and occupation. Sadly, confronting racism for the ascendent part of Biden’s Democratic Party is less a matter of justice and more a response to the power of constituents as a voting bloc. Biden is changing now on racial equity issues because it’s the surest route to the White House, not because he has a strong history on such matters. This does, however, suggest that grassroots Democrats active on Palestine should fight him at every turn and pressure him to be responsive. He’s not going to do the right thing simply on merit. He might if grassroots realities force his hand. And as Zeina Ashrawi Hutchison, a human rights activist and a national delegate to the Democratic National Convention, stressed to The Electronic Intifada, “The Biden campaign still has time before the convention and the November elections to show that they value Palestinian human rights substantively. The platform should include accountability for Israel and equality for both peoples. I look forward to seeing improvements reflected in the DNC platform and in Biden’s foreign policy.” Hutchison is right to hope and push for change. A political party that claims to be seized with racial justice issues can hardly be taken seriously if it refuses even to name an occupation. The Democrats assert they oppose annexation of Palestinian territory, but what’s the use if they won’t go on record threatening to cut the military funding to the power already illegally settling the Jordan Valley and elsewhere? https://electronicintifada.net/sites/default/files/2020-07/2020_07_21_draft_democratic_party_platform.pdf

That means more pain and death for Palestinians subjected to the might of the US-funded Israeli military. Trump’s actions on Jerusalem will not be reversed. Finally, Biden will fight the BDS movement while demanding that Palestinians display an inexhaustible reserve of patience in the face of oppression, inequality and occupation. Sadly, confronting racism for the ascendent part of Biden’s Democratic Party is less a matter of justice and more a response to the power of constituents as a voting bloc. Biden is changing now on racial equity issues because it’s the surest route to the White House, not because he has a strong history on such matters. This does, however, suggest that grassroots Democrats active on Palestine should fight him at every turn and pressure him to be responsive. He’s not going to do the right thing simply on merit. He might if grassroots realities force his hand. And as Zeina Ashrawi Hutchison, a human rights activist and a national delegate to the Democratic National Convention, stressed to The Electronic Intifada, “The Biden campaign still has time before the convention and the November elections to show that they value Palestinian human rights substantively. The platform should include accountability for Israel and equality for both peoples. I look forward to seeing improvements reflected in the DNC platform and in Biden’s foreign policy.” Hutchison is right to hope and push for change. A political party that claims to be seized with racial justice issues can hardly be taken seriously if it refuses even to name an occupation. The Democrats assert they oppose annexation of Palestinian territory, but what’s the use if they won’t go on record threatening to cut the military funding to the power already illegally settling the Jordan Valley and elsewhere? https://electronicintifada.net/sites/default/files/2020-07/2020_07_21_draft_democratic_party_platform.pdf

News article:
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized Democrats leaving marijuana legalization out of the party’s platform as “embarrassing.” The New York Democrat said this week that the Democratic Party is behind the times when it comes to legalizing the drug after the Democratic National Committee delegates voted 105-60 on Monday against its inclusion in the platform. “It’s embarrassing. It’s embarrassing that this is not on the Democratic platform,” Ocasio-Cortez told the News Station, a cannabis industry news website. “The Democratic platform on this issue is more conservative than it was in 2016.” The DNC’s platform does not advocate for legalization but rather decriminalization of the substance, which is already legal for medical use in 33 states and for recreational use in 11 states. Legalization is also supported by some two-thirds of people in the United States. “In this issue, it’s not even about being futuristic or next generation,” she continued. “This is an idea whose time has come.” Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who has been outspoken on marijuana legalization, also commented on the DNC vote. “I’m trying to get my party to move forward. I don’t know why the Democrats are moving backwards,” Gaetz said.

Sen. Tom Cotton warned that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will be beholden to the most radical wing of his party if elected. “Well, Bernie Sanders just acknowledged the reality. I mean, Joe Biden’s campaign really is a Trojan horse for the far Left, the Democratic Party," Cotton said Monday on Fox News. Cotton, a Republican and a supporter of President Trump, rattled off a list of political platforms and policies proposed by liberal Democrats that Biden will be forced to implement. "Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote his criminal justice platform, which is going to let violent felons out of prison, which is going to eliminate the use of bail so violent felons are going to get out ... of jail while they are pending their trial for violent crimes," Cotton said. "But it’s not just that. I mean, look at what Joe Biden himself said on the campaign trail — that Beto O’Rourke is going to run gun control policy, which is going to be gun confiscation. They’re going to give amnesty to millions and millions of illegal immigrants, so they can take your jobs and also get their healthcare funded by you. At the same time, they are going to take away your health insurance on the job." The senator from Arkansas was reacting to comments made by Sanders last month advocating for Biden and celebrating that he would be the "most progressive president since FDR." Cotton said Sanders's comments are evidence of a growing leftward lurch within the Democratic Party that could yield disastrous outcomes for the country if embraced by voters. "They are also going the take radical steps, like turning Washington, D.C., into a state or packing the Supreme Court, to rubber-stamp their left-wing agenda," Cotton said.

News article:
Joe Biden may have won the Democratic presidential nomination, but the Bernie Sanders wing of the party will prevail in the White House. That’s the message President Trump’s reelection campaign is honing in on in the homestretch. It is the theme of two ads the Trump campaign launched in early-voting states on Monday. The first ad “exposes Joe Biden as a tool of the radical left for his pledges to raise taxes by trillions of dollars, grant amnesty for 11 million illegal aliens, and cut police funding,” according to the Trump campaign. The second “features a woman silently displaying cue cards that describe her fear that Biden is too weak to stand up to the extremists in control of his agenda: higher taxes, amnesty for illegal aliens, and trade deals that hurt Americans.” “Joe Biden has embraced the policies of the radical Left,” said the narrator in one of the 30-second spots, as the presumptive Democratic nominee appears surrounded by Sanders and “Squad” members Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Trillions in new taxes, crushing middle-class families.” “The radical Left has taken over Joe Biden and the Democratic Party,” concludes the ad. “Don’t let them take over America.” It’s a strategy Trump has flirted with for months, dating back to the competitive phase of the Democratic primaries. Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Trump said voters would have to ask whether Sanders was a “communist” but should also have questions about Biden. “With Joe, he’s sort of down the middle,” he said. “You know, the difference is Joe is not going to be running the government, he’s just going to be sitting in a home someplace, and people are going to be running it for him, and they will be radical-left socialists.” In a Monday appearance on Fox and Friends, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien ditched references to “Sleepy Joe” and “Beijing Biden” in favor of describing the former vice president as an “empty vessel of the radical Left.” He said, “I think we need to judge Joe Biden by the people he’s surrounding himself with.” Biden is “a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” said Republican strategist Bryan Lanza, a former Trump 2016 campaign official. “He’s no longer working-class Joe, and people [in battleground states] are going to be shocked. It’s our job to fill in that shock with facts.” A little over 90 days out from Election Day, the Trump campaign has struggled to define Biden. Even the president, who has excelled at detecting opponents' weaknesses and branding them accordingly, has found it difficult to break through news cycles dominated by the coronavirus. The question remains whether the current strategy of depicting Biden as a tool of the Left, if not quite a convicted radical himself, after he defeated more liberal candidates in the primaries relying on an argument too nuanced to work in the heat of the presidential race. “I feel that's the best strategy right now because the one fear that most Republicans that would ever consider voting for Biden is the lean to the Left,” said Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour. “With more candidates like Bernie Sanders coming forward speaking out for Biden, it will scare some on-the-fence voters away. Biden was the candidate that some voters in the middle saw as a safe bet and would be a reasonable candidate in areas like taxes and the marketplace. But with him giving his center away and leaning more left, it will potentially hurt him with those voters, which is why it's smart for the Trump campaign to focus on that.” This line of attack also amplifies other Trump criticisms of his Democratic challenger, including whether Biden, at age 78 by Inauguration Day, has the stamina to check the most liberal wing of his party once in office — and whether it would only delay such a takeover by four years if so. The hope is also to drive up Biden’s negatives, as succeeded with Hillary Clinton four years ago. “Joe Biden is held hostage by the activist base of the Democratic Party,” said Lanza. “It is not Barack Obama’s Democratic Party, it is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s.” Biden has steadily moved to the left on a host of issues, from environmental policy to abortion to ending the filibuster if Democrats reclaim the Senate. He remains opposed to "Medicare for all," but both he and Sanders are promising "the most progressive" administration in history. “Many may be angry about Trump's personality, but are they willing to pay higher taxes and watch a downturn, as predicted with a left-leaning presidency, in the marketplace? I think not,” Nikpour said. “So it's a good strategy, and it's also a great way to raise money. Fear works in votes and fundraising!” “If Joe Biden is too scared to stand up to antifa, how will he take that 3 a.m. call?” asked Lanza. “You might as well call AOC directly because that's who he's going to go check with.”

WASHINGTON — The US election plunges deeper into unprecedented territory as challenger Joe Biden announces he will accept his nomination virtually and US President Donald Trump suggests breaking tradition by holding his own ceremony at the White House. Citing coronavirus health risks, the Biden campaign says he will make his speech — the high point of a candidate’s race — from his Delaware home where he has spent most of the last months. He had planned to attend the August 17-20 Democratic convention in Milwaukee, which was already heavily scaled-down from the massive event typical before US elections. But the party says the risk was still too high, and switched to a fully virtual affair. “From the very beginning of this pandemic, we put the health and safety of the American people first,” says Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez. Trump, whose reelection bid is struggling with a badly wounded economy and surging COVID-19 pandemic, signals he may also accept his nomination from home — in his case, the White House. “I love the building. I’m there right now. I spend a lot of time here,” he tells Fox News. Trump’s August 27 acceptance speech was originally planned for North Carolina, but that was scrapped due to the coronavirus, as was the back-up location, leaving the Republican scrambling for alternatives. However, presidents are required to separate their campaigning from taxpayer-funded governing. If he goes ahead, Trump would be breaking at the very least with presidential decorum by turning the South Lawn of the iconic building into his personal campaign stage. Trump defends the idea as “by far the least expensive” and says that logistically it would require far less movement of staff and guests. — AFP

President Donald Trump yesterday called Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a 'real beauty' who 'knows nothing about the economy'. The president's comments came during a speech in the battleground state of Ohio, where he accused Democrat leaders of 'inflicting a socialist takeover of the US economy known as the horrendous Green New Deal'. The Green New Deal is a proposed plan to tackle climate change, which was initially tabled by Ocasio-Cortez - who minored in economics at college - and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. Trump said in his speech yesterday: '[The Green New Deal] was conceived by a young woman AOC — AOC plus three, I say — AOC, that's a real beauty, isn't it?' 'She knows as much about the environment — do we have any young children here? — as that young child over there. I think he knows more. And she certainly knows nothing about the economy,' he added. President Donald Trump yesterday called Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a 'real beauty' who 'knows nothing about the economy'. Trump suggested that the proposal, which aims to wean the US off of fossil fuels, could result in the American economy regressing, similarly to Venezuela. 'Venezuela was a very wealthy country 20 years ago — one of the wealthiest per capita, one of the wealthiest, tremendous oil reserves, everything. Now they don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have medicine. They don't have anything. Same thing could happen,' Trump said. Trump went on to criticize the Democrat's stance on fracking, the process of drilling into the earth to release gases to use as energy. 'They want to ban fracking, which will demolish your state. It will demolish Ohio oil and gas jobs. They want to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord, where you'll pay billions and billions of dollars for the privilege of getting ripped off by other countries,' he said. In this July 23, 2020, file image from video, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks on the House floor on Capitol Hill in Washington Trump lashed out at Ocasio-Cortez during a campaign stop in Texas last week, again criticizing the Green New Deal. In his remarks, made with oil rigs and a giant American flag in the background, Trump warned Texans that Democrats in power would bring Ocasio-Cortez's 'disastrous' Green New Deal, a return to the Paris Climate Accord, and the end of fracking. 'The radical left is fighting to abolish American energy,' he warned. 'If these far left politicians ever get into power they will abolish not only your industry but the economy,' he said.

They want to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord, where you'll pay billions and billions of dollars for the privilege of getting ripped off by other countries,' he said.

News article:
Heading into the 2020 presidential campaign, centrist Democrats as well as those who are supporters of Israel had good reason to be worried about the future of their party. After Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016, Bernie Sanders’s wing of the party was still nursing a grudge about being supposedly robbed of the presidential nomination by the establishment. They were confident that the rise of a new generation of radical politicians marked a changing of the guard, and that they were poised to take over. That seemed likely earlier this year when the campaign of the leading mainstream centrist running for president—former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden—seemed dead in the water after several months of lackluster performances on the campaign trail and in debates, as well as disastrous showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. At that point in the process, Sanders seemed likely to win the contest, a state of affairs that sent pro-Israel Democrats and others who believed nominating the Socialist senator from Vermont was a recipe for disaster into panic mode. Faced with the daunting prospect of presenting President Donald Trump with a radical opponent in November, Democrats fell in line behind Biden. With the help of African-American voters, Biden decisively won in South Carolina. And with the exception of hardcore liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who stayed in the race, all of the other major Democratic contenders dropped out and endorsed Biden. At that point, it was effectively over. In the blink of an eye, a party that seemed about to fall into the hands of radical progressives was back safely in the pocket of its establishment. Fast-forward to August, and the same centrist pro-Israel Democrats who fished their wish with Biden worried that the former veep would appease their intra-party foes by picking either a leftist like Warren or someone like Barack Obama’s former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, who was closely associated with that administration’s tilt against the Jewish state and its appeasement of Iran. Instead, Biden chose as his running mate California Sen. Kamala Harris, the most establishment-friendly contender on his vice-presidential short list. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Harris is being celebrated as the first woman of color to be named to a national presidential ticket. But the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica is also the sort of candidate to warm the hearts of centrists, even if she tried hard to sound like a progressive during her abortive run last year for the presidency. After Biden named Harris, the jubilation from groups like the Democratic Majority for Israel was understandable. Given all of the possible choices in a race that at one point last year had two-dozen candidates—with many, if not most, of them espousing not just a host of radical positions on the issues, but also some less than supportive attitudes towards Israel—the Biden-Harris ticket is probably the optimal Democratic outcome for the pro-Israel community. That said, the DMFI shouldn’t oversell their triumph. Biden and Harris are pro-Israel stalwarts when compared to the likes of Sanders and Warren, who are both deeply critical as well as unfair in their criticisms of the Jewish state. It’s also true that unlike many of the other Democrats running, neither Biden nor Harris support conditioning aid to Israel on its obeying American diktats on the peace process. Nevertheless, they still adhere to stands that are opposed by both the Israeli government and the vast majority of Israel’s voters. That includes opposition to the Trump administration’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and their support for the disastrous 2015 Iran nuclear deal that a Biden administration will seek to re-enter. Both are also hostile not only to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but to any conceivable government that might replace him since there is a solid center-right consensus in the Jewish state that will oppose any attempt to revive Obama’s efforts to force Israel to accept a Palestinian state on the West Bank. That means at best, a Democratic victory in November will be a reboot of the Obama administration, as well as a return to years of endless spats between Washington and Jerusalem that will do nothing to promote peace and much to encourage the Jewish state’s foes, especially when compared to Trump, the most pro-Israel president in history. But even if we accept at face value Biden’s and Harris’s claims to be solid supporters of Israel, there is a different and equally important question to ask about what an administration led by them would mean for the Middle East: Who will serve in the key positions that will help determine policies and the day-to-day running of the government? While no one knows the answer to that question with certainty at this point, there is good reason to suspect that supporters of Israel should be concerned once a Biden-Harris administration is staffed. The first thing to point out is that despite Biden deciding not to choose Rice as his running mate, there’s no reason to believe that she won’t be his pick for a key foreign-policy position next year, including secretary of state. That means Rice or any one of a number of veterans of Obama’s State Department or his National Security Council will not just be heading up the foreign-policy team if Biden wins. It’s also a dead certainty that a host of lesser positions will be filled by Obama alumni who have already signaled that the gloves will be off if they get another crack at pressuring Israel to acquiesce to their efforts to empower the Palestinians or to appease Iran. Nor will anti-Israel figures be limited to the foreign-policy team. Prior to Biden’s pick of Harris, the Biden campaign had already announced the identity of her campaign chief of staff. Harris’s top aide will be Karine Jean-Pierre, the former spokesperson for the leftist Moveon.org group. Jean-Pierre is a vicious critic of Israel and wrote a column in Newsweek last year advocating a boycott of the annual AIPAC conference in which she trashed both the pro-Israel lobby and the Jewish state. As far as Jean-Pierre is concerned, traditional support for Israel is in conflict with the “progressive values” most Democrats support. Those views are aligned with the far-left, anti-Israel wing of the party—led by “Squad” members Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who both won easy primary victories despite the hopes of pro-Israel Democrats that they might be defeated and who have not been actively opposed by Biden and Harris—as well as by growing ranks of advocates of the anti-Semitic BDS movement among Democrats in Congress and among grassroots activists. This means that although some may believe that the future of the Democrats has just been decided, the outcome of the fight to preserve the party as one in which friends of Israel can feel comfortable is far from certain.

News article:
Bernie Sanders exhibited the progressive wing's support for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden during a flurry of media appearances on Sunday morning where he voiced his top priority is beating Donald Trump. 'My message to our supporters is we have got to do everything that we can to defeat Donald Trump, who I view as the most dangerous president in American history,' he told CNN's Take Tapper on 'State of the Union.' 'We're going to do all that we can to mobilize people for a progressive agenda,' the Vermont senator continued in his Sunday morning appearance. 'This is not a complicated issue,' the 78-year-old Democratic socialist said of backing the 77-year-old former vice president. 'Donald Trump must be defeated, Biden must be elected.' 'And after that election, we're going to do all that we can to fight for a progressive agenda,' he reiterated. 'What we have to do the day after we elect Joe Biden as president we got to rally our people to stand up and fight for an America that works for all and not just the few,' he added. 'And that absolutely includes Medicare for All.' Sanders is also slated to speak on the kick-off night of the first ever virtual Democratic National Convention on Monday. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday morning on 'State of the Union' that his top priority is beating Donald Trump in November, claiming the next move would be to fight for a progressive agenda Sanders and fellow progressive Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are slated to speak at the Democratic National Convention where they will throw the progressive wing support behind Biden's presidency The former 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate will make a speech at the all-virtual event just ahead of headliner speaker and former first lady Michelle Obama. Also representing the progressive wing of the party at the convention this year will be New York City Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has a 60-second speaking slot on the second night of events. On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez will also share the virtual stage with Biden's wife, Dr. Jill Biden, and former President Bill Clinton. AOC was an organizer from Sanders' campaign in the 2016 presidential race before launching her own political ambitions. As well as speaking to CNN, Sanders – who has gone on quite a media hiatus since suspending his campaign in April and endorsing Biden – also did interviews with NBC News' 'Meet the Press' and ABC News' 'This Week' on Sunday morning to express his support for Biden. The extra push of momentum from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party comes after Biden announced last week that California Senator Kamala Harris would be joining him on his presidential ticket. 'If Wall Street breathes a sigh of relief with Kamala Harris being named to the ticket, what does Bernie Sanders do?' Tapper asked Sanders. 'What Bernie Sanders is going to do is do everything that I can to defeat Donald Trump, to elect Joe Biden,' he responded. This selection marks history as Harris will become the first black woman to ever appear on a major party’s presidential ballot. Harris has also quelled concerns of some far-left factions of the party who were concerned with Biden's middle-of-the-line stance on many policies. Trump has bashed Harris, the former attorney general of California, for her liberal record and claims she is 'nasty' and 'mean' and a 'mad woman.' During an interview with former Fox News commentator Eric Bolling that aired on his show with Sinclair Sunday morning, Trump said she is more liberal than Sanders. The progressive push comes as Biden (left) announced last week his running mate will be California Senator Kamala Harris (right), who last year had the most liberal voting record of any other senator in Congress Trump said Harris is more liberal than Sanders, and asserted Sunday that she would be 'running' the White House as vice president 'She is super liberal,' Trump insisted. 'I have actually heard that she is the most liberal person in Congress. More liberal than Bernie Sanders.' 'Kamala's a socialist,' he continued, claiming she had 'brought over' Biden to the far-left and would be 'running it.' 'She's a disaster,' he asserted. Both Sanders and Harris were once rivals of Biden in the Democratic primary. Harris has the most liberal voting record over the last year of any senator currently serving in Congress, according to GovTrack, a government watchdog. She is a proponent for late-term abortion, has advocated for criminalize climate-change denial and the manufacturing of guns and wants taxpayer-funded health care to apply to illegal immigrants. She has also suggested that being Catholic should disqualify judges from serving on the higher courts. In 2018 she said a Trump nominee and member of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization, might not 'fairly and impartially' judge cases because of the organization's allegiance to the church.

News article:
As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s star rises in the Democratic Party, all eyes are on how the progressive powerhouse will influence the 2020 platform — and with it the prospects of Joe Biden at the top of the ticket. The New York Democrat endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic presidential primary, becoming one of his most vocal and prominent surrogates. She also frequently criticized Biden, the former vice president, as overly centrist, saying in January that the two would be in different political parties “in any other country.” Since Biden became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee earlier this year, Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as a key figure in attempts to bridge the ideological gap between the party establishment and the more populist camp represented by Sanders. Shortly after Sanders exited the race, she joined the party’s “unity task force,” which developed policy recommendations designed to satisfy both factions and build a common front against President Trump heading into November. In an even more prominent role, Ocasio-Cortez is also scheduled to speak Tuesday at the Democrats’ virtual convention, providing an unusual platform for a first-term lawmaker — and self-described democratic socialist — who’s often at odds with the party brass. A day later, she’s set to address the same audience in a separate video segment. It’s not that Ocasio-Cortez is driving the ship. The proposed platform she helped develop does not include “Medicare for All,” a signature issue for both her and Sanders, nor does it contain key components of the Green New Deal, the liberals’ wish list for environmental policy. However, it does embrace a host of other progressive priorities, including a public health insurance option, guaranteed early childhood education and a $15 minimum wage. As a result, the party platform set to be adopted at the virtual convention is “definitively [the] most progressive platform that will be adopted by the Democratic Party,” Joel Rubin, a strategist with the liberal group Democracy Partners, told The Hill. “Much of the ideas were built upon with the work of the working group,” added Rubin, who advised Sanders’s 2020 campaign. Indeed, the 2020 Democratic draft platform has several positions in common with the task force report, including carbon-free electricity production by 2035 and net-zero emissions in the agriculture sector. Both positions come from the task force’s environmental group, which Ocasio-Cortez co-chaired. Such provisions are sure to energize the Democrats’ liberal base, which has seethed under four years of Trump and is already invigorated by the national protests for racial justice prompted by the police killing of George Floyd. But the tug to the left is not without political risk, and Trump has seized on Ocasio-Cortez’s and Sanders’s roles in developing the recommendations, seeking to portray Biden as in thrall to the far left. Republican campaign operatives are only happy to pile on, hoping to link vulnerable centrist Democrats to the most liberal voices in their party. “The more Democrats highlight Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her whacky socialist policies, the better,” said Michael McAdams, a spokesman for the House Republicans’ campaign arm. “AOC is an anti-Semitic, anti-American radical who has made it her mission to get cops killed, destroy the economy and eliminate the American dream.” Ocasio-Cortez’s office declined to comment for this story but referred The Hill to a July tweet by the congresswoman on the working group’s recommendations. In the tweet, Ocasio-Cortez declared the working group had “meaningfully & substantively improved Biden’s positions.” Democrats are pushing back, arguing that many of the policy proposals they’ve adopted are too broadly popular, according to public polls, for this line of attack to be effective. “These are things that matter. These are pocketbook issues. These are not extremist issues,” Rubin said. “The more that the president tries to demonize progressives, the more he’s going to have to explain why the policies that progressives are advocating are not going to help Americans, and I think that’s an argument that we’ll win.” The coronavirus pandemic has also laid bare the effects of income inequality on health care outcomes, meaning voters are more likely than ever to see the issue Ocasio-Cortez’s way, according to Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “Whether it’s Joe Biden or [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] or AOC, we as Democrats can proudly take big, bold solutions to the American people and know that our ideas are popular,” Green told The Hill. Ocasio-Cortez’s influence on the party platform, Green said, has put Biden in a position to better appeal to the progressives who may not have been enthusiastic about him during the primaries. “A combination of progressive influence and this pandemic crisis have pushed Joe Biden to expand his own boundaries of how far to go on big solutions, and the places he’s landed are both bold and extremely popular with voters, so Trump will have a hard time creating a wedge with voters,” he said. In an election year when race, gender and social justice are all at the forefront of the national debate, Ocasio-Cortez seems uniquely suited to play an outsize role on the campaign trail. As a prominent member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, she’s been on the front lines of the Democrats’ battles with Trump over immigration enforcement, police reform and poverty alleviation — even when it meant criticizing the official party line as too tepid. As the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, she speaks to millennial voters who’ve been historically reluctant to participate in elections. And as a social media megastar — boasting more than 8 million Twitter followers — she has the platform to reach them. Those dynamics were all on display last month after Ocasio-Cortez was accosted outside the Capitol by GOP Rep. Ted Yoho (Fla.), who referred to her using a vulgar, sexist slur. Hardly rattled, Ocasio-Cortez used the episode as an opportunity to seize the House floor and denounce a “culture” of sexism on Capitol Hill and beyond — a theme that’s been pronounced under Trump and has grown even more so with Biden’s choice of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) as his running mate. The message, Democrats say, is not that women are running to check a box. It’s that they’re finally getting the due they’ve been denied for too long. “Let’s recognize [Harris] not only as the first woman of color to be vice president, but the best possible person he could have chosen to proceed into this election,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), no stranger to breaking glass ceilings, told MSNBC last week. Yet Republicans see their own strategic opportunities in the rise of liberal figures such as Harris and Ocasio-Cortez, who are radioactive in conservative circles. And GOP strategist Ford O’Connell told The Hill that tying Biden to Ocasio-Cortez could help Trump “recapture” exactly the voters slipping away from him, such as senior citizens and suburbanites. “One of the big points that President Trump wants to sell is that Joe Biden sells himself as a moderate but in reality he’s a figurehead for the far left,” O’Connell said. “The very voters Trump needs to recapture to win this election … they are not big fans of what AOC is selling,” he added. O’Connell noted that some establishment Democrats are already seeking to diminish Ocasio-Cortez’s role in the convention. He pointed to comments by former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) suggesting Ocasio-Cortez speaking would be unnecessary. “If you picked AOC, why wouldn’t you pick [Rep.] Katie Porter [D-Calif.], or why wouldn’t you pick [Rep.] Madeleine Dean [D-Pa.] or [Rep.] Mary Gay Scanlon [D-Pa.]?” Rendell told Politico last week, referring to several other less polarizing women in the Democrats’ freshman class. “What you can tell is when you look at someone like Ed Rendell is it becomes immediately clear that establishment Democrats see her as annoying and often pretend the words that come out of her mouth or on Twitter never really happened,” O’Connell said. “[But] she is the present and future of the Democratic Party, and when she talks, Democrats listen — particularly the far left,” he added.

However, it does embrace a host of other progressive priorities, including a public health insurance option, guaranteed early childhood education and a $15 minimum wage. As a result, the party platform set to be adopted at the virtual convention is “definitively [the] most progressive platform that will be adopted by the Democratic Party,” Joel Rubin, a strategist with the liberal group Democracy Partners, told The Hill. “Much of the ideas were built upon with the work of the working group,” added Rubin, who advised Sanders’s 2020 campaign. Indeed, the 2020 Democratic draft platform has several positions in common with the task force report, including carbon-free electricity production by 2035 and net-zero emissions in the agriculture sector. Both positions come from the task force’s environmental group, which Ocasio-Cortez co-chaired. Such provisions are sure to energize the Democrats’ liberal base, which has seethed under four years of Trump and is already invigorated by the national protests for racial justice prompted by the police killing of George Floyd. But the tug to the left is not without political risk, and Trump has seized on Ocasio-Cortez’s and Sanders’s roles in developing the recommendations, seeking to portray Biden as in thrall to the far left. Republican campaign operatives are only happy to pile on, hoping to link vulnerable centrist Democrats to the most liberal voices in their party. “The more Democrats highlight Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her whacky socialist policies, the better,” said Michael McAdams, a spokesman for the House Republicans’ campaign arm. “AOC is an anti-Semitic, anti-American radical who has made it her mission to get cops killed, destroy the economy and eliminate the American dream.” Ocasio-Cortez’s office declined to comment for this story but referred The Hill to a July tweet by the congresswoman on the working group’s recommendations. In the tweet, Ocasio-Cortez declared the working group had “meaningfully & substantively improved Biden’s positions.” Democrats are pushing back, arguing that many of the policy proposals they’ve adopted are too broadly popular, according to public polls, for this line of attack to be effective. “These are things that matter. These are pocketbook issues. These are not extremist issues,” Rubin said. “The more that the president tries to demonize progressives, the more he’s going to have to explain why the policies that progressives are advocating are not going to help Americans, and I think that’s an argument that we’ll win.” The coronavirus pandemic has also laid bare the effects of income inequality on health care outcomes, meaning voters are more likely than ever to see the issue Ocasio-Cortez’s way, according to Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “Whether it’s Joe Biden or [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] or AOC, we as Democrats can proudly take big, bold solutions to the American people and know that our ideas are popular,” Green told The Hill. Ocasio-Cortez’s influence on the party platform, Green said, has put Biden in a position to better appeal to the progressives who may not have been enthusiastic about him during the primaries. “A combination of progressive influence and this pandemic crisis have pushed Joe Biden to expand his own boundaries of how far to go on big solutions, and the places he’s landed are both bold and extremely popular with voters, so Trump will have a hard time creating a wedge with voters,” he said. In an election year when race, gender and social justice are all at the forefront of the national debate, Ocasio-Cortez seems uniquely suited to play an outsize role on the campaign trail. As a prominent member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, she’s been on the front lines of the Democrats’ battles with Trump over immigration enforcement, police reform and poverty alleviation — even when it meant criticizing the official party line as too tepid. As the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, she speaks to millennial voters who’ve been historically reluctant to participate in elections. And as a social media megastar — boasting more than 8 million Twitter followers — she has the platform to reach them. Those dynamics were all on display last month after Ocasio-Cortez was accosted outside the Capitol by GOP Rep. Ted Yoho (Fla.), who referred to her using a vulgar, sexist slur. Hardly rattled, Ocasio-Cortez used the episode as an opportunity to seize the House floor and denounce a “culture” of sexism on Capitol Hill and beyond — a theme that’s been pronounced under Trump and has grown even more so with Biden’s choice of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) as his running mate. The message, Democrats say, is not that women are running to check a box. It’s that they’re finally getting the due they’ve been denied for too long. “Let’s recognize [Harris] not only as the first woman of color to be vice president, but the best possible person he could have chosen to proceed into this election,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), no stranger to breaking glass ceilings, told MSNBC last week. Yet Republicans see their own strategic opportunities in the rise of liberal figures such as Harris and Ocasio-Cortez, who are radioactive in conservative circles. And GOP strategist Ford O’Connell told The Hill that tying Biden to Ocasio-Cortez could help Trump “recapture” exactly the voters slipping away from him, such as senior citizens and suburbanites. “One of the big points that President Trump wants to sell is that Joe Biden sells himself as a moderate but in reality he’s a figurehead for the far left,” O’Connell said. “The very voters Trump needs to recapture to win this election … they are not big fans of what AOC is selling,” he added. O’Connell noted that some establishment Democrats are already seeking to diminish Ocasio-Cortez’s role in the convention. He pointed to comments by former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) suggesting Ocasio-Cortez speaking would be unnecessary. “If you picked AOC, why wouldn’t you pick [Rep.] Katie Porter [D-Calif.], or why wouldn’t you pick [Rep.] Madeleine Dean [D-Pa.] or [Rep.] Mary Gay Scanlon [D-Pa.]?” Rendell told Politico last week, referring to several other less polarizing women in the Democrats’ freshman class. “What you can tell is when you look at someone like Ed Rendell is it becomes immediately clear that establishment Democrats see her as annoying and often pretend the words that come out of her mouth or on Twitter never really happened,” O’Connell said. “[But] she is the present and future of the Democratic Party, and when she talks, Democrats listen — particularly the far left,” he added.

“PLEASE NOTE: Since Thomas Lifson posted this piece, YouTube has blocked ALL of the videos to which Lifson provides links below. For the full impact of just how egregious this unconstitutional CENSORSHIP IS, click on the link below and scroll down to see this Democrat sabotage of one of our most prestigious conservative web journals – AMERICAN THINKER!! – Fox News Channel.com probably has a video of Maria’s ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ on its web site, so if you didn’t catch the show yesterday, you may be able to view it there. – CB” With the media and the Democrats completely dedicated to fictional narratives, from Trump calling neo-Nazis “fine people” to the wacky conspiracy theory that Trump is sabotaging the U.S. Postal Service in order to disenfranchise voters, the challenge facing the Trump campaign is letting truth annihilate propaganda. I have long stressed that President Trump understands video narratives better than any other president in American history. He was the most successful reality television producer in the history of the medium, crafting compelling narratives abut job competition that drew record audiences. He understands that in order to reach people effectively, a narrative has to follow a structure similar to that of a play, with three acts. The political narrative of the Trump administration is now entering Act Three, in which the conflicts that developed in the first two acts come to a satisfying conclusion, with surprises sprung and conflicts resolved. We got an excellent preview of the developing messages yesterday, thanks to Maria Bartiromo. If you want to understand the deep currents of American politics, Maria Bartiromo’s weekly show on Fox News Channel, Sunday Morning Futures, is essential viewing. Set your DVR to never miss it if you care about politics. Her guests on yesterday’s edition, embedded in full below, laid out the arguments that the Trump campaign can use to win the race, despite the full force of the media behind the artificial narratives pushed by the Democrats. Each guest capably explained the reality that invalidates the media narratives the American public is marinated in. I am optimistic about the Trump campaign’s ability to push reality into the public consciousness among the persuadable segment of the electorate because the public distrusts the media so deeply and because the truth has a lot of gravity when contrasted with the phony narratives that constitute the Democrats’ public stances. Before I describe what each guest covered and provide the time at which the segment starts so readers can focus on what interests them most, I need to note one bombshell that Maria dropped: her sources tell her that John Brennan is slated for an interview with the Durham investigators on Friday of this week. In federal investigations, a target for indictment is usually called in to speak with prosecutors as the last stage of the investigation, after all the relevant facts have been gathered. The mere fact of being called doesn’t guarantee an indictment, of course. But in practice, in an investigation such as Durham’s, an interview is a necessary but not sufficient precursor of an indictment. Jared Kushner was the first interview, beginning 19 seconds into this video: [YouTube has BLOCKED the video since Lifson posted this article!] Kushner offered a detailed and convincing narrative of the strategy that the Trump administration has used to completely reverse the position of the United States in the Middle East and bring about peace, rather than war, as the trend. Under the Obama administration, Iran was ascendant, and the Arab regimes were turning away from the United States, while Israel faced terrorism from Hezb’allah and Hamas, financed by Iran with the billions handed over to it by Obama’s bribe for the Iran deal. The mainstream media are doing their best to ignore the triumph of the normalization of relations between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. But as Kushner explains very clearly, it is a landmark that is leading to even better things ahead, heading toward real peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. This is Nobel Peace Prize–worthy. But the Nobel Prize Committee that awarded the Peace Prize to Barack Obama for no accomplishment at all, just for being Obama, is unlikely to recognize this historic major achievement. Kushner strikes me as extremely smart and articulate. Since he was the point man on negotiating with the Arabs and Israelis, it is pretty easy to imagine him selling them on the Trump administration’s vision for the new Middle East. The only reservation I have about the way he presents himself is that there is curious lack of affect. I would call it “poker face-plus,” in the way he speaks in a monotone and shows no facial expression other than deadpan. The one time he gives away his inner thoughts is when he listens to a question and the corners of his mouth show clues about his reaction. I think Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump are likely to be a force in politics for a long time. It is worthwhile watching the interview just to get a sense of how smart and well controlled he is. Maria followed Jared Kushner with an interview with President Trump, mainly on the Democrats’ demands for $25 billion in U.S. Postal Service funding to handle mail-in ballots, and Trump’s opposition. They can’t appropriate the money without a presidential signature, so he holds the power to scuttle their scheme to steal the election with millions of ballots mailed out, stolen, and harvested. Trump is hanging tough. At the end, Trump also makes the case that Russia hoax coup plot was directed by Obama and Biden — another truth bomb that should be a focus of the campaign. Here is where the Trump segment begins: – [ALSO BLOCKED by YouTube] Steve Bannon followed his former boss and explained the big picture of Trump reversing the globalist agenda, which sacrificed American manufacturing, devastating the blue collar middle class, and enriched the top tier of financial and technology elites. Bannon is passionate and articulate. The message he powerfully articulates should win the industrial Midwest for Trump: Here is where Bannon starts:- [ALSO BLOCKED.] Following Bannon is Senator Ron Johnson, who explains how the evidence of the coup has been covered up, but now is breaking out, as long-suppressed evidence finally is coming to light. He speaks with genuine passion and outrage. Given the high probability that indictments will be forthcoming from the Durham (and maybe other) investigators, the members of the electorate who are not already committed to the left have a chance to finally understand “the greatest political crime in American history,”as President Trump described it to Maria. [BLOCKED] The final segment with Steven Schrage on the set-up of spying on Trump campaign, as apparently masterminded by Stefan Halper, Schrage’s PhD thesis supervisor at Cambridge University. Halper has been kept in the shadows, probably because he was a spy for the US who collaborated with Britain’s MI 6 and Christopher Steele, a former MI 6 spy and has been shielded as a “sources and methods” secret that must be protected. The outrageous sums that were paid to Halper for vague “studies” on broad topics looks to me a lot like the American spooks financing the set-up of spying on the Trump campaign by falsely painting Carter Page as a potential Russian agent when, in fact, he was already an asset for the CIA, which was concealed from the FISA Court by former FBI lawyer Eric Clinesmith, who reportedly is pleading guilty and turning state’s evidence in the Durham probe.

News article:
Veteran Fox News anchor Chris Wallace praised former first lady Michelle Obama’s virtual speech at the Democratic National Convention late Monday, with the “Fox News Sunday” host stating that she “really flayed, sliced and diced” President Trump. “It was a heck of a contribution,” Wallace said. “She really flayed, sliced and diced Donald Trump, talking about the chaos and confusion and lack of empathy, especially coming from this president and this White House, spoke more about the deficits of Donald Trump than the pluses of Joe Biden, but did talk about especially, not so much policies, but especially his empathy and what he has been through and his care for average Americans.” “This was a very effective speech,” Wallace added. Here is how Fox News anchor Chris Wallace reacted to #MichelleObama speech last night #DNCConvention #DNC2020 pic.twitter.com/Ku3z5YCVWN — Amaka Ubaka (@AmakaUbakaTV) August 18, 2020 Wallace’s perspective came during the network’s live coverage of the first night of the convention, which also included speeches from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). Fox News anchor and host Dana Perino also lauded Obama for her authenticity and ability to connect with voters. “You got the sense when you talk about authenticity, she has it in spades. She has that voice, she has clarity, and she knows what she is out there wanting to do,” Perino, who served as President George W. Bush’s press secretary, said. “She was trying to get everybody to really focus and then she had a call to action: Ask for your ballot tonight.” “I think that the DNC, if they look over the course of the night, the first virtual convention of our history, I think they would say that Michelle Obama stuck the landing,” she added. Democratic convention speakers for Tuesday night include Jill Biden, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and former President Clinton, among others. Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to accept the party’s presidential nomination on Thursday evening.

The Democratic National Convention is making clear that the Democrats are only trying to appeal to the radical left, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., told “The Ingraham Angle" Monday. “The Democrats today are the party of the rich,” Cruz said. “They’re the party of coastal elites. They’re the party of Manhattan and San Francisco… That’s who they’re trying to appeal to, is the radical left. When it comes to working men and women, when it comes to union members, when it comes to the Ohio steelworker, they were nowhere to be found.” Cruz added that Democrats don’t have any message for organizations like Teamsters, even as Antifa mobs are burning police union halls. CHRIS WALLACE PANS OPENING OF DNC: 'FELT MORE LIKE A TELETHON' THAN A NATIONAL CONVENTION “The Democrats have said, ‘We care more about the woke mob than we do about standing with cops, firefighters or working men and women,'" he said. "And to go tonight without saying a meaningful word about the riots, about the police officers being murdered, it’s an example of how the Democratic Party [is] getting more and more extreme.” That extremism, Cruz posited, stems from their hatred for President Trump. “That’s what they stand for – radical leftism and hating Trump,” he said. “I don’t think that’s a majority vision in America.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cruz warned that if the Democrats win in November, America is facing the prospect of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. “in ascension." “These are radicals and that’s where the Democratic Party is," he said, "and I don’t think that’s where the American people are."

News article:
On Monday night, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich completed his journey from conservative darling and Republican rising star to speaker at the Democratic National Convention. “I’m a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country,” Kasich said at the event. “That’s why I’ve chosen to appear at this convention. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen, but these are not normal times.” Kasich led a small group of Republican dissidents at the mostly virtual convention’s opening night. But unlike former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New York Rep. Susan Molinari, or businesswoman Meg Whitman, Kasich wasn’t identified with the GOP’s centrist wing for most of his career. An anti-abortion budget cutter, Kasich identified with conservatives since winning a seat in the Ohio state Senate at age 26. “John was a conservative early on,” said a former Ohio Republican official. “He was a fighter.” The son of a mailman, Kasich, first elected to represent a central Ohio congressional district in 1982, originally rose to national prominence as a foot soldier in Newt Gingrich’s “Republican Revolution” in the 1990s. With the election of the first House majority in 40 years, at 42, he ascended to the chairmanship of the House Budget Committee, a post from which he crafted blueprints for cutting federal spending, lowering taxes, reforming welfare, and balancing the budget. Most controversially, Kasich sought to reduce the rate of growth of Medicare spending to achieve $270 billion in savings, which Democrats assailed as necessary only to pay for the GOP’s proposed $245 billion tax cut. He also wanted to trim the foreign aid budget 30% across the board, exempting Israel. Republicans were savaged in the press for trying to defund Big Bird via zeroing out federal funds for public broadcasting and cutting the National Endowment for the Arts. Some of these cuts never happened. But by 1997, Kasich was credited with working with then-President Bill Clinton to deliver the first balanced federal budget since 1969. After a decade out of elective office, Kasich was elected governor of Ohio on a balanced-budget platform in 2010, the beginning of the Tea Party era, unseating an incumbent Democrat. In office, he pushed for privatization, championed concealed carry rights for gun owners, supported defunding Planned Parenthood, and signed legislation pro-choice activists blamed for the closure of half of the abortion clinics in Ohio. Like Scott Walker in Wisconsin, he tried to curb collective bargaining by public sector unions. The measure was reversed by voters when labor leaders put it on the ballot as a referendum. After that setback, some allies began to sense a shift in Kasich. Reelected easily in 2014, he fought conservatives in his own party to win approval for expanding Medicaid in Ohio through Obamacare. The New York Times headlined a story about the battle, “Ohio Governor defies GOP with defense of social safety net,” quoting Kasich as saying, “I’m concerned about the fact there seems to be a war on the poor.” The New York Times reported Kasich “occasionally sounds more like an heir to Lyndon B. Johnson than to Ronald Reagan.” “I had a conversation with one of the members of the legislature the other day,” Kasich said in 2013. “I said, ‘I respect the fact that you believe in small government. I do, too. I also know that you’re a person of faith.’” He added: “‘Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he’s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.’” After a 2015 tour promoting a federal balanced budget amendment, Kasich jumped into the Republican presidential race. Like prior John Weaver-advised GOP candidates John McCain in 2000 and Jon Huntsman in 2012, he received favorable press coverage and was competitive in New Hampshire, where he finished a distant second with nearly 16% of the vote, but he couldn’t break through with conservatives nationally. Kasich emerged as a vocal critic of front-runner Donald Trump and, unlike many other candidates, remained one after Trump secured the nomination, refusing to vote for him that November. This time Kasich is actively supporting the Democratic ticket. Though criticized by Never Trumpers in 2016 for not dropping out quickly enough to allow the field to coalesce around a single anti-Trump candidate, he became a spokesman for their concerns about Trump's temperament and fitness for office. “I know that Joe Biden, with his experience and his wisdom and his decency, can bring us together to help us find that better way,” Kasich said Monday night. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among the liberal Democrats critical of Kasich getting such a large role at their convention, similar to ones played by Democrats Zell Miller and Joe Lieberman at GOP confabs in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Republicans have also panned Kasich’s conversion. “John Kasich’s party and ideology were always selfishly about John Kasich more than the GOP or conservatism,” said Republican strategist Nicholas Everhart. “I think in a lot of ways, it just burns Kasich that Trump was able to take over and mold the party in his own image in a way Kasich had always hoped he’d be able to, but clearly failed.” "After tonight, his future as a Republican is over, and Democrats will have no further use for him," said Bradley Blakeman, a former aide to President George W. Bush. "It was opening and closing night for Kasich’s one act play."

News article:
John Kasich and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in a war of words on Monday evening, hours before the Republican former governor was due to address the Democratic National Convention. The convention, which is being held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, kicks off on Monday at 9pm ET, with Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders due to speak alongside Kasich. Kasich ran against Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, and will on Monday night speak to endorse Trump's rival, Joe Biden. John Kasich, the Republican former governor of Ohio, will address the DNC on Monday night Kasich criticized 'AOC' ahead of his speech, saying she receives 'outsized publicity' In an interview ahead of his speech, Kasich, 68, who was governor of Ohio from 2011-2019, spoke out against Ocasio-Cortez. Asked why he - as a Republican - was asked to speak, he told Buzzfeed News that he thinks the U.S. is 'moderate', and that 'extreme' politicians - like Ocasio-Cortez - receive 'outsized publicity.' The first-term congresswoman will be allotted one minute to speak during the convention, and her speech is pre-recorded. Kasich, on the other hand, will deliver a live address. 'I think both parties have to have new ideas, and I think this country is moderate,' said Kasich. 'People on the extreme, whether they're on the left or on the right, they get outsized publicity that tends to define their party. 'You know, I listen to people all the time make these statements, and because AOC gets outsized publicity doesn't mean she represents the Democratic Party. She's just a part, just some member of it. 'And it's on both sides, whether it's the Republicans or whether it's the Democrats.' Ocasio-Cortez, 30, has only been given one minute to issue remarks at the DNC on Tuesday Ocasio-Cortez, who backed Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary, fired back in a tweet, accusing Kasich of 'fighting against women's rights.' Kasich, who is strongly pro-life, took a series of actions while governor to restrict access to abortion. The Columbus Dispatch calculated that he signed 21 bills chipping away at abortion rights. 'It's great that Kasich has woken up & realized the importance of supporting a Biden-Harris ticket,' she wrote. 'I hope he gets through to GOP voters. Yet also, something tells me a Republican who fights against women's rights doesn't get to say who is or isn't representative of the Dem party.' Kasich is one of four Republicans to speak on behalf of Joe Biden on Monday night Kasich will be one of four Republicans to speak in support of presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday - the same night that Sanders will address the convention. The three Republicans joining Kasich on Monday are former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman; Quibi CEO Meg Whitman, a former adviser for Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns; and former Rep. Susan Molinari, who spoke during the 1996 Republican National Convention. The range of speakers is intended to underscore party unity and highlight the spectrum of political ideologues who support the former vice president -- a fact that Biden's Wall Street donors have been spreading among bankers concerned about the role that Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, both Democratic socialists, could play during the election, sources told Fox Business. Ocasio-Cortez's limited remarks, which she will deliver on Tuesday, have angered some, who have accused the DNC of trying to silence progressive voices. Others were enraged at the allocation of such a short amount of time to the Leftist leader AOC herself accepted the news by posting a poem entitled 'Life Is Just a Minute' Ocasio-Cortez herself acknowledged the decision to curtail her speech by tweeting a poem, entitled: 'Life Is Just a Minute' by Benjamin E. Mays. 'I only have a minute. Sixty seconds in it. Forced upon me, I did not choose it, But I know that I must use it. Give account if I abuse it. Suffer, if I lose it. Only a tiny little minute, But eternity is in it.' The poem, she noted, was recited by the late Elijah Cummings, representative for Maryland. On Sunday, the Young Delegate Coalition, a group of 225 delegates representing Biden, Sanders, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth, at the convention, launched a petition urging the DNC to give Ocasio-Cortez more speaking time. 'She is one of two convention speakers under the age of 50,' the petition stated. 'Yet, she is only being allotted 60 seconds to speak while Republican John Kasich is slated to have a much longer speaking segment. This is unacceptable.' A CBS News poll released over the weekend found that only 38 per cent of Democrats said they wanted to hear from Kasich at the convention, while 63 per cent said they wanted to hear from Ocasio-Cortez.

News article:
WASHINGTON — For Democrats, the future will have to wait. A parade of prominent establishment Baby Boomers — and pre-Baby Boomers — reminded voters their set is in firm control of the party as more than a dozen rising stars were crammed into delivering a single quilted speech on the second night of the Democratic convention Tuesday. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., by far the most recognizable young Democrat in the country, was given her own one-minute speaking slot, but only because she was chosen by runner-up Bernie Sanders to act as a "second" for putting his name in nomination. The message the Biden campaign sent to the rest of the country is that now is not the time to test out new leaders or pursue ideological aims. That's consistent with the way Biden ran his primary campaign, claiming the turf of the Obama administration he served in as vice president and challenging competitors — mostly younger and to his left — to define what was wrong with it. He bet that the Democratic electorate, no matter its impulse for fresh blood or progressive policies, would feel more comfortable with a known-commodity nominee who would be hard for President Donald Trump to label as a risky alternative. He won, and now he's presenting himself and his party to Republicans and independents as the safe pick Democrats saw. On the other side, Biden would like persuadable voters to see Trump as a danger both at home — where the coronavirus has claimed more than 170,000 American lives and wreaked havoc on the real economy — and abroad. "With Joe Biden in the White House, you will never doubt that he will stand with our friends and stand up to our adversaries — never the other way around," former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a onetime fixture at Republican conventions, said in endorsing Biden on Tuesday. "He will stand up to our adversaries with strength and experience. They will know he means business." Powell, 83, added bipartisan punch to a program that highlighted remarks from older men of the political establishment, including former Presidents Bill Clinton, 74, and Jimmy Carter, 95, former Secretary of State and 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry, 76, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, 69. At 59, with no electoral experience, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates stood out for her relative youth and inexperience as she criticized Trump for "relentless attacks on our democratic institutions." They followed a keynote address delivered jointly by 17 next-generation Democrats, including Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Pennsylvania Reps. Brendan Boyle and Conor Lamb, Nevada state Sen. Yvanna Cancela, and Jonathan Nez, president of the Navajo Nation. The format highlighted the idea of a bench of Democrats waiting to take the reins of the party, but also limited the chance that any one of them would become a political liability for Biden. "If this band of 17 radicals is the future of the Democratic Party, Americans should be very worried," the Trump campaign said of the keynoter speakers in an email Tuesday night. "They all hold far-left positions that are well outside the mainstream." But while Biden has said he wants to be a "bridge" from one generation of Democratic leaders to the next, he is signaling that he is in no rush to start paying its construction costs. Download the NBC News app for alerts and all the latest on the Democratic convention. Joseph Mullen, an 18-year-old delegate for Sanders, told The Washington Post's "Power Up" column that younger Democrats have noticed the dominance of the "old guard of Democratic politics" on the first two nights of the convention. "There's not enough young people represented in the lineup," he said. Of course, Wednesday night's program includes Biden's choice for the No. 2 slot on his ticket, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who has been described as a "safe pick" and is also the first woman of color selected as a vice presidential nominee. At 55 and serving in her first term in the Senate, she's less old-guard than many of Tuesday night's speakers. But even Harris, born in October 1964, is a Baby Boomer and, if more progressive than Biden, still solidly within the guardrails of the establishment. For Biden, a young, progressive future is less of a concern than winning now. He has to hope that's true for young progressives, too.

News article:
By David Ian Klein August 19, 2020 Former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign distanced itself from former Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour after the Palestinian-American activist spoke to Democratic National Convention delegates during one of the conference’s virtual assemblies. “Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of anti-Semitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform,” Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement. Sarsour quickly shot back on Twitter. “Just came here to remind you that you need a coalition to defeat Donald Trump and that Muslim Americans are an important voter bloc in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Virginia, Texas, Pennsylvania & I know a little something about how to organize them,” she wrote. In her appearance at the DNC’s Muslims and Allies virtual event, Sarsour said that she was willing to put aside her prior support for Sen. Bernie Sanders in pursuit of a Biden victory. “The Democratic Party is not perfect, but it is absolutely our party at this moment,” she said. “I am here to say that I’m not looking for perfection. I’m looking to defeat fascism.” Sarsour, an anti-Zionist who supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, received criticism when she led the Women’s March due to her past ties to the antisemitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Republicans quickly jumped on Sarsour’s virtual presence at the DNC. “It is outrageous that the Democratic National Committee would allow Linda Sarsour to represent their party to American voters,” Republican Jewish Coalition executive director Matt Brooks said in a statement. “Sarsour’s blatant anti-Semitism finally made her so treif that the radical Women’s March organization had to force her out of her leadership role, but she’s still kosher for the Democrat Party.”

News article:
By David Ian Klein August 19, 2020 Former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign distanced itself from former Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour after the Palestinian-American activist spoke to Democratic National Convention delegates during one of the conference’s virtual assemblies. “Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of anti-Semitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform,” Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement. Sarsour quickly shot back on Twitter. “Just came here to remind you that you need a coalition to defeat Donald Trump and that Muslim Americans are an important voter bloc in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Virginia, Texas, Pennsylvania & I know a little something about how to organize them,” she wrote. In her appearance at the DNC’s Muslims and Allies virtual event, Sarsour said that she was willing to put aside her prior support for Sen. Bernie Sanders in pursuit of a Biden victory. “The Democratic Party is not perfect, but it is absolutely our party at this moment,” she said. “I am here to say that I’m not looking for perfection. I’m looking to defeat fascism.” Sarsour, an anti-Zionist who supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, received criticism when she led the Women’s March due to her past ties to the antisemitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Republicans quickly jumped on Sarsour’s virtual presence at the DNC. “It is outrageous that the Democratic National Committee would allow Linda Sarsour to represent their party to American voters,” Republican Jewish Coalition executive director Matt Brooks said in a statement. “Sarsour’s blatant anti-Semitism finally made her so treif that the radical Women’s March organization had to force her out of her leadership role, but she’s still kosher for the Democrat Party.”

News article:
Former President Bill Clinton was once hailed as a rock star at the Democratic National Convention, but amid the #MeToo era, his presence among this year's speakers has created a virtual elephant in the room. Clinton's scathing remarks about President Trump were overshadowed on Tuesday as critics pointed out his past controversies, including his extramarital affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, allegations of sexual misconduct and assault, and his past ties to deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. "Bill Clinton is just a huge unforced error. Totally unnecessary and a very bad look in 2020," CNN host S.E. Cupp tweeted. "Is the ghost of Epstein talking after Bill Clinton?" progressive commentator Kyle Kulinski jokingly asked. CNN PANEL SHUTS DOWN GUEST ASKING HOW BILL CLINTON HASN'T BEEN 'CANCELED' "interesting choice having jeffrey epstein and ghislaine maxwell's friend bill clinton speak at the dnc while the rest of the party is calling trump a rapist," Twitch TV host Hasan Piker similarly tweeted.

Journalist Phillip Bailey pointed out how Clinton received "5x" more speaking time than Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was only allotted 60 seconds on air despite her popularity in the Democrat Party. MSNBC IGNORES EPSTEIN DOCS IMPLICATING BILL CLINTON; CNN LARGELY AVOIDS "For a party that made Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault allegations the center of its political universe a few years ago nothing says #metoo like giving @BillClinton such a prominent speaking spot over arguably one of its top 5 women, right?" Bailey tweeted. The Federalist cultural editor Emily Jashinsky reacted to Clinton's criticism against Trump, when the former president said, "At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command center. Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos."

News article:
Former President Barack Obama argued that it is not strange that Joe Biden has adopted policies further Left than what he ran on in the primary that are closer to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's governing vision. "If you look at Joe Biden’s goals and Bernie Sanders’s goals, they’re not that different, from a forty-thousand-foot level," Obama told the New Yorker in a recent interview that was published Sunday. "They both want to make sure everybody has healthcare. They want to make sure everybody can get a job that pays a living wage. They want to make sure every child gets a good education." Obama suggested that the difference is tactics rather than policy and that the coronavirus pandemic, along with other political changes, has changed more than Biden has. "A lot of times, the issue has to do with ‘How do we go about that, and what are the coalitions we need?'" Obama said. "What I think the moment has done is to change some of those calculations, not because necessarily Joe’s changed but because circumstances have changed." Biden ran on a more centrist platform that rejected his left-wing competitors’ visions of single-payer healthcare and student loan debt forgiveness. Soon after it became clear that he was the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, however, Biden adopted key proposals from the two biggest leftists in the primary field: a proposal from Sanders to make all public higher education free for those with annual family incomes less than $125,000 and a proposal favored by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to reform the bankruptcy system. The Biden campaign worked with aides and allies of Sanders, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to form a "Unity Task Force" that created recommendations for the Democratic Party platform. Sanders has said that he thinks Biden could be "the most progressive president since FDR." Despite that left-wing turn, last week's virtual Democratic convention focused heavily on emotion and dislike of President Trump in an effort to court Republicans and centrists rather than highlighting the left wing of the party.

News article:
CNN anchor Jake Tapper suggested on Tuesday that Republicans would be "rioting" if Democrats attempted similar "norm-busting" tactics at their own convention. There were plenty of firsts at the Republican National Convention from President Trump's pardon of felon-turned-activist Jon Ponder, his overseeing a naturalization ceremony at the White House, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's address from Jerusalem. Minutes before the convention began, Tapper slammed the "erosions of norms and standards." "There was an expectation in this country that secretaries of state, a tradition, secretaries of state will not speak at conventions," Tapper told his colleague Wolf Blitzer. "I cannot imagine the outcry if Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had spoken at the Democratic Convention in 2012." CNN'S JOE LOCKHART ATTACKS SANDMANN AS 'SNOT NOSE ENTITLED KID' AFTER NETWORK'S DEFAMATION SUIT He continued, "We're also going to have the president issuing a pardon during a political convention. I mean, the individual no doubt deserves a pardon. He was pardoned earlier this year by the state of Nevada. The idea that this would be done as part of a political convention- it's just a completely norm-eroding, norm-busting tradition. And I think we're going to see a lot of that during this convention. And I just can't even imagine what Republicans on Capitol Hill would be doing if Democrats were doing these types of activities during a convention, Wolf. They'd be rioting, frankly." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Other CNN personalities were outspoken with condemnation of the RNC. CNN political analyst Joe Lockhart attacked former Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann following the network settling a $250 million defamation lawsuit, calling the Kentucky teen a "snot nose entitled kid" on Twitter. CNN analyst Brian Karem trashed the address given by First Lady Melania Trump, tweeting she "makes me want to vomit."

News article:
With just over two months to go, the presidential election is in full swing. For months, some have claimed Joe Biden will be the winner, just as they did with Hillary Clinton in 2016. With the close of their convention, however, panic among Democrats is spilling out into the open. Let’s recall that heading into the Democrat primary season of 2019, former Vice President Biden was the presumed nominee. Indeed, in May of 2019, a Brookings Institute headline read: “Why is Joe Biden running away with the Democratic presidential nomination?” It didn’t take long after that, however, for Biden to falter. Joe Biden did poorly in the Democrat debates and on the campaign trail and soon Sen. Elizabeth Warren was leading in the polls. She fell and then Democrats looked to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He faltered and then Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., looked like he would take the nomination in February of 2020. LIZ PEEK: TRUMP MAKES RIVETING CASE FOR REELECTION, SHOWS AMERICA WHAT IT IS IN FOR IF BIDEN WINS The Democrats then did something unprecedented. They panicked and brokered the nomination in broad daylight, by convincing candidates to drop out of the race, to stop Bernie Sanders from becoming the nominee. Then they resuscitated Biden’s dying candidacy and made him the party nominee. If we fast forward to today, the Democrats are panicking again, and their panic started right after the end of the Democrat Convention. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The day after, the leaders of the Democrats’ far left base declared the convention did not go far enough to the left. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said “that the target audience for the Democratic National Convention this week was `white moderates’ and that the Democratic Party could have done more to cater to the party’s base.” She also panned potential moderation in spending by Biden advisers. Sanders agreed with her by stating “They should have had more progressives speaking.” Mark those words, if Biden loses this fall, AOC and Bernie will say the party didn’t nominate a true believer and that was the cause of their defeat. Then Hillary Clinton chimed in. During the middle of the Republican Convention, Clinton admonished Biden to “not concede under any circumstances.” A major party leader talking of concession is the diametrically opposite of political confidence. Then it was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s turn to panic. Pelosi, D-Calif., declared, “out of the blue,” that “I don’t think that there should be any debates,” in a clear attempt to protect Biden from losing to President Trump. Keep in mind that presidential debates have become a staple of elections since the 1960s. The great Kennedy-Nixon debate set the standard for how presidential elections have been conducted ever since. So why are the Democrats panicking? Their convention failed to deliver. Indeed, it looks like their convention scared away Independents. In a poll taken by CBS/YouGov, after the Democrat Convention, President Trump raced to a 10% lead among Independents. If Biden takes Pelosi’s advice and ducks the debates with Trump, he will be regarded now, and by history, as gutless. As I have written before for Fox, our parties are so divided, in what I call The Divided Era, that there is little crossover voting between the parties. That dynamic places a premium on major party enthusiasm (another Biden weakness) and how Independents will vote. If a CBS poll gives Trump that big of a lead, even before the Republican Convention started, the Democrat Party leaders have good reason to panic. Biden’s polling troubles don’t end there, however. The latest Rasmussen poll is consistent with the CBS poll. All of that brings us back to Pelosi stating there should be no debates. She is not alone in that thought on her side of the aisle. Many Democrats know that Biden will not fare well in the debates. Indeed, no modern campaign has seen a candidate campaign less or be less accessible than Biden or his campaign. So much so, that that lack of accessibility caused Fox’s Chris Wallace to declare “This is the damnedest thing I’ve ever seen,” and that “I don’t think [Biden] can hide from now until Election Day. I just don’t think it’s possible.” Of course, just over two months ago, Democrat leaders were good with hidin’ Biden. Former DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe said, at that time, “People say all the time, `Oh, we got to get the vice president out of the basement. He’s fine in the basement.” Now, however, headlines are beginning to read “Biden’s lack of a travel plan worries some Democrats.” If you add it all up, Joe Biden is faltering again. If he takes Pelosi’s advice and ducks the debates with Trump, he will be regarded now, and by history, as gutless. He also would surely lose the election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If Biden does debate, as he has insisted he will, he is likely to do damage to his prospects as well. Just as Trump looks energetic during the conventions while Biden doesn’t, Trump will look the same in the debates. The plain truth is: Biden has never been a good presidential candidate. He is even worse now. The Democrats revived him once, and their panic now indicates they are trying to find a way to do it again. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM TOM DEL BECCARO

News article:
Progressives are hoping for a big night in Massachusetts as voters head to the polls in the state’s Democratic primaries on Tuesday. Groups like the Sunrise Movement and Our Revolution Massachusetts have gone all-in for progressive insurgent and Holyoke, Mass., Mayor Alex Morse (D), who is taking on House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.). Progressives are also coalescing around incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who is facing a high-profile primary challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.). Additionally, major left-wing figures such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have waded into the race. The first-term lawmaker recently participated in an ad for Markey, with whom she co-wrote the Green New Deal. And her group Courage to Change has endorsed Morse, who has compared his race to Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise primary win against former Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) in 2018. “That’s exactly what’s playing out here in this district,” Morse told The Hill. “While people are suffering, we have a congressman who’s using his power for corporations and special interests.” The effort from the groups comes nearly two years after Justice Democrats supported then-progressive candidate Ayanna Pressley, who went on to unseat 10-term incumbent Rep. Mike Capuano (D) in Massachusetts. “I’m seeing very similar trends,” said Solomon Steen, an Our Revolution Massachusetts member, who campaigned for Pressley in 2018. “[It’s] just this real phenomenon that I think is getting undercovered in the press of people coming into politics through issue activism. Not just people who have been doing this for years, but a lot more younger people who are very passionate about whatever their issue is, whether it’s environmental justice, whether it’s racial justice.” Progressives are hoping to replicate recent upsets over incumbents in New York and Missouri. In New York, former middle school principal Jamaal Bowman ousted 16-term incumbent Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) in the state’s 16th Congressional District. Meanwhile, in Missouri, registered nurse and activist Cori Bush defeated 10-term Rep. Wm. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) in the state’s 1st Congressional District. Bowman has endorsed Markey and Morse in their primaries, while Bush has put her support behind Markey. Despite the 39-year-old Kennedy’s track record as a member of the House Progressive Caucus, the 74-year-old Markey has been able to harness left-wing support thanks in part to his stance on environmental issues. Markey’s campaign slogan reads, “It’s not your age — it’s the age of your ideas that’s important.” The senator, who is the longest serving member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, has received endorsements from groups like the Sunrise Movement, Our Revolution and the Working Families Party. “When we’re talking about being a movement candidate, we’re not just talking about someone necessarily [who] was a volunteer and came up through their organization,” said Steen of Our Revolution Massachusetts. “We’re talking about someone who is willing to be the inside voice for these outside groups and enable them to access some of the more arcane and inaccessible elements working within Congress.” Kennedy argued in an interview with The Hill that endorsements from outside groups are not ultimately going to decide the contest that has been playing out across the commonwealth for nearly a year. The congressman also pointed out that a number of the progressive groups endorsing Markey in the primary have endorsed him in prior races. “I don’t think there’s a credible argument that can be made there, whether it’s on strength on the environment or human rights or LGBT rights, or anything else, my record there is a very strong one, and I’m proud of it,” Kennedy said. The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Markey up by 11.2 points. Meanwhile, strategists say that attention from both the media and high-profile progressives in the Senate primary could also help turn out the vote for Morse in his race against Neal. Morse has sought to position himself as a progressive alternative to Neal, telling the left-leaning Jacobin magazine over the weekend that if elected, he would be one of the only Democrats to stand up to the party’s establishment wing. “I would be one of the few Democrats that stands up to the Democratic Party, not just the Republican Party, in fundamentally changing our federal budget to reinvest in people and in domestic priorities like transportation, health care, education, and other social programs,” Morse told the publication. Morse in an interview with The Hill argued that Neal is largely absent from the district, saying, “You would never know that Congressman Neal has power when you look at the district.” Neal’s campaign hit back against the claim, calling it “pure fiction” and citing 700 Neal-hosted events in the district in recent years. All of the candidates competing on Tuesday will also have to contend with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on voter turnout. Tuesday will mark the first statewide vote in Massachusetts to include a vote-by-mail option. Progressive groups on the ground in Massachusetts say they are working with voters to ensure they understand how the mail-in system works, as well as helping them overcome issues in the system. “A lot of people are having to make decisions about can they safely vote in person [while] maintaining socially distant guidelines, and what’s their risk there,” said Steen. The vote-by-mail option could lead to record turnout, with Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin (D) predicting that there could be more than 1.2 million and as much as 1.3 million Democratic ballots cast on Tuesday. Max Greenwood contributed to this report.

He lauded the role the daily has played in highlighting Pakistani-Egyptian bilateral relations in various sectors. “Egypt was also affected by coronavirus and there were a number of similarities in ways the two countries were tackling this pandemic,” he stated. The ambassador spoke about bilateral relations, commenting that they were already very strong but that there is a need to further expand them in various directions. “We have to work in culture, we have to work in trade, we have to work in tourism and housing sectors and many other projects where we can work further together,” said Dahroug. The Egyptian ambassador was also briefed by the executive editor of the paper, Gauhar Zahid Malik, and the group managing-editor, Omar Zahid Malik, on the contributions of the newspaper and on its founder, late editor-in-chief Zahid Malik, who had always believed in the need for strong relations between Pakistan and the Arab countries.

Egypt's Prime Minister's visit comes few days ahead of an anticipated meeting between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia on Monday over the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Egypt’s prime minister Mostafa Madbouly arrived in Sudan for talks with his Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok and several ministers, state run MENA agency reported on Saturday. Extensive talks between the two countries’ delegations will be held on Saturday, according to MENA, without providing details on whether the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) issue will be tackled. Madbouly’s visit comes few days ahead of an anticipated meeting between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia scheduled on Monday over the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) after Khartoum requested last week to adjourn the talks for a week for "internal consultations." Sudan threatened to withdraw from the talks, sponsored by the African Union, if Ethiopia insisted on linking an agreement on the dam’s filling to negotiating a deal on sharing the waters of the Blue Nile. Negotiations to reach a deal over the filling and operation of the nearly $5 billion GERD resumed one week after Cairo's call for a suspension of meetings after Addis Ababa put forward a new draft proposal that Cairo complained is lacking operating guidelines and any legally binding obligations. The mega-dam, built 15 kilometres from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of tension between the three nations. Cairo fears the project will significantly cut its water supply from the River Nile, while Sudan fears it will endanger the safety of its own dams. Addis Ababa announced last month it had achieved its first-year target for the filling of the dam’s reservoir due to the rainfall season. The move was condemned by Cairo and Khartoum -- both have sought a legally binding agreement before the dam was filled. Ethiopia says the massive project, which it hopes will make it Africa’s largest power exporter, is key to its development efforts. Search Keywords: Short link:

The MoU is meant to provide training for students of mechanical engineering, telecommunications engineering, petroleum engineering and pharmacy The Lebanese-Egyptian Business Council and the Beirut Arab University signed on Monday a memorandum of understanding (MoU) providing free Egyptian internships for youth in Lebanese universities, a statement by the university said. The MoU is meant to provide training for students of mechanical engineering, telecommunications engineering, petroleum engineering and pharmacy. Students who undergo this internship program will be given priority to work at Egyptian companies, the statement said. The 45-day program will include a graduation project on an industrial idea that involves Egypt and Lebanon, said Mona Wahba, head of the trade representation office at the Egyptian embassy in Lebanon, according to Egypt’s state news agency MENA. Wahba said this initiative will start with Beirut Arab University and will then be transferred to other Lebanese universities. The initiative will initially include 40 students in the engineering and pharmacy fields and will then secure training in Egyptian hospitals for students at Lebanese medical and nursing colleges. “We view Lebanon as an economic partner with whom we can achieve the model of economic and industrial integration,” Wahba added. The Lebanese-Egyptian Business Council will take care of all expenses of travel, accommodation and training for those involved in the programs, said a statement by the Egyptian embassy in Lebanon. This MoU represents a “glimmer of hope” for Lebanese students and youth amid these hard circumstances, head of the university Amr Al-Adawi said, affirming that a university degree alone is insufficient for youth to be eligible for work after graduation. Egyptian ambassador to Lebanon Yasser Elwi also hailed the initiative, saying it reflects 60 years of Egyptian-Lebanese cooperation and aims to enable Lebanon to “restore the pioneering role that it deserves.” Search Keywords: Short link:

The World Tourism Organisation's (UNWTO) Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said the organisation is willing to cooperate with Egypt to ensure the optimal benefit from Egypt’s tourist destinations. The organisation wants to benefit from the Egyptian model to develop tourism through comprehensive institutional reform, the chief of the UN body told Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi during a meeting in Cairo on Monday. Pololikashvili, chief of the UNWTO, the United Nations agency responsible for promoting tourism, has affirmed the organisation's willingness to foster cooperation with Egypt and to help ensure the optimal use of Egypt’s tourist attractions, the Egyptian presidency stated. Egypt has resumed international flights on 1 July after three months of suspension due to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, adopting a host of strict preventive measures. Pololikashvili hailed Egypt's efforts to gradually restore foreign tourism. He highlighted Egypt’s "unprecedented support" of the tourism sector -- being a vital pillar of the Egyptian economy -- including the facilities and incentives provided for investors to enable them to deal with the pandemic with the least losses possible. El-Sisi welcomed Pololikashvili's visit, which is his first outside Europe since the spread of the pandemic. The president reviewed with the Georgian chief the strategy Egypt has adopted to revive tourism in accordance with precautionary measures set by the country’s tourism ministry in coordination with the relevant authorities. The Egyptian strategy aims at reviving tourism while ensuring the safety of tourists and workers in the sector, El-Sisi noted. He explained Egypt has taken structural measures to rejuvenate tourism, such as merging the ministries of tourism and antiquities during the latest cabinet reshuffle in late 2019. It also implemented a number of projects in the sector, such as Galala city in the northeastern governorate of Suez, New Alamein city in the northwestern governorate of Matrouh, and the Arts and Culture City in the New Administrative Capital, east Cairo. The projects also include Giza’s Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), the National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation in Old Cairo’s Fustat, and a “religious” project, named “The Greater Disclosure over the Land of Peace” in the Sinai Peninsula. The president hailed UNWTO’s continuous support of the tourism sector regionally and internationally and its efforts to revive tourism after it was hard-hit by the spread of the coronavirus. El-Sisi and Pololikashvili reviewed a number of prominent projects in Egypt, including various tourism attractions in new urban communities, as well as numerous museums and the project to develop historical Cairo, the Egyptian presidency spokesman said, highlighting the role of these projects in promoting Egypt's cultural and historical heritage. Pololikashvili said he saw some of the mega projects that have been implemented in line with the highest international standards in tourism. The meeting, which was attended by tourism and antiquities minister Khaled El-Anany, was followed by another with Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Sudan is redrawing its foreign policy, and Egypt is keeping a beady eye on the changes On Tuesday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo became the first high ranking US official to visit Khartoum in three decades. The visit comes against the backdrop of what Sudanese and American officials have recently qualified as serious progress towards removing Sudan from the US list of countries harbouring terrorism, a major foreign policy goal of the transitional government that last year took over from the military-Islamist regime of Omar Al-Bashir. “Great to be in Khartoum for meetings with the civilian-led transitional government,” Pompeo tweeted after arriving in Sudan. “The democratic transition underway is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the people of Sudan. Looking forward to discussing how to deepen the US-Sudan relationship.” In Khartoum Pompeo met with Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and the Chair of the Sudan Transitional Council Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan. In the words of one Sudanese diplomat, Pompeo’s visit is the clearest indication yet that Sudan is being welcomed back into the international fold. He added that the US is pressing Khartoum to move towards normalising relations with Israel as part of a package that would see it taken off the terrorism list. In a press statement issued following the talks between Pompeo and Hamdok, an official government spokesman said Hamdok had told the US top diplomat that such a decision could not be taken by a transitional government. According to a Khartoum-based political source, it is also likely that Hamdok told the US secretary of state that any decision to normalise relations with Israel would place him in a difficult position with a number of political forces, not least the Freedom and Change Movement. “It will happen sooner or later. The entire Arab world is, after all, inching towards normalisation with Israel. But the situation in Sudan is complex, and the decision has to be taken at the right moment if it is to serve our interests,” says the Sudanese diplomat. Two weeks ago the US administration hailed the announcement of normalising relations between Israel and the UAE. Top US officials, including President Donald Trump and his son-in-law and aide Jared Kushner, insisted at the time that other Arab states were poised to do the same within a matter of weeks. The Sudanese diplomat said Khartoum is aware that Trump wants to score as many political victories for Israel as possible to secure maximum support from the Jewish lobby in the US ahead of the presidential elections in November. According to a Washington-based diplomatic source, Khartoum, like a number of other Arab capitals that remain hesitant about going public with their normalisation plans, has agreed in principle to attend the meeting US and Bahrain are working on holding next month, possibly in Manama, so Israeli and Arab officials can explore different avenues towards normalisation. This meeting, “if it finally happens, will be attended by at least 10 Arab states,” including Egypt, Jordan and the UAE, the three Arab countries that currently have diplomatic relations with Israel. Attendance may well be the most Khartoum can offer at the moment, according to the Sudanese diplomat. Earlier this week the spokesman for the Sudanese Foreign Ministry lost his job after saying normalisation with Israel was around the corner. He added that Sudan was the most important country in the Arab world for Israel to have diplomatic relations with, “even more important than Egypt, despite Egypt’s obvious significance.” Egypt, according to officials, is “all for” encouraging Sudan to move towards normalising ties with Israel. They say that over the last 12 months several senior Egyptian officials have raised the matter with their Sudanese counterparts. Cairo, according to the same sources, likes to take credit, along with Israel and the US, for having helped persuade Sudan to allow Israeli flights to use its airspace. “Egypt is actually hoping to create a strategic partnership with Sudan that has a bilateral element but also allows for wider avenues for cooperation with other countries, including Nile Basin states,” one Egyptian official said. He added that Sudan had “shown interest but has still to commit”. Cairo has worked hard to secure closer coordination with Sudan on managing negotiations with Ethiopia over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile. It is still working to consolidate the coordination, with varied degrees of success. According to a Cairo-based European diplomat, Egypt is not always notified by Khartoum about its communications with Addis Ababa. Speaking on Tuesday, the diplomat said Cairo was still waiting to hear from Hamdok about the outcome of his talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who visited the Sudanese capital earlier the same day to discuss the stalled three-way negotiations on GERD that are being sponsored by South Africa, the current chair of the African Union. According to another Egyptian official, Cairo understands that Sudan is unwilling to close the door on any potential regional or international partner that can help it make progress after the economic devastation wreaked over the decades by Al-Bashir. Earlier this month, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli visited Khartoum with a large ministerial delegation in a bid to explore avenues for bilateral cooperation, and the Egyptian ministries of health, higher education and transport are engaged in talks with their Sudanese counterparts to cement agreements mooted in the Madbouli-Hamdok talks. Some are proving elusive. It is taking longer than expected to finalise details of the planned reopening of the Khartoum branch of Cairo University. Established in the mid-1950s, the branch closed 25 years ago following political tensions between Cairo and Khartoum. Egyptian officials say they understand the reasons behind the hesitation of the Sudanese, and it is only to be expected that the different components of Sudan’s transitional government should differ over the details of foreign policy. Meanwhile, Egypt has been working on consolidating its relations with South Sudan. Cairo, officials say, is exploring the possibility of establishing a strategic partnership with Juba as well as Khartoum. This, they insist, is not an attempt to pressure Khartoum to keep on the same page as Cairo when it comes to key Egyptian interests, but an effort to manage those interests in the incredibly sensitive south. *A version of this article appears in print in the 27 August, 2020 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

He added that Sudan had “shown interest but has still to commit”. Cairo has worked hard to secure closer coordination with Sudan on managing negotiations with Ethiopia over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile. It is still working to consolidate the coordination, with varied degrees of success. According to a Cairo-based European diplomat, Egypt is not always notified by Khartoum about its communications with Addis Ababa. Speaking on Tuesday, the diplomat said Cairo was still waiting to hear from Hamdok about the outcome of his talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who visited the Sudanese capital earlier the same day to discuss the stalled three-way negotiations on GERD that are being sponsored by South Africa, the current chair of the African Union. According to another Egyptian official, Cairo understands that Sudan is unwilling to close the door on any potential regional or international partner that can help it make progress after the economic devastation wreaked over the decades by Al-Bashir. Earlier this month, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli visited Khartoum with a large ministerial delegation in a bid to explore avenues for bilateral cooperation, and the Egyptian ministries of health, higher education and transport are engaged in talks with their Sudanese counterparts to cement agreements mooted in the Madbouli-Hamdok talks. Some are proving elusive. It is taking longer than expected to finalise details of the planned reopening of the Khartoum branch of Cairo University. Established in the mid-1950s, the branch closed 25 years ago following political tensions between Cairo and Khartoum. Egyptian officials say they understand the reasons behind the hesitation of the Sudanese, and it is only to be expected that the different components of Sudan’s transitional government should differ over the details of foreign policy. Meanwhile, Egypt has been working on consolidating its relations with South Sudan. Cairo, officials say, is exploring the possibility of establishing a strategic partnership with Juba as well as Khartoum. This, they insist, is not an attempt to pressure Khartoum to keep on the same page as Cairo when it comes to key Egyptian interests, but an effort to manage those interests in the incredibly sensitive south. *A version of this article appears in print in the 27 August, 2020 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

The Egyptian Association of Graduates of Russian and Soviet Universities has congratulated Russia’s ambassador to Egypt, Georgy Borisenko, on the 77th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries on 26 August, 1943. “The congratulations are directed to ourselves and to our Russian friends, who have proven throughout modern history that they are the most loyal friends of the Egyptian people,” said association president Sherif Gad said. “In cooperation with the Soviet Union, about 100 projects were built, which are the most important infrastructure for the Egyptian economy, above all the Aswan High Dam,” he added. Gad said that the depth of bilateral relations is evident in the complete understanding between the two country’s leaderships and the great congruence in international positions shared by the two countries, and by the fact that joint cooperation continues in the construction of major projects such as the El Dabaa nuclear power plant and the Russian industrial zone in the Suez Canal region. Fathy Toughan, secretary-general of the association, said that the Egyptian people regard Russia as the country’s main partner in development and that they are looking forward to more achievements through the agenda of the new ambassador. Members of the association welcomed the decision of leadership in the two countries to transfer the activities of the Egypt-Russia Cultural Year 2020 to 2021 so that “we can take advantage of this historic and unprecedented event in the history of bilateral relations between the two countries,” said Toughan.

The last time Abe met with Sisi was in August last year on the sidelines of the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development Following Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s recent resignation announcement, Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi issued a statement on Facebook on Saturday praising Abe as a “patriotic statesman who gave much to his country.” Abe, who served for around eight years as Japan’s prime minister and president of the Liberal Democratic Party, announced his resignation on Friday over a resurgence of his ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease from which he has suffered for many years. The Egyptian president wished Abe a speedy recovery and praised him for being “a friend and a supporting partner to Egypt who made great contributions in enhancing cooperation and friendship between Egypt and Japan.” Abe, 65, became Japan’s longest serving prime minister last year, ruling since 2012. This is not the first time Abe has resigned over health issues. In 2007, after only one year in office, he resigned and handed the reigns over to chief cabinet secretary Yasuo Fukuda. The last time Abe met with El-Sisi was in August last year on the sidelines of the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD). The two sides discussed enhancing cooperation in the fields of basic education, higher education, culture, technology, energy and transport. They also discussed the construction of the Grand Egyptian Museum in northern Egypt’s Giza governorate, as well as encouraging more Japanese companies to invest in Egypt. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Czechs flocked to the National Museum in Prague on Monday to enjoy watching Egypt's pharaonic treasures displayed for the first time at an exhibition dubbed "Sun Kings,” held to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Czech archaeological mission in Egypt. The exhibition was inaugurated by Egyptian Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Khaled el-Anani and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš on Sunday, in a ceremony attended by 500 Czech figures including entrepreneurs and statesmen. The exhibition, scheduled to last until February 2021, features 90 artifacts unearthed by the Czech mission in the archaeological area of Abu Sir. The collection includes the head of a statue of King "Ra-Nefer-F", and a group of statues from the Old Kingdom, including one of a writer, statues of senior statesmen and officials, and a group of Canopic vessels, in addition to ten Ushabti statues of faience. Babiš hailed the Egyptian government for its cooperation in organizing the exhibition in light of the current circumstances and the coronavirus pandemic. "This exhibition is the first to display Egyptian antiquities in Prague and the largest ever on Ancient Egypt," he said. For his part, Anani said "the preparations for this exhibition, which began about five years ago, offers visitors a small glimpse about the Egyptian civilization, which would encourage them to visit Egypt to see more and enjoy the amazing Egyptian beaches." The exhibition shed lights on the fifth dynasty (2435-2306 BC) and its kings known as "Sun Kings", who built their pyramids and temples in Abu Sir, southern Giza. The kings include Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre, and Nyuserre. And because the pyramids were built of mudbrick, they collapsed with time, and the region has been known as "the region of forgotten pyramids." Dr. Miroslav Bárta, vice president of Charles University, said "the exhibition is an opportunity to recall the pyramid construction age, by displaying the artifacts the Czech mission excavated in Abu Sir. It is a dream that came true." Anani said "the artifacts displayed at the exhibition never left Egypt before, and they are set to be featured in the Grand Egyptian Museum after they return from Prague." He expected the Prague exhibition to host up to 300,000 visitors, and hailed the use of the video and hologram to provide more information about the artifacts. During the exhibition, visitors can watch movies on Kings Sahure and Nyuserre and their tombs.

Babiš hailed the Egyptian government for its cooperation in organizing the exhibition in light of the current circumstances and the coronavirus pandemic. "This exhibition is the first to display Egyptian antiquities in Prague and the largest ever on Ancient Egypt," he said. For his part, Anani said "the preparations for this exhibition, which began about five years ago, offers visitors a small glimpse about the Egyptian civilization, which would encourage them to visit Egypt to see more and enjoy the amazing Egyptian beaches." The exhibition shed lights on the fifth dynasty (2435-2306 BC) and its kings known as "Sun Kings", who built their pyramids and temples in Abu Sir, southern Giza. The kings include Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre, and Nyuserre. And because the pyramids were built of mudbrick, they collapsed with time, and the region has been known as "the region of forgotten pyramids." Dr. Miroslav Bárta, vice president of Charles University, said "the exhibition is an opportunity to recall the pyramid construction age, by displaying the artifacts the Czech mission excavated in Abu Sir. It is a dream that came true." Anani said "the artifacts displayed at the exhibition never left Egypt before, and they are set to be featured in the Grand Egyptian Museum after they return from Prague." He expected the Prague exhibition to host up to 300,000 visitors, and hailed the use of the video and hologram to provide more information about the artifacts. During the exhibition, visitors can watch movies on Kings Sahure and Nyuserre and their tombs.

Egyptian Deputy Foreign Minister for European Affairs Badr Abdel Aati met with Polish officials in Warsaw on Friday to discuss potential investment opportunities in Egypt for the EU country. Abdel Aati told Polish officials, including the deputy foreign ministry for Africa and the Middle East, that Egypt is keen to enhance cooperation with Poland in several fields, including modern technology, information technology, and artificial intelligence. Egyptian Ambassador to Poland Hossam El-Qawish also attended the meeting, according to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry. Abdel Aati affirmed the importance of resuming discussions between the two countries to accomplish a cooperation initiative and to ink an MoU between the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) and Poland's Katowice Special Economic Zone (KSEZ), with the aim of establishing a Polish industrial zone in Egypt. Egypt has been pushing forward with efforts to attract investors to the Suez Canal Economic Zone in recent years, highlighting the available opportunities for foreign corporations. The Polish zone will provide ways to create investment opportunities for Polish companies in the Egyptian market, as well as tapping into the privileges, guarantees and exemptions the Egyptian government awards to foreign investors, Abdel Aati said. Adel Aati also touched upon the significance of the cooperation between Egypt and the Visegrad Group of countries, which includes Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. He urged the establishment of an industrial zone for the group's countries in the SCZone, as well as in Egypt’s industrial, investment and free zones, in order to consolidate bilateral cooperation. The meeting also covered the latest developments concerning the long-running dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which is being built in Ethiopia on the Blue Nile, as well as updates on the situations in Libya and Syria, and on the Palestinian cause.

CAIRO: With the escalation of tension between Egypt and Turkey, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry discussed with his Emirati counterpart Abdullah bin Zayed the latest developments in the Eastern Mediterranean. The two sides also discussed relations between their countries and ways to enhance joint cooperation in all fields, according to UAE News Agency WAM. This coincides with Greece’s denial of holding talks with Turkey, mediated by NATO, with the aim of easing tensions between the two parties due to disputes over maritime borders and gas exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey is provoking Greece — which has drawn its maritime borders with Egypt in accordance with recognized international agreements — by exploring gas in the Eastern Mediterranean on its own, a move that was met with great international condemnation. “There are deep, brotherly relations between the UAE and the Arab Republic of Egypt and a continuous keenness to strengthen each other and develop areas of joint cooperation,” bin Zayed said. Both countries share similar visions with regard to the Eastern Mediterranean, Libya, and a number of other issues. HIGH LIGHT Turkey is provoking Greece — which has drawn its maritime borders with Egypt in accordance with recognized international agreements — by exploring gas in the Eastern Mediterranean on its own, a move that was met with great international condemnation. Bin Zayed confirmed his country’s rejection of any measures threatening stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Last month, Egypt and Greece signed an agreement to demarcate the maritime borders between them, which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described as worthless. Egypt responded by expressing its astonishment at the Turkish position, explaining that it was surprising that such statements and allegations should be issued by a party that did not know the agreement and its details. Two days ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Athens and Ankara to de-escalate tension in the Eastern Mediterranean around the maritime borders and energy reserves in the region, after strong statements from Turkey.

Japan is keen to support Egypt in its green energy agenda, as well as digital transition, which is key to combatting the impacts and spread of coronavirus Egypt’s Ministry of International Cooperation, together with representatives of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Japanese Embassy in Cairo, organised a virtual high-level policy dialogue to deepen levels of cooperation for 2021/2022, where development projects will be implemented across several sectors including health, agriculture, aviation, electricity, transportation, and the environment, alongside the promotion of knowledge exchange in science and technology. Several representatives of Japanese institutions as well as 41 representatives from a number of Egyptian ministries attended the event. During the meeting, Assistant Minister of International Cooperation for Planning and Strategic Studies Randa Hamzeh, on behalf of the Minister of International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat, presented the ministry’s principles on economic diplomacy that aim at strengthening "Global Partnerships for Effective Development.” Head of the Asian Cooperation Sector at the Ministry of International Cooperation Mona Ahmed highlighted the support provided by the Japanese government to Egypt amid the Covid-19 pandemic in many development projects across several sectors, the most important of which are energy, transportation, health and education, adding that both countries are looking forward to strengthening cooperation during the coming period in line with efforts to achieve the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. For his part, Economic Adviser to the Japanese Embassy Miyamoto Sokago said that cooperation and strategic partnership between the two countries are expected to experience a new phase, aiming to prioritise and accelerate a clean energy transition for Egypt, as well as contain the impacts of the Covid-19 virus. Head of the JICA office in Cairo Yoshifumi Omura reviewed success stories as a result of joint cooperation between the two countries, saying that all projects aim to focus on three pillars, ‘People at the Core’, ‘Projects in Action’ and ‘Purpose as the Driver’, in order to ensure sustainable development. Japan has invested in 12 projects in Egypt worth $2 billion, including the Egyptian Japanese University of Science, the Abu Rish University Hospital project, the Japanese schools project, and the renewable energy project, which is the first independent power producer project in the country and that aims to contribute to the Egyptian government’s strategy to supply 20 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2022. To support a post-Covid-19 recovery, Japan’s International Cooperation Agency aims to focus on expanding renewable energy, the maintenance and improvement of the transmission and distribution grid, promoting off-grid power supply, building a hydrogen energy-based society and improving facilities for existing thermal power plants. The agency further aims to push for Egypt’s digital transition through the support and investment of Japanese companies to increase automation and remote work, which is essential in helping to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus. In regards to health, over $18.5 million in grants were dedicated to support the export of Japanese medical equipment as well as technical assistance to boost Egypt’s health sector and its capacity to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Japan has been supporting Egypt’s development in various sectors since 1954, with $1.3 billion of aid overall, and $6.8 billion in loans for the energy, health, transport, tourism and education sectors.

El-Qabbaj and Reed discussed cooperation in social protection, economic empowerment, crises and relief and efforts to combat all forms of violence against women and support centres hosting battered women. Egypt’s Social Solidarity Minister Nevin El-Qabbaj and USAID’s new Egypt director Leslie Reed met virtually on Tuesday for a discussion that covered the new NGO law and cooperation in various fields. The pair discussed cooperation in response to the implications of the coronavirus pandemic, an official statement from the ministry said, as well as on social protection, economic empowerment, crises and relief, efforts to combat all forms of violence against women, and support centres that host abused women. El-Qabbaj added that the ministry is close to issuing the executive regulations on the law, which regulates civil society organisations operating in Egypt, noting that these regulations were created in partnership with community leaders, civil society organisations, MPs, as well as specialised experts and knowledgeable figures. Reed hailed Egypt’s efforts in the field of social protection, adding that the amended NGO law constitutes a significant step to boost social participation, the statement read. The US aid agency representative also lauded the social solidarity ministry’s efforts around issues that affect the lives of marginalised groups of people. The House of Representatives passed an amended NGO law in July 2019, after the existing version of the law was criticised for imposing steep restrictions on the work of tens of thousands of civil society organisations in the country. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly formed a committee to oversee the amendment of the original NGO law in 2018, after President Abdel-Fattah El asked for revisions to be made.

El-Qabbaj added that the ministry is close to issuing the executive regulations on the law, which regulates civil society organisations operating in Egypt, noting that these regulations were created in partnership with community leaders, civil society organisations, MPs, as well as specialised experts and knowledgeable figures. Reed hailed Egypt’s efforts in the field of social protection, adding that the amended NGO law constitutes a significant step to boost social participation, the statement read. The US aid agency representative also lauded the social solidarity ministry’s efforts around issues that affect the lives of marginalised groups of people. The House of Representatives passed an amended NGO law in July 2019, after the existing version of the law was criticised for imposing steep restrictions on the work of tens of thousands of civil society organisations in the country. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly formed a committee to oversee the amendment of the original NGO law in 2018, after President Abdel-Fattah El asked for revisions to be made.

News article:
Official international data reveals that Israel is the world's leading country with regards to the spread of the coronavirus, which is proliferating significantly in certain neighbourhoods in Jerusalem. The weekly report from the US Johns Hopkins University on the spread of the coronavirus pandemic ranked Israel the first in the world in terms of the number of new people infected with the virus when compared to the country's population. The new infection rate in Israel reached 199.3 per million citizens every day last week. Coronavirus infections recorded unprecedented results so far, as 3,074 cases were detected in one day, including 700 among Palestinian Arab citizens alone, out of 33,000 tests carried out today. Thus, the infection rate among those who underwent a test is 9.4 per cent, which may be considered as peak levels. The Israeli Ministerial Committee in charge of coronavirus affairs decided to impose a complete closure as of Monday on around thirty towns classified as "red" due to the high number of cases. This comes in the wake of recording the highest rate of infections since the announcement of the outbreak of the virus in the country last March. In fact, the official report published by the Israeli Ministry of Health revealed today a new record number of daily infections, totalling 3,150 cases. The committee stated that the restrictions imposed on cities classified as "red" are as follows: closing the educational institutions, closing the commercial enterprises apart from essential places such as clinics, pharmacies and bakeries, restrictions on the movement of citizens besides the restriction of movement at a distance of 500 metres from the place of residence in areas that are largely affected by the pandemic. Read: Israel announces partial national lockdown after coronavirus surge Head of the Special Authority to Combat Coronavirus in the Arab Community within the 48 territories Ayman Saif announced: "The ongoing debate within the Ministerial Committee for Coronavirus Affairs is heading towards imposing partial closures and restrictions on the 34 red towns, in addition to imposing a complete closure on four of these towns, including preventing entry and exit." Saif stressed that: "These restrictions and night closures are the result of serious recklessness and failure to adhere to the Ministry of Health's instructions, and therefore they aim to limit the organisation of wedding parties, which are the first source of infection in the red-listed towns." There is currently a state of chaos and turmoil in Israel due to the widespread infection during the second wave of the virus. Ministers of the ultra-Orthodox Jews threaten to withdraw from the government if restrictions are imposed on their people during the Jewish holidays in the middle of this month, due to their cities, in addition to Arab cities, being at the top of the list of red cities. Controversy is growing in Israel over who bears responsibility for the failure and how to deal with coronavirus through complete closure or selective localisation, amid accusations against the police for failure to implement the instructions. The organisation of weddings and large meetings is considered to be one of the causes of the outbreak of the pandemic. This instability runs concurrently in the midst of a stifling economic crisis, manifested by a million unemployed persons in Israel. Social media forums witnessed widespread criticism for the revival of weddings and the participation of a number of heads of local governments, stating that this gives a bad example to the rest of the Arab public.

News article:
Official international data reveals that Israel is the world's leading country with regards to the spread of the coronavirus, which is proliferating significantly in certain neighbourhoods in Jerusalem. The weekly report from the US Johns Hopkins University on the spread of the coronavirus pandemic ranked Israel the first in the world in terms of the number of new people infected with the virus when compared to the country's population. The new infection rate in Israel reached 199.3 per million citizens every day last week. Coronavirus infections recorded unprecedented results so far, as 3,074 cases were detected in one day, including 700 among Palestinian Arab citizens alone, out of 33,000 tests carried out today. Thus, the infection rate among those who underwent a test is 9.4 per cent, which may be considered as peak levels. The Israeli Ministerial Committee in charge of coronavirus affairs decided to impose a complete closure as of Monday on around thirty towns classified as "red" due to the high number of cases. This comes in the wake of recording the highest rate of infections since the announcement of the outbreak of the virus in the country last March. In fact, the official report published by the Israeli Ministry of Health revealed today a new record number of daily infections, totalling 3,150 cases. The committee stated that the restrictions imposed on cities classified as "red" are as follows: closing the educational institutions, closing the commercial enterprises apart from essential places such as clinics, pharmacies and bakeries, restrictions on the movement of citizens besides the restriction of movement at a distance of 500 metres from the place of residence in areas that are largely affected by the pandemic. Read: Israel announces partial national lockdown after coronavirus surge Head of the Special Authority to Combat Coronavirus in the Arab Community within the 48 territories Ayman Saif announced: "The ongoing debate within the Ministerial Committee for Coronavirus Affairs is heading towards imposing partial closures and restrictions on the 34 red towns, in addition to imposing a complete closure on four of these towns, including preventing entry and exit." Saif stressed that: "These restrictions and night closures are the result of serious recklessness and failure to adhere to the Ministry of Health's instructions, and therefore they aim to limit the organisation of wedding parties, which are the first source of infection in the red-listed towns." There is currently a state of chaos and turmoil in Israel due to the widespread infection during the second wave of the virus. Ministers of the ultra-Orthodox Jews threaten to withdraw from the government if restrictions are imposed on their people during the Jewish holidays in the middle of this month, due to their cities, in addition to Arab cities, being at the top of the list of red cities. Controversy is growing in Israel over who bears responsibility for the failure and how to deal with coronavirus through complete closure or selective localisation, amid accusations against the police for failure to implement the instructions. The organisation of weddings and large meetings is considered to be one of the causes of the outbreak of the pandemic. This instability runs concurrently in the midst of a stifling economic crisis, manifested by a million unemployed persons in Israel. Social media forums witnessed widespread criticism for the revival of weddings and the participation of a number of heads of local governments, stating that this gives a bad example to the rest of the Arab public.

News article:
Abu Dhabi: The number of COVID-19 infections has spiked again in some Arab countries after a recent relative decline, amid fears of a second wave of the virus that may be more dangerous than the first. Morocco Morocco has witnessed an upsurge in the number of coronavirus infections in recent weeks, setting a record Sunday of 2,234 infections, 42 per cent of which occurred in Casablanca. The country has taken a package of preventive measures against the killer bug for a forthnight. In a bid to stem the spread of the virus, the Moroccan government decided to close checkpoints of the capital, and subject movement to and from it to an exceptional permit granted by the authorities. The Moroccan government also decided to close all educational institutions and adopt distance education as an alternative system. The measures also included the closure of markets, shops and restaurants at night, and a ban on night movement from 10pm until 5am. Tunisia Tunisia recorded 265 new infections, bringing the tally as of Monday, to 5,041. The Tunisian Ministry of Health says that since the re-opening of the country’s borders on June 27, it has recorded 3,840 infections, including 580 imported cases. The kindergarten sector in Tunisia has witnessed the reluctance of many parents to register their children for fear of infection with the coronavirus, which has increased its spread in the country since August 18. Egypt In Egypt, the Ministry of Health Sunday recorded 19 new deaths from COVID-19, in addition to 151 infections. According to official statistics, the coronavirus has killed about 5,530 people in Egypt, while it infected 99,863 as of Sunday. A two-day run-off in the Senate elections starts Tuesday. The National Elections Authority in Egypt decided in late August to refer about 54 million voters to the Public Prosecution for failing to vote in the first round of the Senate elections. Jordan Authorities in Jordan have decided to compel workers in the private sector to use the “AMAN” app, after requiring their counterparts in the public sector to use the app on August 11. Authorities say the app helps limit the spread of the virus by tracking its users’ movements. On Sunday, the Hashemite Kingdom recorded 58 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections to 2,411. It is scheduled to hold legislative elections in the Kingdom on November 10. West Bank and Gaza Strip The Ministry of Health in the West Bank and Gaza Strip recorded three deaths and 789 new cases of coronavirus on Monday. This brings the total number of deaths in the West Bank and Gaza to 205 cases, while the total number of infections reached 34,801. The World Health Organisation said that the rise in the coronavirus infection curve in Gaza requires a change in the policies used to combat the virus. The Gaza Strip has been in a state of emergency and curfew for fourteen days, as part of the measures taken by the local authorities in an attempt to contain the virus. In a related development, the Supreme Islamic Authority in Jerusalem warned against Israel taking advantage of the corona crisis to close the Al Aqsa Mosque. The head of the authority and the preacher of the mosque, Ikrimah Sabri, called on the worshipers to adhere to preventive measures to prevent the spread of the virus during prayers in the mosque. Israeli media have reported postponing a session scheduled for Sunday to discuss closing the Al Aqsa Mosque as a preventive measure to limit the spread of the virus. On Monday, Israel recorded 2,157 new cases of coronavirus, according to the Ministry of Health. The Israeli government decided to impose a partial closure in 40 of the areas with high rates of infections, instead of a complete lockdown. Yemen In Yemen, the Supreme National Committee to Confront the Coronavirus announced the registration of four new cases on Monday. The Yemeni Saba News Agency quoted National Committee officials as saying that the total number of infections reached 1987, while the number of deaths reached 572 cases. Reports say that the current state of war in Yemen greatly affects the detection and registration of infections, amid fears that the country will not be able to cope with the spread of the virus in light of the ongoing political conflicts on its soil. 27 million infections around the world The number of people infected with the coronavirus around the world has exceeded 27 million, according to statistics published by Johns Hopkins University of America. According to the statistics of the World Health Organisation Regional Office in the Eastern Mediterranean, the number of cumulative confirmed cases of the virus in the region, which includes the Arab countries, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, has exceeded 2.1 million cases, of which 53,082 people died as of Monday. The World Health Organisation has said it does not expect that an effective vaccine will be widely available before mid-2021.

A prominent Kentucky infectious disease specialist who was hailed by the governor as a “front line hero” has died after a nearly four-month battle against COVID-19. Dr. Rebecca Shadowen, who tested positive for the virus on May 13, died on Friday night, Med Center Health in Bowling Green says. Gov. Andy Beshear tweeted Saturday that he was “heartbroken” to hear of her death and urged people to follow her advice and “wear a mask in her honor.” Connie Smith, president and CEO of Med Center Health, said Shadowen “will forever be remembered as a nationally recognized expert who provided the very best care for our patients and community. She was a dear friend to many.” Before contracting the virus, Shadowen led Med Center Health’s work in National Institute of Health trials of patients’ treatment for the virus, according to media reports. Shadowen had said she believed she contracted the virus after an elderly family member received care at home from an infected caregiver. “COVID-19 does not discriminate in its ability to penetrate our homes and communities,” Shadowen said when announcing in the spring that she had tested positive for the virus. While battling the virus, she surprised members of the Bowling Green–Warren County Coronavirus Workgroup by joining in a conference call, telling the group: “It’s a great day to be alive.” She stressed the importance of wearing a mask in public. In his social media tribute Saturday, Beshear referred to Shadowen as a “front line hero who worked tirelessly to protect the lives of others.” — AP

News article:
The number of daily coronavirus infections around the world reached a record high, eight months after the globe first learned about the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 307,930 new cases Sunday, the highest daily figure in its database. In addition, the group expects a rise in the daily number of deaths in October and November in European countries. Cases in Europe have risen sharply in recent weeks, especially in Spain and France. More than 51,000 new cases were reported on Friday alone in the 55 countries monitored by WHO Europe, which is more than the highest peak in April, according to the head of that branch. Britain, Austria and the Czech Republic were among the countries reporting surges, with new cases in the U.K. reaching more than 3,000 in 24 hours for the second day in a row on Saturday. Berlin’s top health official has expressed concern about the rising number of coronavirus infections in Germany, particularly among young people. Dilek Kalayci told public broadcaster RBB that experience showed young people could easily become “super spreaders” resulting in older, more vulnerable people becoming sick with COVID-19 too. Germany's disease control center on Monday reported 927 new cases across the country in the past day. "It's going to get tougher. In October, November, we are going to see more mortality," WHO Europe Director Hans Kluge said. Even though the continent is experiencing a surge of cases, the number of deaths has remained relatively stable. The resurgence, however, is expected to lead to an increase in daily fatalities, the WHO said. "It's a moment where countries don't want to hear this bad news, and I understand," Kluge said, stressing that he wanted to send the "positive message" that the pandemic "is going to finish, at one moment or another." More than 28.9 million people around the world have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and more than 922,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has the most deaths with 193,705, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. India continues to report the most daily new infections of the coronavirus in the world and its daily COVID-19 deaths to remain above 1,000. India’s Health Ministry reported a single-day spike of 92,071 confirmed coronavirus cases Monday and another 1,136 fatalities. The nation has now reported more than 4.8 million infections and more than 79,700 deaths since the pandemic began. In other parts of the world, Israel announced a three-week nationwide lockdown in a bid to quell soaring coronavirus cases, which have passed 4,000 per day. The lockdown will begin on Friday, just hours before the start of the Jewish New Year and the High Holidays. Israel has seen a spike in cases over recent weeks that more tempered measures failed to bring down. It now has one of the world’s worst outbreaks, adjusted for population. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conceded the new lockdown would exact a "difficult price" on Israelis and the economy but that the goal was "to stop the increase” in cases. Israel earned praise earlier this year for its initial handling of the coronavirus domestically, moving quickly to seal the country’s borders and appearing to bring the outbreak under control. It has since been criticized for opening businesses and schools too quickly and allowing the virus to spread once again. Protests against lockdowns Many nations have seen backlash and protests against lockdowns. In Australia on Sunday, police arrested dozens at an anti-lockdown rally in Melbourne after crowds defied stay-at-home orders. That rally followed demonstrations in Germany and Poland on Saturday, which were attended by anti-vaccine campaigners, conspiracy theorists and far-right activists. Such rallies have also been organized frequently in the United States, the hardest-hit nation in the world. President Donald Trump is under pressure over his handling of the outbreak and was slammed for holding big rallies over the weekend, including an indoor event on Sunday.

News article:
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday responded to reports that several White House staff members have tested positive for coronavirus. Trump told reporters at the White House he learned the previous night that one staff member tested positive for coronavirus. “It was one person. Not a person I was associated with,” he added. Earlier, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows refused to answer questions about the positive test results. “I don’t comment on any health-related issues as it relates to the White House ever,” Meadows told Globo News reporter Raquel Krahenbuhl. News of the positive tests at the White House comes a day after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and Bahrain Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani gathered at the White House to sign the Abraham Accords, the agreement to establish peace between the Jewish State and two of the Arab Gulf states. Hundreds of people attended the signing ceremony. In addition, dozens of anti-Israel protesters gathered outside the White House to protest the signing of the peace treaty.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday responded to reports that several White House staff members have tested positive for coronavirus. Trump told reporters at the White House he learned the previous night that one staff member tested positive for coronavirus. “It was one person. Not a person I was associated with,” he added. Earlier, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows refused to answer questions about the positive test results. “I don’t comment on any health-related issues as it relates to the White House ever,” Meadows told Globo News reporter Raquel Krahenbuhl. News of the positive tests at the White House comes a day after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and Bahrain Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani gathered at the White House to sign the Abraham Accords, the agreement to establish peace between the Jewish State and two of the Arab Gulf states. Hundreds of people attended the signing ceremony. In addition, dozens of anti-Israel protesters gathered outside the White House to protest the signing of the peace treaty.

News article:
By Marcy Oster September 23, 2020 (JTA) — As Israel racked up a record nearly 7,000 new coronavirus cases in one day, the government met to consider tightening restrictions, including banning synagogue prayer and public protests. The coronavirus cabinet met Tuesday for several hours but failed to make any decisions about further restrictions to stop the spread of the deadly virus. The cabinet began meeting again on Wednesday afternoon with plans to approve new restrictions by the end of the day. Among the decisions being weighed are the complete closure of synagogues and a ban on outdoor services, though it is not clear if it would apply also to Yom Kippur, the Kan public broadcaster reported. Also under consideration is the halting or limiting of protests in front of the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem. Other restrictions could include limiting employees in private businesses to 50% and closing Ben Gurion Airport. Several rabbinic leaders called for the closure of synagogues, even for Yom Kippur, to halt the spread of the virus, including Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau and Rabbi David Yosef, the son of former Shas party leader and former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. Israel conducted more than 61,000 coronavirus tests on Tuesday, with the rate of those testing positive at a high of 11.3%. On the same day, the country passed a milestone of 200,000 cases of the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Some 634 people were listed in serious condition, including 171 on respirators. The so-called coronavirus czar, Dr. Ronni Gamzu, has said that 800 serious patients is the upper limit that hospitals can handle, a number that Israel is expected to pass by the end of the week. The Health Ministry on Wednesday called on hospitals to hire paramedics and more medical staff to meet the demands. The post Israel hits daily record of nearly 7,000 new coronavirus cases as government debates tighter restrictions appeared first on Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

News article:
The Health Ministry said Thursday morning that 6,808 new virus cases were diagnosed a day earlier, after ministers agreed in a late-night vote to drastically tighten the national lockdown. It was the second day in a row that the number of new cases neared 7,000. The ministry said that a notably high 12.9 percent of the tests that came back Wednesday were positive. There were 54,364 tests carried out. The total number of cases since the start of the pandemic stood at 206,332 with 1,335 deaths. Of the 56,901 active cases, 667 are in serious condition, 164 of them on ventilators, the ministry said. Another 248 are in moderate condition, with the rest displaying mild or no symptoms. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The announcement came after ministers voted to dramatically tighten the country’s existing coronavirus lockdown amid fears that the infection rate is spiraling out of control. Beginning Friday at 2 p.m., nearly all businesses will be closed, with the exception of specific companies and factories designated as “vital” by the Defense Ministry’s National Emergency Authority. The decision, drafted Wednesday by the coronavirus cabinet and approved by the full cabinet on Thursday morning, exempted supermarkets and pharmacies from the closure, and allowed restaurants to work on a home delivery basis only. Yom Kippur prayers that begin Sunday will take place almost entirely outdoors, with groups of up to 10 worshipers permitted to pray inside synagogues, the decision said. The shutdown will also cover the entirety of the Sukkot holiday. Advertisement The holiday season is part of the reason the government was imposing the lockdown now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday. Since most Israelis in any case don’t work during the holidays, the economic damage of the shutdown would be reduced as fewer workdays will be lost. Nearly all public transportation will be closed, as will the last educational institutions still open — mainly special education programs and private preschools. Israelis won’t be allowed to travel more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. Police will be deployed on highways and at the entrances to cities and towns to ensure Israelis don’t attempt to travel during the lockdown. The cabinet decision said officials from the Finance Ministry, Prime Minister’s Office and National Security Council will meet to set ground rules for which government agencies will close, which ones will remain operational, and at what capacities. The cabinet is also reportedly considering closing Ben Gurion Airport to outgoing flights, but the decision was not included in Wednesday’s cabinet vote. The new rules come after a day of acrimonious debates in the cabinet over whether to allow anti-Netanyahu protests during the lockdown, with the Blue and White party insisting a government could not order protests against it to disband. Ministers also argued over how much to restrict prayer gatherings, with Haredi parties Shas and United Torah Judaism pushing to leave synagogues open, even if new limits on numbers of worshipers are imposed. Advertisement Under a final compromise reached late Wednesday, synagogues will close beginning Friday, open in a limited capacity and with worshipers divided into small groups for the 25 hours of the Yom Kippur holiday, then close again on Monday night. A similar compromise was reached on protests, under which demonstrators may gather within a kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. In both cases, gatherings may include no more than 20 people at a time who must stay two meters apart. A special compromise was reached allowing for continued protests outside the Prime Minister’s Residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, where demonstrators have gathered regularly for months to call for Netanyahu’s resignation.

The Health Ministry added 59 deaths to the country’s coronavirus toll in the 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday evening, after two consecutive days that saw over 6,000 new confirmed infections. It was not immediately clear whether 59 people had died during the period, or whether some deaths had been added to the count retroactively, but it was the highest single-day rise in the figure since the start of the pandemic. There were 1,376 recorded coronavirus deaths as of Thursday evening, with 685 patients in serious condition, including 175 on ventilators. At the same time Wednesday, health ministry data had recorded 1,317 coronavirus deaths, making for a jump in 59 recorded deaths — though the ministry also claimed only seven people had died Thursday by the evening hours. A spokeswoman for the ministry could not immediately square the conflicting data, though she said the total figure of 1,376 deaths was accurate. Due to the country’s staggering infection rate, harsh lockdown measures are set to come into force on Friday at 2 p.m., and will see nearly all businesses closed, prayers and public protests severely curtailed, public transportation scaled back dramatically and Israelis ordered to remain close to home, with fewer exceptions than in the existing lockdown.

Health Ministry stats show that there are nearly 7,400 active coronavirus cases in Jerusalem alone, up over 700 just since Friday afternoon. It is the first time there have been 7,000 active cases in any one city. Two other cities also break active case milestones, with second-place Bnei Brak climbing above 4,000 and Ashdod above 3,000 for the first time. As of a mere three days ago, Israel only had one city with more than 3,000 cases, Jerusalem. Tel Aviv is the only other city with over 2,000 active cases.

The Health Ministry said Monday evening that 33 people died from COVID-19 over Yom Kippur, raising the national death toll to 1,499. There were 763 patients in serious condition, with 208 people on ventilators. Additionally there were 287 people in moderate condition. There were 3,426 new coronavirus infections confirmed Sunday, with 25,204 tests carried out. Testing levels, and therefore the number of new cases, were lower due to the eve of Yom Kippur. However, a notably high 14.2% of tests came back positive. Israel had a total of 233,118 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, with 66,639 active cases. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Health Ministry deputy director-general Itamar Grotto told Channel 12 news on Monday evening that he believed that the two weeks remaining in the national lockdown would not be enough to lower the numbers of patients to a manageable level, and that it would need to be extended. “I believe that if we take the right steps in the health system and the public keeps to the regulations, wears masks and maintains social distancing, working together we could be [where we need to be with infections levels] in a month,” Grotto said. The health official was responding to a report that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed the national lockdown would need to be extended. Advertisement The new figures from the Health Ministry and talk of a longer closure came as Haifa’s Rambam Medical Center was forced to call in extra medical staff during Yom Kippur as it struggled to cope with a surge of new patients, the hospital said in a statement on Monday evening. The medical center said that 24 new patients were hospitalized over the course of the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, in the new coronavirus ward opened in the facility’s underground parking lot. The hospital said it was now caring for 78 patients with COVID-19, with 41 of them in critical condition including 16 on ventilators. A new report by a military task force said the number of new confirmed cases per capita in Israel is the highest in the world. However, the country’s testing levels are particularly high, and there are some countries, like Brazil and Mexico, with far higher rates of positive test results. The report also found that the number of patients in serious condition has multiplied by 10 in three months and reflects “an authentic rise in morbidity.” AFP contributed to this report.

Israel’s coronavirus death toll passed 1,500 on Monday night, the latest Health ministry data showed, with over 500 new deaths recorded in some three weeks. The death toll stood at 1,507, with 19 fatalities recorded Monday. The latest grim numbers came as new diagnoses and seriously ill patients remained on the rise, as did the percentage of tests coming back positive — with the prime minister warning of a potential 1,500 serious cases by week’s end, and with officials fearing the national lockdown could be required to last weeks longer than originally planned. With the Jewish High Holiday of Yom Kippur over, police were preparing to step up enforcement considerably starting Tuesday, Channel 12 reported. This would include dozens of new checkpoints on highways between cities, with stringent checks of vehicles; increased inspection of at commerce centers and businesses and punitive action for those operating against health regulations; and heightened presence near synagogues, considered high-risk locations. “Where we see violations [of the rules], and we’ve seen more than a few violations this past week, we’ll hand out fines, too,” Chief Superintendent Roee Waldman, head of Police’s Investigations Department, told the network. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms On Monday night, as Yom Kippur ended, police responded to several incidents of ultra-Orthodox Israelis gathering in the dozens and hundreds in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, in violation of health regulations. Dr. Guy Choshen, head of the coronavirus department at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Medical Center, told Channel 12 Monday night the hospital was seeing an ever-increasing case-load, as both the number of serious cases and those requiring ventilation continued to grow, with a particularly evident rise in the past few days. “We see a rise in the number of those who come and are forced to fight to release patients to other facilities, to [coronavirus] hotels,” Choshen said. “We are really struggling to release in order to make space for the next patients coming in.” Advertisement In a statement released by his office on Monday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set out a numbered list of items to be discussed when the so-called coronavirus cabinet convenes on Wednesday, with the health system preparing to treat 1,500 gravely ill patients by Thursday, October 1 at the top of the list. The number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients stood at 772 Monday night, and it was not immediately clear why it was feared that number would double within two days. According to Channel 12 news, Netanyahu believes the national lockdown could be extended to last for around a month in an attempt to contain the surging outbreak. The coronavirus cabinet will also discuss setting goals and indicators for a gradual emergence from Israel’s second national lockdown, progress in vaccines and the purchase and use of rapid COVID-19 tests. Ministers will discuss the status of the country’s enforcement of the regulations, as well as increasing fines and sanctions for those found violating restrictions. The cabinet will also discuss the use of digital tools to combat the pandemic, as well as a focused campaign on the wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. Advertisement Also in the works are talks about the education system and plans to return to school, as well as assistance programs to the elderly. Meanwhile on Tuesday the Knesset was set to renew discussions on legislation banning large demonstrations and further restricting public prayer as part of the lockdown. The Haaretz newspaper reported that the Blue and White party would likely support the legislation, so long as Netanyahu’s Likud pulls certain provisions it had added at the last moment Friday in an effort to make the limitations more stringent. The law will prevent people from demonstrating over a kilometer from their homes. Organizations demonstrating against the government said they were planning to send convoys of vehicles to Jerusalem on Tuesday to protest the legislation. Demonstrations against the prime minister over his alleged corruption as well as his scathing attacks on the justice system have become a regular occurrence in recent months, with rallies held several times a week, and major events every Saturday. But the protests have become a contentious issue as virus cases have grown, with the premier and others disparaging the mass gatherings amid fears of infection. Israel had a total of 233,265 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic Monday night, with 66,566 active cases, 772 of them serious, and 290 in moderate condition. Of those in serious condition, 209 required ventilation, a new record high. Advertisement Due to the Yom Kippur holiday, test numbers were low Sunday, with some 25,000 carried out, compared to some 50,000-60,000 daily tests over the past week. But the percentage of positive virus tests remained on the rise, standing at 14.3% Monday. Citing Health Ministry data, the Ynet news site reported that positive test rates were far higher in five largely ultra-Orthodox towns, standing at 32.53% over the past week in Beitar Illit, 31.27% in Elad, 27.91% in Bnei Brak, 26.42% in Modiin Illit and 23.04% in Beit Shemesh. On Saturday, Netanyahu admitted that his government made mistakes in emerging from Israel’s first national lockdown earlier this year, as the Health Ministry reported over 8,000 new coronavirus cases on Friday — a new single-day record. “Did we make mistakes in the past? Of course,” Netanyahu said in a Hebrew video released by his office. “The opening of event halls was too fast. Maybe the opening of the whole school system,” he said. He also pointed a finger at experts whom he says counseled for opening the economy; the Knesset for overturning some government decisions; and the media for what he said was a contribution to public apathy by portraying the response to the pandemic as overblown. A sweeping new lockdown took force at 2 p.m. on Friday, though lawmakers were unable to reach an agreement over planned restrictions on protests and public prayers. Under the new rules, nearly all businesses are to be closed, with the exception of specific companies and factories designated as “essential” by the Defense Ministry’s National Emergency Authority, as well as grocery stores and food shops. Restaurants are permitted to operate on a home-delivery basis only.

By Aryeh Stern YERUSHALAYIM — The Health Ministry reported Wednesday morning that 4,949 people tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday after 34,352 tests had been conducted. The number of seriously ill has gone up to 810, of whom 205 are ventilated. According to the Health Ministry, at least 73% of the ventilated are men. Israel’s official death toll from the disease now stands at 1,547. Since the start of the outbreak in Israel, 239,222 people tested positive for coronavirus; 122,340 of them in September alone. The number of active patients currently ill with the disease stands at 65,149. At least 16 cities across the country currently have over 1,000 active patients. There are at least 7,188 active cases in Yerushalayim, 4,052 in Bnei Brak, 2,946 in Ashdod, 2,184 in Tel Aviv-Yafo, 1,795 in Petach Tikvah, 1,759 in Netanya, 1,695 in Modi’in Illit, 1,474 in Be’er Sheva, 1,335 in Rishon LeTzion, 1,293 in Haifa, 1,286 in Holon, 1,182 in Rechovot, 1,116 in Elad, 1,059 in Beitar Illit and 1,001 in Ashkelon. Meanwhile, Health Ministry Director-General Chezy Levy told hospital administrators on Wednesday there would be 1,500 extra beds added nationwide by mid-October. A report in August by experts at the Weizmann Institute of Science predicted that hospitals would only be able to handle up to 800 patients in serious condition. Israel crossed that threshold on Tuesday. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on Monday said that Israel should be prepared for 1,500 patients in serious condition by Thursday but it was unclear why the sudden spike was expected. According to Channel 12, there will be 750 extra beds by October 5, with the remaining 750 in place by October 15. Of those beds, 20% will be for patients in critical condition who are on ventilators, while the remaining 80% will be for those in serious, moderate or mild condition. The report did not specify if any particular medical centers would be targeted for an increase in beds. Levy told Army Radio that as hospitals became more congested, the level of care for COVID-19 patients would deteriorate due to their complicated medical requirements. “In order to treat a complex patient like a patient in serious condition with coronavirus, years of [medical] experience are required. As their number increases, we fear that the quality of treatment will decrease,” Levy said.

News article:
By Aryeh Stern YERUSHALAYIM — The Health Ministry announced on Thursday morning that a record-high nearly 9,000 new coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the last day, as infections continued to climb and worries mounted of hospitals being overwhelmed by the surge. According to the ministry, 8,919 new cases were recorded, raising the number of infections since the pandemic began to 248,133. The figure almost doubled over the past month, when only 116,882 virus carries had been confirmed since the beginning of September. The previous high of 8,385 cases in a single day was notched last Friday, but the last several days saw infection numbers drop to just several thousand as testing levels fell off due to Shabbos and Yom Kippur. The Health Ministry said 65,694 tests were performed Wednesday, which was also a record high. The ministry said 13.6% of tests came back positive. Forty-three deaths had been announced over the previous 24 hours, bringing the toll since the start of the pandemic to 1,571. The number of patients in serious condition stood at 810, with 206 on ventilators. The numbers were slightly lower than on Wednesday, which saw serious cases rise to over 830 for the first time. Officials have warned that hospitals will begin to be overwhelmed once the number of serious patients rises above 800. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told health officials on Wednesday to prepare a plan for 5,000 seriously ill patients by next week. Heads of internal medicine departments at Israeli medical centers warned Wednesday that overcrowding and staff shortages meant they were having difficulty treating patients suffering from other illnesses.

By Aryeh Stern YERUSHALAYIM — The Health Ministry announced on Thursday morning that a record-high nearly 9,000 new coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the last day, as infections continued to climb and worries mounted of hospitals being overwhelmed by the surge. According to the ministry, 8,919 new cases were recorded, raising the number of infections since the pandemic began to 248,133. The figure almost doubled over the past month, when only 116,882 virus carries had been confirmed since the beginning of September. The previous high of 8,385 cases in a single day was notched last Friday, but the last several days saw infection numbers drop to just several thousand as testing levels fell off due to Shabbos and Yom Kippur. The Health Ministry said 65,694 tests were performed Wednesday, which was also a record high. The ministry said 13.6% of tests came back positive. Forty-three deaths had been announced over the previous 24 hours, bringing the toll since the start of the pandemic to 1,571. The number of patients in serious condition stood at 810, with 206 on ventilators. The numbers were slightly lower than on Wednesday, which saw serious cases rise to over 830 for the first time. Officials have warned that hospitals will begin to be overwhelmed once the number of serious patients rises above 800. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told health officials on Wednesday to prepare a plan for 5,000 seriously ill patients by next week. Heads of internal medicine departments at Israeli medical centers warned Wednesday that overcrowding and staff shortages meant they were having difficulty treating patients suffering from other illnesses.

News article:
1. Slowed, but not slowed enough: Two weeks into a nationwide lockdown, Israel is beginning to see some tiny signs of hope amid reports of mass disobedience among two usual suspects: the ultra-Orthodox and politicians. “Israel’s rate of coronavirus infection – which is among the highest in the world – may be slowing down, according to data from the past few days. But it will take another week or two to see if these preliminary indications reflect a real change,” reports Haaretz. The paper adds, though, that Health Ministry officials are showing cautious optimism. Channel 12 news reports on a “slight” downward trend in the percentage of tests coming back positive, and the number of serious cases (based on a single day’s stats). The channel quotes from a daily report by the military-run coronavirus task force that says “in the last few days, [there has been] a certain drop nationally in the percentage of positive cases, but they are still very high. The scale of daily infection is much higher than estimation of what will allow the country to sustainably manage breaking the infection chain.” In a tweet, Israel Hayom’s Ariel Kahana quotes from the same report and highlights all the places it says that Israel is doing poorly. “Failure!” he writes. Minister Orit Farkash tells Army Radio that things are going great: “This wave is being managed better than the first wave. There are tens of thousands of tests a day, the medical corps has opened wards, there’s no comparison.” The head of Maayenei Hayeshua hospital in Bnei Brak isn’t so sure though, telling the same station that “there are a lot more sick people than in March, in terms of numbers and in terms of serious cases, but the percentages are lower.” 2. Now can we go out? Things are apparently going so swimmingly that some are already talking about getting out of the lockdown. Reports indicate that Finance Minister Israel Katz, Economy Minister Amir Peretz and Science Minister Izhar Shai are all pushing for the reopening of many businesses, as well as permitting preschools to open so that parents of small children are able to go to work. However, in a video released Sunday night, Netanyahu appears to push against those pressures, calling himself “more cautious than the cautious.” “Seeking an exit,” reads the top headline on Israel Hayom’s front page, though it should possibly read “seeking to stop an exit.” “Sources in the cabinet say that the fear is if they start opening up certain sectors, there will be pressure to open up more and so for this stage they need to stick with the graduated lockdown as much as needed until the goal that has been set is reached,” the paper reports. According to the paper, health ministry officials are pushing for an eight-stage exit to the lockdown, with three weeks between each stage, which will be reversed if numbers start to go back up again, which sounds an awful lot like the first failed exit. It’s also unclear why the same pressure to rush a reopening won’t exist whenever this goal to start the potentially five-month process begins. Kan reports that the official leading the charge against lifting restrictions is the government’s coronavirus czar Ronni Gamzu, who is expected to recommend to the cabinet that elementary schools and Haredi yeshivas remain closed at least for the coming month — and not until October 19 under the current lockdown plan. Army Radio meanwhile reports that Treasury officials fear allowing the lockdown to to be drawn out should the government collapse, saying that ministers in Likud and Blue and White will prefer to present voters with a lower infection rate, even if it means keeping businesses shut. (Given the popular support for opening back up after the first lockdown, one wonders if they have it backwards.) And ToI’s Nathan Jeffay speaks to epidemiologist Ora Paltiel, who thinks Israel should open up schools to younger grades and let the nearly virus-proof rugrats catch as catch can. “Young children are not the main engine of transmission for this virus, and therefore we have to do everything we can to protect their ability to go and learn,” she says. 3. Lawmaker, lawbreaker: Why wait for stuff to reopen? Haaretz reports that many Israelis are already exploiting loopholes to beat the lockdown and fly around or stay in business. The article actually lays out the loopholes being used (with a warning that they are not strictly legal.) Among them is a trick used by restaurants who can offer delivery, but not takeaway, and so just “deliver” it to a corner a few feet down the street, which does not sound shady at all. “Business owners are indignant. They feel that the government hasn’t compensated them [for their lockdown losses] and are looking for ways to stay in business. People who are on the brink are willing to take their chances,” Israel Restaurant Association head Shai Berman is quoted saying. Here’s another loophole: be a politician. After Minister Gila Gamliel comes down the virus, reports proliferate Monday morning that she spent Yom Kippur breaking lockdown rules by traveling 150 kilometers (90 miles) to her in-laws and praying in a synagogue. Haaretz, which breaks the story, reports that “Gamliel refused to respond to Health Ministry investigators for hours, and when she eventually did, she intentionally misled them by falsely claiming that she was infected by her driver.” Channel 12’s Amit Segal writes in an opinion piece that Netanyahu should fire Gamliel posthaste: “Even in a broken country, even a corrupt one, Gila Gamliel cannot stay as a minister one more day,” he writes. Israel Hayom covers Gamliel, who comes from Likud, but also plays up Yesh Atid-Telem MK Mickey Levy seemingly having broken lockdown rules by visiting his son’s home, which was first reported by Channel 12. While the paper includes the fact that Levy says he was only there outside for a short time, and that it’s within walking distance of his own home, it also tries to catch him out on some supposed hypocrisy: “Levy, who is on the coronavirus committee, was in a discussion in August during which members of Blue and White were asked to leave immediately. The reason: they had met with minister Pnina Tamano-Shatta, who tested positive. He claimed ‘they are endangering us.’” Walla’s Barak Ravid also tries his hand at pointing out a double standard, tweeting that “Yair Lapid said a few days ago that any minister who breaks the rules should be fired. If he is serious, he should start with MK Mickey Levy from his party.” It’s not only elected officials breaking the rules. Kan reports that coronavirus czar Ronni Gamzu is refusing to quarantine despite having met with the mayor of Shfaram, who has since tested positive. “Gamzu’s staff say that nobody at the meeting needs to quarantine because they kept rules about mask-wearing and keeping distance,” it reports. And throwing everyone through a loop, an apparently hacked Israel Hayom Twitter account announces that another politician with the virus, one US President Donald Trump, has handed power to Vice President Mike Pence and been taken into intensive care.

I fought the law, and the law threw a bucket at my head: The cops, meanwhile, have their hands full trying to enforce lockdown regulations on an obstreperous ultra-Orthodox public. Social media and traditional media are filled to the gills with both reports of mass disobedience in the community and cops seemingly taking enforcement a bit too far, attacking kids and the like. Videos that get wide coverage show cops in Jerusalem shoving a Haredi kid in a scooter onto the ground, throwing a bucket at a kid in Beitar Illit, and arresting a man seemingly for committing the crime of taking a video. עובר כל גבול ::שוטר יס״מ תועד שדוחף בחוזקה ילד שנסע על קורקינט, pic.twitter.com/lsfpANJ0D2 — ישי ירושלמי (@ishayyurslaem) October 4, 2020 Advertisement תיעוד מביתר עילית: שוטר משליך דלי על ילד, תעודת עניות למשטרת ישראל@IL_police pic.twitter.com/UIWircs0XG — חיים גולדברג (@haim_goldberg) October 4, 2020 צילמת – נעצרת. מטורף. הוא לא תוקף שוטרים. כלום. בסך הכל עומד (עם מסכה) ומצלם. ואז נעצר. pic.twitter.com/gJJxPVJRpM — בני רבינוביץ (@benirabin) October 4, 2020 One less popular video tweeted out by ultra-Orthodox journalist Avi Gadlovitz shows police shoving a man to the ground during riots in Bnei Brak: “Police violence is reaching new highs! … A man in his 50s who innocently tried to get around the gathering was hit with murderous blows. No response from the police can explain these images,” he writes. האלימות המשטרתית שוברת שיאים! את הרוע הזה צילמתי עכשיו בבני ברק. אדם בשנות ה-50 לחייו שהלך לתומו וניסה לעקוף את ההתקהלות חוטף מכות רצח. שום תגובה של במשטרה לא תסביר את המראות האלו. pic.twitter.com/RMJVrQjMiT — אבי גדלוביץ' (@avigad27) October 4, 2020 Channel 12 news reports that Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, who heads the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, called up acting police Commissioner Motti Cohen to warn that “the strong arm of the police in these confrontations may create unwanted consequences.” According to the channel, Cohen told Deri that given the various challenges, enforcement had been less than perfect. A Yedioth story, under the headline “The ground is burning,” writes that the confrontations between cops and ultra-Orthodox youth in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak have become “more severe.” The paper quotes the kid who got a bucket to the head saying that everything was hunky dory with the cops until the Yassam elite anti-terror police force swooped in: “They cuffed my friend and I wanted to see where they were taking him, so I went with them. Suddenly, one cop threw a bucket at my head. After that he hit me in the head and threw me in a cruiser and took me to the police station while I was injured.” “Police in the eye of the storm,” reads a headline in Israel Hayom. 5. The root of all problems: Between the violence seen Sunday and reports of police abuse at anti-government protests on Saturday, Haaretz’s lead editorial takes aim at Public Security Minister Amir Ohana.

Israel’s coronavirus czar Ronni Gamzu said Saturday he expected the country’s daily coronavirus infection rate to drop to 2,000 this week, after it moved down to some 3,000-4,000 daily cases in recent days. “If we continue on this path, we’ll be prepared for winter,” Gamzu said as he toured the northern town of Julis. Israel has been under a national lockdown for the past three weeks to contain a raging second wave of the pandemic, which at one point reached some 9,000 daily cases. However, recent days have seen both the number of daily cases and the percentage of positive tests go down amid sweeping restrictions on the public. A Tel Aviv police officer died of the virus Saturday after coming into contact with infected Israelis as part of his job. He had been hospitalized in serious condition in recent days. Gamzu called on the public to “go and get tested” over any suspicion of infection. “We can not beat coronavirus without testing. A healthy person can be infected and infect [others],” he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Gamzu added that some cities could emerge from the closure while others remain under lockdown in the coming days, according to the so-called traffic-light program that divides towns into red, orange and green by the severity of the pandemic. Gamzu said the government should give local authorities more responsibilities in handling the pandemic, but said this would require “a budget, resources, authorities, help and understanding.” He also addressed numerous recent cases of public figures breaking lockdown restrictions to meet with relatives, saying such people “should watch themselves doubly” in order to serve as an example to the rest of the public. Advertisement Noting the mass weddings among the Arab and Druze population in the early summer, which is believed to have contributed greatly to infections in those communities, Gamzu said: “There was a month and a half of weddings here that unfortunately took a very heavy toll on communities and hospitals. “Exiting the lockdown does not mean entering weddings and reckless gatherings. The achievements you’ve made here were reached with hard work and at a heavy price, and we need to maintain them,” he said. Thursday saw Israel at its lowest test positivity rate in a month, with 8 percent of tests coming back with COVID-19 diagnoses. Positivity rates had hovered at around 12%-13% for much of recent weeks, at one point reaching a high of 15%. On Saturday the national case count stood at 282,646, of which 59,578 were active cases. Seriously ill patients stood at 850, of whom 233 were on ventilators. The death toll was at 1,879. Gamzu warned in an interview with Channel 12 Friday that there may be a spike in cases in the coming weeks as a result of those who violated health guidelines against crowding over the Sukkot holiday, which ends Saturday night. But, he expressed optimism that the government will be able to begin easing the lockdown either at the end of next week or at the beginning of the following week. However, he warned that “there will be some areas where we will have to carry on with the closure.” Advertisement The current lockdown, Israel’s second since the pandemic started, began on September 18 before Rosh Hashanah and was tightened a week later. It is currently set to end on October 14. It has been marked by clashes between enforcing police and ultra-Orthodox protesters, as well as between police and anti-government protesters who are calling for Netanyahu’s resignation due to his ongoing corruption trial and the government’s handling of the virus outbreak. On Thursday a senior Health Ministry official said that the lockdown has helped to curb the spread of COVID-19, but cautioned that large swaths of the country are still seeing high rates of infection. At a press conference, Sharon Elrai, acting head of the ministry’s public health services division, displayed a chart showing the percentage of Israelis living in “red” areas with the highest levels of infection. After peaking at 65 percent on September 28, she said there has been a “gradual decline” in the rate, which is now at 40%. “This isn’t good enough. We need to drop more before we can loosen the restrictions,” Elrai said. “But there’s no doubt we see from this that [the lockdown] is working.” She said the Health Ministry was working with other government ministries to draft a strategy for reopening the country, which she insisted would be “slow” and “gradual” and based on declining infection levels. Elrai also said morbidity rates were headed “in the right direction.” According to Health Ministry figures released Friday evening, ultra-Orthodox Israelis account for a disproportionately high number of the total coronavirus cases across the country. Twenty-five percent of tests conducted in Haredi towns came back positive, Channel 12 reported, citing figures from the Health Ministry. The countrywide positive test rate stood at 7.4% Advertisement In addition, Haredi locales made up for over 60% of the Health Ministry designated virus hotspots, Channel 12 reported. Overall, the number of hotspots nationwide dropped from 130 last week to 80 as of Friday night. Channel 12 also cited figures from Weizmann Institute of Science Professor Eran Segal showing that “46% of the contagion at the moment is in the ultra-Orthodox community,” in what appeared to be a reference to the percentage of active cases countrywide. The ultra-Orthodox make up some 12% of the total population in Israel. There has been growing criticism of Haredi communities for not adhering to government guidelines, including continuing to host mass gatherings over the High Holiday period.

Several thousand protesters showed up on Sunday for a weekly anti-Netanyahu demonstration near the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem, which in its 13th week drew a smaller crowd than usual, as Israel in under a nationwide coronavirus lockdown. His detention was extended by two days.Police said they arrested a driver who was speeding near the main protest site, "putting protesters and police officers in danger." No injuries were reported, and the suspect, a 20-year-old resident of Jerusalem, was taken into questioning. Overall, 11 protesters were arrested or detained Sunday night for disturbance of the peace and assaulting a police officer.

Hunderds of anti-Netanyahu protesters also gathered in Caesarea near the prime minister's private residece. One of them said: "I'm not for defying the lockdown, and I wouldn't have come if it was banned. But as a citizen I feel the need to protest, becuase what's going on here is unbelievable." Also on Sunday, ultra-Orthodox protesters demonstrated in five cities over what organizers call "the lockdown's destructive ramifications, which hurt religious life, and citizens' welfare." They claim the government's restrictions disrupt the marking of the Jewish High Holy Days throughout this month. Several demonstrators in the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak torched garbage bins and hurled stones at police officers. The police said that a patrol vehicle was damaged, adding that one person was arrested. Protests are allowed during the three-week lockdown, but under restrictions released on Friday – the same day the lockdown began – demonstrators must stay within separated groups of up to 20 people.

Credit: Tomer Appelbaum Police have set up barriers at the main protest site in Jerusalem, but most protesters have ignored them, and police officials said they wouldn't enforce the new directives, which have not yet gone into effect. As the crowds gathered, one activist was detained after police said he told protesters how to avoid being fined for not wearing a protective mask. A senior police official told Haaretz that the police are aware that these planned protests may be used as a tactic to evade movement restrictions, because the police "cannot enforce regulations fully and if someone says they are on their way to a protest, they can't be fined." "We know that some intend to take advantage of these protests in order to allow families that spent the holiday outside their home, at relatives' or with their rabbis to return home and tell officers at roadblocks that they're on their way to a protest," said the official. The wave of anti-Netanyahu protests in Jerusalem has been interrupted this week because of Rosh Hashanah and the coronavirus lockdown. On Friday, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit and the Health Ministry issued directives stating that demonstrators must be divided into separate groups of up to 20 people each and must wear face masks at all time. The space allocated for the protest against Netanyahu in Jerusalem will be expanded to allow protesters to maintain social distancing. Some protesters, however, were undeterred by the lockdown and on Saturday a group of 200 people held an anti-lockdown, anti-Netanyahu protest at a Tel Aviv beach. They maintained that the surge in coronavirus cases and subsequent lockdown was a result of Netanyahu's mishandling of the crisis. Some of the protesters told Haaretz they were unemployed and that the lockdown has further threatening their livelihood.

Police arrested a man on Sunday night who was speeding toward barricades set up around a protest in Jerusalem as thousands of Israelis gathered for a weekly demonstration against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outside his official residence in Jerusalem. Police said they had “arrested a suspect who drove toward the police barricades and was a danger to protestors and police.” They did not immediately specify whether the incident was a near-accident or an intended attack. Video posted to social media showed a white Mini Cooper car coming to a screeching halt as officers called on the driver to stop, some of them with their guns drawn. Police then pulled the driver from the vehicle and wrestled him to the ground. Toward the end of the video, one officer appears to punch the suspect in the groin area before grasping him by the neck. It was not clear what prompted this. צילומים בלעדיים ל"שיחה מקומית" של החשוד בניסיון הדריסה בהפגנה בירושלים מבצע את המעשה ונעצר. מהמשטרה במחוז ירושלים נמסר כי החשוד הועבר לחקירה.

Advertisement Police said the man was taken for questioning, but provided no further details on his identity or possible motivation. It was not immediately clear if the incident was an attempted attack or an accident. Some 3,000 people gathered late Sunday for the weekly protest against Netanyahu outside his official residence in Jerusalem, in the first such demonstration since the start of a renewed nationwide lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic and after fresh restrictions were announced on those taking part. Several hundred more protested outside his private residence in the seaside town of Caesarea. Netanyahu is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. His criminal trial began in June, but he has refused to step down from office and denies any wrongdoing. Many demonstrators also protested against his handling of the coronavirus crisis. While protests were exempt from the new restrictions on movement and gatherings, which came into force Friday before Rosh Hashanah with the start of the three-week closure, police announced new social distancing regulations for demonstrations. Hundreds of demonstrators formed a convoy to Jerusalem, waving black flags out of their cars as they drove to the capital. Advertisement Police tried to divide demonstrators into “capsules” of 20 people, but did not physically enforce the efforts as the new guidelines are currently just a suggestion and have not yet been approved by the government. “I remind you that also during the lockdown it is permitted to protest,” retired air force Brig. Gen. Amir Haskel, one of the Sunday night protest organizers, said in a video earlier Sunday urging demonstrators to take part in the evening’s rally. Speaking outside the Prime Minister’s Residence, Haskel called for demonstrators to wear masks and maintain the social distancing guidelines. He also later shared photos showing protesters marking the street with chalk drawings to ensure distance between the demonstrators. “The demonstration this evening is a test for the continuation of our struggle. I call on you to come,” he said. נערכים לקראת ההפגנה הערב בבלפור. סימונים על הכביש כדי לשמור ריחוק חברתי. pic.twitter.com/xgaXECu4jW — amir haskel (@AmirHaskel) September 20, 2020 The weekly protests in Jerusalem and elsewhere across Israel are usually held on Saturday evenings after Shabbat, but this week they were pushed off until Sunday night, when the Jewish New Year holiday ends. The Prime Minister’s Residence has become the center of ongoing demonstrations against the premier over his indictment on graft charges and handling of the pandemic, with weekly protests there sometimes drawing tens of thousands of people. Advertisement Netanyahu and his supporters have claimed the protests are a major vector of infections, though health officials have not provided any definitive information tracing cases back to the rallies so far. Besides the new measures regarding movement and gatherings, the lockdown also includes far-reaching restrictions on business activity, including limiting restaurants and other eateries to offering delivery. On Sunday, police hit the Nisso Cafe in Jaffa with a fine of NIS 5,000 for serving some 50 patrons in defiance of the lockdown. Yoni Salomon, the cafe’s owner, said he had “no choice” but to open. “There’s no logic to this lockdown,” he told the Kan public broadcaster. “When you got here you saw the whole place was full. People voted with their feet.” Solomon added: “We won’t allow anyone to take our basic rights of liberty, work and livelihood… I’m ready to absorb the fine.” בית הקפה "ניסו" בשוק הפשפשים ביפו פתח כרגיל ואיפשר ללקוחות לשבת בשטח המקום, זאת בניגוד להנחיות המאפשרות ביצוע משלוחים בלבד. סיירים של הפיקוח העירוני הזמינו את המשטרה שפינתה את ההתקהלות והסועדים@daniel_elazar pic.twitter.com/b8VLuCFXwD Advertisement — כאן חדשות (@kann_news) September 20, 2020 Earlier Sunday, police said they had handed out 2,802 fines over the past day for various infractions of the lockdown rules and other coronavirus regulations, the vast majority of them to people who ventured out over a kilometer from their homes without valid reason. Police have said the public has so far largely adhered to restrictions that came into effect Friday afternoon, in the government’s latest effort to curb the surging pandemic. The closure will remain in effect for at least three weeks. Israel, which has one of the highest daily infection rates per capita in the world, became the first developed country to order a second lockdown to fight the pandemic. Meanwhile, Israel’s coronavirus czar warned Sunday that virus numbers were reaching “emergency,” levels that could see the country face 600 deaths a month and ordering hospitals to add new virus wards. Prof. Ronni Gamzu said in an interview with Channel 12 news that he fears the number of COVID-19 patients in serious condition could reach 800 by the end of the week, a number that has been frequently touted as the maximum Israeli hospitals can cope with. The Health Ministry on Sunday reported another 1,906 coronavirus cases since midnight Saturday, bringing the number of infections since the pandemic began to 187,396. It also confirmed another seven deaths, raising the national toll to 1,236. The case number was significantly lower than recent days, but that likely reflected the drop in testing over the Rosh Hashanah holiday. The ministry said there are 52,262 confirmed active cases, including 643 in serious condition, with a record 170 on ventilators.

Hundreds of people took part in demonstrations calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s resignation around the country Thursday, as protest leaders vowed to continue to rally within the confines of a tightened national lockdown which will controversially introduce limitations on protests as part of an effort to bring the coronavirus outbreak under control. Some rallied at highway overpasses, while the largest gathering took place near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem. In a nod to restrictions already in effect, demonstrators in Jerusalem spread out chairs at the scene to maintain social distancing, unlike previous events where protesters were more tightly grouped together, drawing criticism that they were liable to spread the coronavirus. Under restrictions set to go into effect at 2 p.m. on Friday, people will be prevented from venturing more than one kilometer from their home in order to protest and rallies will be limited to groups of 20. Protests outside Netanyahu’s residence will be allowed to continue with up to 2,000 participants at a time, as long as they are divided into 20-person “capsules.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Critics have accused the prime minister of pushing through overbearing restrictions on movement and economic activity in order to also clamp down on the protests. One by one Thursday, former senior members in Israel’s defense establishment spoke from a central podium at Paris Square. Many compared the current government’s failure to contain a raging coronavirus outbreak to the failures which preceded the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Former Air Force brigadier general Amir Haskel, a veteran activist whose brief arrest in late June sparked the current protest wave, said that the restrictions on demonstrations were about politics, not public health. Advertisement “I think that the prime minister’s decision yesterday is a flagrant conflict of interest. He simply cannot place restrictions on protests against him,” Haskel told The Times of Israel. “The decision is based solely on his desire to silence us.” Haskel said that the organizers were planning on petitioning the High Court of Justice to overturn the restrictions. In the meantime, he said, demonstrations would continue across the country in accordance with the restrictions. “I stood for four years at intersections by myself, or with small groups, and protested. If necessary, we can return to the intersections,” Haskel said. “Maybe he will manage to [silence] us for a week, or two weeks. But this is Netanyahu’s swan song.” Yuval Carminovich, a lawyer from Tel Aviv, regularly attends the protests in Jerusalem. He told The Times of Israel that he intended to follow the new restrictions — even though he considered them “scandalous.” “I intend to abide by the law. If they say it’s illegal for me to demonstrate here, then I won’t. But this is a slippery slope which doesn’t have a clear end,” Carminovich said. Just outside the demonstration, video showed Channel 12 news correspondent Moshe Nussbaum and cameraman Hanan Shroitman heckled aggressively by a small group of protesters shouting right-wing and pro-Netanyahu slogans at them. The hecklers, some of whom got nose to nose with Nussbaum, called him “disgusting,” “a stinking journalist,” and a “leftist traitor,” among other insults. Advertisement The two eventually managed to leave the area after a police officer got between them and the hecklers. According to the channel, one heckler was detained. כתב הפלילים של חדשות 12 משה נוסבאום הותקף על ידי עשרת המפגינים בהפגנת הימין.

The Black Flag movement, an anti-Netanyahu protest group, vowed to continue demonstrating over the weekend despite the lockdown. “Israel does not have a functioning prime minister, it has a criminal defendant who is destroying any good the country has,” the movement said in a statement. “Today, it is already clear to every citizen that the problem with the country is not the synagogues, not the demonstrations, it is the number one defendant Benjamin Netanyahu.” The head of the Crime Minister protest group, Gonen Ben Yitzhak, has also vowed to continue demonstrating, but was not seen at the Paris Square demonstration. The protests are aimed mainly against Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, and against the government’s handling of the virus outbreak. Advertisement Dozens of protesters also rallied outside the Knesset building. Several threw bags of cow dung in the direction of the parliament building, Channel 12 news reported. Cyber and National Digital Matters Minister David Amsalem, who is also the liaison between the Knesset and government, was heckled by the protesters as he walked past them from the Knesset to the nearby Finance Ministry, the network reported. As the crowd became increasingly vocal, Amsalem’s security detail hurried him into the Finance Ministry premises. Amsalem, who later introduced the lockdown proposal for a Knesset vote at the plenum, accused opposition lawmakers of “leading anarchy” through the anti-government protests. Apparently referring his earlier clash with protesters, lamented their lack of respect for a government minister, telling the plenum that some had shouted at him “thief, swindler, I paid you NIS 10,000, go to prison” as well as calling him “fat” and “stinking.” The lockdown proposal, which requires Knesset approval, passed its first reading in parliament on Thursday evening by 36 votes in favor to 32 against. If approved, nearly all public transportation will be closed, as will the last educational institutions still open — mainly special education programs and private preschools. Israelis won’t be allowed to travel more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. Police will be deployed on highways and at the entrances to cities and towns to ensure Israelis don’t attempt to travel during the lockdown. There were acrimonious debates in the cabinet this week over whether to allow the anti-government protests during the lockdown, with the Blue and White party insisting a government could not order protests against it to disband. Ministers also argued over the degree to which prayer gatherings should be restricted, with ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism pushing to leave synagogues open, even if new limits on the number of worshipers are imposed. Under a final compromise reached late Wednesday, synagogues will close beginning Friday, open in a limited capacity for the 25 hours of the Yom Kippur holiday, then close again on Monday night.

News article:
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Crowds protested outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home on Saturday demanding he quit over his handling of COVID-19 - many angered by what they said were government attempts to use lockdown measures to stifle demonstrations. FILE PHOTO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives a statement as Israel imposes nightly curfews in dozens of towns and neighbourhoods to stem the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Beit Shemesh, Israel September 8, 2020. Alex Kolomoisky/Pool via REUTERS Long lines of cars drove along the main highway to Jerusalem in a protest convoy and groups gathered on bridges and junctions in other cities, also demonstrating about corruption charges against Netanyahu - charges he denies. The protests came a day after the government tightened COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, though parliament failed to pass one measure to restrict citizens’ protests to within 1 km (0.6 miles) of their homes. That measure would have effectively halted the weekly demonstrations outside Netanyahu’s residence which have built up over the summer. “I’m here to stop the destruction of Israel, to stop democracy dying,” said Amit Tirosh, 42, a doctor from central Israel. “Luckily parliament managed to stop the demonstrations’ halt at the last minute. Everyone should be here. We are at the edge of an abyss.” Netanyahu has rejected allegations that the tougher lockdown rules were in part intended to quash the protests, which he has often called “anarchist” and “ludicrous”. “We need the lockdown in order to save lives,” he said on Thursday. There was no official figure for the number of protesters on Saturday but Israel’s N12 News said thousands took part. Police said most of them complied with social distancing and face mask rules. Netanyahu’s government decided this week to tighten a three-week lockdown imposed on Sept. 18, hoping to keep Israelis at home, shutting down many businesses and limiting group prayers during the ongoing Jewish high-holiday season. On Saturday, Netanyahu urged Israelis in a video message on Twitter to pray in the open air rather than inside synagogues on Yom Kippur, the upcoming Jewish day of atonement and the holiest day in the Jewish calendar which begins on Sunday. Only 27% of Israelis trust Netanyahu’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey published by the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday. Israel imposed its first lockdown in March and then relaxed it in May as new cases tapered off. But infections have since surged, reaching daily highs of more than 7,000 among the population of nine million. The country is in recession with unemployment above 11%.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Crowds protested outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home on Saturday demanding he quit over his handling of COVID-19 - many angered by what they said were government attempts to use lockdown measures to stifle demonstrations. FILE PHOTO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives a statement as Israel imposes nightly curfews in dozens of towns and neighbourhoods to stem the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Beit Shemesh, Israel September 8, 2020. Alex Kolomoisky/Pool via REUTERS Long lines of cars drove along the main highway to Jerusalem in a protest convoy and groups gathered on bridges and junctions in other cities, also demonstrating about corruption charges against Netanyahu - charges he denies. The protests came a day after the government tightened COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, though parliament failed to pass one measure to restrict citizens’ protests to within 1 km (0.6 miles) of their homes. That measure would have effectively halted the weekly demonstrations outside Netanyahu’s residence which have built up over the summer. “I’m here to stop the destruction of Israel, to stop democracy dying,” said Amit Tirosh, 42, a doctor from central Israel. “Luckily parliament managed to stop the demonstrations’ halt at the last minute. Everyone should be here. We are at the edge of an abyss.” Netanyahu has rejected allegations that the tougher lockdown rules were in part intended to quash the protests, which he has often called “anarchist” and “ludicrous”. “We need the lockdown in order to save lives,” he said on Thursday. There was no official figure for the number of protesters on Saturday but Israel’s N12 News said thousands took part. Police said most of them complied with social distancing and face mask rules. Netanyahu’s government decided this week to tighten a three-week lockdown imposed on Sept. 18, hoping to keep Israelis at home, shutting down many businesses and limiting group prayers during the ongoing Jewish high-holiday season. On Saturday, Netanyahu urged Israelis in a video message on Twitter to pray in the open air rather than inside synagogues on Yom Kippur, the upcoming Jewish day of atonement and the holiest day in the Jewish calendar which begins on Sunday. Only 27% of Israelis trust Netanyahu’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey published by the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday. Israel imposed its first lockdown in March and then relaxed it in May as new cases tapered off. But infections have since surged, reaching daily highs of more than 7,000 among the population of nine million. The country is in recession with unemployment above 11%.

Israeli protesters have placed washing machines in front of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Jerusalem, local media reported yesterday. This came, according to the reports, after the Washington Post revealed that Netanyahu and his wife were carrying bags of their dirty laundry to the US in order to have them cleaned for free. Reporting an informed US official, the Washington Post reported: "Over the years, the Israeli leader has developed a reputation among the staff at the U.S. president's guesthouse for bringing special cargo on his trips to Washington: bags and suitcases full of dirty laundry." "The Netanyahus are the only ones who bring actual suitcases of dirty laundry for us to clean," another US official told the American daily. "After multiple trips, it became clear this was intentional." Israeli social media users posted pictures showing a number of washing machines in front of Netanyahu's house, in a symbolic protest against the prime minister's behaviour.

BAKU, Azerbaijan, September 8 By Elnur Baghishov – Trend: As many as 2,302 people have been infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the past 24 hours in Iran, said Sima Sadat Lari, spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Trend reports citing the ministry. According to Sadat Lari, 132 more people have died from the coronavirus over the past day. Sadat Lari added that the condition of 3,713 people is critical. The official said that Iran's Tehran, Mazandaran, Gilan, Qom, Isfahan, Razavi Khorasan, East Azerbaijan, Kerman, North Khorasan, Semnan, Yazd, Zanjan, and Qazvin provinces are considered 'red' zones. So far, more than 3.43 million tests have been conducted in Iran for the diagnosis of coronavirus. Iran continues to monitor the coronavirus situation in the country. According to recent reports from the Iranian officials, over 391,100 people have been infected, and 22,542 people have already died. Meanwhile, over 337,400 have reportedly recovered from the disease. The country continues to apply strict measures to contain further spread. Reportedly, the disease was brought to Iran by a businessman from Iran's Qom city, who went on a business trip to China, despite official warnings. The man died later from the disease. The Islamic Republic only announced its first infections and deaths from the coronavirus on Feb. 19. The outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan - which is an international transport hub - began at a fish market in late December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Some sources claim the coronavirus outbreak started as early as November 2019.

Around half of all coronavirus patients being treated in Iran’s intensive care units are dying, a government health specialist said on Saturday. The death toll among those on ventilators is 90 percent. Read the latest updates in our dedicated coronavirus section. Advertisement “In all, 10 percent to 12 percent of hospitalized patients are losing their lives,” Masoud Mardani, a specialist of infectious diseases and a member of the government coronavirus task force, told the semi-official ISNA news agency. He was speaking on Saturday as the health ministry said the country's coronavirus death toll had risen by 166 to 24,118. Payam Tabarsi, head of infectious diseases at Tehran’s Masih Daneshvari Hospital, said the number of emergency room patients being admitted at his facility had jumped over the past week from 68 a day to 200. “People are queuing to be admitted,” he was cited as saying by ISNA. If the trend continues, deaths from coronavirus could reach 600 a day within weeks, he said. Iran's total number of confirmed cases in the last 24 hours spiked by 2,845 to 419,043, health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said on state TV. President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that a 20 percent decline in public adherence to health protocols had contributed to the spike in infections. “Today, the health ministry gave a worrying report. The public’s observance, which was 82 percent in earlier weeks, has fallen to 62 percent,” Rouhani said in remarks broadcast live on state television. He said the ministry report showed a recurrence of infection among former patients. Tabarsi called on authorities to limit school attendance to online classes, saying that in the last few days several students and teachers had been infected. Schools re-opened on Sept. 5 for 15 million students after a seven-month closure despite concerns over increased spread of the coronavirus in the country. Last month, over one million students sat for a four-day nationwide university entrance exam despite calls to postpone them. Rouhani said no student had tested positive for the virus following the exams.

News article:
Iran's Health Ministry said on Monday nearly the whole country was on a coronavirus red alert as cases and deaths rose to record levels, with a member of the state task force's warning field hospitals might be needed if people flout the rules. Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari told state television that 26 of Iran's 31 provinces were "red" zones, the highest alert level, while four were at the next "orange" level. Authorities registered a record high 3,902 new cases in the past 24 hours, with the total number of identified cases in the worst-hit country in the Middle East rising to 475,674, Lari said. She said 235 patients had died in the past 24 hours, equalling a daily death toll high set on July 28, bringing the total death toll to 27,192. Officials have complained that many have defied regulations to wear face masks and some families used lockdowns to go on trips, helping spread the virus with hospitals nearly full. "If people keep going on weekend trips…, our patients might have to go to field hospitals," Masoud Mardani, a member of the state coronavirus task force, told Khabaronline website. READ: Fines and business closures among new Iran coronavirus restrictions On Saturday, schools, libraries, mosques, and other public institutions in the capital Tehran closed for a week as part of measures to stem the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases. Similar closures have been also imposed in Zanjan province, northwest of Tehan, and cities in several other provinces, shutting museums, theatres, gyms, cafes, and hair salons, state media said. Because of coronavirus concerns, Iran has banned flights to Iraq to block trips by Iranians to the neighbouring country for the annual pilgrimage of Arbaeen, which draws large crowds. Land borders to Iraq have also been closed. After stopping flights to Turkey, Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation said on Monday one flight per day would be allowed in each direction.

DUBAI: One person is dying from COVID-19 every three minutes in Iran, state television said on Wednesday, as the health ministry reported a record daily toll of 415 fatalities. Parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf tweeted that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, the latest among dozens of officials to be infected. Non-essential businesses have been shut in Tehran and dozens of other cities as cases rise again in the Middle East's worst-hit country. Schools, theatres and museums have been shut and social, cultural and religious events cancelled for at least a week. Iranian authorities have blamed the sharp increase on people failing to follow restrictions. Total fatalities from the disease have reached 33,714, health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari told state TV. The number of confirmed cases rose by 6,824 in the past 24 hours to 558,648, she added. Some experts have doubted the accuracy of Iran’s official coronavirus tolls. A report by the Iranian parliament’s research centre in April suggested that the coronavirus tolls might be almost twice as many as those announced by the health ministry.

News article:
TEHRAN: Iran warned on Wednesday it will not tolerate "terrorists" near its border with Azerbaijan, after France and Russia raised the alarm over the deployment of Syrian militants in the Karabakh conflict. "It is unacceptable for us that some people want to send terrorists from Syria and other places towards regions near our frontiers," President Hassan Rouhani said, quoted on state television. Iran borders Armenian-held areas of Azerbaijan near Nagorno-Karabakh that have seen fighting. Armenia and Azerbaijan have for decades been locked in a conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnically Armenian area which broke away from Baku in a 1990s war that cost about 30,000 lives. Heavy fighting erupted on September 27 in one of the most combustible frozen conflicts left over from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Turkey has been accused of deploying fighters from Syria to support Azerbaijan in Karabakh. French President Emmanuel Macron said Ankara had sent Syrian "Jihadists" to the region, accusing Turkey of crossing a "red line". Turkey has not responded publicly. Russia and Armenia have also said that fighters from Syria and Libya are being deployed on the Azeri side in the conflict. Rouhani, which has good relations with both Yerevan and Baku, reiterated on Wednesday that "occupation is in no case acceptable". "Everyone" must "accept the reality... and respect other countries’ territorial integrity", he said. Rouhani at the same time condemned "those who, on one side or the other, pour oil on the fire", without naming Turkey which has declared open support for Azeri military action to reclaim the enclave. Iran has called on both Armenia and Azerbaijan to cease hostilities and offered to facilitate talks. On Saturday, Tehran warned against any "intrusion" after mortar fire hit Iranian villages along the border.

They were disturbed by air raid sirens throughout the night as multiple explosions went off in a city plunged into total darkness. The city was hit by new strikes in the morning, with smoke visible and buzzing indicating the source was a drone, an AFP correspondent said.

TEHRAN: Iran warned on Wednesday it will not tolerate "terrorists" near its border with Azerbaijan, after France and Russia raised the alarm over the deployment of Syrian militants in the Karabakh conflict. "It is unacceptable for us that some people want to send terrorists from Syria and other places towards regions near our frontiers," President Hassan Rouhani said, quoted on state television. Iran borders Armenian-held areas of Azerbaijan near Nagorno-Karabakh that have seen fighting. Armenia and Azerbaijan have for decades been locked in a conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnically Armenian area which broke away from Baku in a 1990s war that cost about 30,000 lives. Heavy fighting erupted on September 27 in one of the most combustible frozen conflicts left over from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Turkey has been accused of deploying fighters from Syria to support Azerbaijan in Karabakh. French President Emmanuel Macron said Ankara had sent Syrian "Jihadists" to the region, accusing Turkey of crossing a "red line". Turkey has not responded publicly. Russia and Armenia have also said that fighters from Syria and Libya are being deployed on the Azeri side in the conflict. Rouhani, which has good relations with both Yerevan and Baku, reiterated on Wednesday that "occupation is in no case acceptable". "Everyone" must "accept the reality... and respect other countries’ territorial integrity", he said. Rouhani at the same time condemned "those who, on one side or the other, pour oil on the fire", without naming Turkey which has declared open support for Azeri military action to reclaim the enclave. Iran has called on both Armenia and Azerbaijan to cease hostilities and offered to facilitate talks. On Saturday, Tehran warned against any "intrusion" after mortar fire hit Iranian villages along the border.

News article:
The renewed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region has the propensity to draw in regional powers such as Iran, Russia and Turkey, and thus become a proxy war in the South Caucasus. The conflict is one that is already progressing towards outright war as fighting has now escalated, with cities being bombed, a rising death toll and allegations of cluster bombs being used. As with most contemporary border disputes this is both complex and multifaceted, rooted in the legacy of imperialism and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Both countries gained their independence in 1918 from the Tsarist Russian Empire only to be incorporated into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics two years later. By then, ethnic and religious tensions had already erupted between Armenians and Azeris, as both laid claim to Nagorno-Karabakh; although within Azerbaijan's borders, it was and is mostly inhabited by Armenians. Hostilities halted for a while following the establishment of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) in 1923 by the then Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. Yet following the demise of the Soviet Union, war erupted again with the Armenians preferring to reunify with historic Armenia and Azerbaijan wanting to reassert its own sovereignty claims and bring an end to Armenian occupation. This lasted until a 1994 ceasefire and the emergence of a de facto Republic of Artsakh, a state not recognised internationally within Azerbaijan's borders. This long peace came to an end abruptly due to a very short war in 2016 which left at least 200 dead and was seen largely as being instigated by Azerbaijan as a logical consequence of the lack of progress in the peace talks under the auspices of the OSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) Minsk Group co-chaired by France, Russia and the US. It was during this conflict that Azerbaijan addressed the longstanding asymmetry with Armenia which always had the superior army. Russia was the primary benefactor of Baku's face-saving skirmish by repositioning itself as the principal mediator and strengthening its geopolitical position in the Caucasus at the expense of Western influence. While Moscow officially recognises Baku's territorial claims it has a defence pact with traditional ally Armenia – and this does not apply to the disputed region — and is happy to supply arms to both sides. READ: Only Arab states aligned with Iran will oppose Zionism A peak in oil revenues between 2010 and 2015 coincided with a huge military budget for Azerbaijan. Most of its military equipment is acquired from Russia, and Israel is its second largest military trading partner. In the same year as the 2016 conflict, Baku spent almost $5 billion on Israeli arms, including radar systems and drones. Azerbaijan established ties with Israel soon after its post-Cold War independence in 1991. It is among a handful of Muslim-majority countries which have relations with Tel Aviv; in fact, Azerbaijan and Turkey are the only non-Arab Muslim-majority states in this position. Nevertheless, the "Turkish-Azerbaijani axis" has had a significant impact on Israel's relationship with Azerbaijan, with all three countries facing similar security threats and geopolitical perceptions. However, waning ties between Turkey and Israel over the past decade has meant that relations with energy-rich Azerbaijan have superseded ties with Turkey in importance for the occupation state. Israel gets most of its oil from Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oilfields, although its recent normalisation with the UAE and Bahrain means that there is the potential for it to diversify its oil supply should the Caucasus conflict spiral out of control. It is interesting to note that, historically, Azerbaijan had a thriving Zionist movement, with Baku becoming "one of the major centres" of Jewish nationalism by 1891. The movement was particularly active during the fleetingly independent pre-Soviet republic when a Zionist represented the Jewish community in parliament. READ: Israel and the evolution of asymmetric warfare Casual observers may be surprised to learn that although Iran has ties with both Armenia and Azerbaijan, it tends to favour its Orthodox Christian neighbour over Azerbaijan, despite the latter being a fellow Shia Muslim majority country, albeit a secular state. Iran does have historic and religious links with Azerbaijan, though; the Safavid dynasty established its base in Ardabil, in Iran's Azerbaijan region, and Azeris form the largest ethnic group in Iran after Persians, there being more Azeris in Iran than in Azerbaijan itself. However, Iran's support for Armenia is best understood in light of Baku's alliance with Tel Aviv and Ankara. Azerbaijan is not just an invaluable energy source for Israel, but it also provides Tel Aviv with valuable intelligence on military activities in northern Iran. Thus, Tehran does not trust Azerbaijan; this wariness is reciprocated because Baku is concerned about Iran's growing ideological influence among its Shia population. The majority of the political prisoners in the country are said to be behind bars for religion-related offences and Ashura commemorations are monitored closely by the state. Iran must tread carefully so as not to alienate its large Azeri minority as there have already been demonstrations and rallies in support of Azerbaijan. There are also fears that nationalist sentiments could spill across the border and ignite Azeri separatism in the country. However, the Azeri Iranians are largely loyal to the state whose head, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is of Azeri descent. The arrival of Turkish-supported Syrian mercenaries in Azerbaijan is also is a genuine security concern for Tehran being so close to the border, especially as extremist factions are currently the dominant force among those fighting against the Syrian government in Idlib. Unlike Azerbaijan, Iranian ally Armenia has "underdeveloped" ties with Israel and only opened an embassy in Tel Aviv last month. The Armenians have already recalled their ambassador over Israel's continued supply of "ultra-modern weapons" to Azerbaijan, describing this as "unacceptable". Even in the midst of the conflict, Azerbaijani civilian cargo flights have been running between Baku, Turkey and Israel, and are perceived widely to be carrying military equipment to be used in Nagorno-Karabakh. Ironically, Israel is also noteworthy for officially refusing to recognise the Armenian Genocide, a highly controversial and sensitive subject for the Turks. In spite of the advanced arsenal at Azerbaijan's disposal, including Turkish drones which have been so effective in Syria and Libya, its conscript soldiers are poorly trained and have low morale. Given that they are bolstered by untrained and ill-equipped Syrian mercenaries, it is no surprise that Armenian sources have claimed high casualties among Azerbaijani forces and social media is full of graphic footage of fallen Azerbaijani soldiers. NetBlocks has reported a social media and communications blackout in Azerbaijan following the declaration of martial law "to prevent large scale provocations" by the enemy. READ: The Kurds may well have 'no friends but the mountains', but they do have Israel From Armenia's perspective, it is facing an existential threat, with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan accusing Turkey and Azerbaijan of "continuing the Armenian genocide". Turkey's rejection of a ceasefire at this stage and Azerbaijan's insistence on pressing forward, having captured several villages from Armenian forces, have made Armenian disengagement from the conflict and ceding to Baku's demands "almost impossible" to imagine. The mountainous terrain and higher ground favours the Armenians and the onset of winter will severely restrict Azerbaijani progress. It goes without saying that Turkey's troubled history with the Armenians and the lack of diplomatic ties, plus the fact that the Azeris are a Turkic nation, means that Ankara is fully supportive of Azerbaijan. Even the head of the IYI Turkish opposition party has announced its support for the government's policy on Azerbaijan, expressing the hope that it focuses on strengthening ties with Turkic countries instead of the Muslim Brotherhood in Arab countries. Azerbaijan is therefore crucial for pan-Turkism and connecting Turkey with the wider Turkic world across Central Asia, but Armenia is in the way. However, in practical, realistic terms, Turkey is also reliant on Azerbaijani gas imports, which jumped 23 per cent in the first half of this year, although this may change if Ankara can exploit its own recently discovered gas field and it is found to be economically viable. Much like Russia's intention to bolster its presence in the Caucasus, Turkey is seeking a similar outcome, which is in line with its assertive foreign policy. According to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's support for Baku is part of the search for its "deserved place in the world order". In the zero-sum vying for power game, neither Iran, Turkey nor Russia would be content with allowing one or the other to dominate the Caucasus. The Russian, Ottoman and Safavid Empires all clashed over this region in the past, and their modern equivalents will do so again, albeit by proxy, should the situation on the ground deteriorate. Any support for the Azeri people, whether based on religious or ethnic ties, however, will not necessarily warrant support for its pro-Israel government.

The head of Egypt’s Al-Azhar Ahmed El-Tayyeb called on Thursday for Azerbaijan and Armenia to call a ceasefire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where nearly two weeks of heavy fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. “Listening to the sound of reason dictates an immediate ceasefire between the two neighboring countries of Azerbaijan and Armenia,” El-Tayyeb said on his official Twitter account. “We call upon all those committed to the message of world peace to make their best towards stopping armed conflict and returning to the negotiation table and peaceful solutions between these two countries,” he added. Heavy fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh region erupted on 27 September, killing scores of both servicemen and civilians. Nagorno-Karabakh is inside Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia, which claims the region is part of its territory from the pre-Soviet era. Al-Azhar is the most influential Islamic institution in Egypt and most of the Sunni world. Nearly 97 percent of the population in Azerbaijan are Muslims, the majority of whom are Shia.

News article:
As fighting intensifies between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Washington’s silence is deafening. Domestic distractions are no excuse for the Trump administration to ignore a war that threatens to engulf Turkey, Russia and Iran, and place NATO partner Georgia in grave danger. Indeed, America is the sole power that can defuse the conflict and take a leadership role in a long-overdue peace settlement. Fierce fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan has not subsided since September 27, making negotiations more difficult with each passing day. Battles are taking place along the line of contact that has separated Azerbaijani and Armenian forces since the 1994 ceasefire. Armenian-controlled cities in the Nagorno-Karabakh region have been shelled, including the capital Stepanakert, as well as Azerbaijani villages on the other side of the line of contact, with both sides reporting civilian deaths. Armenian mid-range missiles have also hit civilian targets far beyond the conflict zone, reaching as far as the Absheron region near Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku. Several missiles hit Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, Ganja, located close to major oil and gas pipelines from the Caspian Sea to Europe. On October 6, Armenian forces reportedly fired a rocket targeting the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline in Azerbaijan’s Yevlakh region. The rocket barely missed the oil pipeline and the nearby South Caucasus natural gas line, but the threat to major energy, transportation and communication corridors remains high. Although Armenia blames Azerbaijan for shelling towns in Nagorno-Karabakh, the current military adviser to the Armenian prime minister, Vagharshak Harutyunyan, openly stated on Russian TV’s Vesti news program that the Armenian army is deliberately targeting the civilian population of Azerbaijan to create panic. For 30 years, the two sides have not been able to settle the conflict. While Armenia has tried to retain its war gains, Azerbaijan has insisted on ending Armenian occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent Azerbaijani districts — making up almost 14 percent of the country’s territory. Four United Nations resolutions and a UN General Assembly resolution have reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity calling on Armenia to withdraw its armed forces. The warring sides already refer to the fighting as the second Karabakh war. The difference with the first war, however, is that both are now heavily armed with more sophisticated weapons, including missiles and drones that can inflict far more destruction. Armenia and Azerbaijan are among the most militarized states in the world, with both being primarily armed by Russia. Baku has also purchased drones from Israel and Turkey. Most recently, Russia has supplied military equipment to Armenia via Iran, causing the large Azeri population in Iran to protest Tehran’s assistance to Yerevan. Videos from Iran show attacks on trucks carrying Russian weaponry to Armenia amid increasing restlessness among the estimated 20 million ethnic Azeris inside Iran. The Armenian media has blamed Turkey for the conflict, claiming that Ankara has sent Syrian fighters to help Azerbaijan and presenting Armenia as a defender against international terrorism. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has also asserted that if Azerbaijan’s army succeeds, it would mean genocide for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, referencing the genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire in 1915. He omitted the fact that 30 years ago it was Armenian forces that committed the ethnic expulsion of almost one million Azerbaijanis from Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding regions. Although Turkey has expressed strong support for Azerbaijan’s attempt to regain its territory, there is no evidence that Ankara is actively assisting Baku militarily. Ankara claims that a small number of Turkish F-16 warplanes stationed in Azerbaijan are not involved in the fighting, while the joint military drills that took place during the summer are routine events and much smaller than Russia’s multi-national Kavkaz 2020 exercises in southern Russia and Armenia. Moscow has been surprisingly reserved since the conflict erupted and may be banking on a short war that will make both sides even more dependent on Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has emphasized that Moscow’s military agreement with Yerevan only applies to the territory of Armenia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov elaborated that Russia’s obligations under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) do not extend to Karabakh. Faced with Moscow’s subdued response, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that Yerevan could make concessions over the Nagorno-Karabakh region if Azerbaijan was ready to do the same. Washington now has a valuable opportunity to begin decisive international mediation not only to stop the armed conflict but also to negotiate a durable settlement. Previous formats, including the OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, France and the U.S., have obviously failed to resolve the conflict. While France is a weak party without the full force of the European Union, Russia has exerted an inordinate influence in the process and prefers to keep Armenia and Azerbaijan embroiled in a permanent dispute that serves its ”divide and rule” policy. U.S. leadership, with support from the EU and NATO allies, can not only defuse the war, it can also prevent the region from falling under even more pernicious Russian and Iranian influence.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov elaborated that Russia’s obligations under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) do not extend to Karabakh. Faced with Moscow’s subdued response, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that Yerevan could make concessions over the Nagorno-Karabakh region if Azerbaijan was ready to do the same. Washington now has a valuable opportunity to begin decisive international mediation not only to stop the armed conflict but also to negotiate a durable settlement. Previous formats, including the OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, France and the U.S., have obviously failed to resolve the conflict. While France is a weak party without the full force of the European Union, Russia has exerted an inordinate influence in the process and prefers to keep Armenia and Azerbaijan embroiled in a permanent dispute that serves its ”divide and rule” policy. U.S. leadership, with support from the EU and NATO allies, can not only defuse the war, it can also prevent the region from falling under even more pernicious Russian and Iranian influence.

News article:
Russia moved to stop the worst escalation of fighting in the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh in more than a quarter-century by hosting cease-fire talks on Friday. Late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement calling for a break in the fighting between the Armenian and Azerbaijani forces that have raged for nearly two weeks over the region. The Kremlin said Putin’s initiative followed a series of calls with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. Advertisement For all the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app. The latest outburst of fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces began Sept. 27 and marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The region lies in Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994. The Kremlin said Putin proposed calling a cease-fire to exchange prisoners and collect the bodies of dead soldiers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov greeted his Armenian and Azerbaijani counterparts at the ministry’s mansion in Moscow on Friday afternoon. Read more: Israel sending weapons to Azerbaijan as fight with Armenia rages on: Sources Armenia said it’s open to holding a cease-fire, while Azerbaijan has made a potential truce conditional on the Armenian forces’ withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh, arguing that the failure of international efforts to negotiate a settlement left it no other choice but to try to reclaim its lands by force. Speaking in an address to the nation, the Azerbaijani president said nearly three decades of international talks “haven’t yielded an inch of progress, we haven’t been given back an inch of the occupied lands.” “Mediators and leaders of some international organizations have stated that there is no military solution to the conflict,” Aliyev said. “I have disagreed with the thesis, and I have been right. The conflict is now being settled by military means and political means will come next.” Azerbaijani officials and Nagorno-Karabakh separatist authorities said heavy shelling continued overnight. Armenian officials say Turkey is involved in the conflict and is sending Syrian mercenaries to fight on Azerbaijan’s side. Turkey has publicly backed Azerbaijan in the conflict but has denied sending combatants to the region. In an interview with CNN Arabic aired Thursday, Azerbaijan’s president admitted that Turkish F-16 fighter jets have stayed on in Azerbaijan weeks after a joint military exercise, but insisted that they have remained grounded. Armenian officials had earlier claimed that a Turkish F-16 shot down an Armenian warplane, a claim that both Turkey and Azerbaijan have denied. Aliyev’s office said French President Emmanuel Macron called him Friday to discuss the conflict but wouldn’t give any details of the conversation. The call followed Macron’s conversation with the Armenian prime minister late Thursday. Macron’s office voiced hope that a truce could be negotiated soon, noting that it was coordinating its efforts with the Kremlin.

Elsewhere in his remarks, the official accused Baku of “pursuing a policy of genocide against people who have been fighting for their freedom since 1988,” and alleged that “Turkey and international terrorism” were helping the Azeri side. Reporting that civilian objects in Karabakh have been attacked by rocket artillery and drones, Harutyunyan stressed that “universal human values are being violated, the civilian population is being annihilated, and after this they expect Artsakh to agree to their demands. This will not happen. Artsakh enjoys the right to self-defence, and will not be part of Azerbaijan.” Also on Sunday, Armenian Defence Ministry spokesman Artsrun Hovhannisyan reported that strike drones were being delivered to Azerbaijan from Turkey and Israel under the guise of humanitarian aid. Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to halt fighting in the Nagorno-Karabakh starting Saturday at 12:00 local time after 10 hours of negotiations between the two countries’ foreign ministers in Moscow on Friday. Both sides have since accused one another of violating the truce. Armenia has repeatedly accused Turkey and Israel of involvement in the conflict, and has alleged that Ankara has deployed Syrian mercenaries in Karabakh. Baku has rejected these allegations, with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev saying last week that the country’s army of 100,000 was sufficient for Azerbaijan's operations in the region.

The region at the center of renewed fighting had been hailed a mini tiger economy after a decade of 9-10% growth. Warring Azerbaijan and Armenia, on the other hand, needed a distraction from their economic woes. If it were internationally recognized as a country, Nagorno-Karabakh would have one of the smallest economies in the world. With GDP at just $713 million (€603 million) in 2019, it ranks lower than most Caribbean and Pacific islands. GDP in dollar terms, however, only tells part of the story. The formerly autonomous region of Azerbaijan, now populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, has sustained economic growth at around 10% over the past decade — and more than 17% in 2017, according to local government statistics cited by the Russian business newspaper RBC. Those economic achievements will quickly fall by the wayside if a temporary ceasefire fails to hold and the renewed fighting of the past two weeks continues. More than 400 people have been killed in Karabakh since September 27. Read more: EU fails to act on Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan Though the violence is primarily a conflict over an ethnic and territorial dispute that pre-dates the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic woes affecting the warring parties may have helped prompt a return to hostilities, according to regional experts. Hard times fueled by pandemic "The coronavirus, together with the collapse in the oil price, has hurt Azerbaijan's economy just as it was implementing much-needed reforms," journalist and South Caucasus expert Silvia Stöber told DW, referring to the endemic corruption that has been fueled by its energy-dependent economy. Despite attempts to diversify, the oil and gas sector still makes up around 40% of Azerbaijan's GDP and is responsible for 90% of exports. From January to April, exports fell by a quarter, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which also predicts that GDP will sink 3% year-on-year. EBRD noted that the strict lockdown measures introduced earlier this year hit the domestic economy hard, particularly the financial sector. Armenia, too, which last year recorded its strongest growth since 2007 at 7.6%, is expected to see a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, according to the EBRD. Stöber said Armenia had been rolling out its own reforms to tackle decades of corruption that sparked the 2018 Velvet Revolution when the health emergency hit in March. The country, which relies on hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign currency remittances from its 11 million-strong diaspora, saw its revenues dry up, she added. At the height of the first wave of the pandemic, money transfers from abroad dropped nearly 40%, the EBRD said,. "The conflict is a distraction from the economic and social situation," Stöber told DW. "It has encouraged people — even those critical of their governments — to rally around their flag." Workers at the Karavay bread factory bake bread to ship to members of the Armenian military in the frontline city of Martakert Image: Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images Energy pipelines at risk A lasting conflict would have the potential to cause significant economic damage in the region, and both countries' energy infrastructure could be targeted. Earlier this week, Azerbaijan complained that the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline was attacked by Armenian rockets — charges that Yerevan insisted were "outright lies." Read more: Half of Nagorno-Karabakh's population displaced by fighting Azerbaijan's main oil and gas pipelines, heading for the European market, snake through Georgia and Turkey. Armenia's energy, meanwhile, is supplied by pipelines from Russia and Iran. A protracted war could drag in regional powers: Turkey, which is Azerbaijan's closest ally, and Russia, which is on friendly terms with both sides and has a defense pact with Armenia. While Moscow has, so far, attempted to remain on the sidelines, Russian President Vladimir Putin could use the conflict as a way of pressuring Yerevan to accept even closer economic ties. Putin does nothing "Russia could stop this fight at any point," Ben Aris, editor-in-chief of the Berlin-based BNE Intellinews, told DW. "They did in 2016 when the conflict was only allowed to go on for four days, but this time, they've done nothing." Putin plans to expand the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU), the Russian equivalent of the European Union for former Soviet states, while Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is seen as too close to the West and could hamper that ambition. Moscow, meanwhile, sells arms to both warring parties, while Ankara recently delivered Turkish-made drones to Azerbaijan for $30 million. The oil-rich country has been a growing customer for Turkish weapons and military training. The Armenian Defense Ministry released a video on October 1, allegedly showing the shooting down of an Azerbaijani unmanned aerial vehicle Image: Armenian Defense Ministry Karabakh itself boomed Before the pandemic hit, Nagorno-Karabakh had a small but strong diversified economy, heavily reliant on the extraction of minerals and precious stones and metals, including gems, gold, copper and construction materials. According to RBC, three-quarters of Karabakh's exports are sent to its neighbor and benefactor, where they can be relabeled as "Made in Armenia," while the rest go to Russia. The disputed region is self-sufficient in electricity and even exports power from its hydroelectric dams to Armenia. However, strict lockdown measures as a result of the health crisis have hit local supply chains, leaving many of Karabakh's exports stuck in Armenia, Aris said. The economy has contracted 1.5% this year and is likely to plummet further as a result of the conflict. A huge construction boom funded by Armenian government subsidies and remittances from the country's diaspora has ground to a halt for now. Until recently, the creation of new villages and towns had smoothed the way for more ethnic Armenians to move into the region and build a better life. "If you want a parallel, it's like Israel putting settlers into the Golan Heights," Aris explained. Before the conflict flared up again, average incomes in Karabakh were slightly higher than in Armenia, he said, adding that due to the amount of business, construction, mining and manufacturing activity, "life in the breakaway region was relatively good."

The region at the center of renewed fighting had been hailed a mini tiger economy after a decade of 9-10% growth. Warring Azerbaijan and Armenia, on the other hand, needed a distraction from their economic woes. If it were internationally recognized as a country, Nagorno-Karabakh would have one of the smallest economies in the world. With GDP at just $713 million (€603 million) in 2019, it ranks lower than most Caribbean and Pacific islands. GDP in dollar terms, however, only tells part of the story. The formerly autonomous region of Azerbaijan, now populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, has sustained economic growth at around 10% over the past decade — and more than 17% in 2017, according to local government statistics cited by the Russian business newspaper RBC. Those economic achievements will quickly fall by the wayside if a temporary ceasefire fails to hold and the renewed fighting of the past two weeks continues. More than 400 people have been killed in Karabakh since September 27.

Hard times fueled by pandemic "The coronavirus, together with the collapse in the oil price, has hurt Azerbaijan's economy just as it was implementing much-needed reforms," journalist and South Caucasus expert Silvia Stöber told DW, referring to the endemic corruption that has been fueled by its energy-dependent economy. Despite attempts to diversify, the oil and gas sector still makes up around 40% of Azerbaijan's GDP and is responsible for 90% of exports. From January to April, exports fell by a quarter, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which also predicts that GDP will sink 3% year-on-year. EBRD noted that the strict lockdown measures introduced earlier this year hit the domestic economy hard, particularly the financial sector. Armenia, too, which last year recorded its strongest growth since 2007 at 7.6%, is expected to see a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, according to the EBRD. Stöber said Armenia had been rolling out its own reforms to tackle decades of corruption that sparked the 2018 Velvet Revolution when the health emergency hit in March. The country, which relies on hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign currency remittances from its 11 million-strong diaspora, saw its revenues dry up, she added. At the height of the first wave of the pandemic, money transfers from abroad dropped nearly 40%, the EBRD said,. "The conflict is a distraction from the economic and social situation," Stöber told DW. "It has encouraged people — even those critical of their governments — to rally around their flag."

Earlier this week, Azerbaijan complained that the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline was attacked by Armenian rockets — charges that Yerevan insisted were "outright lies." Read more: Half of Nagorno-Karabakh's population displaced by fighting Azerbaijan's main oil and gas pipelines, heading for the European market, snake through Georgia and Turkey. Armenia's energy, meanwhile, is supplied by pipelines from Russia and Iran. A protracted war could drag in regional powers: Turkey, which is Azerbaijan's closest ally, and Russia, which is on friendly terms with both sides and has a defense pact with Armenia. While Moscow has, so far, attempted to remain on the sidelines, Russian President Vladimir Putin could use the conflict as a way of pressuring Yerevan to accept even closer economic ties. Putin does nothing "Russia could stop this fight at any point," Ben Aris, editor-in-chief of the Berlin-based BNE Intellinews, told DW. "They did in 2016 when the conflict was only allowed to go on for four days, but this time, they've done nothing." Putin plans to expand the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU), the Russian equivalent of the European Union for former Soviet states, while Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is seen as too close to the West and could hamper that ambition. Moscow, meanwhile, sells arms to both warring parties, while Ankara recently delivered Turkish-made drones to Azerbaijan for $30 million. The oil-rich country has been a growing customer for Turkish weapons and military training. The Armenian Defense Ministry released a video on October 1, allegedly showing the shooting down of an Azerbaijani unmanned aerial vehicle Image: Armenian Defense Ministry Karabakh itself boomed Before the pandemic hit, Nagorno-Karabakh had a small but strong diversified economy, heavily reliant on the extraction of minerals and precious stones and metals, including gems, gold, copper and construction materials. According to RBC, three-quarters of Karabakh's exports are sent to its neighbor and benefactor, where they can be relabeled as "Made in Armenia," while the rest go to Russia. The disputed region is self-sufficient in electricity and even exports power from its hydroelectric dams to Armenia. However, strict lockdown measures as a result of the health crisis have hit local supply chains, leaving many of Karabakh's exports stuck in Armenia, Aris said. The economy has contracted 1.5% this year and is likely to plummet further as a result of the conflict. A huge construction boom funded by Armenian government subsidies and remittances from the country's diaspora has ground to a halt for now. Until recently, the creation of new villages and towns had smoothed the way for more ethnic Armenians to move into the region and build a better life. "If you want a parallel, it's like Israel putting settlers into the Golan Heights," Aris explained. Before the conflict flared up again, average incomes in Karabakh were slightly higher than in Armenia, he said, adding that due to the amount of business, construction, mining and manufacturing activity, "life in the breakaway region was relatively good."

News article:
The same day, the Armenian side announced the destruction of Turkish-made drones in the combat zone, including over Stepanakert and Karabakh’s northern regions. Meanwhile, Baku reported that more than half a dozen civilians had been injured in the city of Terter in an Armenian artillery attack, and reported the destruction of an Armenian S-300 air defence system. Armenia denied the latter claim, and accused Azerbaijan of transferring control of air operations inside Karabakh to the Turkish Air Force. The war extended into cyberspace, with both sides releasing footage of the alleged destruction of enemy troops and equipment. Baku also accused Armenian forces of employing the Tochka-U tactical missile system. Yerevan denied this, and reported that Karabakh self-defence forces had turned back attacks on the breakaway from the north and south. On Thursday, October 1, Azerbaijan again reported that civilian areas in Terter had come under attack, and that one civilian was killed. The Armenian side reported the destruction of three Azerbaijani Air Force Su-25s and two Mi-24 helicopters, with one of the aircraft said to have gone down over Iran. The Azeri side denied the claims and reported that all its aircraft were “combat-ready and fully operational.” Baku also accused Armenia of hiring foreign mercenaries from the Middle East. October 1 also saw two French journalists from Le Monde injured in the conflict zone, with several other foreign and Armenian journalists said to have come under fire. Yerevan recalled its ambassador to Israel for talks over Tel Aviv’s supply of arms to Baku. On October 2, the European Union formally called on Turkey to stop its blatant interference in the Karabakh conflict. The same day, a bipartisan group of 49 US lawmakers called on the State Department to formally “clearly and unequivocally condemn Azerbaijan’s unreasonable aggression” and to threaten a cut-off of US aid. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Paris had evidence that 300 Syrian jihadist militants had been transferred to the Karabakh warzone through Turkey. Ankara reiterated that it was calling on Azerbaijan to continue to liberate “its territories.” JUST IN: Azerbaijan's Ministry of Defense publishes footage of Armenia's Armed Forces being shelled#SputnikUpdates https://t.co/eiBWP78qvT pic.twitter.com/yzePQqXg0z — Sputnik (@SputnikInt) October 2, 2020 Yerevan restated its willingness to co-operate with the established OSCE Minsk Group to reach a ceasefire, and accused the Azeri side of using cluster bombs and ballistic missiles, calculating that some 157 civilians in Karabakh had been killed over the six preceding days of fighting. Baku reported that Armenian artillery had again shelled Terter, as well as several Azerbaijani villages. 'Unprecedented' Fighting On October 3, as the flare-up neared the one week mark, President Aliyev announced that Armenia had “destroyed” the Karabakh negotiations process, stressed that Turkey is not involved in the conflict militarily in any way, shape or form, and suggested that Russia has a “special” role to play as a mediator owing to its good historical relations with both Azerbaijan and Armenia. The same day, Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the scale of the conflict unprecedented, and suggested that Armenia would be ready to discuss the deployment of Russian peacekeepers.

News article:
Russia on Monday urged Armenia and Azerbaijan to immediately start observing a ceasefire agreed over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region as intense fighting between the two Caucasus rivals cast fresh doubt over the accord. The clashes have raged for the last two weeks over the breakaway region of Azerbaijan controlled by Armenians after a 1990s war and whose independence is recognised by no state. The fighting, the worst since a 1994 ceasefire, has sparked fears of a regional conflict, with Turkey backing Azerbaijan, Armenia seeking to pull ex-Soviet ally Russia in on its side and Iran looking on warily. After 11 hours of talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in Moscow, the two sides agreed early Saturday to a humanitarian ceasefire. But repeated clashes have so far made a mockery of the truce deal, with both sides Monday accusing the other of repeated violations. "We expect that the decisions that have been adopted will be rigorously observed by both parties," said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow after hosting his Armenian counterpart Zohrab Mnatsakanyan. The truce -- whose immediate aim was to exchange prisoners and the bodies of people killed -- had to be implemented on the ground and work was underway to ensure verification mechanisms were in place, he added. Lavrov said he believed the "all-night vigil" that clinched the ceasefire would "not be in vain" and that the issue could be resolved on the ground "in the nearest time". French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said it was "indispensable and urgent" that the truce was "strictly" obeyed. An AFP correspondent in the Azerbaijani town of Barda not far from the front line heard thumping echoes of shelling Monday morning and the noise intensified in the afternoon. In the Azerbaijani village of Otuzikiler where many have fled from shelling, 42-year-old Gultekin Rakhimova said her three small children had not slept properly since rockets rained down on their houses two weeks ago. "They wake up and cry. They have nightmares because the dead come back in their dreams," she said as one of her boys tossed pebbles at a rooster outside their temporary new home in a village school. In Karabakh's main city of Stepanakert, an AFP photographer heard shelling from the direction of the town of Hadrut. "Armenian armed forces, who did not comply with the humanitarian truce, repeatedly tried to attack the positions of the Azerbaijan army," the Azerbaijani defence ministry said. Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said Azerbaijan was "now intensively shelling the southern front". The 1990s war -- which ended with the 1994 ceasefire that did not present a long-term solution to the conflict -- cost the lives of about 30,000 people. Nearly 600 people, including 67 civilians, have been killed in the latest fighting since last month, according to a tally based on tolls given by both sides. Analysts have long warned that Nagorno-Karabakh was the most combustible of the unresolved conflicts left over after the fall of the Soviet Union, with Azerbaijan vowing to regain control of the territory and Armenians insisting they would never cede ground. The so far fruitless, decades-long search for a settlement over Karabakh has been overseen by the Minsk Group of world and regional powers chaired by senior diplomats from France, Russia and the United States. Mnatsakanyan was due to meet the Minsk Group co-chairs in Moscow after his discussions with Lavrov. Renewed fighting has stoked fears of a full-blown war embroiling Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan and has been accused by Paris and Moscow of sending pro-Ankara Syrian militiamen to help Baku. Lavrov said Monday that his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu had in telephone talks expressed his support for the Moscow ceasefire deal. But in another call Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar urged his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu to convince Armenia to withdraw from Karabakh, warning "Azerbaijan will not wait 30 more years for a solution". Russia has a military base in Armenia and counts Yerevan as an ally in the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). Iran, which has warm relations with Armenia and is wary of Baku's military cooperation with Israel, has also expressed alarm over the reports of Syrian militia being sent to Azerbaijan. Iran's foreign ministry expressed regret "over the violation of the announced ceasefire", urging both sides to resume talks.

News article:
The recent attack on Azerbaijan’s residential areas in the territories occupied by Armenia for the last 26 years has quickly spiraled away from the central claims of Baku about its national sovereignty and territorial integrity into a geopolitical free-for-all, with multiple parties seeking to get in on the action in some capacity or else seeking to have the recognition of their own unrelated claims and narratives recognized by the international community. While much of the discussion has focused on the Armenia-Azerbaijan war as a proxy for territorial ambitions by Russia and Turkey, Iran’s role in supporting Armenia deserves wider attention, particularly in its potential effect on Israel’s interests in the region. Important to note is that this relationship has been bilateral. Armenia in the past has provided Iran with weapons, which were then used to kill American troops, according to WikiLeaks revelations of U.S. State Department cables. Iran, on the other hand, backed Armenia on critical matters such as Armenia’s occupation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Iran’s interest in this matter is its concern over the areas in the Northwest of the country close to the conflict zone—East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan and Ardebil, which are peripheral areas populated mostly by ethnic Azerbaijanis. Iran itself is comprised mostly of non-ethnic Pars with the majority being Azerbaijanis. The rights of non-Persian nations in Iran have been challenged by Iran’s ethnocentric ideology and deliberate strategy of dividing and conquering its ethnically diverse population. As Brenda Schaffer explains, Iran will choose pragmatic geopolitical consideration over alleged principles of Islamic solidarity anytime. Azerbaijan, while priding itself on its Shi’a Muslim social identity, has turned away from the Khomeinist model Iran has tried to impose upon or sell to Shi’a populations in the Middle East with some success. Azerbaijani society promoted religious reform through intellectual discourse even before the Soviet annexation, rejecting clerical dominance over the political life and refusing to be bound by ijtihad, Islamic legal precedent. Clericalism in Azerbaijan was finished by the early 20th century with secular intellectuals prevailing, and with nationalists providing a counterbalance to the religious movements. Indeed, Azerbaijan successfully and voluntarily managed to combine Sunni and Shi’a boards, promoted minority Sunni Muslims in the military ranks, and created joint mosques where worshippers of both backgrounds were accommodated. The Soviet Union disrupted vibrant and independent religious life inside the country, discrediting official institutions, and making it difficult to provide value and education to the public. Independent clerical groups that began to emerge accused the official bodies of collaborationism with the Soviets. Iran saw an opportunity to appeal to the vacuum of independent central religious currents through propaganda and outreach, though it faced staunch resistance from pan-Turkic leaders. At the same time, in opposition to Soviet suppression of religion, revival movements grew and various countries, including Iran, have tried to import preachers and religion, focusing on the peripheral region. Under President Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan has cracked down on the proliferation of foreign-funded NGOs and mosques, instead providing generous state funding to all religious institutions, and further established a new Institute on Theology which would educate new imams according to the once-rich and flourishing tradition of independent Azerbaijani Shi’ism that had broad support before the Soviet disruption of intellectual and religious life. For Iran, these moves to counter its exportation of the revolution provide an additional challenge in its ambition to spread influence and to gain control of the Caspian and energy resources, essentially colonizing the Caucasus the way Tehran has aspired to dominate and permeate the Middle East. Furthermore, Azerbaijan’s resistance to the ideological outreach was a threat to the Islamic Republic internally, as its approach could be adopted by the Azerbaijani and other Turkic populations inside the country, causing a potential collapse of internal institutions. Therefore, despite Armenia portraying itself as a Christian haven in an appeal for Western support, it made sense for Iran to exploit long-standing tensions between the two countries that predate the Soviet Union inspired attacks and later invasion of U.N.-delineated border territories, in part to prevent Azerbaijan from gaining too much influence with the Iranian citizens and in part to block its regional maneuvers. Furthermore, Iran’s alliance with Russia—challenged by divergent interests in Syria and historic competition—is strengthened by cooperation over this issue, with Russia being the primary backer of Armenia’s incursions. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Iran’s agenda is multi-layered; not the least of it, pushing Azerbaijan closer to Turkey and damaging its independent image in the eyes of the Western countries would help Iran politically in undermining another pro-Western country that stands as a bulwark against Tehran’s influence, but also facilitate the goal of spreading Khomeinism in border areas and beyond, taking advantage of tumult and chaos. Iran, therefore, has been known to bring in physical reinforcements to aid Armenia, particularly prior to the earlier, apparently test attacks aimed at Azerbaijan’s energy-rich Tovuz region in the summer. Furthermore, despite staunch and vocal opposition to Turkey, Armenia has been working closely with Iran and Qatar—one of Turkey’s leading funders and ideological and political allies—on various energy and infrastructure projects. Political alliances are as self-evident as questionable defense arrangements. An Armenian activist has taken part in the pro-Iran, pro-BDS radical self-styled feminist group “Code Pink,” decrying the alleged occupation of Judea and Samaria, while promoting Armenia’s occupation of the areas, which the media, ironically has titled “disputed.” This individual worked with the Armenia Tree Project promoting various projects in the occupied lands. In Lebanon, Armenian political groups have been known to join forces with the Iran-backed Hezbollah. These seemingly isolated events, in reality, contribute to an increasingly complex geopolitical reality directly threatening Israel, which is taking steps to prepare for another potential conflagration with Hezbollah. Not only is Israel now forced to consider the consequences of clashes between two countries it has diplomatic relationships with and considers allies, but the involvement of third parties, including Iran, is raising the question about its own security and potential for far greater destabilization in its proximity down the road. Iran’s involvement threatens to attract radicalized militias into the sensitive Caucasus arena. While Armenia and Turkey are exchanging accusations of alleged intent to bring foreign fighters into the region, Iran has a history of actually attempting terrorist plots against Israeli targets in Baku in 2009 and 2012, which were foiled. The Armenian-Turkish sideshow is a welcome respite for Iran. Not only the complicated theater of war distracts from the issue of Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity but it creates a window of opportunity for Iranian fighters to slither stealthily into the conflict. Iran’s encirclement strategy in Bahrain is working just as well in the Caucasus with a significant (and radicalized) Iranian population rooted in nearby Georgia. Armenia is also one of the favored tourist destination for Iranians, as well as a transit zone between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union. Needless to say, facilitating the passage to Azerbaijan and other areas through a friendly neighboring country is as much about economics as it is about security. For Israel, it means an increasingly spread-out presence of Iranian nationals and possibly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps contingent and other groups throughout the Caucasus. Given the triangular and increasingly close relationship between Jerusalem, Baku and Abu Dhabi further facilitated by the recent Abraham Accords—and creating a sort of security triangle between Eurasia and the Middle East—Iranian interventionism can pose a risk to this arrangement, weakening the political border areas among the countries. Iran’s facilitation of Armenia’s aggression essentially weakens Azerbaijan as a strategic security partner for Israel; overwhelms the Caucasus with the same type of destabilizing activity that has already turned Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and parts of Yemen into no-go zones; and creates another regional sphere of influence for Tehran. That, in turn, means yet another potential front of instability that can create a zone of attacks against Israel. While Armenia is using Israel for various political reasons, the volume of economic, humanitarian and security cooperation with Azerbaijan cannot be overestimated, and neither can its role in addressing issues of mutual interest in the European Union, which Armenia does not provide. It is also the one friendly spot situated between Turkey, Iran and parts of the Arab world under heavy Iranian influence. Iran’s game plan here is not hard to foresee.

The rights of non-Persian nations in Iran have been challenged by Iran’s ethnocentric ideology and deliberate strategy of dividing and conquering its ethnically diverse population. As Brenda Schaffer explains, Iran will choose pragmatic geopolitical consideration over alleged principles of Islamic solidarity anytime. Azerbaijan, while priding itself on its Shi’a Muslim social identity, has turned away from the Khomeinist model Iran has tried to impose upon or sell to Shi’a populations in the Middle East with some success. Azerbaijani society promoted religious reform through intellectual discourse even before the Soviet annexation, rejecting clerical dominance over the political life and refusing to be bound by ijtihad, Islamic legal precedent. Clericalism in Azerbaijan was finished by the early 20th century with secular intellectuals prevailing, and with nationalists providing a counterbalance to the religious movements. Indeed, Azerbaijan successfully and voluntarily managed to combine Sunni and Shi’a boards, promoted minority Sunni Muslims in the military ranks, and created joint mosques where worshippers of both backgrounds were accommodated. The Soviet Union disrupted vibrant and independent religious life inside the country, discrediting official institutions, and making it difficult to provide value and education to the public. Independent clerical groups that began to emerge accused the official bodies of collaborationism with the Soviets. Iran saw an opportunity to appeal to the vacuum of independent central religious currents through propaganda and outreach, though it faced staunch resistance from pan-Turkic leaders. At the same time, in opposition to Soviet suppression of religion, revival movements grew and various countries, including Iran, have tried to import preachers and religion, focusing on the peripheral region. Under President Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan has cracked down on the proliferation of foreign-funded NGOs and mosques, instead providing generous state funding to all religious institutions, and further established a new Institute on Theology which would educate new imams according to the once-rich and flourishing tradition of independent Azerbaijani Shi’ism that had broad support before the Soviet disruption of intellectual and religious life. For Iran, these moves to counter its exportation of the revolution provide an additional challenge in its ambition to spread influence and to gain control of the Caspian and energy resources, essentially colonizing the Caucasus the way Tehran has aspired to dominate and permeate the Middle East. Furthermore, Azerbaijan’s resistance to the ideological outreach was a threat to the Islamic Republic internally, as its approach could be adopted by the Azerbaijani and other Turkic populations inside the country, causing a potential collapse of internal institutions. Therefore, despite Armenia portraying itself as a Christian haven in an appeal for Western support, it made sense for Iran to exploit long-standing tensions between the two countries that predate the Soviet Union inspired attacks and later invasion of U.N.-delineated border territories, in part to prevent Azerbaijan from gaining too much influence with the Iranian citizens and in part to block its regional maneuvers. Furthermore, Iran’s alliance with Russia—challenged by divergent interests in Syria and historic competition—is strengthened by cooperation over this issue, with Russia being the primary backer of Armenia’s incursions. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Iran’s agenda is multi-layered; not the least of it, pushing Azerbaijan closer to Turkey and damaging its independent image in the eyes of the Western countries would help Iran politically in undermining another pro-Western country that stands as a bulwark against Tehran’s influence, but also facilitate the goal of spreading Khomeinism in border areas and beyond, taking advantage of tumult and chaos. Iran, therefore, has been known to bring in physical reinforcements to aid Armenia, particularly prior to the earlier, apparently test attacks aimed at Azerbaijan’s energy-rich Tovuz region in the summer. Furthermore, despite staunch and vocal opposition to Turkey, Armenia has been working closely with Iran and Qatar—one of Turkey’s leading funders and ideological and political allies—on various energy and infrastructure projects. Political alliances are as self-evident as questionable defense arrangements. An Armenian activist has taken part in the pro-Iran, pro-BDS radical self-styled feminist group “Code Pink,” decrying the alleged occupation of Judea and Samaria, while promoting Armenia’s occupation of the areas, which the media, ironically has titled “disputed.” This individual worked with the Armenia Tree Project promoting various projects in the occupied lands. In Lebanon, Armenian political groups have been known to join forces with the Iran-backed Hezbollah. These seemingly isolated events, in reality, contribute to an increasingly complex geopolitical reality directly threatening Israel, which is taking steps to prepare for another potential conflagration with Hezbollah. Not only is Israel now forced to consider the consequences of clashes between two countries it has diplomatic relationships with and considers allies, but the involvement of third parties, including Iran, is raising the question about its own security and potential for far greater destabilization in its proximity down the road. Iran’s involvement threatens to attract radicalized militias into the sensitive Caucasus arena. While Armenia and Turkey are exchanging accusations of alleged intent to bring foreign fighters into the region, Iran has a history of actually attempting terrorist plots against Israeli targets in Baku in 2009 and 2012, which were foiled. The Armenian-Turkish sideshow is a welcome respite for Iran. Not only the complicated theater of war distracts from the issue of Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity but it creates a window of opportunity for Iranian fighters to slither stealthily into the conflict. Iran’s encirclement strategy in Bahrain is working just as well in the Caucasus with a significant (and radicalized) Iranian population rooted in nearby Georgia. Armenia is also one of the favored tourist destination for Iranians, as well as a transit zone between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union. Needless to say, facilitating the passage to Azerbaijan and other areas through a friendly neighboring country is as much about economics as it is about security. For Israel, it means an increasingly spread-out presence of Iranian nationals and possibly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps contingent and other groups throughout the Caucasus. Given the triangular and increasingly close relationship between Jerusalem, Baku and Abu Dhabi further facilitated by the recent Abraham Accords—and creating a sort of security triangle between Eurasia and the Middle East—Iranian interventionism can pose a risk to this arrangement, weakening the political border areas among the countries. Iran’s facilitation of Armenia’s aggression essentially weakens Azerbaijan as a strategic security partner for Israel; overwhelms the Caucasus with the same type of destabilizing activity that has already turned Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and parts of Yemen into no-go zones; and creates another regional sphere of influence for Tehran. That, in turn, means yet another potential front of instability that can create a zone of attacks against Israel. While Armenia is using Israel for various political reasons, the volume of economic, humanitarian and security cooperation with Azerbaijan cannot be overestimated, and neither can its role in addressing issues of mutual interest in the European Union, which Armenia does not provide. It is also the one friendly spot situated between Turkey, Iran and parts of the Arab world under heavy Iranian influence. Iran’s game plan here is not hard to foresee.

News article:
The recent attack on Azerbaijan’s residential areas in the territories occupied by Armenia for the last 26 years has quickly spiraled away from the central claims of Baku about its national sovereignty and territorial integrity into a geopolitical free-for-all, with multiple parties seeking to get in on the action in some capacity or else seeking to have the recognition of their own unrelated claims and narratives recognized by the international community. While much of the discussion has focused on the Armenia-Azerbaijan war as a proxy for territorial ambitions by Russia and Turkey, Iran’s role in supporting Armenia deserves wider attention, particularly in its potential effect on Israel’s interests in the region. Important to note is that this relationship has been bilateral. Armenia in the past has provided Iran with weapons, which were then used to kill American troops, according to WikiLeaks revelations of U.S. State Department cables. Iran, on the other hand, backed Armenia on critical matters such as Armenia’s occupation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Iran’s interest in this matter is its concern over the areas in the Northwest of the country close to the conflict zone—East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan and Ardebil, which are peripheral areas populated mostly by ethnic Azerbaijanis.

News article:
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Tuesday said only a change in Turkey’s stance on Nagorno-Karabakh could convince Azerbaijan to halt military action over the region. But in his first interview since a ceasefire in the conflict was agreed to in Moscow on Saturday, he gave no indication that he expected Ankara to shift its position. The two neighbours have for decades been locked in a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnically Armenian area that broke away from Baku in a 1990s war that cost about 30,000 lives. Since fighting flared on September 27, Turkey has strongly backed Azerbaijan and said Armenian forces must leave the enclave, which is governed and populated by ethnic Armenians. French President Emmanuel Macron said Turkey had sent in Syrian mercenaries, as it did in Libya to back the Government of National Accord, drawing widespread condemnation from the international community. Ankara said on Tuesday that it should play a role in international discussions on the conflict, something Yerevan opposes. The ceasefire, brokered by Russia, is already badly frayed, with both sides accusing the other of attacks. At his official residence in Yerevan, Mr Pashinyan accused Turkey of sabotaging the ceasefire and trying to muscle its way into the South Caucasus region to further its expansionist ambitions. “I’m convinced that for as long as Turkey’s position remains unchanged, Azerbaijan will not stop fighting,” he told Reuters. Azerbaijan says it is open to the temporary humanitarian ceasefire to exchange prisoners and bodies, but claims Armenian forces have breached it. Armenia denies this. Iran said an unidentified drone crashed near its border with Azerbaijan earlier on Tuesday. The drone crashed in a village in Parsabad county, Ardebil province, along Iran's northern border, deputy governor Behrouz Nedayi told Iran’s state news agency Irna. "The drone's identity and cause of its crash in the area are being investigated," Mr Nedayi said, reporting no damage. Expand Autoplay Retired police officer Genadiy Avanesyan, 73, searches for belongings in the remains of his house, which is said was destroyed by Azeri shelling, in the city of Stepanaker. AFP On Tuesday, Armenian and Azerbaijani forces engaged in new fighting despite pleas from world and regional powers to observe the ceasefire. The International Committee of the Red Cross urged Armenia and Azerbaijan to finalise arrangements for it to handle an exchange of prisoners and bodies from the conflict. The fighting has killed almost 600, including 73 civilians, according to a tally based on partial tolls from both sides. "To date we keep discussing intensely with the sides on this topic," Martin Schuepp, ICRC's Eurasia director, said in Geneva. "But no meaningful agreement has been reached yet that will allow us to actually proceed to such an exchange. "So discussions are going on with the sides and we hope that the conditions will be met to actually implement such an operation in the future." Mr Schuepp called for the safety of Red Cross staff to be guaranteed. The EU and Iran have also called on the parties to observe the ceasefire. Some estimates show Azeris make up 10 million of the 80 million population of Iran, which is also home to almost 100,000 Armenians. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joined the ceasefire call on Tuesday. "The United States calls on Azerbaijan and Armenia to implement their commitments to a ceasefire as agreed," Mr Pompeo wrote on Twitter. "We deplore the loss of human life and remain committed to a peaceful settlement." But concerns remain over the role of Turkey. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said from Britain that 1,450 Syrian mercenaries had gone to Azerbaijan, including 250 who travelled in the last week. It said 119 of them had died, with 78 of them repatriated to Syria and other bodies still in Azerbaijan. Armenia is part of a regional Russia-led security group but Moscow has so far refused to become implicated in the conflict. Yet analysts say Turkey's involvement will put further strain on relations between President Vladimir Putin and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

News article:
As the conflict rages in Nagorno-Karabakh, the question of belonging rises to the fore among Middle East nations The largely Shia-dominated Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey in its war with Armenia. The Shia Islamic Republic of Iran favours Armenia and Sunni Arab nations seem to tilt towards the mostly Christian nation in the current conflict in the Caucasus. On a community level, division on the war in Nagorno-Karabakh is nowhere more evident than in Lebanon, the region’s most colourful mosaic of sects where Christians, Shias, Sunnis and other ethnicities are sharply split on the conflict between the two former Soviet republics. Across the Middle East, the war in Nagorno-Karabakh has sparked heated debate over the territorial conflict which is increasingly framed as a clash around religious, sectarian and ethnic lines. The long-simmering conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh flared up in late September apparently driven by an attempt by Azerbaijan to recapture swathes of territories occupied by Armenian forces for some 30 years. The current fighting between the two countries has been surpassing periodic escalations, involving troops, heavy artillery, tanks, missiles, warplanes and drones. Hundreds of people have been killed and wounded while thousands more have been driven from their homes on both sides as residents sought shelter from the relentless exchange of artillery fire. Like in many parts of the world where religious and ethnic divisions have been source of contention and manipulation, the new war in the disputed enclave has raised fears of outside intervention if the conflict gets much messier. The stakes in the Nagorno-Karabakh war are high, especially with main neighbouring countries having divided regional interests, while many of them may look at the conflict through a religious or ethnic lens. Turkey provides full-throated support to Azerbaijan mainly because Azeris belong to the same Turkish ethnicity, and also due to the long-standing hostility between the Turks and Armenians who accused the Ottomans of committing genocide against them at the beginning of the 20th century. Iran, meanwhile, has adopted a neutral stance and has repeatedly offered to mediate over the past three decades. But the Persian-dominated nation has been traditionally worried about rising Azeri nationalism, for fear it will spur its own large Turkish minority. Besides, Shia-dominated Iran wants to maintain its huge economic interests with largely Christian Armenia, especially the strategic route its northern neighbour provides for its trade and energy exports to Europe. Reactions from governments in the Arab and Islamic worlds have been largely muted, even though some of them feel the escalating conflict is too dangerous to ignore. For a region with diversified populations of religious, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, the conflict in the Caucasus will naturally, however, be a polarising and divisive issue in the Middle East. As hostilities rage between Azerbaijan and Armenia, an intense social media war is being waged for the moral high ground at a time of increasing gridlock on regional sectarian and ethnic conflicts. Many Christians are supporting Armenia, Turkomans back Azerbaijan and Muslim Shia and Sunnis are divided between those who are toeing Iran’s line and those who are fearful of Turkey’s increasing influence in the region. Apart from the propaganda war to recruit official and public opinion, some Middle East communities are reportedly caught in the bloody conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and some are dying. While members of Syrian National Army (SNA), the umbrella term for a group of opposition militias backed by Turkey, are reportedly fighting with Azerbaijan, the Kurdish Democratic Party in Syria denied Turkish claims it had sent some of its troops to fight with Armenia. Another conflict between India and Pakistan last year also provoked similar controversy when New Delhi withdrew the special status of the Jammu and Kashmir region, virtually annexing the Muslim majority-dominated state to India. While many Muslims worldwide lambasted India for the annexation of the region, Pakistan was outraged by the muted response of most governments in the Islamic world despite desperate calls for support. Each of these two conflicts and the sentiments surrounding them have been the latest events underlining the dynamics around collective identities and signalling the emergence of a new outlook in international and regional relationships. These two conflicts will unlikely be the last example of polarisation in the Middle East which continues to witness tectonic socio-political changes in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Arab uprisings in 2011. Though communalism is deep rooted in Middle East history, the region has witnessed a tremendous shift towards sectarian and ethnicity-based politics which are redefining the sense of belonging of its individuals and its nations. While geopolitical and economic factors remain inarguably relevant in Middle East conflicts, religious and other ethnic identities deeply interwoven in its societies have demonstrated again a significant role in the region’s dynamics. Though state failure, dysfunctional governments and geopolitical discord have contributed to conflicts in countries such as Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Syria and Yemen, sectarianism remains behind present day unrest and upheavals. Worse still, these kinds of identity politics have surpassed their local influence to mean an eventual extension of regional politics into domestic affairs and national policies. This is clearly evident in Iran’s and Turkey’s cases where Tehran and Ankara have been trying to consolidate influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Syria and Yemen, manipulating communal rifts in these beleaguered countries. Notwithstanding other key factors, the simmering sectarian conflicts in these hotbeds are largely blamed for the mounting identity crisis as seen in the region’s principal fault line: Sunni versus Shia. But it is also seen in other disputes haunting the Middle East, clearly articulated in the geopolitical and cultural competition between major stakeholders that entertain regional power. In a broader sense, the Middle East has been transformed by these identity politics, which relate to changes in attitudes and the adjustment of political culture to dynamically changing dimensions. Politics has shifted inwardly from traditional pan-Arabism, anti-Western and anti-Israel cleavages to a new cleavage focused on sectarianism or ethnicity and outwardly seeking new alliances. One interpretation of the new normalisation process triggered by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain striking agreements with Israel is that’s more about rising Iranian and Turkish regional influence than about peace. This may explain why reactions to the Caucasus war in the Middle East suggest a more dynamical approach to both identity politics and the nature of regional unrest, where both are interacting to enflame conflict. This could also explain the recent public debate about the viability of the Arab League after the organisation failed to support a Palestinian request to condemn the UAE and Bahrain deals with Israel in line with its numerous resolutions that ban normal relationships with Israel before it returns land it occupied in 1967. While traditionally the Arabs wanted closer relations with their brethren, now a sense of fear and disenfranchisement is making many Arab governments and individuals seek to maintain close relations with outside powers. Today, many Arabs blame the Palestinians for lacking a vision or a plan for peace with Israel. Others are looking to Iran and Turkey as a strategic threat, and not Israel. Some have even been contemplating establish an Arab NATO, which would bring the United States and Israel together with Sunni Arab states in opposition to Iran. Whether the cause of conflicts in the Middle East or the result, as some would argue, the question of belonging continues to impact national politics to become a driving force in geopolitical competition and regional political rivalries. Due to its very nature, the phenomenon, with its internal and external implications, will continue to drive the discourse of identity politics probably for a long time, while stoking debate over the future of the Middle East. *A version of this article appears in print in the 15 October, 2020 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

As the conflict rages in Nagorno-Karabakh, the question of belonging rises to the fore among Middle East nations The largely Shia-dominated Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey in its war with Armenia. The Shia Islamic Republic of Iran favours Armenia and Sunni Arab nations seem to tilt towards the mostly Christian nation in the current conflict in the Caucasus. On a community level, division on the war in Nagorno-Karabakh is nowhere more evident than in Lebanon, the region’s most colourful mosaic of sects where Christians, Shias, Sunnis and other ethnicities are sharply split on the conflict between the two former Soviet republics. Across the Middle East, the war in Nagorno-Karabakh has sparked heated debate over the territorial conflict which is increasingly framed as a clash around religious, sectarian and ethnic lines. The long-simmering conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh flared up in late September apparently driven by an attempt by Azerbaijan to recapture swathes of territories occupied by Armenian forces for some 30 years. The current fighting between the two countries has been surpassing periodic escalations, involving troops, heavy artillery, tanks, missiles, warplanes and drones. Hundreds of people have been killed and wounded while thousands more have been driven from their homes on both sides as residents sought shelter from the relentless exchange of artillery fire. Like in many parts of the world where religious and ethnic divisions have been source of contention and manipulation, the new war in the disputed enclave has raised fears of outside intervention if the conflict gets much messier. The stakes in the Nagorno-Karabakh war are high, especially with main neighbouring countries having divided regional interests, while many of them may look at the conflict through a religious or ethnic lens. Turkey provides full-throated support to Azerbaijan mainly because Azeris belong to the same Turkish ethnicity, and also due to the long-standing hostility between the Turks and Armenians who accused the Ottomans of committing genocide against them at the beginning of the 20th century. Iran, meanwhile, has adopted a neutral stance and has repeatedly offered to mediate over the past three decades. But the Persian-dominated nation has been traditionally worried about rising Azeri nationalism, for fear it will spur its own large Turkish minority. Besides, Shia-dominated Iran wants to maintain its huge economic interests with largely Christian Armenia, especially the strategic route its northern neighbour provides for its trade and energy exports to Europe.

News article:
Over the last several weeks, Armenia and Azerbaijan have been engaged in an escalating conflict centered around a decades-long dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory but has illegally occupied by Armenia since their first war ended in 1994. While this conflict seemingly revolves around a dispute between two small Caucasus countries, it has larger regional and even global implications. While the conflict in the Caucasus does not directly threaten Israel, its long-standing close ties with Azerbaijan and fledgling relations with Armenia—coupled with the larger geopolitical landscape of the region involving heavyweights Turkey, Russia and Iran—put the Jewish state on high alert for developments. “Israel and Azerbaijan maintain a strategic alliance. It is not just about arms sales or oil, but a very deep strategic cooperation,” Brenda Shaffer, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center, told JNS. “Azerbaijan’s long-term open friendship with Israel has helped other Muslim-majority states establish open cooperation with Israel and even contributed to the current blossoming of ties between Israel and several Muslim-majority states, like the UAE.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories She said that “Azerbaijan, despite bordering Iran, was not afraid to openly cooperate with Israel over the years. This showed other Muslim majority states that they can, without worrying about repercussions from Iran or other states, establish open cooperation with Israel.” Armenian military officials say that 532 soldiers have been killed since Sept. 27, when hostilities began. Azerbaijan has not disclosed how many soldiers have been killed, though reports that 42 civilians have died since the start of fighting. On Sept. 10, Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a Russian-brokered truce stipulating that a cease-fire should eventually led to a deal on settling the conflict. However, in the days following the ceasefire, renewed clashes have taken place with both sides blaming the other for continued attacks in violating of the agreement. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged both sides to implement the ceasefire. “We deplore the loss of human life and remain committed to a peaceful settlement,” said Pompeo. ‘Exert pressure on public opinion’ Indeed, as the fighting intensified in recent weeks, Israel has come under fire for its close military ties with Azerbaijan. Social-media video emerged in early October showing Israeli-made LORA short-range ballistic missiles being used by Azerbaijani forces against Armenia military targets. Similarly, Azerbaijani officials have confirmed the use of Israeli-made drones as well. The use of Israeli-made weapons against Armenia, which also has diplomatic relations with Jerusalem, has led to a diplomatic row between the two countries after Armenia recalled its ambassador to Israel over the arms sales in early October. Similarly, the head of the self-declared Artsakh Republic, which is the Armenian-backed illegal government of Nagorno-Karabakh region, accused Israel of being complicit in Azerbaijan’s “genocidal” war. At the same time, Israel’s Supreme Court also rejected a petition to ban arms sales to Azerbaijan, saying there was a lack of evidence that Israeli-made weapons were being used for war crimes against Armenia. “Israel has friendly ties with the Armenian people and is home to a vibrant Armenian community. On strategic issues, however, the two states are on different sides. Armenia has close cooperation with Iran, and much of the military supplies to Armenia today transit Iranian territory,” said Shaffer. “In the grand scheme of things, the longer the conflict is on high flames, the greater the chance Israel will be confronted by other countries.” Azerbaijani Ambassador to the United States Elin Suleymanov accused Armenia of attempting to cause a wider confrontation by drawing in international players such as Turkey, Russia and Israel. “Azerbaijan and Israel have a very wide-ranging relationship. It’s very comprehensive and by far not limited to military cooperation, although security and defense is, of course, an important factor in these ties,” he told JNS. “Azerbaijan is a country that is under attack and an illegal occupation, so it’s natural that Azerbaijan buys military equipment for self-defense,” continued Suleymanov. “We buy from many countries, including Russia, Turkey and Israel. The Armenian side exaggerates this issue and focuses on Israel so much in order to exert pressure on public opinion.” Instead, Suleymanov noted that Azerbaijan is being attacked from its own territory by an illegal occupying force. “It is fundamentally important to understand that all fighting today is taking place within the internationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan. An Armenian army is illegally inside the territory of Azerbaijan, killing and bombing our civilians,” he told JNS. “Azerbaijan has repeatedly stated that we have no military objectives on territories of Armenia and we do not plan to attack Armenia.” ‘Threaten gas markets in Europe’ Indeed, both Armenia and Azerbaijan are former Soviet Republics, regaining their independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Since then they have been stuck in an unresolved conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but now controlled and occupied by ethnic Armenians. The current round of fighting between is the second stage of fighting that began last July. During the summer conflict, Armenia attacked Azerbaijani towns along their international border, about 300 kilometers north of where the current fighting is taking place. “Azerbaijan is now showing Armenia that there are costs and risks in its attacks.” During the July flare-up, Armenia sought to undermine the security of the energy corridor. That area is also close to several strategic oil pipelines running from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, which also supply some 40 percent of Israel’s oil. In addition to oil, that area also hosts the Southern Gas Corridor, which is a new pipeline that will supply natural gas to Europe. “Moscow is likely to have supported Armenia’s attacks in July on Azerbaijan in close proximity to the energy corridor,” said Shaffer, adding that it was done to “to signal to Azerbaijan not to attempt to threaten its gas markets in Europe.” Additionally, Armenian Defense Minister Davit Tonoyan has also pushed a new military doctrine with the aim to control all of its occupied territories, termed “New Wars for New Territories,” which indicated that Azerbaijan needed to fear it could lose even more territories if it sought to take its territories back. “The current round of fighting is connected to the July phase. Azerbaijan is now showing Armenia that there are costs and risks in its attacks on Azerbaijan as well,” said Shaffer. While the Armenian-occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region is at the center of the dispute between the two countries, Shaffer noted that most of the current fighting is actually taking place in seven additional districts occupied by Armenia during the war back in the early 1990s. “This is an aspect that most of the world press has missed—that most of the area Armenia occupies is outside Nagorno-Karabakh,” she said, adding that Armenia has been expanding settlements in the areas outside of Nagorno-Karabakh and has rejected peace offers over the years to leave these areas. ‘A challenge for Tehran’ While it’s unlikely that Israel would be pulled into the conflict in any capacity, the Jewish state’s support for Azerbaijan could harm its relations with other allies, such as Cyprus and Greece. “Israel and Azerbaijan maintain a strategic alliance. It is not just about arms sales or oil.” “Israel will be criticized by Western countries for providing the Azeris with drones, which have been massacring Armenian targets, and by her close Hellenic allies for taking a side with Turkey (a longtime rival of the Cypriots and Greeks) and against Armenia (having strong political, cultural and religious ties with Greece),” Benjamin Weil, director of the project for Israel’s National Security at the Endowment for Middle East Truth, told JNS. “In the grand scheme of things, the longer the conflict is on high flames, the greater the chance Israel will be confronted by other countries,” he said. Nevertheless, the conflict in the Caucasus could also create a new front in the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran. Iran, which shares a border with Azerbaijan and is also home to a large population of Azeris, has strong ties with Armenia. “[Armenian] Prime Minister [Nikol] Pashinyan, during his visit last year to Iran, offered for Armenia to serve as a transit state for Iranian gas to Europe. Armenia has a military unit in Syria that operates under the Russian forces there,” said Shaffer. Additionally, Russia, which does not share a border with Armenia, is supplying the country with weapons via Iran. “Tehran’s support for Armenia and its occupation of Azerbaijani incenses many members of the Azerbaijani community in Iran, and this could create a challenge for Tehran,” said Shaffer. As a result, many Iranian Azeris, wh0 estimates suggest may comprise up to a quarter or even a third of Iran’s population, have been demonstrating against Iran’s support for Armenia, chanting “Death to Armenia” at rallies and expressing solidarity with Azerbaijan’s situation. “Israel’s close cooperation with Azerbaijan seems to be building appreciation domestically in Iran itself for Israel,” said Shaffer. “Accordingly, many ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran are writing on social-media positive posts on Israel’s support for Azerbaijan.”

Nevertheless, the conflict in the Caucasus could also create a new front in the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran. Iran, which shares a border with Azerbaijan and is also home to a large population of Azeris, has strong ties with Armenia. “[Armenian] Prime Minister [Nikol] Pashinyan, during his visit last year to Iran, offered for Armenia to serve as a transit state for Iranian gas to Europe. Armenia has a military unit in Syria that operates under the Russian forces there,” said Shaffer. Additionally, Russia, which does not share a border with Armenia, is supplying the country with weapons via Iran. “Tehran’s support for Armenia and its occupation of Azerbaijani incenses many members of the Azerbaijani community in Iran, and this could create a challenge for Tehran,” said Shaffer. As a result, many Iranian Azeris, wh0 estimates suggest may comprise up to a quarter or even a third of Iran’s population, have been demonstrating against Iran’s support for Armenia, chanting “Death to Armenia” at rallies and expressing solidarity with Azerbaijan’s situation. “Israel’s close cooperation with Azerbaijan seems to be building appreciation domestically in Iran itself for Israel,” said Shaffer. “Accordingly, many ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran are writing on social-media positive posts on Israel’s support for Azerbaijan.”

News article:
Over the last several weeks, Armenia and Azerbaijan have been engaged in an escalating conflict centered around a decades-long dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory but has illegally occupied by Armenia since their first war ended in 1994. While this conflict seemingly revolves around a dispute between two small Caucasus countries, it has larger regional and even global implications. While the conflict in the Caucasus does not directly threaten Israel, its long-standing close ties with Azerbaijan and fledgling relations with Armenia—coupled with the larger geopolitical landscape of the region involving heavyweights Turkey, Russia and Iran—put the Jewish state on high alert for developments. “Israel and Azerbaijan maintain a strategic alliance. It is not just about arms sales or oil, but a very deep strategic cooperation,” Brenda Shaffer, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center, told JNS. “Azerbaijan’s long-term open friendship with Israel has helped other Muslim-majority states establish open cooperation with Israel and even contributed to the current blossoming of ties between Israel and several Muslim-majority states, like the UAE.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories She said that “Azerbaijan, despite bordering Iran, was not afraid to openly cooperate with Israel over the years. This showed other Muslim majority states that they can, without worrying about repercussions from Iran or other states, establish open cooperation with Israel.” Armenian military officials say that 532 soldiers have been killed since Sept. 27, when hostilities began. Azerbaijan has not disclosed how many soldiers have been killed, though reports that 42 civilians have died since the start of fighting. On Sept. 10, Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a Russian-brokered truce stipulating that a cease-fire should eventually led to a deal on settling the conflict. However, in the days following the ceasefire, renewed clashes have taken place with both sides blaming the other for continued attacks in violating of the agreement. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged both sides to implement the ceasefire. “We deplore the loss of human life and remain committed to a peaceful settlement,” said Pompeo. ‘Exert pressure on public opinion’ Indeed, as the fighting intensified in recent weeks, Israel has come under fire for its close military ties with Azerbaijan. Social-media video emerged in early October showing Israeli-made LORA short-range ballistic missiles being used by Azerbaijani forces against Armenia military targets. Similarly, Azerbaijani officials have confirmed the use of Israeli-made drones as well. The use of Israeli-made weapons against Armenia, which also has diplomatic relations with Jerusalem, has led to a diplomatic row between the two countries after Armenia recalled its ambassador to Israel over the arms sales in early October. Similarly, the head of the self-declared Artsakh Republic, which is the Armenian-backed illegal government of Nagorno-Karabakh region, accused Israel of being complicit in Azerbaijan’s “genocidal” war. At the same time, Israel’s Supreme Court also rejected a petition to ban arms sales to Azerbaijan, saying there was a lack of evidence that Israeli-made weapons were being used for war crimes against Armenia. “Israel has friendly ties with the Armenian people and is home to a vibrant Armenian community. On strategic issues, however, the two states are on different sides. Armenia has close cooperation with Iran, and much of the military supplies to Armenia today transit Iranian territory,” said Shaffer. “In the grand scheme of things, the longer the conflict is on high flames, the greater the chance Israel will be confronted by other countries.” Azerbaijani Ambassador to the United States Elin Suleymanov accused Armenia of attempting to cause a wider confrontation by drawing in international players such as Turkey, Russia and Israel. “Azerbaijan and Israel have a very wide-ranging relationship. It’s very comprehensive and by far not limited to military cooperation, although security and defense is, of course, an important factor in these ties,” he told JNS. “Azerbaijan is a country that is under attack and an illegal occupation, so it’s natural that Azerbaijan buys military equipment for self-defense,” continued Suleymanov. “We buy from many countries, including Russia, Turkey and Israel. The Armenian side exaggerates this issue and focuses on Israel so much in order to exert pressure on public opinion.” Instead, Suleymanov noted that Azerbaijan is being attacked from its own territory by an illegal occupying force. “It is fundamentally important to understand that all fighting today is taking place within the internationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan. An Armenian army is illegally inside the territory of Azerbaijan, killing and bombing our civilians,” he told JNS. “Azerbaijan has repeatedly stated that we have no military objectives on territories of Armenia and we do not plan to attack Armenia.” ‘Threaten gas markets in Europe’ Indeed, both Armenia and Azerbaijan are former Soviet Republics, regaining their independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Since then they have been stuck in an unresolved conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but now controlled and occupied by ethnic Armenians. The current round of fighting between is the second stage of fighting that began last July. During the summer conflict, Armenia attacked Azerbaijani towns along their international border, about 300 kilometers north of where the current fighting is taking place. “Azerbaijan is now showing Armenia that there are costs and risks in its attacks.” During the July flare-up, Armenia sought to undermine the security of the energy corridor. That area is also close to several strategic oil pipelines running from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, which also supply some 40 percent of Israel’s oil. In addition to oil, that area also hosts the Southern Gas Corridor, which is a new pipeline that will supply natural gas to Europe. “Moscow is likely to have supported Armenia’s attacks in July on Azerbaijan in close proximity to the energy corridor,” said Shaffer, adding that it was done to “to signal to Azerbaijan not to attempt to threaten its gas markets in Europe.” Additionally, Armenian Defense Minister Davit Tonoyan has also pushed a new military doctrine with the aim to control all of its occupied territories, termed “New Wars for New Territories,” which indicated that Azerbaijan needed to fear it could lose even more territories if it sought to take its territories back. “The current round of fighting is connected to the July phase. Azerbaijan is now showing Armenia that there are costs and risks in its attacks on Azerbaijan as well,” said Shaffer. While the Armenian-occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region is at the center of the dispute between the two countries, Shaffer noted that most of the current fighting is actually taking place in seven additional districts occupied by Armenia during the war back in the early 1990s. “This is an aspect that most of the world press has missed—that most of the area Armenia occupies is outside Nagorno-Karabakh,” she said, adding that Armenia has been expanding settlements in the areas outside of Nagorno-Karabakh and has rejected peace offers over the years to leave these areas. ‘A challenge for Tehran’ While it’s unlikely that Israel would be pulled into the conflict in any capacity, the Jewish state’s support for Azerbaijan could harm its relations with other allies, such as Cyprus and Greece. “Israel and Azerbaijan maintain a strategic alliance.

News article:
A small landlocked enclave tucked in a remote corner of Transcaucasia may be emerging as a powder keg that could threaten the security of several nations, among them Russia, Turkey, Iran and the two immediate protagonists Armenia and Azerbaijan. High Qarabagh, Nagorno Karabakh in Russian, Artsakh in Armenian, Qarabagh Olya in Persian and Azeri covers an area of 4,400 square kilometres, less than half of Lebanon with a population of 150,000 more than 90 percent of them ethnic Armenians. And, yet, in 1924 when Josef Stalin, then in charge of nationalities in the newly created Soviet Union was carving the extinct tsarist empire into republics, High Qarabagh was attached to the autonomous republic of Azerbaijan, itself invented by Bolshevik chief out of territories known as Aran Shirvan and Nakhichevan. If Stalin had gone by population the enclave should have been attached to Armenia, another republic that he put on the map. However, Stalin’s gerrymandering game didn’t stop there. He put a chunk of his new Azerbaijan, known as Nakhichevan at some distance from the rest of the republic with Armenia sandwiched in between. He went even further by dividing the Kurdish majority enclave of Lachin between Armenia and Azerbaijan while attaching Talesh, a non-Azeri coastal land to Azerbaijan. Stalin’s divide-and-rule strategy, aimed at making the “captive nations” of the Bolshevik Empire dependent on Moher Russia for peace and security. He imposed a similar scheme in Central Asia by turning Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan into patchworks of ethnicities. When the Soviet Empire collapsed in 1991 it was inevitable that Stalin’s geographical doodling would face questions. Seizing the opportunity, the Armenian population of High Qarabagh expelled the Azeri minority in what was to become a model for ethnic cleansing in other places, notably the Balkans. Backed by Armenia the enclave’s ethnic Armenians won a series of military victories and managed to set up their own autonomous republic. At the time it was evident that the Artsakh rebels had received substantial aid from post-Soviet Russia. This was partly due to the fact that throughout Soviet history ethnic Armenians, though fewer in number, played a much greater role than the Azeris. The Soviet central leadership always included an Armenian at political and military levels; and some like Anastas Mikoyan reached the very top of the greasy pole. Even now ethnic Armenians who decided to say in Russia proper have high profile presence in the Moscow leadership, among them Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov whose real Armenian name is Serge Kalantarian. In contrast the ethnic Azeris who lived in Russia proper decided to return to their land en masse and were soon rewarded with new wealth generated by two decades of an oil boom. Throughout much of history Armenians had regarded Russia, a fellow Christian nation, as their protector against Muslim neighbors, especially the Ottoman Empire. This was one reason why newly independent Armenia agreed to host a major Russian military base which at its peak contained 20,000 Russian troops. In contrast several Azeri leaders played the anti-Russian card by airing historical grievances against “the occupiers”. The firebrand leader, Abulfazil Ilchibey, went even further by promoting a mass de-russification that included a change of alphabet and Russian-style family names. Independent Azerbaijan wanted to join the “Western World”, casting itself as the United States’ most reliable ally in the region. To emphasise that point new Azerbaijan forged close relations with Israel to the point of promoting tight military cooperation, and talking of a Baku-Tel Aviv axis. In the current round of fighting Azerbaijan enjoys superiority in armament largely thanks to Israeli support. Nevertheless Israel is anxious not to lose its other regional ally Armenia. That ambiguity has enabled Turkey to cast itself as Azerbaijan’s principal backer while depicting Russia and the Islamic Republic in Iran as Armenia’s allies. The Khomeinist leadership in Tehran is especially confused about what line to take. The fighting looms as a security treat to Iran itself, even if only because of its overspill into Iranian territory. In the past week of fighting hundreds of shells fired by both sides have fallen into border areas in Iran. The fighting may also produce large numbers of refuses whose natural shelter would be Iranian territory. Tehran also faces pressure from powerful figures within the military and security services who regard Azerbaijanis as kith and kin. At the same time, “Supreme Guide” Ali Khamenei is anxious not to antagonise Russia who he now sees as his principal protector against the American “Great Satan.” He has another worry: the introduction of hundreds of Syrian militants into the Azeri forces through Turkey. These fighters have little experience in warfare in the steep mountains of Transcaucasia especially in the harsh climates of the winter. But, as committed militants of the Muslim Brotherhood, they could enable Turkey to create its own Hezbollah-like “foreign legion”, challenging Iran elsewhere, including in Iraq and Lebanon. Erdogan has tried to partly justify his backing for Azerbaijan by claiming that PKK fighters, supposedly coming from Soleymanieh in Iraq, via Iran, have joined Armenian forces in Qarabagh. He has also revived the theme of “Turkitude” (Turkishness) which had only recently underplayed in favor of his claim to Islamic-ness as the foundation of Turkish identity. Erdogan’s identity crisis was further highlighted by the national census held two years ago when citizens were asked to cite their ethnic origins. The results had to be doctored because only a minority chose the label Turkish. The survey revealed most citizens remain attached to “mellat” identities they had during the Ottoman Empire, including Daghestani, Chechen, Alevite, Kurdish, Arab, Byzantine, Bulgarian , Udmurt, Circassian, Chechen and even Greek and Armenian. The surprise revelations forced Erdogan to try and fudge the identity issue by claiming Turks were descendants of ancient Hittites dating back to 3,000 years ago. Tehran’s reaction has been marked by confusion. It has refrained from taking a clear position while Khamenei was silent at the time of this writing. After a number of small demonstrations in Tabriz, capital of East Azerbaijan province, four Azeri mullahs identified as Khamenei’s representatives issued a joint statement demanding that High Qarabagh be returned to Azerbaijan Republic. Khamenei’s foreign policy adviser Ali Akbar Velayati made a similar demand in carefully modulated tones not to anger Russia. The foreign ministry, however, tried to dodge the issue, not even calling in Armenia’s ambassador for a routine dressing down. Ignoring the crisis, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced he was heading for Beijing in the hope of persuading the Chinese to release some of Iran’s frozen assets. The Qarabagh conflict could provoke uncontrollable reactions in Iran where an estimated 20 million Azeri-speakers spread all over the country regard the Azerbaijan Republic as part of greater Iran. The slogans chanted in Tabriz and Tehran demonstrations included overtly irredentist ones such as “Qarabagh is ours, Azerbaijan is ours.” What are now Armenian and Azerbaijani republics, plus Georgia, were ceded to Iran in the treaties of Amassia (1550) and Qasr Shirin (1639) signed with Ottoman Empire. In exchange the Ottomans received Mesopotamia, today’s Iraq, plus Abkhazia and Ajaria and the Armenian part of Anatolia. If Azerbaijan wins, a coalition of Turkey, Israel and the United States would end up in the winning camp while the Islamic Republic will be seen as indifferent to the aspirations of Azerbaijan which is supposed to be the third largest Shiite nation after Iran and Iraq. If Armenia wins, the likely co-winners would include Russia and Israel, again leaving Iran isolated. For the past 30 years the Islamic Republic has been a lifeline to landlocked Armenia, channelling its foreign trade and providing it with electricity. If Armenia loses, Tehran will get a bad mark from Moscow as a fickle friend. This war may produce only losers. Azerbaijan is unlikely to succeed in regaining full control of the disputed enclave. Armenia has already lost some territory and faces a wave of refugees flowing into the capital Yerevan. Turkey may win a propaganda round as protector of Azeris but would be dragged into a fifth war which, its economy already under stress, it may not be able to sustain. Israel may have to come off the fence and choose one side by losing the other. Russia would lose by seeing militants find a niche so close to itself while being forced to abandon its claim of peacemaker among former Soviet republics. Tehran, too, will be a loser on both geopolitical and ideological grounds. Khamenei claims to be the supreme leader of Muslims throughout the world. Yet, we now see that he cannot even influence events on his doorstep.

News article:
Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other of violating a new ceasefire on Sunday, as they tried for the second time in a week to bring a halt to fighting over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The ex-Soviet neighbours agreed to a truce from midnight (2000 GMT Saturday) following a push by international mediators to end three weeks of heavy clashes over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian region that broke from Azerbaijan's control in the 1990s. A previous ceasefire agreed a week ago fell apart amid mutual accusations and continued fighting that has left hundreds dead and forced tens of thousands from their homes. The new ceasefire deal was announced after one of the deadliest attacks on civilians so far on Saturday, when a missile hit a residential area of Azerbaijan's second city Ganja, killing 13 people including children. Armenia's defence ministry said Azerbaijani forces had violated the new ceasefire only minutes after it took effect, firing artillery shells and rockets in the early hours of Sunday. Its foreign ministry said Azerbaijan had also launched an attack in a southern area of the Karabakh frontline "demonstrating to the international community its treacherous nature". Azerbaijan's defence ministry accused Armenian forces of firing artillery and mortar shells and of launching early morning attacks along the frontline. Armenia was in "gross violation" of the ceasefire and showing "open disrespect" for the efforts of international mediators, the foreign ministry in Baku said. The two sides had described the agreement as a "humanitarian truce" to allow for the exchange of prisoners and bodies. Armenia said on Sunday that Azerbaijan had "categorically rejected" an attempt mediated by the International Committee of the Red Cross to withdraw wounded soldiers from the front. Azerbaijan said it was in talks with the ICRC and was prepared to unilaterally hand over some bodies of Armenian servicemen. Azerbaijan and Armenia have been locked in a bitter conflict over Karabakh since Armenian separatists backed by Yerevan seized control of the mountainous province in a 1990s war that left 30,000 people dead. The region's declaration of independence has not been recognised by any country, even Armenia, and it is still part of Azerbaijan under international law. The fighting that broke out three weeks ago has been the heaviest since a 1994 ceasefire and has threatened to draw in regional powers Turkey, which backs Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a military alliance with Armenia. France, Russia and the United States have tried for decades to mediate a resolution to the dispute over Karabakh under the "Minsk Group", but negotiations have long been stalled. UN chief Antonio Guterres on Sunday called on both sides to respect the new ceasefire and condemned the attacks on civilians, in particular Saturday's deadly missile strike on Ganja. The European Union's top diplomat Joseph Borrell also deplored the violations of the truce and appealed for an end on attacks on civilians. AFP journalists in Karabakh's main city Stepanakert said it was largely calm on Sunday, but after the failure of other ceasefire attempts and decades of mistrust, residents had little hope that a truce would hold. "Our country is ready to respect the ceasefire but the others will not... We can't trust them," Sveta Petrosyan, a 65-year-old with two sons at the front, told AFP outside her apartment. Two explosions were heard in the evening and a drone was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, erupting into a ball of fire as it crashed into a mountain. In Azerbaijan's frontline town of Terter, residents told AFP there had been some shelling around midday but that Sunday was the quietest it had been in several days. "I don't know if the ceasefire will last and I don't care," said Elshad Rezayev, 35. "They killed our women and children. All I want to do is pick up a gun and go fight them so that this is finished forever." The clashes over Karabakh that erupted on September 27 have left more than 700 dead, including scores of civilians on both sides. The real death toll is probably much higher, as most of the deaths have been reported among Armenian separatist forces and Azerbaijan has not released any figures on its military casualties. Azerbaijan says it has retaken significant territory in areas along the frontline, including two regional centres -- Jabrayil and Fizuli -- in a no-man's land splitting Nagorno-Karabakh proper from territory under Azerbaijani control. It also claims to have taken several areas of strategic high ground and on Sunday President Ilham Aliyev said on Twitter that his forces had seized the strategic Khudaferin bridge over the Aras river between Azerbaijan and Iran. Armenia has accused Turkey of encouraging longtime ally Azerbaijan to launch the offensive to retake Nagorno-Karabakh last month.

Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other of violating a new ceasefire on Sunday, as they tried for the second time in a week to bring a halt to fighting over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The ex-Soviet neighbours agreed to a truce from midnight (2000 GMT Saturday) following a push by international mediators to end three weeks of heavy clashes over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian region that broke from Azerbaijan's control in the 1990s. A previous ceasefire agreed a week ago fell apart amid mutual accusations and continued fighting that has left hundreds dead and forced tens of thousands from their homes. The new ceasefire deal was announced after one of the deadliest attacks on civilians so far on Saturday, when a missile hit a residential area of Azerbaijan's second city Ganja, killing 13 people including children. Armenia's defence ministry said Azerbaijani forces had violated the new ceasefire only minutes after it took effect, firing artillery shells and rockets in the early hours of Sunday. Its foreign ministry said Azerbaijan had also launched an attack in a southern area of the Karabakh frontline "demonstrating to the international community its treacherous nature". Azerbaijan's defence ministry accused Armenian forces of firing artillery and mortar shells and of launching early morning attacks along the frontline. Armenia was in "gross violation" of the ceasefire and showing "open disrespect" for the efforts of international mediators, the foreign ministry in Baku said. The two sides had described the agreement as a "humanitarian truce" to allow for the exchange of prisoners and bodies. Armenia said on Sunday that Azerbaijan had "categorically rejected" an attempt mediated by the International Committee of the Red Cross to withdraw wounded soldiers from the front. Azerbaijan said it was in talks with the ICRC and was prepared to unilaterally hand over some bodies of Armenian servicemen. Azerbaijan and Armenia have been locked in a bitter conflict over Karabakh since Armenian separatists backed by Yerevan seized control of the mountainous province in a 1990s war that left 30,000 people dead. The region's declaration of independence has not been recognised by any country, even Armenia, and it is still part of Azerbaijan under international law. The fighting that broke out three weeks ago has been the heaviest since a 1994 ceasefire and has threatened to draw in regional powers Turkey, which backs Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a military alliance with Armenia. France, Russia and the United States have tried for decades to mediate a resolution to the dispute over Karabakh under the "Minsk Group", but negotiations have long been stalled. UN chief Antonio Guterres on Sunday called on both sides to respect the new ceasefire and condemned the attacks on civilians, in particular Saturday's deadly missile strike on Ganja. The European Union's top diplomat Joseph Borrell also deplored the violations of the truce and appealed for an end on attacks on civilians. AFP journalists in Karabakh's main city Stepanakert said it was largely calm on Sunday, but after the failure of other ceasefire attempts and decades of mistrust, residents had little hope that a truce would hold. "Our country is ready to respect the ceasefire but the others will not... We can't trust them," Sveta Petrosyan, a 65-year-old with two sons at the front, told AFP outside her apartment. Two explosions were heard in the evening and a drone was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, erupting into a ball of fire as it crashed into a mountain. In Azerbaijan's frontline town of Terter, residents told AFP there had been some shelling around midday but that Sunday was the quietest it had been in several days. "I don't know if the ceasefire will last and I don't care," said Elshad Rezayev, 35. "They killed our women and children. All I want to do is pick up a gun and go fight them so that this is finished forever." The clashes over Karabakh that erupted on September 27 have left more than 700 dead, including scores of civilians on both sides. The real death toll is probably much higher, as most of the deaths have been reported among Armenian separatist forces and Azerbaijan has not released any figures on its military casualties. Azerbaijan says it has retaken significant territory in areas along the frontline, including two regional centres -- Jabrayil and Fizuli -- in a no-man's land splitting Nagorno-Karabakh proper from territory under Azerbaijani control. It also claims to have taken several areas of strategic high ground and on Sunday President Ilham Aliyev said on Twitter that his forces had seized the strategic Khudaferin bridge over the Aras river between Azerbaijan and Iran. Armenia has accused Turkey of encouraging longtime ally Azerbaijan to launch the offensive to retake Nagorno-Karabakh last month.

News article:
(JTA) — The de-facto leader of a disputed region claimed by both Armenia and Azerbaijan accused Israel of assisting in a genocide against his people. In a speech last week, Arayik Harutyunyan, the Armenian leader of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, said Israel is “responsible for the genocide in Karabakh.” Harutyunyan was referring somewhat hyperbolically to the deaths of several hundred people in recent weeks in armed clashes between Armenian separatists and Azerbaijani troops. The area has seen deadly clashes for decades. Azerbaijan is a major buyer of Israeli arms, including some of its most advanced strike drones. Some of those weapons have reportedly been against Armenian troops or groups that it backs. Israeli officials have said they have no knowledge of or involvement in how Azerbaijan uses the weapons it buys. But Harutyunyan dismissed such claims during a press conference on Oct 11. “These statements are a mockery. Of course they know and continue to supply weapons anyway. And the authorities of Israel, which itself survived the genocide, are also responsible for this genocide,” Harutyunyan said, according to a report in RIA Novosti. Israel’s economic ties to Azerbaijan, which supplies about one-third of Israel’s total oil consumption, have long complicated relations with Armenia, which recalled its ambassador from Israel on Oct. 2 on account of the weapons sales, though without making any reference to genocide. The move came just months after Armenia’s president, Armen Sarkissian, made a landmark visit to Israel in which he spoke about the bonds between the nations born of their shared experience of genocide. Israel and Armenia “share common history through painful and sad times with the extinction of millions in the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide,” Sarkissian said in a Jan. 24 speech in Holon, referring to the killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by Turkish soldiers during World War I. Israel for decades declined to recognize the slayings as genocide for fear it would anger Turkey, a major trading partner. In 2015, on the 100th anniversary of the event, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin described it merely as “mass killings.”

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Eurasia Tags: TurkeyErdoganKarabakhWarMediterranean There is significant evidence that Turkey is the main instigator of the current Karabakh war. The country has been involved in every step of the way from the preparation to the execution of the Azerbaijani war plan. For more than ten hours, from Oct. 9 to Oct. 10, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov presided over tough and grueling negotiations between Armenian foreign minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and Azerbaijani foreign minister Jeyhun Bayramov. The talks focused on ending the recent war over the breakaway republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (known by Armenians as Artsakh). They resulted in a humanitarian ceasefire and a commitment to further peace talks. It seemed to be a remarkable feat for Moscow’s veteran diplomat. At the time of this writing, the ceasefire has “largely held,” albeit by a thread. The war over Karabakh is new. The conflict, however, is not. Its complex origins can be traced deep into history, but the more contemporary conflict dates to the 1980s when Mikhail Gorbachev embarked on reforming the Soviet Union. In response to Gorbachev’s call for glasnost and perestroika, the Armenians of majority-Armenian Karabakh, then autonomous within Soviet Azerbaijan, sought to unify their region with Soviet Armenia. Peaceful demonstrations in Yerevan and Stepanakert were met with anti-Armenian ethnic violence in the Azerbaijani town of Sumgait, not far from Baku. Tensions rose and further clashes between Armenians and Azeris ensued, exploding into open warfare by the time of the Soviet dissolution in 1991. The war led to death, destruction, and destitution on both sides. A Russian-brokered ceasefire in 1994 left the Karabakh Armenians in control of much of Karabakh, as well as seven districts surrounding it, providing direct borders with Armenia and Iran. The ceasefire regime has tenuously kept the peace since then, but the area has seen periodic outbursts of violence, including the Four-Day War of 2016. The current war represents the most serious escalation of violence since the early 1990s. Unprecedented both in scale and ferocity, it was unleashed by Baku, with unparalleled support from Turkey, in the early morning hours of Sept. 27. What motivated such a massive attack on Karabakh by Azerbaijan? It was no secret that Azerbaijani strongman Ilham Aliyev was dissatisfied with the Karabakh negotiation process, having called the negotiations “meaningless” on more than one occasion. Over time, the increasing belligerence in Aliyev’s rhetoric was matched by the increased acquisition of powerful weapons, due exclusively to oil revenue windfall. However, a much more significant dimension warrants our attention—the factor of Azerbaijan’s powerful ally, Turkey and its newfound regional messianism with a geopolitical agenda to match. Enter Erdogan There is significant evidence that Turkey is the main instigator of the current Karabakh war. The country has been involved in every step of the way from the preparation to the execution of the Azerbaijani war plan. Satellite imagery of Azerbaijan’s Ganja International Airport from the New York Times revealed the presence of Turkish F-16 fighter jets, to which Aliyev later admitted in an interview on CNN. According to Yerevan, these jets were used by Turkey against Armenian forces early in the war. Moreover, according to credible media reports and assessments by French and Russian intelligence, Turkey has been busy shuttling mercenaries and jihadists from Syria and Libya into the conflict zone, including members of the Syrian Nusra Front. However, Ankara’s foray into Karabakh is only the latest episode of its imperial adventurism. Whether picking fights in the Mediterranean Basin, laying claim to Jerusalem, or stifling his opposition at home, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made his geopolitical ambitions well-known. His bullish intervention in Karabakh risks transforming a localized interethnic conflict into a major regional war, if not a world war. By throwing his full weight behind Azerbaijan, both diplomatically and militarily, Erdogan has managed to catch Russia off guard in his effort to establish a foothold in the Caucasus. The Turkish president made his intentions clear in a July 2020 speech in which he declared that it was up to him to continue the mission of the Ottomans in the region. Some observers interpreted his remarks as a not-so-veiled threat against Armenians in the context of the Armenian Genocide. However, his ominous statements refer less to 1915 and more to another related historical event, no less traumatic for Armenians—the Ottoman military invasion of Transcaucasia in 1918. In that episode, the Ottoman Empire sought to stake out a claim to the Caucasus amid the ongoing Russian Civil War. Erdogan seeks to revive this historical claim to the region, against the backdrop of his recent conflicts with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Libya and Syria. He has openly described his total support for Azerbaijan as part of Turkey’s quest for its “deserved place in the world order.” His aim is to use a new war in Karabakh to send a message to Moscow and, if possible, to undermine Russia’s historical influence in the Caucasus and even to potentially supplant it with Turkish influence. Iran, too, is the target of this latest brazen move by Erdogan. As Ankara’s détente with Moscow vanishes in the sands of North Africa and the Levant, Karabakh presents Erdogan with an opportunity of a lifetime to turn a barrage of insults into a barrage of injuries. Ankara first tested the waters for intervening directly in the Karabakh conflict on the Azerbaijani side during the 2016 Nagarno-Karabakh conflict. The context was Turkey’s rivalry with Russia over the Syrian Civil War and the shootdown of the Russian Sukhoi Su-24 aircraft over Syrian airspace. At the time, Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev accused Ankara of “adding fuel to the fire” over Karabakh. This was a mere dress rehearsal for what was to come. An ill-fated Azerbaijani attack on Armenia’s northeastern province of Tavush in mid-July 2020 resulted in a cross-border skirmish that would claim the life of Azerbaijani’s Maj. Gen. Polad Hashimov. The anger over Hashimov’s death, combined with both the dwindling oil revenues of the self-styled “Dubai of the Caucasus” and economic decline from the coronavirus pandemic, led Baku to turn to Ankara. Embittered by his own economic woes and geopolitical setbacks elsewhere, Erdogan was only too eager to help. Together, Turkey and Azerbaijan held joint war games in Baku and in the strategic Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhichevan, adjoining Armenia and Iran. The exercises, involving various artillery and air-defense systems and a coterie of Turkish F-16 jets, did not go unnoticed in Moscow. In late September, only days before Azerbaijan launched its assault on Karabakh with Turkish support, Russia conducted the Kavkaz-2020 war games. Held in the North Caucasus, these games involved the military forces of Armenia and other ex-Soviet states. Although Baku was slated to participate as an observer, Aliyev spurned Moscow’s invitation due to the Karabakh conflict. Baku was also likely attentive to those Kavkaz-2020 exercises carried out in the Caspian Sea, especially that of the Caspian Flotilla amphibious assault. Erdogan’s War As the attention of the international community lingered over the pandemic, the time to strike seemed right to Ankara and Baku. On Sept. 27, the first reports of aerial bombardments on Stepanakert began to appear on Armenian Telegram channels followed by breaking news reports in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and curiously enough, Turkey. Significantly, a Turkish TV reporter began live reporting from one of the areas touched by the war within a space of one hour. As the war began, Azerbaijan’s objective was to surround the territory of the former Soviet-era Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO), attacking from the northwest, the southeast, and the northeast. Baku’s offensives on the northwest aimed at retaking the strategic districts of Kelbajar (Karvachar) and Lachin (Berdzor), which provide Armenia with a critical overland link to Karabakh. However, the impassable terrain of the Murov (Mrav) mountain range, combined with stiff Armenian resistance, led to heavy casualties for Baku. Azerbaijan has fared only slightly better on the southeast front, along the Araks River and the border with Iran, where their main objective has been to retake the towns of Fizuli (Varanda) and Jabrayil (Jrakan). Unlike the northwest, the lowland geography of the southeast is more familiar terrain for Baku. However, even in this area with its more suitable physical conditions, Azerbaijan has encountered stiff Armenian resistance, resulting in heavy casualties and failure to obtain its military objectives. A similar situation has developed in northeastern Karabakh, near the city of Martakert, where the village of Talish has become the main bone of contention between Baku and the Karabakh Armenians. Frustrated by the failed offensives, Baku and Ankara resorted to punishing the recalcitrant Karabakhians by shelling cities and towns and targeting civilians. Perhaps no city has suffered more from the new war than the Karabakh capital, Stepanakert, named for the Armenian revolutionary Stepan Shahumyan. Since the start of the hostilities, the denizens of this mountain town have faced a barrage of shelling from Azerbaijani forces, with active Turkish support. So relentless have been these attacks that the name “Stepanakert” has now become synonymous with the tragedy and senselessness of this war, fueled by the ambitions of the leaders in Ankara and Baku. Due to the ruthless and indiscriminate bombing, the citizens of the city have been driven into underground shelters and into despair. Those fortunate enough to flee the carnage have found refuge in nearby Armenian cities, such as Goris and Kapan, and further west in Yerevan. The strategy of deliberately targeting civilians comes directly from the playbook of Mr. Erdogan. As Amnesty International has reported, he has used this precise strategy repeatedly against the Kurds in his own country and in Syria and Iraq.

Azerbaijan has fared only slightly better on the southeast front, along the Araks River and the border with Iran, where their main objective has been to retake the towns of Fizuli (Varanda) and Jabrayil (Jrakan). Unlike the northwest, the lowland geography of the southeast is more familiar terrain for Baku. However, even in this area with its more suitable physical conditions, Azerbaijan has encountered stiff Armenian resistance, resulting in heavy casualties and failure to obtain its military objectives. A similar situation has developed in northeastern Karabakh, near the city of Martakert, where the village of Talish has become the main bone of contention between Baku and the Karabakh Armenians. Frustrated by the failed offensives, Baku and Ankara resorted to punishing the recalcitrant Karabakhians by shelling cities and towns and targeting civilians. Perhaps no city has suffered more from the new war than the Karabakh capital, Stepanakert, named for the Armenian revolutionary Stepan Shahumyan. Since the start of the hostilities, the denizens of this mountain town have faced a barrage of shelling from Azerbaijani forces, with active Turkish support. So relentless have been these attacks that the name “Stepanakert” has now become synonymous with the tragedy and senselessness of this war, fueled by the ambitions of the leaders in Ankara and Baku. Due to the ruthless and indiscriminate bombing, the citizens of the city have been driven into underground shelters and into despair. Those fortunate enough to flee the carnage have found refuge in nearby Armenian cities, such as Goris and Kapan, and further west in Yerevan. The strategy of deliberately targeting civilians comes directly from the playbook of Mr. Erdogan. As Amnesty International has reported, he has used this precise strategy repeatedly against the Kurds in his own country and in Syria and Iraq.

Topic: Security Region: Eurasia Tags: TurkeyErdoganKarabakhWarMediterranean There is significant evidence that Turkey is the main instigator of the current Karabakh war. The country has been involved in every step of the way from the preparation to the execution of the Azerbaijani war plan. For more than ten hours, from Oct. 9 to Oct. 10, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov presided over tough and grueling negotiations between Armenian foreign minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and Azerbaijani foreign minister Jeyhun Bayramov. The talks focused on ending the recent war over the breakaway republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (known by Armenians as Artsakh). They resulted in a humanitarian ceasefire and a commitment to further peace talks. It seemed to be a remarkable feat for Moscow’s veteran diplomat. At the time of this writing, the ceasefire has “largely held,” albeit by a thread. The war over Karabakh is new. The conflict, however, is not. Its complex origins can be traced deep into history, but the more contemporary conflict dates to the 1980s when Mikhail Gorbachev embarked on reforming the Soviet Union. In response to Gorbachev’s call for glasnost and perestroika, the Armenians of majority-Armenian Karabakh, then autonomous within Soviet Azerbaijan, sought to unify their region with Soviet Armenia. Peaceful demonstrations in Yerevan and Stepanakert were met with anti-Armenian ethnic violence in the Azerbaijani town of Sumgait, not far from Baku. Tensions rose and further clashes between Armenians and Azeris ensued, exploding into open warfare by the time of the Soviet dissolution in 1991. The war led to death, destruction, and destitution on both sides. A Russian-brokered ceasefire in 1994 left the Karabakh Armenians in control of much of Karabakh, as well as seven districts surrounding it, providing direct borders with Armenia and Iran. The ceasefire regime has tenuously kept the peace since then, but the area has seen periodic outbursts of violence, including the Four-Day War of 2016. The current war represents the most serious escalation of violence since the early 1990s. Unprecedented both in scale and ferocity, it was unleashed by Baku, with unparalleled support from Turkey, in the early morning hours of Sept. 27. What motivated such a massive attack on Karabakh by Azerbaijan? It was no secret that Azerbaijani strongman Ilham Aliyev was dissatisfied with the Karabakh negotiation process, having called the negotiations “meaningless” on more than one occasion. Over time, the increasing belligerence in Aliyev’s rhetoric was matched by the increased acquisition of powerful weapons, due exclusively to oil revenue windfall. However, a much more significant dimension warrants our attention—the factor of Azerbaijan’s powerful ally, Turkey and its newfound regional messianism with a geopolitical agenda to match. Enter Erdogan There is significant evidence that Turkey is the main instigator of the current Karabakh war. The country has been involved in every step of the way from the preparation to the execution of the Azerbaijani war plan. Satellite imagery of Azerbaijan’s Ganja International Airport from the New York Times revealed the presence of Turkish F-16 fighter jets, to which Aliyev later admitted in an interview on CNN. According to Yerevan, these jets were used by Turkey against Armenian forces early in the war. Moreover, according to credible media reports and assessments by French and Russian intelligence, Turkey has been busy shuttling mercenaries and jihadists from Syria and Libya into the conflict zone, including members of the Syrian Nusra Front. However, Ankara’s foray into Karabakh is only the latest episode of its imperial adventurism. Whether picking fights in the Mediterranean Basin, laying claim to Jerusalem, or stifling his opposition at home, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made his geopolitical ambitions well-known. His bullish intervention in Karabakh risks transforming a localized interethnic conflict into a major regional war, if not a world war. By throwing his full weight behind Azerbaijan, both diplomatically and militarily, Erdogan has managed to catch Russia off guard in his effort to establish a foothold in the Caucasus. The Turkish president made his intentions clear in a July 2020 speech in which he declared that it was up to him to continue the mission of the Ottomans in the region. Some observers interpreted his remarks as a not-so-veiled threat against Armenians in the context of the Armenian Genocide. However, his ominous statements refer less to 1915 and more to another related historical event, no less traumatic for Armenians—the Ottoman military invasion of Transcaucasia in 1918. In that episode, the Ottoman Empire sought to stake out a claim to the Caucasus amid the ongoing Russian Civil War. Erdogan seeks to revive this historical claim to the region, against the backdrop of his recent conflicts with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Libya and Syria. He has openly described his total support for Azerbaijan as part of Turkey’s quest for its “deserved place in the world order.” His aim is to use a new war in Karabakh to send a message to Moscow and, if possible, to undermine Russia’s historical influence in the Caucasus and even to potentially supplant it with Turkish influence. Iran, too, is the target of this latest brazen move by Erdogan. As Ankara’s détente with Moscow vanishes in the sands of North Africa and the Levant, Karabakh presents Erdogan with an opportunity of a lifetime to turn a barrage of insults into a barrage of injuries. Ankara first tested the waters for intervening directly in the Karabakh conflict on the Azerbaijani side during the 2016 Nagarno-Karabakh conflict. The context was Turkey’s rivalry with Russia over the Syrian Civil War and the shootdown of the Russian Sukhoi Su-24 aircraft over Syrian airspace. At the time, Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev accused Ankara of “adding fuel to the fire” over Karabakh. This was a mere dress rehearsal for what was to come. An ill-fated Azerbaijani attack on Armenia’s northeastern province of Tavush in mid-July 2020 resulted in a cross-border skirmish that would claim the life of Azerbaijani’s Maj. Gen. Polad Hashimov. The anger over Hashimov’s death, combined with both the dwindling oil revenues of the self-styled “Dubai of the Caucasus” and economic decline from the coronavirus pandemic, led Baku to turn to Ankara. Embittered by his own economic woes and geopolitical setbacks elsewhere, Erdogan was only too eager to help. Together, Turkey and Azerbaijan held joint war games in Baku and in the strategic Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhichevan, adjoining Armenia and Iran. The exercises, involving various artillery and air-defense systems and a coterie of Turkish F-16 jets, did not go unnoticed in Moscow. In late September, only days before Azerbaijan launched its assault on Karabakh with Turkish support, Russia conducted the Kavkaz-2020 war games. Held in the North Caucasus, these games involved the military forces of Armenia and other ex-Soviet states. Although Baku was slated to participate as an observer, Aliyev spurned Moscow’s invitation due to the Karabakh conflict. Baku was also likely attentive to those Kavkaz-2020 exercises carried out in the Caspian Sea, especially that of the Caspian Flotilla amphibious assault. Erdogan’s War As the attention of the international community lingered over the pandemic, the time to strike seemed right to Ankara and Baku. On Sept. 27, the first reports of aerial bombardments on Stepanakert began to appear on Armenian Telegram channels followed by breaking news reports in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and curiously enough, Turkey. Significantly, a Turkish TV reporter began live reporting from one of the areas touched by the war within a space of one hour. As the war began, Azerbaijan’s objective was to surround the territory of the former Soviet-era Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO), attacking from the northwest, the southeast, and the northeast. Baku’s offensives on the northwest aimed at retaking the strategic districts of Kelbajar (Karvachar) and Lachin (Berdzor), which provide Armenia with a critical overland link to Karabakh. However, the impassable terrain of the Murov (Mrav) mountain range, combined with stiff Armenian resistance, led to heavy casualties for Baku. Azerbaijan has fared only slightly better on the southeast front, along the Araks River and the border with Iran, where their main objective has been to retake the towns of Fizuli (Varanda) and Jabrayil (Jrakan).

News article:
Armenia is seeking Iran's support in pressuring Azerbaijan, while Azerbaijan also appreciates the Islamic Republic's diplomatic overtures. Both believe that international guarantors France, Russia and the United States are not doing enough to end the conflict in the South Caucasus region. With no signs of Armenia and Azerbaijan's battle over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh abating, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif proposed in a call Friday with Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov the establishment of tripartite talks involving Iran, Russia and Turkey to help resolve the conflict. Such a mechanism would complement the existing process led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Minsk Group co-chairs France, Russia and the U.S. In comments delivered to Newsweek, Armenian ambassador to the U.S. Varuzhan Nersesyan responded to the Iranian offer. "We value Iran's balanced approach and efforts towards the peaceful solution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, which has been ongoing since 1991," Nersesyan said. "Iran is a neighboring country to Armenia and Azerbaijan, and it shares its borders with the Republic of Artsakh." The self-proclaimed Artsakh Republic is a separatist state composed largely of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh territory internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, which seeks to reassert control over the area. Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey, another neighboring power with historically poor ties to Armenia, which sees a role for Tehran in helping to alleviate the pressure from Baku and Ankara. "In regard to negotiations that could bring about an end to aggression in the region, I think Iran has the capacity and could use its leverages to restrain Azerbaijan and urge Turkey not to add fuel to fire in Nagorno Karabakh," Nersesyan told Newsweek. Baku's own envoy in Washington previously responded to the Iranian offer on Friday, also welcoming Tehran's offer while expressing disappointment over the Minsk Group's efforts. "Azerbaijan appreciates every offer to help with reaching the much needed peace in our region," Azerbaijani ambassador to the U.S. Elin Suleymanov told Newsweek at the time. "At the same time, for the last 28 years the OSCE Minsk Group has been engaged in mediating between. Unfortunately, there has been very little progress as a result of these talks." The Minsk Group has repeatedly expressed concern over dueling accusations of civilians being targeted and called for an immediate ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron also discussed the matter in a phone call on Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also reportedly set to soon meet separately with the top diplomats of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Suleymanov said Azerbaijan was willing to resume U.N. Security Council resolution negotiations within the Minsk Group framework "as soon as possible" and accused Armenia of "delaying and avoiding the peace talks as well as rejecting the basic principles" recently elaborated by the nine-member group that also includes Belarus, Finland, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Turkey. To improve talks, Baku would like to see more representation outside co-chairs Paris, Moscow and Washington. "We also believe that the negotiation process should be more inclusive within the Minsk Group itself as well and with more active involvement of all Minsk Group members, including Germany and Turkey, among others," Suleymanov told Newsweek. Read more Iran Ready for Arms Trade with 'Many Friends,' US left in 'Isolation' Iran Ready for Arms Trade with 'Many Friends,' US left in 'Isolation' When it comes to Turkey, however, his Armenian counterpart said there was little room for participation due to the country's close alignment with Azerbaijan. "The only possible solution should be based on mutual compromises between all parties - Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan," Nersesyan told Newsweek. "Regarding Turkey's participation in the peace process, the best that Turkey can do to stay out of this process, because of its biased approach to this conflict." He accused Ankara of exacerbating the conflict rather than helping to resolve it. "As we see during this recent war, Turkey is the only country supporting Azerbaijan's aggression by providing military arsenals and deploying foreign terrorist fighters in the conflict," Nersesyan said. "Turkey's participation is unacceptable for us, as it tries to destabilize this fragile region." The Turkish embassy in Washington has previously expressed its support for Azerbaijan in comments sent to Newsweek. "Turkey stands shoulder to shoulder with Azerbaijan in the face of the latest aggression of Armenia," Ankara's embassy said last month. "This is not only due to the close cultural and historical relations between our countries, but also a necessity to emphasize the principle of respecting the basic international principle of territorial integrity." Iran too has officially sided with fellow Shiite Muslim Azerbaijan in calling for the withdrawal of mostly Christian Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh. In addition to religious ties, Iran also has an ethnic Azeri population that rivals that of neighboring Azerbaijan itself and separatist groups within Iran staged rallies in support of Baku, raising fears of unrest from authorities in Tehran. Iran has also denied Azerbaijani accusations that the country has facilitated arms transfers from Russia to its ally Armenia, while Azerbaijaini officials have repeatedly denied allegations from Iran, Russia and international media reporting on the use of Turkey-backed rebel fighters from Syria in Nagorno-Karabakh. Tehran and Moscow have actively supported efforts to battle opposition forces in Syria through their shared support of the government in Damascus as part of a conflict in which they already coordinate with Ankara. Now, however, both countries have expressed concern that these insurgents could be deployed closer to their borders. For Iran, the conflict has already spilled over. Numerous reports have emerged of stray Azerbaijani drones and Armenian shells falling into Iranian territory, frustrating Iranian diplomatic and military officials who have issued warnings that retaliatory measures would be taken in response to such incidents. Read more Armenia, Azerbaijan Supporters At War Around World, Fighting for Awareness Armenia, Azerbaijan Supporters At War Around World, Fighting for Awareness "Maintaining security and peace of Iranian citizens living in border areas is the redline of the country's armed forces," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement Friday, "and if the shelling is repeated, Islamic Republic of Iran will not remain indifferent in this respect." That same day, Iranian military attaché Colonel Bahman Sadeghin brought his country's concerns to Armenia in a meeting with Armenian Defense Ministry's General Department of Defense Policy and International Cooperation chief Levon Ayvazyan. The Armenian side blamed Azerbaijani forces for purposely congregating near the border with Iran, and a relayed message said "the Artsakh Defense Army reserves the right to carry out devastating strikes against the Azerbaijani armed forces in this area." Iranian ambassador to Azerbaijan Abbas Mousavi also went on Azerbaijani television to discuss the conflict on Saturday. The following day, he emphasized Iran would place its own interests first in determining its position on Nagorno-Karabakh. "Iran's foreign policy is not determined in Washington, London, Beijing, Baku, Yerevan, Moscow or Ankara, rather we decide on national interests and national security with independence and authority in Tehran," Mousavi tweeted. "The psychological and media warfare of governments, regimes, or "special circles" has no bearing on what should or should not be done." Also on Sunday, a decade-long arms embargo imposed by the United Nations on Iran expired as per a nuclear deal struck in 2015 by Iran and the United States, alongside China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. Washington has since abandoned the deal and imposed sweeping unilateral sanctions on Tehran, while the remaining parties continue to support the agreement. Defying warnings from the U.S. and Israel, which already sells arms to Azerbaijan, Iranian mission to the United Nations spokesperson Alireza Miryousefi recently told Newsweek his country was prepared to resume buying and selling weapons among its "many friends and trading partners." He also said his country had a "robust domestic arms industry to ensure its defense requirements against foreign aggression." The Iranian military was set to showcase some of its equipment Wednesday in a massive aerial and anti-air defense drill. "Complete security is established in the northwestern borders of the country by air and land, especially in the borders of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone," Iranian Army Northwestern Zone Air Defense commander Brigadier General Abbas Azimi told reporters. That same day, however, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported on yet another drone falling near the Gara Goch village in Khoda Afarin county of Iran's East Azerbaijan province. The news coincided with an intensification of fighting just across the border, raising the stakes for Iran as the conflict next door raged with no end in sight.

"At the same time, for the last 28 years the OSCE Minsk Group has been engaged in mediating between. Unfortunately, there has been very little progress as a result of these talks." The Minsk Group has repeatedly expressed concern over dueling accusations of civilians being targeted and called for an immediate ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron also discussed the matter in a phone call on Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also reportedly set to soon meet separately with the top diplomats of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Suleymanov said Azerbaijan was willing to resume U.N. Security Council resolution negotiations within the Minsk Group framework "as soon as possible" and accused Armenia of "delaying and avoiding the peace talks as well as rejecting the basic principles" recently elaborated by the nine-member group that also includes Belarus, Finland, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Turkey. To improve talks, Baku would like to see more representation outside co-chairs Paris, Moscow and Washington. "We also believe that the negotiation process should be more inclusive within the Minsk Group itself as well and with more active involvement of all Minsk Group members, including Germany and Turkey, among others," Suleymanov told Newsweek.

"The only possible solution should be based on mutual compromises between all parties - Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan," Nersesyan told Newsweek. "Regarding Turkey's participation in the peace process, the best that Turkey can do to stay out of this process, because of its biased approach to this conflict." He accused Ankara of exacerbating the conflict rather than helping to resolve it. "As we see during this recent war, Turkey is the only country supporting Azerbaijan's aggression by providing military arsenals and deploying foreign terrorist fighters in the conflict," Nersesyan said. "Turkey's participation is unacceptable for us, as it tries to destabilize this fragile region." The Turkish embassy in Washington has previously expressed its support for Azerbaijan in comments sent to Newsweek. "Turkey stands shoulder to shoulder with Azerbaijan in the face of the latest aggression of Armenia," Ankara's embassy said last month. "This is not only due to the close cultural and historical relations between our countries, but also a necessity to emphasize the principle of respecting the basic international principle of territorial integrity." Iran too has officially sided with fellow Shiite Muslim Azerbaijan in calling for the withdrawal of mostly Christian Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh. In addition to religious ties, Iran also has an ethnic Azeri population that rivals that of neighboring Azerbaijan itself and separatist groups within Iran staged rallies in support of Baku, raising fears of unrest from authorities in Tehran. Iran has also denied Azerbaijani accusations that the country has facilitated arms transfers from Russia to its ally Armenia, while Azerbaijaini officials have repeatedly denied allegations from Iran, Russia and international media reporting on the use of Turkey-backed rebel fighters from Syria in Nagorno-Karabakh. Tehran and Moscow have actively supported efforts to battle opposition forces in Syria through their shared support of the government in Damascus as part of a conflict in which they already coordinate with Ankara. Now, however, both countries have expressed concern that these insurgents could be deployed closer to their borders. For Iran, the conflict has already spilled over. Numerous reports have emerged of stray Azerbaijani drones and Armenian shells falling into Iranian territory, frustrating Iranian diplomatic and military officials who have issued warnings that retaliatory measures would be taken in response to such incidents. Read more Armenia, Azerbaijan Supporters At War Around World, Fighting for Awareness Armenia, Azerbaijan Supporters At War Around World, Fighting for Awareness "Maintaining security and peace of Iranian citizens living in border areas is the redline of the country's armed forces," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement Friday, "and if the shelling is repeated, Islamic Republic of Iran will not remain indifferent in this respect." That same day, Iranian military attaché Colonel Bahman Sadeghin brought his country's concerns to Armenia in a meeting with Armenian Defense Ministry's General Department of Defense Policy and International Cooperation chief Levon Ayvazyan. The Armenian side blamed Azerbaijani forces for purposely congregating near the border with Iran, and a relayed message said "the Artsakh Defense Army reserves the right to carry out devastating strikes against the Azerbaijani armed forces in this area." Iranian ambassador to Azerbaijan Abbas Mousavi also went on Azerbaijani television to discuss the conflict on Saturday. The following day, he emphasized Iran would place its own interests first in determining its position on Nagorno-Karabakh. "Iran's foreign policy is not determined in Washington, London, Beijing, Baku, Yerevan, Moscow or Ankara, rather we decide on national interests and national security with independence and authority in Tehran," Mousavi tweeted. "The psychological and media warfare of governments, regimes, or "special circles" has no bearing on what should or should not be done." Also on Sunday, a decade-long arms embargo imposed by the United Nations on Iran expired as per a nuclear deal struck in 2015 by Iran and the United States, alongside China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. Washington has since abandoned the deal and imposed sweeping unilateral sanctions on Tehran, while the remaining parties continue to support the agreement. Defying warnings from the U.S. and Israel, which already sells arms to Azerbaijan, Iranian mission to the United Nations spokesperson Alireza Miryousefi recently told Newsweek his country was prepared to resume buying and selling weapons among its "many friends and trading partners." He also said his country had a "robust domestic arms industry to ensure its defense requirements against foreign aggression." The Iranian military was set to showcase some of its equipment Wednesday in a massive aerial and anti-air defense drill. "Complete security is established in the northwestern borders of the country by air and land, especially in the borders of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone," Iranian Army Northwestern Zone Air Defense commander Brigadier General Abbas Azimi told reporters. That same day, however, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported on yet another drone falling near the Gara Goch village in Khoda Afarin county of Iran's East Azerbaijan province. The news coincided with an intensification of fighting just across the border, raising the stakes for Iran as the conflict next door raged with no end in sight.

News article:
Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces clashed in several parts of Nagorno-Karabakh on Friday, as the United States stepped up diplomatic efforts to try to end the deadliest fighting in the mountain enclave for over a quarter of a century. In Washington, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met separately with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia in a new attempt to end nearly a month of bloodshed that Russian President Vladimir Putin said may have killed 5,000 people. Meanwhile, heavy fighting raged on in the Caucasus enclave. The two sides traded accusations involving the shelling of civilians, and authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said the towns of Stepanakert and Martakert, as well as several villages were struck by Azerbaijani rockets. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry denied the claim and accused Armenian forces of targeting the Terter, Agdam and Agjabedi regions of Azerbaijan overnight. Local men put out a house fire after a night attack in the town of Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh on Friday Citizens inspect a car destroyed during a shelling by Azerbaijan's artillery during a military conflict in Stepanakert, the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh, on Friday A soldier makes his way over the rubble left by a night attack on Stepanakert on Friday Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov meets with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, at the State Department in Washington, Friday Pompeo with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov at the State Department in Washington on Friday The collapse of two Russia-brokered ceasefires has dimmed hopes of a quick end to fighting that broke out on September 27 over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway territory of Azerbaijan controlled by ethnic Armenians. U.S. President Donald Trump said 'good progress' was being made on the issue but did not elaborate and declined to say if he had spoken with the leaders of either country. 'We're working with Armenia. We have a very good relationship with Armenia ... We'll see what happens,' he told reporters in the Oval Office. A handful of protesters from both sides, holding Armenian and Azeri flags and banners, chanted outside the State Department on Friday. People try to remove car tyres from a car shop on fire after shelling by Azerbaijan's artillery during a military conflict in Stepanakert, the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Friday A house damaged by a night attack in the Nagorno-Karabakh region's capital People try to remove car tyres from a car shop on fire after shelling by Azerbaijan's artillery during a military conflict in Stepanakert, the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Friday Local people take cover in the basement during a night attack A house damaged by a night attack Local men put out a house fire after shelling hit civilian homes in Nagorno-Karbakh Smoke rises during fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijan's forces in the Karabakh mountains, the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Friday A panoramic view of the city of Stepanakert after Friday's shelling Both ministers held separate meetings with Pompeo that lasted around 30 to 40 minutes. Speaking at a virtual event held by the Atlantic Council think tank, Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan said he had 'very productive' meetings with Pompeo. 'We have been assessing the way in which we can immediately, without delay, achieve the establishment of a ceasefire and go back to the peaceful resolution. I think what we've been hearing from the United States was very encouraging,' he said. He said the current discussion at the moment among the co-chairs of the Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, was focused on the parameters of that ceasefire and how to sustain it. The wreckage of a car left after the missile attack An overturned car in Stepanakert Friday night World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defense pact with Armenia. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul that he hoped Moscow and Ankara could work together on resolving the conflict and reiterated demands for a Turkish role in mediation. 'Turkey believes it has just as much right as Russia to be involved here for peace.' Washington, Paris and Moscow, who long led the talks, have ignored such calls, and differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fueling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has enflamed the conflict.

Armenia's defense ministry also reported fighting in several areas and said the town of Martuni in Nagorno-Karabakh was shelled during the night. Azerbaijan denied this. Azerbaijan has expressed concern about the security of pipelines close to the fighting used to export Azeri oil and gas, though none has been damaged. Pompeo said this week he hoped the 'right path forward' could be found at the talks. But Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he saw no diplomatic resolution of the conflict at this stage, and Azeri President Ilham Aliyev has described the prospects of a peace settlement as 'very remote'.

Such statements have to be agreed by consensus. Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy confirmed the council was no longer working on a text. About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Azeri forces say they have made territorial gains, including full control over the border with Iran, which Armenia denies. Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian administration says its forces have repulsed attacks

The new humanitarian truce follows four weeks of conflict over the disputed region. Two previous Russia-brokered agreements have broken down, with both Armenia and Azerbaijan blaming the other for a return to violence. The United States, Armenia and Azerbaijan announced a new cease-fire agreement over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region that will take effect at 8:00 a.m. local time (0400 UTC/GMT) on Monday. The deal follows nearly a month of fresh conflict in the region, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians, entered its fifth week. Two previous temporary truces, broken by Russia, have failed to hold. Shortly after the cease-fire took effect on Monday, Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other of violating the agreement. The Azerbaijan Defense Ministry said Armenian forces had shelled villages in the Terter and Lachin regions. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Ministry denied the claim, saying it was "misinformation" and that Azerbaijian's military had launched a missile attack on Armenian forces. 'Intensive negotations' A joint statement from the three countries said the accord came after Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov met with senior US diplomats on Friday. "The United States facilitated intensive negotiations among the Foreign Ministers and the Minsk Group Co-Chairs to move Armenia and Azerbaijan closer to a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict," Sunday's joint statement said. The warring parties agreed to abide by the terms of the humanitarian ceasefire agreed in Moscow on October 10, which were reaffirmed in the statement issued from Paris on October 17, the statement added. The US is one of three co-chairs, along with France and Russia, of the Minsk Group, established by the Organization for the Security and Cooperation of Europe (OSCE) to broker peace between the two former Soviet republics. Military death roll rising The latest positive development came hours after Armenia raised its military death toll to 974. Some 37 civilians have also been killed in fighting between Azeri and Armenian forces, which broke out again on September 27, it added. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military casualties due to censorship under the martial law that applies in the region. But Baku did say 65 civilians were killed and more than 300 wounded on their side.

Fighting over the region has surged to its worst level since a war from 1991-1994 that killed some 30,000 people. Conflict rages on Local officials in Karabakh on Sunday had accused Azeri forces of firing artillery at civilian settlements during the night. Baku denied killing civilians and said its positions had been attacked with small arms, mortars, tanks, and howitzers. Azerbaijan also said it had downed an Armenian military aircraft, reports that Armenia denied. Meanwhile, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said Sunday they have deployed troops along the Islamic Republic's border with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Their mission was "to protect national interests and maintain peace and security," according to comments published by the IRNA news agency.

He tweeted that Azeri forces were "liberating Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized territory from occupation."

"I am absolutely confident in the effectiveness of the peace negotiations but this also depends on the will of the Armenian side to take part in them," Azerbaijan's president said. Aliyev has said that Armenian forces need to withdraw from the disputed region to end the conflict. dv/mm (dpa, Reuters)

Smoke rises after shelling by Azerbaijan's artillery during a military conflict in Stepanakert, the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Saturday, Oct. 24, 2020. The heavy shelling forced residents of Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, into shelters, as emergency teams rushed to extinguish fires. Nagorno-Karabakh authorities said other towns in the region were also targeted by Azerbaijani artillery fire. (AP Photo) Asharq Al-Awsat Fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh region continued Sunday, but Armenia and Azerbaijan reiterated their commitment to a peaceful resolution of their decades-old conflict and agreed to a third attempt to establish a ceasefire after four weeks of hostilities. The agreement on a truce set to begin at 8 a.m. (0400 GMT) Monday was announced in a joint statement by the governments of the United States, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Two previous Russia-brokered ceasefires, including one last weekend, frayed immediately after taking force, with both sides accusing each other of violations. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet Sunday night that the US facilitated "an intensive negotiation" and Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov "have committed to implement and abide by the ceasefire" that comes into force Monday. Russia, the US, and France, co-chairs of the so-called Minsk Group set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to mediate the conflict, also took part in the talks, Pompeo said. In a separate statement, co-chairs of the group said they would meet with the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in Geneva on Thursday "to discuss, reach agreement on, and begin implementation ... of all steps necessary to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict." Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994. The latest fighting that began Sept. 27 has involved heavy artillery, rockets, and drones, killing hundreds in the largest escalation of hostilities between the South Caucasus neighbors in more than a quarter-century. The deadly clashes have continued despite numerous calls for the cessation of hostilities and the two attempts at establishing a ceasefire. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the ceasefire agreement and reiterated his appeal to Armenia and Azerbaijan to fully implement it without delay and "resume substantive negotiations without preconditions," UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The UN chief urged the parties to allow unimpeded humanitarian access to Nagorno-Karabakh to deliver aid and "to make concrete steps towards a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict," Dujarric said. According to Nagorno-Karabakh officials, 974 of their troops and 37 civilians have been killed in the clashes so far. Azerbaijani authorities haven't disclosed their military losses, but say the fighting has killed 65 civilians and wounded 300. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that according to Moscow´s information, the death toll from the fighting was nearing 5,000, significantly higher than what both sides report. On Friday, Pompeo hosted the Armenian and Azerbaijan foreign ministers for separate talks, but the fighting raged on unabated. On Sunday morning, the Nagorno-Karabakh army said battles continued "on all directions of the frontline," and the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry accused Armenian forces of targeting several Azerbaijani regions. Armenian military officials reported "intense fighting" in the conflict zone throughout the day and "heavy battles" Sunday evening. The four weeks of fighting have prompted concerns of a wider conflict involving Turkey, which has thrown its weight behind Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a security pact with Armenia. It also worried worried Iran, which has borders with both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Iran has occasionally complained about stray mortar rounds and rockets that injured people and damaged buildings in rural areas near the borders. Iran´s Revolutionary Guard said Sunday it deployed units of its ground forces to the border near the area of the conflict, the country´s state radio reported. Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, chief of the Guard´s ground forces, said that Iran would not accept any action that "violates" the security and peace of Iranian people in the region. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan maintained they were committed to a peaceful resolution and blamed each other for hindering peace. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has said Armenian forces must withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh to end the fighting. "A ceasefire cannot be without conditions. The truce is possible only after Armenian leadership announces withdrawing its troops from Azerbaijan's occupied territories," Aliyev said Sunday. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian, in turn, accused Azerbaijan of taking a "non-constructive" stance in negotiations. "To solve this issue, we need mutual concessions. Every time Armenia expresses willingness to make any concessions ... Azerbaijan comes up with new demands, new conditions," Pashinian said Sunday in an interview. The announcement of the new ceasefire came several hours after those remarks. President Donald Trump´s national security adviser, Robert O´Brien, tweeted Sunday that the president asked him to meet at the White House with the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers on Friday and that he spoke on the phone Saturday with Pashinian and Aliyev. "Congratulations to all of them for agreeing to adhere to the ceasefire today," O´Brien said, adding that Pompeo and his deputy Stephen Biegun played key roles. "Lives will be saved in both nations."

BAKU/YEREVAN -- Deadly fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces over the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region has intensified as both sides blame each other for the collapse of a third attempt at a cease-fire. Azerbaijan and Armenian reported civilian casualties in urban areas on October 28, two days after a U.S.-brokered cease-fire was to go into effect. Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said 21 civilians were killed and 70 injured in Smerch multiple-rocket system attacks on the city of Barda, located in central Azerbaijan outside the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Four civilians were reportedly killed in another attack on the city on the previous day. The Armenian Defense Ministry accused Azerbaijani forces of attacking civilian areas in Nagorno-Karabakh, including the shelling of a hospital and maternity clinic in the enclave’s main city, Stepanakert. The rocket attacks caused damage but inflicted no casualties. One civilian was killed and two others were injured in a rocket attack on the nearby town of Shushi (Susa). Both sides denied the other's claims that civilians were being targeted. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said urban areas had been hit and that one volunteer from the Azerbaijan Red Crescent Society was killed in the shelling. Two other volunteers were injured. "Alongside thousands of civilians, the ICRC witnessed intense shelling in urban areas on both sides of the front line today, leading to death, destruction, injuries, and desolation," it said in a statement. "These latest exchanges signal that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict risks spiraling out of control," it warned. Both sides have claimed the other is targeting civilians during a month of intense clashes that have drawn in world powers seeking to halt the worst fighting the region since a 1994 cease-fire. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on October 27 spoke separately by phone with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, urging both sides to pursue a diplomatic solution and abide by the cease-fire brokered by Washington over the weekend. Two Russian-brokered humanitarian cease-fires have similarly collapsed within minutes of going into effect. Ethnic tensions in the region between Christian Armenians and their mainly Muslim neighbors have flared in Nagorno-Karabakh for decades. Nagorno-Karabakh is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but the ethnic Armenians who make up most of the population reject Azerbaijani rule. They have been governing their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Azerbaijan's troops were pushed out of the breakaway region in a war in the early 1990s. The latest fighting began September 27, escalating quickly to involve heavy artillery, rockets, and drones. At least 1,000 people have been killed in the fighting. Nagorno-Karabakh officials say 1,068 of their troops and 39 civilians have been killed in the clashes, while 122 civilians have been wounded. Azerbaijan does not disclose its military losses, but they say the fighting has killed 69 civilians and wounded 322. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Moscow believes the death toll from the fighting was nearing 5,000. Aliyev said on October 28 that Armenian forces had lost 5,000 troops, a claim denied by the Armenian side. "As to our losses, I've said we will make them public after the fighting is over. But I have to say that they are a lot less [than Armenia's losses]," he said. Aliyev has demand that Nagorno-Karabakh be returned to Azerbaijan, as well as seven surrounding districts controlled by Armenian forces. Armenia says it will not withdraw from territory it views as part of its historic homeland and where the population needs protection. Heavy fighting has been reported on multiple fronts in recent days, with Azerbaijani forces reportedly capturing territory in the southern sector along the border with Iran. Iran's Foreign Ministry said Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi visited areas near Iran’s border with Azerbaijan and warned the warring parties against harming the security of Iranian territories. “The security of border regions, dams, and constructions is highly significant for the Islamic Republic of Iran and is a red line,” Araqchi said, according to IFP News. Araqchi plans to begin a trip on October 28 to several countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Russia, to discuss the crisis, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said. The United States, France, and Russia -- co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) -- said their foreign ministers would meet on October 29 in Geneva to discuss the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. The Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict, said the meeting would "to discuss, reach agreement on, and begin implementation, in accordance with a timeline to be agreed upon, of all steps necessary to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict." Ahead of that meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone on October 27 with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, telling him about contacts with the leadership of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the "steps being taken to achieve a cease-fire as soon as possible and de-escalate the crisis," a Kremlin statement said. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has sparked concerns over a wider conflict in the South Caucasus drawing in NATO member Turkey, which is an ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a military pact with Armenia. Turkey has demanded a bigger role in the Minsk Group, which Ankara and Baku say has sidelined the Nagorno-Karabakh issue for decades without finding a lasting solution.

BAKU/YEREVAN -- Deadly fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces over the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region has intensified as both sides blame each other for the collapse of a third attempt at a cease-fire. Azerbaijan and Armenian reported civilian casualties in urban areas on October 28, two days after a U.S.-brokered cease-fire was to go into effect. Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said 21 civilians were killed and 70 injured in Smerch multiple-rocket system attacks on the city of Barda, located in central Azerbaijan outside the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Four civilians were reportedly killed in another attack on the city on the previous day. The Armenian Defense Ministry accused Azerbaijani forces of attacking civilian areas in Nagorno-Karabakh, including the shelling of a hospital and maternity clinic in the enclave’s main city, Stepanakert. The rocket attacks caused damage but inflicted no casualties. One civilian was killed and two others were injured in a rocket attack on the nearby town of Shushi (Susa). Both sides denied the other's claims that civilians were being targeted. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said urban areas had been hit and that one volunteer from the Azerbaijan Red Crescent Society was killed in the shelling. Two other volunteers were injured. "Alongside thousands of civilians, the ICRC witnessed intense shelling in urban areas on both sides of the front line today, leading to death, destruction, injuries, and desolation," it said in a statement. "These latest exchanges signal that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict risks spiraling out of control," it warned. Both sides have claimed the other is targeting civilians during a month of intense clashes that have drawn in world powers seeking to halt the worst fighting the region since a 1994 cease-fire. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on October 27 spoke separately by phone with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, urging both sides to pursue a diplomatic solution and abide by the cease-fire brokered by Washington over the weekend. Two Russian-brokered humanitarian cease-fires have similarly collapsed within minutes of going into effect. Ethnic tensions in the region between Christian Armenians and their mainly Muslim neighbors have flared in Nagorno-Karabakh for decades. Nagorno-Karabakh is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but the ethnic Armenians who make up most of the population reject Azerbaijani rule. They have been governing their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Azerbaijan's troops were pushed out of the breakaway region in a war in the early 1990s. The latest fighting began September 27, escalating quickly to involve heavy artillery, rockets, and drones. At least 1,000 people have been killed in the fighting. Nagorno-Karabakh officials say 1,068 of their troops and 39 civilians have been killed in the clashes, while 122 civilians have been wounded. Azerbaijan does not disclose its military losses, but they say the fighting has killed 69 civilians and wounded 322. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Moscow believes the death toll from the fighting was nearing 5,000. Aliyev said on October 28 that Armenian forces had lost 5,000 troops, a claim denied by the Armenian side. "As to our losses, I've said we will make them public after the fighting is over. But I have to say that they are a lot less [than Armenia's losses]," he said. Aliyev has demand that Nagorno-Karabakh be returned to Azerbaijan, as well as seven surrounding districts controlled by Armenian forces. Armenia says it will not withdraw from territory it views as part of its historic homeland and where the population needs protection. Heavy fighting has been reported on multiple fronts in recent days, with Azerbaijani forces reportedly capturing territory in the southern sector along the border with Iran.

News article:
YEREVAN/BAKU -- Azerbaijan has handed over to Armenia the bodies of 29 servicemen killed in the ongoing fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, as the death toll mounted in the latest flareup of violence in the decades-old conflict over the separatist region. The handover was acknowledged by both sides on October 29 as Yerevan and Baku continued to blame each other for the collapse of a U.S.-brokered cease-fire -- the third since fighting broke out on September 27. Armenian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanian said the transfer took place through "the exceptional mediation efforts of the Russian Federation, and with the participation of the field team of the personal representative of the OSCE chairperson-in-office and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)." She said that at the same time, ICRC efforts had resulted in one civilian's repatriation to Armenia. Stepanian said Armenia "once again reiterates its readiness to hand over to the Azerbaijani side the bodies of Azerbaijani servicemen in the territory of Artsakh [Armenia's name for Nagorno-Karabakh], and to start the process of recovery of bodies in the inter-positional zone throughout the entire Artshakh-Azerbaijan front line of hostilities, as well as exchange of information on POWs and their respective handover in future." Hikmat Haciyev, an aide to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, told foreign journalists that the handover was initiated by Baku, with Russia's help. "On the initiative of Ilham Aliyev, the Azerbaijani side handed over the bodies of 30 dead servicemen to Armenia," Haciyev said. "Azerbaijan is grateful to the Russian Defense Ministry and, personally, to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, for organizing the transfer of the bodies of deceased Armenian servicemen," Haciyev said. The handover took place as the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan were expected to hold meetings with the co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Geneva on October 29. However, reports said the talks had been postponed for at least one day. The United States, France, and Russia are the co-chairs of the Minsk Group, which had been the main mediator in the conflict. The Minsk Group said the meeting would be held "to discuss, reach agreement on, and begin implementation, in accordance with a timeline to be agreed upon, of all steps necessary to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict." Meanwhile, Amnesty International said it had verified the use of banned cluster bombs by Armenian forces for the first time since fighting with Azerbaijani forces erupted on September 27. One or several Smerch rockets were fired into the Azerbaijani city of Barda on October 28, hitting a residential neighborhood close to a hospital, according to the London-based human rights group. Azerbaijani authorities have said at least 21 people were killed in the attack, with dozens more wounded. On October 5, Amnesty International identified M095 DPICM cluster munitions that appear to have been fired by Azerbaijani forces into Stepanakert. Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's regional director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, urged both sides to immediately stop using cluster munitions and to prioritize the protection of civilians. "The firing of cluster munitions into civilian areas is cruel and reckless, and causes untold death, injury and misery," she said. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the region's de facto leader, Arayik Harutiunian, said on October 29 that Azerbaijani troops had advanced to within 5 kilometers of the town of Shushi (known as Susa in Azeri), and urged residents to mobilize all their resources to fend off the attack. Shushi is located about 5 kilometers south of Stepanakert, the largest city in the separatist region. The de facto Defense Ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh said earlier on October 29 that 51 more casualties had taken its military death toll to 1,119 since fighting with Azerbaijani forces erupted on September 27. It said that shelling by Azerbaijani forces of civilian settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh continued overnight, while the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry in turn said its forces came under fire in the Goranboy district, north of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Nagorno-Karabakh rights ombudsman, Artak Beglarian, said Azerbaijan on October 29 launched its heaviest missile strikes on the largest city in the separatist region since the fighting started on September 27. "Azerbaijan struck Stepanakert for several hours, dozens of missiles hit the city," Beglarian said. "Civilians were injured as a result of the strike, the heaviest during the recent fighting," he said. Both sides have claimed that the other has been targeting civilians during a month of intense clashes that have drawn in world powers seeking to halt the worst fighting in the region since a 1994 cease-fire. Following the collapse of the Washington-brokered cease-fire, the U.S. Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, urged President Donald Trump to get involved directly in efforts to curb the fighting. "After a month of fighting, it is long past time for President Trump to directly engage the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey to push for immediate de-escalation and stop the advance of Azerbaijani troops into Nagorno-Karabakh," Biden said in a statement on October 28. "The United States should be leading a diplomatic effort to end the fighting, together with our European partners, and push for international humanitarian assistance to end the suffering; under my administration that is exactly what we will do," Biden, who will face Trump in the November 3 presidential election, urged. Nagorno-Karabakh is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but the ethnic Armenians who make up most of the population, reject Azerbaijani rule. They have been governing their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Azerbaijan's troops were pushed out of the breakaway region in a war in the early 1990s.

Turkey has demanded a bigger role in the Minsk Group, which Ankara and Baku say has sidelined the Nagorno-Karabakh issue for decades without finding a lasting solution. Turkey is not the only regional player with an eye on the conflict. Iran's Foreign Ministry said Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi visited areas near Iran's border with Azerbaijan and warned the warring parties against harming the security of Iranian territories. Araqchi, who is on a regional tour that also includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, said on October 29 in Moscow that the Minsk Group had proved to be "inefficient" in its efforts to resolve the decades-old conflict. "It has been 30 years since the Minsk Group was formed, but it has not been able to find a long-term solution to the problem," Araqchi was quoted by the Iranian Embassy in Moscow as saying. Earlier this week, Iran announced it had drawn up a plan to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the hope of stopping fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces continuing along its northwestern border. The European Union, meanwhile, said the escalation was "unacceptable" and called for new peace talks. "The European Union finds it unacceptable that after three agreements brokered by Russia, France, and the United States on a cease-fire, the fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh still continues," European Commission foreign affairs and security policy spokesman Peter Stano said in a statement late on October 28.

She said that at the same time, ICRC efforts had resulted in one civilian's repatriation to Armenia. Stepanian said Armenia "once again reiterates its readiness to hand over to the Azerbaijani side the bodies of Azerbaijani servicemen in the territory of Artsakh [Armenia's name for Nagorno-Karabakh], and to start the process of recovery of bodies in the inter-positional zone throughout the entire Artshakh-Azerbaijan front line of hostilities, as well as exchange of information on POWs and their respective handover in future." Hikmat Haciyev, an aide to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, told foreign journalists that the handover was initiated by Baku, with Russia's help. "On the initiative of Ilham Aliyev, the Azerbaijani side handed over the bodies of 30 dead servicemen to Armenia," Haciyev said. "Azerbaijan is grateful to the Russian Defense Ministry and, personally, to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, for organizing the transfer of the bodies of deceased Armenian servicemen," Haciyev said. The handover took place as the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan were expected to hold meetings with the co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Geneva on October 29. However, reports said the talks had been postponed for at least one day. The United States, France, and Russia are the co-chairs of the Minsk Group, which had been the main mediator in the conflict. The Minsk Group said the meeting would be held "to discuss, reach agreement on, and begin implementation, in accordance with a timeline to be agreed upon, of all steps necessary to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict." Meanwhile, Amnesty International said it had verified the use of banned cluster bombs by Armenian forces for the first time since fighting with Azerbaijani forces erupted on September 27. One or several Smerch rockets were fired into the Azerbaijani city of Barda on October 28, hitting a residential neighborhood close to a hospital, according to the London-based human rights group. Azerbaijani authorities have said at least 21 people were killed in the attack, with dozens more wounded. On October 5, Amnesty International identified M095 DPICM cluster munitions that appear to have been fired by Azerbaijani forces into Stepanakert. Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's regional director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, urged both sides to immediately stop using cluster munitions and to prioritize the protection of civilians. "The firing of cluster munitions into civilian areas is cruel and reckless, and causes untold death, injury and misery," she said. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the region's de facto leader, Arayik Harutiunian, said on October 29 that Azerbaijani troops had advanced to within 5 kilometers of the town of Shushi (known as Susa in Azeri), and urged residents to mobilize all their resources to fend off the attack. Shushi is located about 5 kilometers south of Stepanakert, the largest city in the separatist region. The de facto Defense Ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh said earlier on October 29 that 51 more casualties had taken its military death toll to 1,119 since fighting with Azerbaijani forces erupted on September 27. It said that shelling by Azerbaijani forces of civilian settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh continued overnight, while the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry in turn said its forces came under fire in the Goranboy district, north of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Nagorno-Karabakh rights ombudsman, Artak Beglarian, said Azerbaijan on October 29 launched its heaviest missile strikes on the largest city in the separatist region since the fighting started on September 27. "Azerbaijan struck Stepanakert for several hours, dozens of missiles hit the city," Beglarian said. "Civilians were injured as a result of the strike, the heaviest during the recent fighting," he said. Both sides have claimed that the other has been targeting civilians during a month of intense clashes that have drawn in world powers seeking to halt the worst fighting in the region since a 1994 cease-fire. Following the collapse of the Washington-brokered cease-fire, the U.S. Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, urged President Donald Trump to get involved directly in efforts to curb the fighting. "After a month of fighting, it is long past time for President Trump to directly engage the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey to push for immediate de-escalation and stop the advance of Azerbaijani troops into Nagorno-Karabakh," Biden said in a statement on October 28. "The United States should be leading a diplomatic effort to end the fighting, together with our European partners, and push for international humanitarian assistance to end the suffering; under my administration that is exactly what we will do," Biden, who will face Trump in the November 3 presidential election, urged. Nagorno-Karabakh is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but the ethnic Armenians who make up most of the population, reject Azerbaijani rule. They have been governing their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Azerbaijan's troops were pushed out of the breakaway region in a war in the early 1990s. Aliyev has demanded that Nagorno-Karabakh be returned to Azerbaijan as well as seven surrounding districts controlled by Armenian forces. Armenia says it will not withdraw from territory it views as part of its historic homeland and where the population needs protection. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has sparked concerns over a wider conflict in the South Caucasus drawing in NATO member Turkey, which is an ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a military pact with Armenia. Turkey has demanded a bigger role in the Minsk Group, which Ankara and Baku say has sidelined the Nagorno-Karabakh issue for decades without finding a lasting solution. Turkey is not the only regional player with an eye on the conflict. Iran's Foreign Ministry said Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi visited areas near Iran's border with Azerbaijan and warned the warring parties against harming the security of Iranian territories. Araqchi, who is on a regional tour that also includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, said on October 29 in Moscow that the Minsk Group had proved to be "inefficient" in its efforts to resolve the decades-old conflict. "It has been 30 years since the Minsk Group was formed, but it has not been able to find a long-term solution to the problem," Araqchi was quoted by the Iranian Embassy in Moscow as saying. Earlier this week, Iran announced it had drawn up a plan to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the hope of stopping fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces continuing along its northwestern border. The European Union, meanwhile, said the escalation was "unacceptable" and called for new peace talks. "The European Union finds it unacceptable that after three agreements brokered by Russia, France, and the United States on a cease-fire, the fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh still continues," European Commission foreign affairs and security policy spokesman Peter Stano said in a statement late on October 28.

News article:
(MENAFN- AzerNews) By Trend Advisor to the Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces Vladimir Pogosyan made statements of a threatening character towards Turkey and Israel via social media networks, Trend reports. Speaking about the terrorist attacks in Europe, Pogosyan said that he was not interested in these attacks. 'Finally, Armenian politicians began to understand what are Europe and Israel, especially Israel, he said. "Today's Israel and Germany of 1933 are the same. We won't forgive anyone, and the time will come when we'll take revenge on you, know this," he added. Armenian Armed Forces launched a large-scale military attack on positions of the Azerbaijani army on the front line, using large-caliber weapons, mortars, and artillery on Sept. 27. Azerbaijan responded with a counter-offensive along the entire front. As a result of retaliation, Azerbaijani troops liberated a number of territories previously occupied by Armenia, as well as take important, strategic heights under control. The fighting continued into October 2020, in the early days of which Armenia has launched missile attacks on Azerbaijani cities of Ganja, Mingachevir, Khizi as well as Absheron district. The conflict between the two South Caucasus countries began in 1988 when Armenia made territorial claims against Azerbaijan. As a result of the ensuing war, the Armenian Armed Forces occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan, including the Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven surrounding districts. The 1994 ceasefire agreement was followed by peace negotiations. Armenia has not yet implemented four UN Security Council resolutions on the withdrawal of its armed forces from Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding districts. -- Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz

News article:
Tver, Russia - Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia signed on Monday a Russian-brokered settlement to end the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, surrendering disputed territory and bowing to other demands as he faced a battlefield defeat. The agreement signed by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Pashinyan calls for Armenia’s army to withdraw from the Nagorno-Karabakh region and to be replaced by Russian peacekeepers. Under the deal, the warring sides were to halt fighting and prepare for the peacekeepers’ arrival. Three earlier cease-fires, negotiated by Russia, France and the United States, have collapsed. But the agreement Monday suggested a more permanent, sweeping redrawing of the security map of the southern Caucasus, a volatile region wedged between Turkey, Russia and Iran. The settlement sealed a role in the region for an increasingly assertive Turkey, which backed Azerbaijan in the war that began in September. “I personally made a very hard decision for me and all of us,” Pashinyan wrote in a statement announcing the agreement. “It’s not a victory, but there’s no defeat.” Indeed, the agreement ends a quarter-century of Armenian military control over the remote, mountainous region that is a touchstone of Armenian national identity. Russia will now guard the borders. The Nagorno-Karabakh region has a mostly Armenian population but it fell within the Soviet-drawn borders of Azerbaijan. The enclave declared independence before the Soviet breakup. Internally displaced people For the Azerbaijanis, the settlement opens the prospect that at least some of the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people who lost their homes in a separatist war that ended in 1994 could return to the region. That war ended with the shoe on the other foot: a cease-fire seen as catastrophic but inevitable for Azerbaijan after Armenian military victories. Putin said the new agreement requires both the Armenian and Azerbaijani armies to stop at their currently occupied positions. That cements in place the Azerbaijani capture on Sunday of a strategic town, known as Shusha to Azerbaijanis and Shushi to Armenians. It is the second-largest town in the region and overlooks the separatist capital of Stepanakert, just about six miles away. Armenia has also lost control of the access road needed for military supplies to reach the mountain enclave, starving its defenders of hope of holding out if the fighting continued. “I made the decision as a result of a deep analysis of the military situation,” Pashinyan wrote. He said the deal was “the best solution in the situation.” Within hours of the announcement, protests broke out in Yerevan, Armenia’s capital. A crowd broke into the government building and ripped Pashinyan’s nameplate off the door of the prime minister’s office, Russian television news showed. “Where is Nikol? Where is that traitor?” the intruders screamed. A crowd broke into the government building and ripped Pashinyan’s nameplate off the door of the prime minister’s office. Putin said the agreement was “in the interests of people of Armenia and Azerbaijan.” On Monday, Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry apologized for what it said was the accidental shooting-down of a Russian military helicopter, killing two crew members, an incident that had threatened to draw Russia more deeply into the conflict. For decades, Armenia had drawn support for its defense of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from a large diaspora in Southern California, France and Russia. Azerbaijan has relied on backing from Turkey, an ominous turn of events to Armenians who say the Turks have never accepted responsibility for atrocities committed during and after World War I. Distracted by the presidential election, the United States played only a limited role in the diplomacy over the past month. Ruined stone houses he separatist government in Nagorno-Karabakh had for more than 25 years presided over seven occupied Azerbaijani districts outside the Soviet-era borders of the enclave. These were eerie, depopulated regions of deserted villages and ruined stone houses. Armenia defied United Nations resolutions calling for the return of the residents; holding, it seemed, the military advantage, the country had steadfastly refused any settlement allowing their return. Now, the deal signed on Monday delivers to Azerbaijan much of what the country has sought for years in negotiations, including the return of internally displaced people. Along with withdrawing its army from the enclave, Armenia agreed to surrender control of small ethnic Armenian areas inside Azerbaijan but not in Nagorno-Karabakh; to open a transport corridor for Azerbaijan through Armenia to the Azerbaijani region of Nakhichevan; and to allow the United Nations to oversee the return of the internally displaced people. The capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert, was saved from what appeared to be imminent military attack but will rely on Russian peacekeepers for its defense.

Armenia has also lost control of the access road needed for military supplies to reach the mountain enclave, starving its defenders of hope of holding out if the fighting continued. “I made the decision as a result of a deep analysis of the military situation,” Pashinyan wrote. He said the deal was “the best solution in the situation.” Within hours of the announcement, protests broke out in Yerevan, Armenia’s capital. A crowd broke into the government building and ripped Pashinyan’s nameplate off the door of the prime minister’s office, Russian television news showed. “Where is Nikol? Where is that traitor?” the intruders screamed. A crowd broke into the government building and ripped Pashinyan’s nameplate off the door of the prime minister’s office. Putin said the agreement was “in the interests of people of Armenia and Azerbaijan.” On Monday, Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry apologized for what it said was the accidental shooting-down of a Russian military helicopter, killing two crew members, an incident that had threatened to draw Russia more deeply into the conflict. For decades, Armenia had drawn support for its defense of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from a large diaspora in Southern California, France and Russia. Azerbaijan has relied on backing from Turkey, an ominous turn of events to Armenians who say the Turks have never accepted responsibility for atrocities committed during and after World War I. Distracted by the presidential election, the United States played only a limited role in the diplomacy over the past month. Ruined stone houses he separatist government in Nagorno-Karabakh had for more than 25 years presided over seven occupied Azerbaijani districts outside the Soviet-era borders of the enclave. These were eerie, depopulated regions of deserted villages and ruined stone houses. Armenia defied United Nations resolutions calling for the return of the residents; holding, it seemed, the military advantage, the country had steadfastly refused any settlement allowing their return. Now, the deal signed on Monday delivers to Azerbaijan much of what the country has sought for years in negotiations, including the return of internally displaced people. Along with withdrawing its army from the enclave, Armenia agreed to surrender control of small ethnic Armenian areas inside Azerbaijan but not in Nagorno-Karabakh; to open a transport corridor for Azerbaijan through Armenia to the Azerbaijani region of Nakhichevan; and to allow the United Nations to oversee the return of the internally displaced people. The capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert, was saved from what appeared to be imminent military attack but will rely on Russian peacekeepers for its defense.

News article:
YEREVAN/BAKU -- Russian peacekeepers are on their way to Nagorno-Karabakh to be deployed as part of an agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia to halt six weeks of military conflict over the breakaway region. The first 200 Russian troops of the peacekeeping force arrived in Armenia on November 10 following the announcement earlier in the day of a Russia-brokered truce to end fighting between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians in and around the enclave. The announcement triggered celebrations in Azerbaijan but a political crisis in Armenia, where angry protesters stormed government buildings and parliament. The move came after Azerbaijani forces made major battlefield gains, including reports that they were approaching Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert (Xankandi in Azeri), after taking the nearby strategic town of Shushi (Susa). Nagorno-Karabakh is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but the ethnic Armenians who make up most of the population reject Azerbaijani rule. They have been governing their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Azerbaijan's troops and ethnic Azeri civilians were pushed out of the region in a war that ended in a cease-fire in 1994. Efforts to resolve the conflict by the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) -- co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States -- have not brought any results since 1992 and three previous cease-fires signed since fighting broke out again on September 27 have failed to hold. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian first announced the trilateral agreement in a Facebook post, saying he had signed a statement with the presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan on the "termination" of the war as of 1 p.m. local time. Pashinian said the deal, which includes the long-term deployment of Russian troops to the region, was "the best possible solution for the current situation." "I made this decision as a result of an in-depth analysis of the military situation and an assessment of the people who know it best," Pashinian wrote. Later in the day, Armenian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanian said military actions in and around Nagorno-Karabakh had ceased completely. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he believed the agreement "will create [the] necessary conditions for a long-term and full-fledged settlement of the crisis around Nagorno-Karabakh on a fair basis and in the interests of the Armenian and Azerbaijani people." According to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, the agreement amounted to a "capitulation" by Armenia. "An iron hand forced him to sign this document," he said, referring to Pashinian. Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian de facto leader, Arayik Harutiunian, said he had agreed with Pashinian to end hostilities "given the current dire situation" and to avoid completely losing the separatist enclave. Under the deal, Azerbaijan will keep territory in Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas captured during the conflict. It also calls for Armenian forces to hand over some areas they held outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, including the eastern district of Agdam and the western area of Kalbacar. Armenians will also forfeit the Lachin region, where a crucial road connects Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. The agreement calls for a 5-kilometer-wide area in the so-called Lachin Corridor to remain open and be protected by a Russian force of 1,960 peacekeepers under a five-year mandate. Russia's Defense Ministry said that 12 Ilyushin Il-76 military transport planes delivered more than 200 peacekeepers and their equipment to Armenia on November 10. The agreement also calls for Russian border services to monitor a new transport corridor through Armenia connecting Azerbaijan to its western exclave of Naxcivan, which is surrounded by Armenia, Iran, and Turkey. European Union foreign-policy chief Josep Borrell on November 10 welcomed the truce agreement and called for further negotiations "to ensure that any settlement is sustainable." Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by telephone with Putin following the announcement and said his country would participate in monitoring the truce. Erdogan also called for the return of ethnic Azeris to Nagorno-Karabakh and reiterated the need to create the corridor through Armenian territory between Azerbaijan and Naxcivan. Since fighting erupted in late September, several thousand people are believed to have been killed on both sides. Azerbaijan's forces scored a major victory on November 8, taking the key town of Shushi, offering strategic heights over Stepanakert, just 10 kilometers away. Shushi also lies along the main road connecting Stepanakert with Armenia. Thousands of people have fled Nagorno-Karabakh in recent days to Armenia, with lines of vehicles clogging the main road connecting the enclave to Armenia. Azerbaijan's forces in recent weeks have also retaken several regions outside Nagorno-Karabakh that had been occupied by ethnic Armenian forces. Several thousand angry protesters gathered in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, in the early hours after Pashinian announced he had signed the cease-fire agreement, with mobs storming the government headquarters and parliament, ransacking offices and smashing windows in an outburst of anger. Parliament speaker Ararat Mirzoyan was injured in a mob attack and hospitalized, drawing a sharp rebuke from the government. Dozens of men also caused an incident at the RFE/RL bureau in Yerevan, calling the Armenian Service "traitors." Acting RFE/RL President Daisy Sindelar said that what happened at RFE/RL's Yerevan bureau was "a reprehensible assault on the essential duty of journalists to serve as impartial witnesses during major news events. "Our Armenian Service, Azatutyun, is one of the few media outlets in Armenia that has aimed to present all sides of a deeply divisive conflict. We call on the police and public alike to support the right of Azatutyun and all independent journalists to report the news, objectively and in full, without threat of violence or scapegoating," Sindelar added. The Union of Journalist of Armenia strongly condemned the attacks and any threats against media. President Armen Sarkisian's office said he was launching "political consultations" to build national unity and "coordinate...solutions arising from our agenda of protecting national interests." Sarkisian said in a statement he had learnt about the agreement to end the fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh from the media. "Unfortunately, there were no consultations or discussions with me, as the President of the Republic, regarding this document, and I did not participate in any negotiations," he said, insisting that the signing of such an important document involving Armenia's "vital security interests" and the "whole Armenian nation" should have been subjected to "comprehensive consultations and discussions." The previous day, 17 opposition parties issued a joint statement calling for Pashinian's resignation amid a series of military defeats suffered by Yerevan-backed ethnic Armenian forces in the enclave fighting against Azerbaijan. Among the parties that signed the statement were the main parliamentary opposition party, Prosperous Armenia, led by tycoon Gagik Tsarukian, the former ruling Republican Party of ex-President Serzh Sarkisian, and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutiun). In his comments following the night of chaos, Pashinian implied that corruption in previous governments was also to blame for the current situation. "We must prepare for revenge. We haven't dealt properly with the corrupt, oligarchic scoundrels, those who robbed this country, stole soldiers' food, stole soldiers' weapons," said Pashinian, a reformist pressing an anti-corruption campaign who came to power in 2018 in the wake of mass popular protests. "I call on citizens with dignity to be ready for us going after the rioters and their bosses, after the corrupt part of Dashnaktsutiun, after the robbers from the Republican Party, the Prosperous Armenia party, the deserters from the Hayrenik party who left their combat positions and fled, and must be tried for desertion," he charged. In Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, joyful crowds took to the streets on November 10 chanting "Karabakh! Karabakh!" and waving Azerbaijani and Turkish flags. Lawmaker Aydin Mirzazadeg, who is also a member of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party's (YAP) Political Council, called the trilateral agreement "a historic victory." However, the chairman of the opposition Musavat Party deplored that no consultations on the trilateral agreement were held in Azerbaijan. "Azerbaijanis learned about the agreement at 4 a.m., which is not acceptable," Arif Hacili said. According to Hacili, the agreement violates Azerbaijan's constitution and Declaration Of Independence, which he said do not allow the deployment of foreign troops in the country. The deputy chairman of the opposition Azerbaijani Popular Front Party (PFPA), Seymur Hazi, expressed concern over "the return of the Russian Army to the region," calling it a threat to Azerbaijan's independence.

News article:
It is unusual for Iran to have a sudden change of heart in its foreign policy. Indeed, it can be said to be one of the firmest and most blatant when it comes to its projection of regional influence, and its rhetoric is just as bold. This has changed with the recent conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh. At first, Iran supported Armenia subtly while publicly remaining "neutral". However, there were reports that it sent 200 heavy armoured vehicles and supplies to help Armenia in its fight against Azerbaijan. Then there were reports of Iran shipping Russian arms to Armenia, which Tehran denied. There were also reports that Iran had allowed and facilitated the passage of hundreds of fighters from the designated terrorist group the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), who were allegedly heading to Nagorno-Karabakh to fight alongside Armenian troops. These reports triggered numerous protests across the north-west of Iran, where many of the country's Azeri citizens live. Dozens of protestors were arrested for expressing their support for Azerbaijan.

READ: Where does Iran stand on the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh? Iran was also acting on its own insecurities over its sizeable Azeri population. As the country's largest minority at around a quarter of the population, nationalist ambitions have reportedly been growing amongst Iranian Azeris. There is speculation that Iran supports Armenia in order to curb such ambitions. There are also the interests that Iran shares with Russia, which is a key ally of Armenia. Just as Iran and Russia support the same side – the Assad regime – in Syria, and have similar goals to curb US and Turkish influence in the region, Iran may also have supported Armenia for that very same reason, as it judged the Nagorno-Karabakh front to be identical to the others. As Azerbaijani forces captured the strategic city of Shusha and were on the verge of taking the rest of the occupied territory, however, Iran realised that its strategy was wrong. It was backing the losing side, not least because Russia did not go to Armenia's rescue as many thought it would. Weighing up its options, Tehran probably decided that the opportunity for bilateral cooperation with Azerbaijan was the best it could hope for. Nevertheless, despite its attempts to save face, the Azerbaijani victory resulted in exactly what Iran feared: a victory for Turkey and its foreign policy. While Ankara continues to support the Syrian opposition against the Iran-backed Assad regime, and contributed to the Libyan government's pushback against Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar earlier this year, Azerbaijan's success in recapturing Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding provinces is certainly of the biggest benefit to Turkey. It was Ankara, after all, which openly supported Baku by selling it the kind of drones which worked so effectively in Syria and Libya, and devastated the Armenian forces. It was also Turkey which conducted joint military training exercises with Azerbaijan shortly before the fighting with Armenia broke out; deployed F-16 fighter jets in the country in case of Armenian attacks; and offered its direct military support if necessary. Factor in the increased cooperation between the two countries in recent years, and the issue becomes clearer. Last month, as the conflict was still raging, it was announced that the strategic Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) was ready to begin operations and deliver gas directly from Azerbaijan to Europe for the first time. With much of the TANAP passing through Turkey, it means that it will import more gas from Azerbaijan and reduce its dependence on Russia and Iran, as will the other countries benefiting from the pipeline. READ: Turkey's strategic victory in Nagorno-Karabakh It was reported earlier that Azerbaijan has become Turkey's main supplier of gas over the first eight months of this year, surpassing both Russia and Iran. Moreover, it was revealed in June that Turkey's state gas grid operator Botaş is to build a gas pipeline to supply the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan, which immediately threatened to sideline Iran's gas supply to the area. Following the Russian-brokered peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the Turkish parliament yesterday approved the deployment of troops to Nagorno-Karabakh to help facilitate its implementation. This gives Turkey a further stake in the region and allows the presence of its military there along with Russian troops, leaving Iran as the only neighbouring power without a say in the matter. The result of this is that Turkey has drawn the southern Caucasus closer into its sphere of influence, while Iran missed the opportunity of doing so because of a seemingly uncertain policy towards the conflict. Iran now has to keep abreast of events while building on whatever cooperation it still maintains with Azerbaijan and considering Russia as a potential partner. All of this is a far cry from Iran's potential as a reliable mediator in the 1990s. It now seems that the only influence it can exert in the southern Caucasus and Azerbaijan is cultural.

News article:
It is unusual for Iran to have a sudden change of heart in its foreign policy. Indeed, it can be said to be one of the firmest and most blatant when it comes to its projection of regional influence, and its rhetoric is just as bold. This has changed with the recent conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh. At first, Iran supported Armenia subtly while publicly remaining "neutral". However, there were reports that it sent 200 heavy armoured vehicles and supplies to help Armenia in its fight against Azerbaijan. Then there were reports of Iran shipping Russian arms to Armenia, which Tehran denied. There were also reports that Iran had allowed and facilitated the passage of hundreds of fighters from the designated terrorist group the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), who were allegedly heading to Nagorno-Karabakh to fight alongside Armenian troops. These reports triggered numerous protests across the north-west of Iran, where many of the country's Azeri citizens live. Dozens of protestors were arrested for expressing their support for Azerbaijan. Towards the end of the conflict earlier this month, however, when Azeri forces were clearly gaining the upper hand, Iran backtracked on its stance and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei acknowledged Azerbaijan's right to the Armenian occupied territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Iran has since welcomed the peace deal that was agreed upon. Why the sudden change of heart by Tehran?

News article:
Tel Aviv - Asharq Al-Awsat Israel will begin human trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine on Nov. 1 after receiving regulatory approval, the Defense Ministry announced on Monday. The Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) began animal trials for its “BriLife” vaccine in March. The Health Ministry and an oversight committee have now given the green light to take it to the next stage. The “Bri” is the first part of the Hebrew word for health; the “Il” stands for Israel and “life.” According to the ministry statement, 80 healthy volunteers, between the ages of 18 and 55, will be monitored for three weeks to see if virus antibodies develop. Two other phases will take place over a period of six months to ensure the vaccine is approved for mass use. The vaccine, the ministry said, has already tested well on a number of animal models and the IIBR has produced more than 25,000 doses for the first and second phases of the clinical trials. The Institute’s final goal is 15 million rations for Israelis and Palestinians, the ministry stressed. “This is a day of hope for the citizens of Israel, thanks to the researchers of the IIBR,” said Defense Minister Benny Gantz. He expressed gratitude for dozens of researchers who work day and night on this mission in full cooperation with the Health Ministry, pledging to provide the institute with all the means and support required to reach a safe and effective vaccine. The IIBR affirmed it obtained all the necessary authorizations from the Health Ministry to begin human trials, noting that it also obtained the approval of the US Department of Health. Meanwhile, Israel’s Channel 12 channel reported on Monday that the foreign intelligence service, Mossad, brought a Chinese coronavirus vaccine to Israel in recent weeks in order to study and learn from it. Israel is trying to reach agreements to purchase coronavirus vaccines from several other potential developers, according to an informed senior Health Ministry official. The coronavirus cabinet held a two-day meeting on Sunday, chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but found no radical solutions to the fundamental issues raised by the public on the current partial lockdown. Members agreed on the gradual reopening of the educational sector, with tighter fines imposed on violators of Health Ministry instructions, A $150 fine will be imposed on those who do not wear a mask, and $10,000 for those who open their shops without an approval from the ministry.

The physician for prominent ultra-Orthodox Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky said on Wednesday that the 92-year-old has recovered from the coronavirus. Following the pronouncement by Dr. Ori Rogowski from Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, Kanievsky’s HMO said he is no longer required to quarantine, according to the Ynet news site. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Kanievsky’s grandson on Wednesday and told him he was pleased to hear that the rabbi was no longer sick with COVID-19. “We’re pleased he recovered,” Netanyahu reportedly told Yaakov Kanievsky. According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, the premier additionally said the whole country had prayed for Kanievsky’s recovery. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The entire nation prayed, and is still praying, for the well-being of the Rabbi as an admired leader and a figure devoted entirely to Torah,” Netanyahu said. The Haredi leader’s grandson in response reportedly claimed that it was a “distortion of the media” that his grandfather had called for virus restrictions to be ignored — Kanievsky has been criticized for instructing schools to open in defiance of regulations. “The rabbi instructs that regulations should be followed and masks should be worn,” the grandson told Netanyahu, according to Channel 12 news. Advertisement Netanyahu also expressed satisfaction at the reduction of transmission rates in ultra-Orthodox localities. “In a comprehensive partnership, with responsibility and dialogue, we will maintain what has been achieved with hard work and we will lead Israel to being a green and safe country,” Netanyahu said. Kanievsky is a hugely influential leader of the non-Hasidic Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox community in Israel, with hundreds of thousands of followers. He was confirmed to have the virus earlier this month and his condition briefly worsened a week after he contracted COVID-19. Kanievsky was diagnosed with the virus just two days after the Haaretz daily reported that he violated quarantine, hosting visitors at his home in Bnei Brak following Yom Kippur, despite being required to self-isolate due to his exposure to a confirmed coronavirus carrier. Kanievsky has faced intense criticism for his handling of the pandemic and rulings given to his followers. Earlier this month, even as he was receiving treatment for COVID-19, Kanievsky instructed schools to reopen in defiance of government decisions, leading hundreds of schools to illicitly open their doors. Advertisement The opening of schools is seen as a massive danger, with many of the ultra-Orthodox areas having high infection rates and indoor spaces understood to be major virus incubators. Schools in the rest of the country have remained shut for that reason. Kanievsky had already made headlines in March during the first wave of the pandemic, when, despite appeals from the Prime Minister’s Office and the Israel Police, he insisted that yeshivas and schools remain open in defiance of government calls to close them, handing down a ruling stating that “canceling Torah study is more dangerous than the coronavirus.” At the time, there were 200 active coronavirus cases in the country and no deaths. He changed course two weeks later, as the infections climbed to hundreds daily and as his hometown of Bnei Brak saw widespread infection and later ordered his followers to pray individually rather than in group services and wrote that those who violated social-distancing and health rules, endangering others, are akin to murderers in the eyes of Jewish law and may be reported to the Israeli authorities. Kanievsky was quoted by an online news report in early September as seemingly encouraging yeshiva students not to get tested for the virus, earning sharp criticism from Israel’s coronavirus czar Ronni Gamzu. Gamzu later apologized, saying the quotes attributed to the top ultra-Orthodox rabbi were misleading, apparently confirming a report in the ultra-Orthodox Mishpacha magazine that said the rabbi had not been referring to a blanket policy, but rather was ruling on specific circumstances regarding students who had been tested two weeks prior and who had since been isolated in study “capsules.” The announcement that Kanievsky had been infected came amid a national lockdown over the holidays due to surging infection rates, with significantly high numbers of new coronavirus cases in the ultra-Orthodox community. The week before, Kanievsky and Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, another leader of the Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox community in Israel, issued a call to follow the health regulations. A letter from them, which was publicized by the Health Ministry, called on the ultra-Orthodox to only hold prayer services outdoors, while observing social distancing and while wearing masks throughout. The letter said the health rules must be kept without exception and said the Sukkot holiday must be observed with one’s nuclear family only. Kanievsky also told his followers that they should take coronavirus tests if necessary during the festivals since this was an imperative for pikuah nefesh (saving lives).

Advertisement Netanyahu also expressed satisfaction at the reduction of transmission rates in ultra-Orthodox localities. “In a comprehensive partnership, with responsibility and dialogue, we will maintain what has been achieved with hard work and we will lead Israel to being a green and safe country,” Netanyahu said. Kanievsky is a hugely influential leader of the non-Hasidic Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox community in Israel, with hundreds of thousands of followers. He was confirmed to have the virus earlier this month and his condition briefly worsened a week after he contracted COVID-19. Kanievsky was diagnosed with the virus just two days after the Haaretz daily reported that he violated quarantine, hosting visitors at his home in Bnei Brak following Yom Kippur, despite being required to self-isolate due to his exposure to a confirmed coronavirus carrier. Kanievsky has faced intense criticism for his handling of the pandemic and rulings given to his followers. Earlier this month, even as he was receiving treatment for COVID-19, Kanievsky instructed schools to reopen in defiance of government decisions, leading hundreds of schools to illicitly open their doors. Advertisement The opening of schools is seen as a massive danger, with many of the ultra-Orthodox areas having high infection rates and indoor spaces understood to be major virus incubators. Schools in the rest of the country have remained shut for that reason. Kanievsky had already made headlines in March during the first wave of the pandemic, when, despite appeals from the Prime Minister’s Office and the Israel Police, he insisted that yeshivas and schools remain open in defiance of government calls to close them, handing down a ruling stating that “canceling Torah study is more dangerous than the coronavirus.” At the time, there were 200 active coronavirus cases in the country and no deaths. He changed course two weeks later, as the infections climbed to hundreds daily and as his hometown of Bnei Brak saw widespread infection and later ordered his followers to pray individually rather than in group services and wrote that those who violated social-distancing and health rules, endangering others, are akin to murderers in the eyes of Jewish law and may be reported to the Israeli authorities. Kanievsky was quoted by an online news report in early September as seemingly encouraging yeshiva students not to get tested for the virus, earning sharp criticism from Israel’s coronavirus czar Ronni Gamzu. Gamzu later apologized, saying the quotes attributed to the top ultra-Orthodox rabbi were misleading, apparently confirming a report in the ultra-Orthodox Mishpacha magazine that said the rabbi had not been referring to a blanket policy, but rather was ruling on specific circumstances regarding students who had been tested two weeks prior and who had since been isolated in study “capsules.” The announcement that Kanievsky had been infected came amid a national lockdown over the holidays due to surging infection rates, with significantly high numbers of new coronavirus cases in the ultra-Orthodox community. The week before, Kanievsky and Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, another leader of the Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox community in Israel, issued a call to follow the health regulations. A letter from them, which was publicized by the Health Ministry, called on the ultra-Orthodox to only hold prayer services outdoors, while observing social distancing and while wearing masks throughout. The letter said the health rules must be kept without exception and said the Sukkot holiday must be observed with one’s nuclear family only. Kanievsky also told his followers that they should take coronavirus tests if necessary during the festivals since this was an imperative for pikuah nefesh (saving lives).

The first volunteer in trials for Israel’s new coronavirus vaccine has been released from the hospital, saying he feels “great.” Segev Harel, a 26-year-old undergraduate student, was injected at the Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan on Sunday, and was kept in the hospital for 24 hours of observation. In his first English-language comments, he said: “Hello everybody, good morning, thank you all for your support. “I’m here after spending the night in Sheba Medical, and now I’m going home and I feel great, and I hope we will bring the vaccine to Israel and to the whole world.” The vaccine, named Brilife, was developed by the Israel Institute for Biological Research. Some 15 million shots are already being produced, in the hope that the trial goes smoothly. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Eytan Ben-Ami, a Sheba doctor who is part of the team directing the trial, told The Times of Israel: “The first patient was kept in hospital for 24 hours to observe him in case of any adverse effects and there were none. “Everything has been really smooth. It’s very early in the process, but until now, everything is going according to plan.” Soon after Harel left Sheba, the second volunteer to receive a shot, Aner Ottolenghi, started the hospital discharge procedure. Ottolenghi, a 34-year-old doctoral student, had spent the night at Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem, where he was given the shot. Advertisement A statement from Hadassah said that he “felt great this morning and spent the night without any symptoms or issues due to the vaccine. He says that he is sleeping well.” The first phase of the clinical trial is expected to last roughly a month and will involve some 80 volunteers ages 18 to 55. The second phase in December will test roughly 1,000 volunteers ages 18 to 85 at eight hospitals around the country. In this phase, volunteers with preexisting conditions will be allowed to participate. If that larger group responds well to the vaccine and antibodies are detected in their blood, injections will then be given to some 30,000 people in April or May 2021. If the vaccine works well and there are no significant side effects, it will then be approved for full use in the general population. Last Monday, the Defense Ministry announced that Israel had begun mass-producing the potential coronavirus vaccine and plans to distribute it to both Israelis and Palestinians if it is approved for use. The director of the state-run Israel Institute for Biological Research, Shmuel Shapira, said it will produce 15 million doses in the first stage and estimated the shot could be ready by July. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

The boss of one of Israel’s largest hospitals has placed a huge order for Russia’s Sputnik-V coronavirus vaccine, arguing that concerns over the formula are due to tensions between Moscow and Washington, rather than safety issues. Zeev Rotstein, director of Jerusalem’s Hadassah Medical Centre believes Western objections are more political than scientific, telling Israeli newspaper Haaretz, “it’s like the space race. It’s no wonder the Russians called the vaccine Sputnik 5. They wanted to remind the Americans who reached space first.” Rotstein said the “results and safety we’ve seen have been very good. There’s a good probability that the vaccine is safe. And there’s a reasonable probability ... that it’s also effective.” Also on rt.com No Sputnik V for you! EU insists only ‘approved’ Covid vaccines allowed after Orban says Hungary is in talks with Russia & China Russia drew criticism from some international scientists in August after becoming the first country to approve a vaccine for the virus.

News article:
By Aryeh Stern YERUSHALAYIM — The Health Ministry is considering the option of recommending legislation requiring Israeli citizens to be vaccinated against coronavirus when the vaccine is made available in Israel. The debate came after an announcement by Pfizer that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective and could begin to be rolled out by the end of 2020. The move is intended to push members of the public who fear vaccination to immunize themselves and encourage the chances of herd immunity among the populace and those who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus. The ministry’s epidemic task force has previously expressed concern about public hesitation to receive a vaccine and the consequences should a large slice of the population refuse to be vaccinated. The task force proposed to step up the Health Ministry information campaign about the pandemic in order to provide additional information about the vaccination. The proposal may face legal opposition, however. “In principle, the State of Israel has until today refrained from legally requiring any vaccinations,” said Dr. Adi Niv-Yagoda, an expert in health policy and medical law at the Tel Aviv University. “Even today, the state allows a citizen to maintain autonomy and not be vaccinated with the routine vaccines recommended by the Health Ministry,” said Niv-Yagoda. “Many steps are taken to explain the importance of immunization. … Consequently the immunization rate [in Israel] is one of the highest in the world.” Niv-Yagoda said that despite the pandemic, a law forcing citizens to immunize themselves “constitutes a fatal violation of basic rights and freedoms of the individual. The way to achieve high immunization coverage is through advocacy and the establishment of trust between the government and the public.”

Prioritizing the elderly for COVID-19 vaccines doesn’t make sense, but giving the first shots to young superspreaders could be a shortcut toward “herd immunity,” an Israel Prize-winning scientist has claimed. Health services internationally are planning how exactly they will allocate the first batches of vaccines that they receive, following Pfizer’s announcement last week that its coronavirus shot appears to be 90 percent effective, and Moderna’s announcement Monday that it is hitting 94.5%. The elderly and vulnerable are expected to be first, including in Israel, which signed a deal with Pfizer on Friday and has had an agreement with Moderna since June. But for the sake of public health, social butterflies are a far better investment, says Prof. Shlomo Havlin, a pioneer of statistical physics, who insists that the idea of starting with elderly people like him just doesn’t make sense. “It would be much more effective to immunize the potential spreaders,” he told The Times of Israel on Sunday. “This way they won’t infect others and the pandemic will decay much faster.” Sign up for the Tech Israel Daily and never miss Israel's top tech stories Newsletter email address Subscribe By signing up, you agree to the terms The 78-year-old Bar Ilan University professor said that’s the best route toward herd immunity, arguing: “It’s not the kind of idea that will be popular, and you would think that it wouldn’t be good for me, as an older person, but it would actually benefit everyone.” Havlin’s latest study, which he says illustrates his logic, has been peer-reviewed and will soon be published in the journal National Science Review. No matter how fast the vaccine producers work, all countries are expected to receive their vaccines in batches. The director-general of the Health Ministry reportedly moved to manage expectations on Monday, according to Army Radio, telling ministers that only 100,000 Israelis will receive the necessary two doses of the coronavirus vaccine ordered during the first quarter of 2021. Advertisement Havlin, who is renowned for developing the first mathematical evaluation theory for the stability of the internet, said of his proposal: “If you don’t have enough vaccine and you want to protect the whole population, this is the only way to do it.” The principle is simple, he insisted, noting that it has been shown worldwide that huge percentages of infections are spread by a small number of people referred to as superspreaders who move around a lot. “Those who don’t move around much, like me, can be infected but can’t really infect many others,” he said. “So it’s good for me, but isn’t really so good on a national level, if I get the vaccine.” This argument, though absent from public discussions among health officials, has been raised a few times in academic circles. Three health experts from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Southern California argued in a September article that the elderly should wait until potential superspreaders receive shots. But their claim was very conceptual; they offered no stats to show the bottom-line benefit. Havlin has advanced the argument by building a complex model that he says predicts the advantages of inoculating potential superspreaders first, and by suggesting how that could be carried out. His conclusion: Societies will get three times the benefit from their initial batches of coronavirus shots if they are administered to potential spreaders, instead of the elderly and vulnerable. Advertisement “This is a very big difference,” he said. “If it were a 10 percent or 20% difference in effectiveness you could say it’s not so important, but the figure we see is significant. This is because in society many people have few encounters while a few people have lots of encounters.” Havlin is convinced that identifying the high-encounter people is easier than imagined. Cellphone data could make it very simple, though he admitted that privacy laws make it unlikely the information would be handed to health officials. But they could start with people in jobs that, by their nature, involve lots of face-to-face contact. Many countries plan to vaccinate health workers; he suggested including teachers, retail employees and others whose professional profile indicates exposure to large numbers of people. Havlin also wants to seek out society’s social butterflies and immunize them, which he said would be easy. One method he suggested was to send researchers to any public place, gather 10 people, give them a questionnaire that assesses their level of social interaction, and vaccinate the most sociable person in each such group. Havlin created a mathematical model to see what would happen in society if such a questionnaire method were deployed. His upcoming journal article consists mostly of findings from this modeling, with the conclusion that initial shots of a vaccine would have triple the impact in cutting cases in a society. Politically speaking, it would be an uphill struggle to opt for such an approach, Havlin admitted. “It’s not easy to implement,” he said. “For example, how can Bibi say, ‘I won’t give immunization to older people’? Many won’t understand.” However, he said, the potential benefits of his approach could be worth going out on a limb for. Eran Segal, a Weizmann Institute computational biologist whose coronavirus projections are closely followed by Israelis, estimated that if Israel obtained around 500,000 vaccines, expected in January or February, it could reduce the number of serious cases by 40%. Advertisement His projections were based on the assumption that available vaccines are used to inoculate the oldest members of society: The first 500,000 vaccines could protect Israelis over 75, and 800,000 could immunize all those over 70. Segal, reached by The Times of Israel to comment on Havlin’s superspreaders-first idea, said that some such people are identifiable but others aren’t, which presents a challenge. He suggested that a hybrid vaccination model may have potential. “It could very well be that a combination of vulnerable and superspreaders would work better,” Segal said.

News article:
By Hamodia Staff YERUSHALAYIM — Media reports that plans are afoot to force Israelis to get a Covid-19 shot are untrue, according to Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch. “There is no intention to advance legislation” of this kind, the Likud MK told Channel 12, and said he was aware that some Israelis are saying they intend to refuse vaccination when it becomes available. A recent poll showed that 52 percent of Israelis plan to forego the shot, at least on the first round. The Israel Democracy Institute survey found that only 40 percent would take a first shot at the vaccine, likely indicating a concern that safety standards could get slighted as the companies rush to complete trials and begin production. Kisch said he checked with Health Minister Yuli Edelstein earlier today, and the latter told him the reports are “false and misleading.” The deputy health minister says he believes the reports stemmed from a “misunderstanding” after health officials consulted with legal representatives on the possibility of forcing coronavirus testing. Meanwhile, the infection rate in the Palestinian Authority was up. The PA Health Ministry reported 742 new cases over the last 24 hours, the most in some months. Around 22% of tests came back positive, suggesting that the virus is spreading among Palestinians who have not yet been tested. In Gaza, 389 new coronavirus infections were confirmed on Thursday, and around 15% of tests came back positive, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Hamas health authorities have said that the coastal enclave could return to lockdown if the number of active cases increases. The PA, in Yehuda and Shomron, currently has 5,402 active coronavirus cases, and the Gaza Strip has 3,827.

News article:
Israel said Friday it is in advanced stages of negotiations with British drug maker AstraZeneca to secure the supply of a coronavirus vaccine for five million people. Under to the agreement, AstraZeneca would provide some 10 million vaccine doses, with its vaccine requiring two doses per person. The vaccine would be sold under a nonprofit model – the company would not profit from selling the product to Israel during the pandemic. Haaretz podcast: Will Trump's purged Pentagon let Israel attack Iran? Credit: Haaretz The initial supply of AstraZeneca vaccines would arrive in Israel in the first half of 2021 subject to regulatory authorities in Europe, the United States and Israel. This deal would include the biggest supply of vaccines Israel has secured so far. The talks to seal the deal are held on the order by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein. Currently, Israel only has agreements with three drug companies developing coronavirus vaccines: Pfizer, which has recently said that their new test results show its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective, Moderna, which said its vaccine is 94.5% effective and is now at a late-stage clinical trial , and Arcturus, which is still in the first stage. Data published on Thursday showed that AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s potential COVID-19 vaccine produced a strong immune response in older adults, with researchers expecting to release late-stage trial results by Christmas. The data, reported in part last month but published in full in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday, suggest that those aged over 70, who are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19, could build robust immunity. “The robust antibody and T-cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging,” said Maheshi Ramasamy, a consultant and co-lead investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group. “We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.” Late-stage, or Phase III, trials are ongoing to confirm the findings, researchers said, and to test whether the vaccine protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of people, including people with underlying health conditions. Results of those trials should definitely be known by Christmas, the Oxford Vaccine Group’s director, Andrew Pollard, said, adding it was too early to know whether and how well the vaccine works in preventing COVID-19 disease. “We’re still waiting to get to the point where we can do the analysis to just work out how well the vaccine can protect people, and we’re getting ever closer to that,” he told journalists. “We are optimistic that we’ll be able to do that before Christmas, and obviously we’ll share that with you as soon as we can at that point.” The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine candidate, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, had been among the front-runners in global efforts to develop shots to protect against infection with the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. “We’re not in a rush. We and it’s not a competition with the other developers,” Oxford’s Pollard said, adding that AstraZeneca would release headline efficacy data before it was published in an academic journal. Oxford University has set a target of 53 infections to start the interim analysis of its late-stage trial results, though “lots of cases” in its trial arms in Britain, South Africa and Brazil mean the exact number of infections reported could differ. Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna shots, both of which use new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), AstraZeneca’s is a viral vector vaccine made from a weakened version of a common cold virus found in chimpanzees. The Phase II trial reported in The Lancet involved a total of 560 healthy volunteers, with 160 aged 18-55, 160 aged 56-69, and 240 aged 70 or over. Volunteers got two doses of the vaccine or a placebo, and no serious side effects related to the AZD1222 vaccine were reported, the researchers said. AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world.

News article:
The Health Ministry has reneged on its previous opposition and plans to support a return to school for all grades in cities with low infection rates, Channel 12 news reported Saturday night. The matter had been expected to go up for discussion on Sunday evening, at a meeting of the coronavirus cabinet to discuss the government’s next steps on the coronavirus pandemic, However last Saturday it was announced that the meeting would be delayed to Monday, apparently to allow more work to be done by ministries before ministers convene. Health officials had previously raised objections to the swift return of schoolchildren to class. The Channel 12 report did not indicate what had led to the sudden change of course. Other news reports said health officials continue to be opposed to reopening schools. Currently, grades 1-4 are back in class, with grades 5-6 expected to join them on Tuesday, and grades 11-12 to return to the classroom a week later. Grades 7-10 are continuing distanced learning. Education Minister Yoav Gallant has long pushed for a return of most kids to school. On Saturday evening he tweeted: “Millions of students must immediately return to school. In the long months of extended lockdown they have accumulated significant educational gaps and have suffered loneliness. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The consequences of the extended lockdown will be with these children for a long time,” he said. “We must not forget Israel’s future generation.” Channel 12 also reported that with Jerusalem’s latest deals for vaccines with pharma companies Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Arcturus, Israel is expected to have doses for 12 million people — enough vaccines for everyone in the country. However, none of the deals guarantee a deadline for the arrival of the agreed-upon vaccines, and with mass global demand, it is still not clear how many vials Israel will get, and when. Advertisement And though all the companies are in various advanced stages of development and testing, no vaccine has so far been approved for general use by regulators in the US and Europe. Channel 12 reported that since Israel signed its latest major deal — with AstraZeneca — long after the US and Europe, it is likely to be at the bottom of the waiting list and see significant delays in supply. Israel is also in talks with Russia to receive its “Sputnik V” vaccine, though some experts have questioned its opaque certification process. “We will continue to work to ensure that we will have as many vaccines for as many citizens, from as many sources and as fast as possible,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday, Pfizer said Friday it is asking US regulators to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine, starting the clock on a process that could bring limited first shots as early as next month. Moderna is also expected to seek emergency authorization within weeks Advertisement AstraZeneca is not as far along in the process, but the company announced Thursday that in initial trials its vaccine has shown to safely produce a robust immune response in healthy older adults. The vaccine produced fewer side effects in people aged 56 and over than in younger people — a significant finding given that COVID-19 disproportionately causes severe illness among seniors, the company said as it released its phase 2 trial results. The manufacturers said the vaccine was undergoing larger, more comprehensive phase 3 trials to confirm the results. A vaccine is seen as the best hope to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year and unleashed devastation on the global economy. So far, 1.2 million people have died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Israel is also working on a home-grown vaccine, though it is currently only in phase 1 trials and its development is expected to take months longer than the foreign candidates.

News article:
The first coronavirus immunization centers could be in use by next month, German Health Minister Jens Spahn has revealed. UNICEF says 2 billion doses could be shipped to poor countries in 2021. DW rounds up the latest. German Health Minister Jens Spahn told Redaktions Netzwerk Deutschland Monday he had asked the country's 16 regional states to establish coronavirus immunization centers by mid-December, assuming European authorities approved a first vaccine.

The first coronavirus immunization centers could be in use by next month, German Health Minister Jens Spahn has revealed. UNICEF says 2 billion doses could be shipped to poor countries in 2021. DW rounds up the latest. German Health Minister Jens Spahn told Redaktions Netzwerk Deutschland Monday he had asked the country's 16 regional states to establish coronavirus immunization centers by mid-December, assuming European authorities approved a first vaccine. "I'd rather have a ready-to-go immunization center that remains inactive for several days than a licensed vaccine that cannot be administered," the minister said, reiterating that vulnerable persons, such as the elderly, would be treated first.

GAZA (Reuters) — A sharp rise in coronavirus infections in the Gaza Strip could overwhelm the Palestinian enclave’s meager medical system by next week, public health advisers said on Sunday. Gaza, where the dense and poor population of 2 million is vulnerable to contagions, has logged 14,000 coronavirus cases and 65 deaths, mostly since August. Seventy-nine of Gaza’s 100 ventilators have been taken up by COVID-19 patients, said Abdelraouf Elmanama, a microbiologist who is part of the enclave’s pandemic task force. “In 10 days the health system will become unable to absorb such a hike in cases and there might be cases that will not find a place at intensive care units,” he said, adding that the current 0.05% mortality rate among COVID-19 patients could rise. Gaza’s Hamas rulers have so far imposed one lockdown. “We are not giving Hamas any ‘coronavirus discounts’,” Israeli cabinet minister Izhar Shay told Army Radio after the IDF retaliated earlier Sunday against Hamas military sites after a rocket was launched from Gaza against southern Israel. “We will continue responding as appropriate,” he said. But Shay said Israel was enabling international humanitarian aid to reach Gaza, adding: “This is the level that we can preserve in the coronavirus context.” Abdelnaser Soboh, emergency health lead in the World Health Organization’s Gaza sub-office, cautioned, however, that “within a week, we will become unable to care for critical cases”. The infection rate among those being tested was 21%, with a relative increase in carriers over the age of 60, he said. “This is a dangerous indicator since most of (those over 60) may need to be hospitalized,” Soboh added.

A top Health Ministry official said Tuesday that Israel was entering a third wave of coronavirus infections, warning that rising infection rates would likely climb even further. Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, the acting head of the ministry’s public health services division, noted that over 1,200 new cases were recorded Monday for the first time since mid-October and that the average of new daily infections over the past week was 982. These figures are “very worrying,” she said. “This rise does not include the opening of malls or the return of grades five and six, meaning there will be more rises. This is the start of the third wave,” Alroy-Preis said during a briefing. “This is an emergency,” she said. “We are identifying more and more ‘orange’ cities [with moderate infection rates].” “This is exactly how the second wave started. Many of the sick are coming from red countries — it’s a serious vector,” she added, referring to countries with high infection rates. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms She said officials are looking into the possibility of reopening isolation hotels for those returning from abroad. Alroy-Preis’ warning joined that of coronavirus czar Nachman Ash, who said earlier Tuesday that Israel was in a “state of emergency” due to climbing infections. Health Ministry Director-General Chezy Levy, however, pushed back against those warnings. Advertisement “We’re not in an emergency situation at the moment,” Levy told Channel 12 news. “The rise in morbidity is likely to bring us there, perhaps even in big leaps, but we’re certainly not there yet.” Levy also told the Kan public broadcaster he doesn’t think the government will, or necessarily can, ban travel to Turkey, after reports said the National Security Council was weighing such a move. During the briefing, Alroy-Preis said health officials were not planning on attempting to impose a lockdown over the winter holidays, hours after Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch said the ministry would push for a nightly curfew during Hannukah and Christmas. “We’re on the verge of restrained steps — right now every sick person is infecting more than one other. It’s possible that limited measures can slow the advance of the disease, and we won’t need significant steps,” she said. Alroy-Preis said although the main infection zones were in the Arab community, numbers were high in the general population as well. She also advised against relying on a vaccine getting to Israel anytime soon. Advertisement “We’ll likely need to get through the winter with most Israelis not vaccinated,” she said. According to the Health Ministry, 789 new cases had been confirmed as of Tuesday evening, after 1,244 were diagnosed the day before, bringing the number of infections since the pandemic began to 337,961. The death toll stood at 2,877, with 12 fatalities since the morning. Active cases further climbed to 10,707, with 264 in serious condition, including 84 on ventilators. Another 80 were in moderate condition and the rest had mild or no symptoms. Of the 43,201 tests performed so far on Tuesday, 1.8 percent came back positive, down slightly from recent days. The renewed rise in infections comes as the government continues to roll back many of the restrictions that were in place during the second nationwide lockdown, with high school students returning to class on Sunday and some malls allowed to reopen last week.

News article:
One-and-a-half million doses of a coronavirus vaccine purchased by Israel could end up going to the Palestinian Authority, due to bureaucratic restrictions on the vaccine. According to a report by Kan, Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem purchased 1.5 million doses of the Sputnik 5 vaccine, a coronavirus vaccine developed by Russia. Hadassah, which paid an advance on the vaccine, has applied for permission from the Israeli Health Ministry to use the vaccine. But the Health Ministry has thus far refused to approve the Sputnik 5 vaccine, leading Hadassah Hospital to seek alternative uses for the doses of the vaccine which were already ordered. Hospital officials are reportedly in talks with the United Arab Emirates to sell off the vaccine, which the UAE would in turn donate to the Palestinian Authority. Israel also has secured deals for the acquisition of other foreign-made coronavirus vaccines, including Moderna and Pfizer, and is developing a domestic coronavirus vaccine, which is estimated to be available by the summer of 2021.

One-and-a-half million doses of a coronavirus vaccine purchased by Israel could end up going to the Palestinian Authority, due to bureaucratic restrictions on the vaccine. According to a report by Kan, Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem purchased 1.5 million doses of the Sputnik 5 vaccine, a coronavirus vaccine developed by Russia. Hadassah, which paid an advance on the vaccine, has applied for permission from the Israeli Health Ministry to use the vaccine. But the Health Ministry has thus far refused to approve the Sputnik 5 vaccine, leading Hadassah Hospital to seek alternative uses for the doses of the vaccine which were already ordered. Hospital officials are reportedly in talks with the United Arab Emirates to sell off the vaccine, which the UAE would in turn donate to the Palestinian Authority. Israel also has secured deals for the acquisition of other foreign-made coronavirus vaccines, including Moderna and Pfizer, and is developing a domestic coronavirus vaccine, which is estimated to be available by the summer of 2021.

News article:
The news that pharmaceutical companies have apparently succeeded in developing an effective vaccine against the coronavirus is encouraging, especially in light of the Israeli government’s success in signing deals to supply of millions of doses of the vaccine. But senior health officials erred in their calculations: They counted only the number of vaccine doses needed to immunize nine million Israeli citizens, and failed to include the number of doses needed to vaccinate five million Palestinians, residents of the West Bank and Gaza, living under Israeli control and responsibility. The Palestinian authorities, as local authorities responsible for certain areas, are of course required to safeguard the health of the residents of Gaza and the West Bank. Their responsibility is similar to that of Tel Aviv municipality’s responsibility for the health of city residents, which it assumes by, for example, enforcing social distancing regulations. However the activities of local government, whose authority is limited, does not absolve the central government of its responsibilities. The Palestinian Authority and Israeli municipalities are authorized to run such systems as health and education with the aid of money that the state of Israel earmarks for them from the tax revenue it collects, and from donations and taxes that these local authorities collect on their own, all subject to the overall authority of the state. At a time when the Palestinian authorities are unable to purchase the vaccines on their own, the state of Israel must do so – as part of its obligation to ensure equal rights to everyone living under its control, Israelis and Palestinians alike. Israel, since its establishment, has pursued a policy of controlling land without accepting responsibility for the non-Jews living there. Back during the War of Independence the nascent state decided to seize as much territory as possible, but to prevent its Palestinian residents form returning once the fighting ended. After the Six-Day War the state established a campaign to settle and Judaize the territories it occupied and even annexed them, whether de facto or de jure, without recognizing the rights of their Palestinian inhabitants. Although the international rules governing occupation hold the occupying state responsible for the health and welfare of the population living under the occupation, and despite the obligation under international human rights laws to honor the rights of everyone living under its rule – Israel promotes only the rights of Israelis, particularly Jews, including the 600,000 settlers. For 53 years Israel has claimed that the discriminatory treatment is only temporary, until the “final” status of the Gaza Strip and West Bank is determined. But this control has become permanently temporary. As long as Israel controls Israel/Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, it must treat the 6.5 million Jews and 6.5 million Palestinians living there equally. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Israeli government has shirked this responsibility. Back in March, when Foreign Ministry representatives were asked whether Israel will financially assist the Palestinian health system, they replied that “the Palestinian authorities must cope with the virus in their territory.” This is not an acceptable position. Firstly, denying responsibility for the health of those who live in the territory is accompanied by an insistence that the West Bank belongs to the Jewish people and that parts of it will be officially annexed. You don’t have to be a licensed lawyer to understand the absurdity of a position by which territory belongs to the Jewish people when it comes to settlement, exploitation and annexation, but that when its non-Jewish residents are ill, the territory is Palestinian. Secondly, Israeli control prevents the Palestinian authorities from confronting the pandemic, because Israel very much restricts their jurisdiction. Since 1967 Israel has been in control of the borders of the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian population registry and the tax system. That means, for example, that Palestinian police in areas B and C, 80 percent of the West Bank, are not allowed to enforce restrictions on gatherings, or the requirement to wear a mask. In the Gaza Strip, years of closures and economic warfare have weakened the infrastructure, hurt the economy and stunted the healthcare system, preventing it from financing vaccinations. Residents of Gaza and the West Bank need vaccines more than ever. Gaza reports about 800 new cases a day, and the percentage of people testing positive in the few tests that are carried out is close to 30 percent. The situation in the West Bank is similar. In Gaza the hospitals are filling up with coronavirus patients. Both authorities, Fatah and Hamas, have imposed nightly curfews, but the economic situation deters them from imposing further lockdowns. Palestinians receive no unemployment insurance or coronavirus grants. The Palestinian Authority is trying to buy vaccines but so far without any success. Since his Bar-Ilan speech in 2009, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and its partners have succeeded in dispelling the illusion that there are or will be two states in the future, or that the Palestinian authorities control the West Bank or Gaza. The reality of one sovereign authority, under which local authorities operate – a reality that has existed now for many years – obligates that authority to grant equal economic, cultural, civil and political rights. The first, immediate step, must be to purchase millions more vaccines. Because the virus, contrary to the government of Israel, doesn’t discriminate between Jews and Palestinians.

New COVID-19 restrictions will be imposed in the Gaza Strip as Hamas authorities seek to combat a wave of coronavirus infections in the Palestinian enclave without a return to total lockdown, the Hamas-run interior ministry announced on Thursday night. Gaza has 10,321 active cases, and 827 were recorded over the past 24 hours. Around 32 percent of coronavirus tests came back positive over the same period. Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said on Thursday night that authorities estimated that another 17,000 Gazans had been exposed to the virus. “The reality is, we are in an extremely dangerous stage,” al-Qidra said. Authorities shied away from implementing a full lockdown, instead opting for tightening restrictions. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “We considered imposing a full lockdown, but we decided against it, given the burdens it imposes,” interior ministry spokesperson Iyad al-Bozm said. Mosques, schools, universities and nurseries in Gaza will all be closed beginning on Saturday, and a nightly curfew is being imposed starting at 6 p.m., also starting on Saturday. On the following Friday and Saturday there will be a total lockdown across the Gaza Strip, al-Bozm said. Advertisement The Gaza Strip, which is ruled by the Hamas terror group, managed to avoid a major coronavirus outbreak for nearly five months by containing new arrivals in the coastal enclave for 21 days in quarantine centers. But since mid-August, the virus has spread throughout the Strip. Over the past three weeks, the situation has deteriorated dramatically, with hundreds of new infections announced every day. Between 20 and 30 percent of tests have consistently come back positive over the past three weeks, indicating that the virus is likely spreading widely undetected. Around 88% of hospital beds with ventilators for coronavirus patients in critical condition are already occupied, the Gaza health ministry reported on Wednesday night. An additional 66% of the intensive care unit capacity is also full, according to senior World Health Organization official Gerald Rockenschaub. Hamas health officials have warned that Gaza’s fragile health system — battered by a 13-year-blockade by Egypt and Israel as well as three wars between Israel and Hamas — cannot withstand much further strain. The terror group, which avowedly seeks to destroy Israel, has ruled the coastal enclave since 2007. Israel maintains the security blockade to prevent it from importing arms. “If the trend continues like that, we may reach capacity in the coming weeks. It’s difficult to predict. We can act now to curb the pandemic and avoid hitting the ceiling, but there’s not too much time for decisive action,” Rockenschaub, the World Health Organization’s director in the Palestinian territories, told The Times of Israel on Thursday.

Israel's health maintenance organizations were informed Thursday that Israel is going to receive a far greater high number of COVID-19 vaccine doses than initially thought. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Israel is now due to receive two shipments of two million doses each, which are expected to arrive either by the end of December or the start of January. 3 View gallery Illustration ( Photo: Shutterstock ) Like Britain, which will next week embark on a mass vaccination program, Israel's first batch of doses will be provided by Pfizer Inc. The American pharma giant developed its vaccine with German company BioNTech and received funding from Berlin. Germany said in October that it would share with Israel any coronavirus vaccination created in Europe. 3 View gallery Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, left, and his German counterpart Heiko Maas meeting in Berlin ( Photo: AFP ) German Health Minister Jens Spahn informed Israeli Ambassador to Germany Jeremy Issacharoff of the decision, which came following a meeting the week before between Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi and his German counterpart Heiko Maas in Berlin. The first batch of doses due to be received by Israel will enough to inoculate two million. At this stage, no decision has been taken on how to vaccines will be distributed between Israel's various HMOs, although it is likely that the division will be in proportion to the number of members of each HMO. 3 View gallery Health Ministry DG Hezi Levi ( Photo: Alex Kolomoisky ) Health Ministry DG Hezi Levi told Ynet last month that Israel will initially receive a small number of doses and express the hope that everyone in a high-risk group in Israel will be vaccinated by the end of Q1 2021. The first people to be vaccinated, in line with Health Ministry guidance for flu jabs, will be healthcare professionals and the elderly population, as well as those considered high-risk.

News article:
Children, pregnant women and recovering coronavirus patients will be the last to be vaccinated against the virus once Israel obtains the vaccine, sources on the committee making the decision said. Primarily, that's because these groups were not included in the clinical trials conducted so far on the coronavirus vaccine, although they are said to be part of future studies. Israel is expected to get its first 200,000 doses of vaccine in January, assuming a vaccine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vaccinations will then begin immediately. The FDA is in the final stages of approving two vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna, and vaccinations are expected to start in the United States later this month. Britain has already granted Pfizer’s vaccine emergency approval and is slated to start vaccinating members of the public next week. Even if the FDA approves the vaccines, Israeli regulators must approve them for use in Israel. During this process, the Health Ministry’s medical technology, information and research department will examine the full results of the clinical trials, which haven’t yet been published, in addition to the FDA’s decision. In general, however, medicines that are approved by the FDA are approved in Israel as well. It’s not yet clear whether vaccinations will be handled by Israel's health maintenance organizations or designated centers where people covered by any HMO can go. The decision is likely to depend on how soon the vaccines arrive and how many doses each shipment contains. The government has also started setting up mechanisms to monitor the vaccination process, including establishing a national coronavirus registry and a special agency jointly run by the ministry and the Israel Center for Disease Control. The agency will monitor the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and any side effects or complications. It will also conduct tests to see how long antibodies remain in people who are vaccinated and whether anyone who is vaccinated contracts the virus. The panel making decisions on who should be vaccinated first, a committee headed by Prof. Shmuel Rishpon, has drafted a proposal that largely aligns with the World Health Organization’s recommendations. The proposal suggests that the first to be vaccinated be people age 80 or older, medical staffers with high exposure to the virus and people with risk factors. The Health Ministry’s Magen Avot V’imahot administration, which is responsible for managing the coronavirus crisis in nursing homes and assisted living complexes, said it expects that residents and staffers at these facilities will also be at the top of the list. “A system for vaccinating 160,000 residents and workers already exists and is ready, including all the necessary databases,” an administration official said. However, not all the country’s elderly live in such facilities. Altogether, there are around 250,000 people aged 80 or older in Israel. Dr. Tal Brosh, who heads the infectious disease unit at Assuta Hospital in Ashdod and is a member of Rishpon’s committee, said everything depends on how many doses of the vaccine Israel receives. “Nobody knows exactly what will happen – how many doses will arrive and when,” he said. “If 50,000 doses arrive in January, vaccinating 50,000 elderly people is meaningless. In any case, the first doses that arrive, even if there are 200,000, aren’t going to substantially affect the pandemic in Israel.” Open gallery view A volunteer participant in a coronavirus vaccine trial at the University of Oxford, Nov. 2020. Credit: John Cairns / Univ. of Oxford Another issue the panel has been considering is whether recovered coronavirus patients should be vaccinated. “As of now, the World Health Organization’s recommendation is to vaccinate anyone who wants to be vaccinated, regardless of prior incidence of the coronavirus,” Brosh said. “But our approach at the moment says that anyone who has been ill with the coronavirus and recovered won’t be vaccinated in the first stage and should be a low priority. At this stage, it’s more important to vaccinate people who still haven’t gotten sick.” As for whether the vaccine is even necessary for or effective in recovered patients, Brosh said, “We don’t know. There’s a knowledge gap on this issue. We don’t know if people who got sick and recovered are protected against infection, or for how long. “At the moment, we know that documented incidents of reinfection are very rare,” he added. “But we can’t know what will happen if we wait a year or two, when these people lose their protection and become able to get infected again.”

News article:
A man who recently died of coronavirus may have been Israel’s first case of fatal reinfection with the disease, Kan news reported on Wednesday. The nursing home resident, 74, became ill in August with COVID-19, the disease cause by the virus. He was treated at Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tivka, where he eventually recovered. Three subsequent virus tests all showed that he was no longer infected. However, he recently became ill again with COVID-19 symptoms and was admitted to Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan. Doctors were unable to save him and he died earlier this week, Kan reported. Health officials are looking into the case to determine whether the patient became infected with a new strain of the virus, or if it somehow remained dormant in his body, hidden from the tests, before reemerging, the report said. Earlier this month Army Radio reported that doctors are investigating 81 cases of COVID-19 patients who appeared to have recovered from the coronavirus and later became reinfected.

The cases are still being probed, and officials believe that the final confirmed number of reinfections may be smaller. Israel is believed to be the first country in the world to confirm such a large-scale investigation into suspected reinfection. In October an Israeli reinfection case was, for the first time, documented in formal medical research. Advertisement Since the start of the outbreak there have been 339,318 virus cases diagnosed in Israel and 2,883 people have died, according to Health Ministry figure published Wednesday. Scientists currently believe that fewer than two dozen people worldwide have been confirmed reinfected, and the British medical journal Lancet put the figure as low as five in a recent report. The Lancet article put the issue of reinfection on the global health agenda as it documented America’s first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Last month Dutch authorities reported what is believed to be the first death as a result of reinfection. The deceased was an 89-year-old immunocompromised woman, who tested positive, recovered, and 59 days later fell ill and once again tested positive. She did not have negative tests between illnesses, but researchers have been reported as saying the genetic makeup of the virus found in the tests differed — suggesting it was reinfection and not a single prolonged illness. Tel Aviv University professor Mordechai Gerlic told The Times of Israel he suspects that mistakes account for some reports of reinfection, saying the diagnoses may well reflect testing errors, or patients who never fully recovered from their first infection.

She did not have negative tests between illnesses, but researchers have been reported as saying the genetic makeup of the virus found in the tests differed — suggesting it was reinfection and not a single prolonged illness. Tel Aviv University professor Mordechai Gerlic told The Times of Israel he suspects that mistakes account for some reports of reinfection, saying the diagnoses may well reflect testing errors, or patients who never fully recovered from their first infection. Advertisement Confirmed cases of reinfection should not cause alarm, he said. “In any biological system you have outliers, and the statistics here prove it’s not something to worry about.” Nathan Jeffay contributed to this report.

Health Ministry data on Wednesday morning showed 1,182 new cases of coronavirus diagnosed in Israel a day earlier. The number of active cases in the country stood at 11,072, the highest figure since October 30. Of those, 266 patients were in serious condition, including 94 on ventilators. A further 67 were in moderate condition and the rest had mild or no symptoms. The number of infections since the pandemic began increased to 338,591. The death toll held steady at 2,877, with no reported overnight fatalities. Testing reached its highest level of the week with 62,734 performed on Tuesday, and1.9 percent coming back positive, a slight drop from recent days. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms On Wednesday morning, Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch said that officials were still weighing recommending a national curfew to stem family visits over Hanukkah and Christmas amid the continued rise in new coronavirus infections. “The issue is still under discussion. The Health Ministry is considering the possibility, but it is not an effective step in reducing morbidity,” Kisch told Army Radio. While health officials have previously cast doubt on the efficacy of nightly curfews in curbing the spread of COVID-19, Kisch said on Tuesday in an interview with Channel 12 that there’s a “logic” to such a measure over the holiday to prevent people gathering around nightfall to light Hanukkah candles together. Advertisement It was unclear if the proposal had the backing of health officials or the cabinet, which has final say on any restrictions. Ministers have in the past rejected Health Ministry proposals for some lockdowns and other regulations. On Tuesday, Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, the acting head of the ministry’s public health services division, said that officials were not planning on attempting to impose a lockdown over the winter holidays. “We’re on the verge of restrained steps — right now every sick person is infecting more than one other. It’s possible that limited measures can slow the advance of the disease, and we won’t need significant steps,” she said. Alroy-Preis’s comments were made in a briefing in which she warned Israel was entering a third wave of coronavirus infections, and that rising infection rates would likely climb even further. Alroy-Preis said the infection figures were “very worrying.” “This rise does not include [those caused by] the opening of malls or the return of grades five and six, meaning there will be more rises. This is the start of the third wave,” Alroy-Preis said. Advertisement “This is an emergency,” she said. “We are identifying more and more ‘orange’ cities [with moderate infection rates].” “This is exactly how the second wave started. Many of the sick are coming from red countries — it’s a serious vector,” she added, referring to countries with high infection rates. She said officials are looking into the possibility of reopening isolation hotels for those returning from abroad. Alroy-Preis’s warning joined that of coronavirus czar Nachman Ash, who said earlier Tuesday that Israel was in a “state of emergency” due to climbing infections. Health Ministry Director-General Chezy Levy, however, pushed back against those warnings. “We’re not in an emergency situation at the moment,” Levy told Channel 12. “The rise in morbidity is likely to bring us there, perhaps even in big leaps, but we’re certainly not there yet.” Levy also told the Kan public broadcaster he doesn’t think the government will, or necessarily can, ban travel to Turkey, after reports said the National Security Council was weighing such a move. Alroy-Preis said although the main infection zones were in the Arab community, numbers were high in the general population as well. Advertisement She also advised against relying on a vaccine getting to Israel anytime soon. “We’ll likely need to get through the winter with most Israelis not vaccinated,” she said. The renewed rise in infections comes as the government continues to roll back many of the restrictions that were in place during the second nationwide lockdown, with high school students returning to class on Sunday and some malls allowed to reopen last week.

News article:
The main laboratory conducting coronavirus tests in the Gaza Strip halted operations Sunday due to a severe shortage of essential equipment and materials, Gaza's Health Ministry said. This is the latest in a series of dire signs about the state of Gaza's medical situation due to the ongoing rise in the number of coronavirus patients. As Haaretz reported last week, around 30 percent of coronavirus tests in Gaza are coming back positive, with the daily number of tests ranging from 2,000 to 2,500. 726 new patients were diagnosed in the 24 hours, bringing the number of active coronavirus patients to 10,591. 375 are hospitalized and 157 are on ventilators. The ministry said it recently managed to increase the number of coronavirus beds in hospitals to 170 and hopes to obtain equipment in the next few weeks to further increase the number to 200. Ministry sources said the actual number of virus carriers is probably higher than the official figure, given the relatively low number of daily tests and the fact that the diagnostic lab has ceased to function. Over the weekend, 10 Israeli doctors witnessed the situation in Gaza first-hand during a visit organized by Physicians for Human Rights. This is the first time Israeli doctors have entered the territory since the pandemic erupted. The doctors were there from Thursday to Sunday, carrying out 12 complex operations in two different hospitals – Nasser in southern Gaza and Shifa in Gaza City. One visiting physician, Prof. Iyad Khamaysi, director of the endoscopy unit at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, said that while everyone is now focusing on the coronavirus, the dire state of Gaza’s medical system isn’t due solely to the pandemic. Many chronically ill patients in the Strip, including cancer patients, need urgent treatment but are being pushed aside due to the virus," Prof. Khamaysi said. “You have to remember that manpower is limited, and the hospitals themselves have limited resources. Gaza in general has suffered from a severe shortage of medications, and the medical system was deficient even before the coronavirus. I encountered a great many cases in which patients needed urgent treatment but there was nobody to provide it," he said. Open gallery view A woman walks past a mural encouraging the wearing of face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic, on the main road of Nusseirat refugee camp, central Gaza Strip, Tuesday, November 24, 2020. Credit: Adel Hana,AP “For instance, the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Yunis has become a hospital for coronavirus patients. And all the other patients were sent to other hospitals, and that just put a further burden on the system. I encountered very serious cases of patients such as transplant patients who needed treatment and medications, but there was nobody to provide them,” Prof. Khamaysi added. Another member of the group, Dr. Jamal Dakdouki, is a psychologist who gave workshops for Palestinian mental health professionals on how to cope with the coronavirus from a mental health standpoint. He said that Gaza’s distress goes far beyond the medical system. Dr. Dakdouki said that on Thursday evening he saw masses of people crowding around ATMs to withdraw money from their newly deposited salaries: “You see the distress in everyone, and it’s clear there is very great economic pressure. People would rather spend hours near their bank branch, even if it’s crowded, so they can withdraw a few hundred shekels. In a tradeoff between health and livelihood, it’s clear which takes priority.” Based on conversations with their Palestinian counterparts, the Israeli doctors said that pressure is also rising on Gaza’s Hamas leadership to impose a total lockdown rather than the nighttime curfew they imposed last week. Dr. Dakdouki said there’s great concern that the number of hospital patients will soar due to an influx of flu patients as well as coronavirus cases, leading to talks of imposing a two-week lockdown starting December 15. The delegation brought medical equipment and drugs with them for use in treating various conditions, not just the virus. Most was delivered directly to hospitals and the rest to the Gazan Health Ministry’s pharmacy division. “Gaza’s health system has been in a serve crisis for years, and even more so following the eruption of the coronavirus,” said Salah Haj Yahye, who coordinates PHR’s activity in Gaza. He added that the visit wasn’t merely a humanitarian operation, but also a reminder that Gaza is suffering from a prolonged closure that harms patients, medical staff and the entire population.

That, however, will be a tough nut to crack. The last round of direct talks between the two sides took place in 2013, but back then the US, who mediated in those negotiations, failed to achieve a breakthrough. Since then Israel has continued with its expansionist activity in the disputed West Bank, while the Palestinians have stuck to their strategy of inciting the masses against the Jewish state, frustrating many in the liberal circles of Europe and the US, including Biden himself. The cutting of funds and Trump's seemingly one-sided policies have only made the situation worse, with the Palestinians losing their trust in the US as an objective mediator. If elected, Biden will need to address these issues and regain the faith of the Palestinians, and Sztokman is certain that he will be up for the challenge. "He is going to be great for Israel and the region. He is smart and understands the importance of stability and security and will be able to solve a number of pressing issues". Iranian Threat? However, those pressing issues do not stop at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Biden will also need to face Iran, if he ends up winning the race on 3 November. In 2018, when President Trump abandoned the Iran nuclear deal aimed at reducing Tehran's nuclear facilities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions on the Islamic Republic, Biden was critical of the decision. For him, leaving the agreement was wrong, just as it was immoral to keep imposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic, which has been struggling to cope with health and economic crises caused by the spread of COVID-19. Biden, who acknowledges "the challenges the regime in Iran poses to America's security interests", says he will take a different approach to the issue, finding "a smart way to be tough on Iran". Just as with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, here too Sztokman is certain that the Democratic candidate will do what's best for America, Israel, the region, and the world. "Biden will do the right thing with Iran. Trump's decision to step out [from the deal] in the middle of everything without listening to advisers was wrong. It was spontaneous and impulsive and it reflects the current president's incoherent foreign policy".

News article:
Yoram Ettinger, a former Israeli diplomat and an expert on Israel-US ties, says he definitely understands the reason behind the support from the Jewish state and the Gulf for Trump. "They trust Trump because he has applied military and financial pressure on the Islamic Republic, simultaneously boosting cooperation with moderate Arab states. Democrats, on the other hand, have courted the Ayatollahs and disappointed many in the Gulf". Now, as polls predict a victory for Trump's challenger, Joe Biden, Ettinger says history might repeat itself and the new boss in Washington might return to the policies implemented by the Obama administration. Past Mistakes And the problem is, says the expert, those policies were a mistake that should not be repeated. "First of all, with the eruption of the upheavals in the Middle East in 2011, the Democrats referred to that turbulence as an Arab Spring and a march of democracy without realising that that was a devastating tsunami. And, secondly, they refrained from admitting that Islamic terror was a threat and tackle it as such". Quite the opposite was true. In 2009, for example, loyal to its policy of political correctness, the Obama administration reportedly ordered to erase intelligence on individuals linked to a number of terror groups. And in 2015, when an Islamist extremist opened fire on two military installations in Chattanooga killing five people, Obama called it "workplace violence". "Biden is likely to continue that policy, simply because of the nature of his political advisers and he is also likely to shrink the US defence budget", predicts Ettinger. With Trump in office, the US defence budget has gone up. In 2020 it reached $738 billion, an increase of $21 billion from the previous year. Ettinger says that decision "enhanced the US posture of deterrence in the region and the entire world", whereas a move in the opposite direction would "whet the appetites of rogue regimes". Enemies Won't Rest Although the concept of a boosted budget as a tool of deterrence is still debatable, for a country that faces multiple security threats the importance of a big military budget can hardly be underestimated. In recent years, the US has managed to infuriate a number of regional players. First, in 2018, together with France and the UK, it launched a series of airstrikes in Syria, angering the authorities in Damascus.

News article:
With both US presidential candidates staunch supporters of the State of Israel and close personal friends of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli premier is likely viewing Tuesday’s election without dread for either outcome. While his preference for another Donald Trump victory seems obvious, Netanyahu knows Joe Biden has a good chance of moving into the White House, and is therefore ready to turn the pendulum’s swing into a political victory of his own. If the incumbent president gets four more years, the prime minister is likely to argue that it was their unique relationship that made the Trump administration one of the most pro-Israel in history. “I got Trump to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to move the US Embassy,” he can be expected to proclaim with increasing frequency as the next election in Israel nears. “It was due to my lobbying that he withdrew from the dangerous Iran nuclear deal. Because of our friendship he recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and declared that West Bank settlements aren’t illegal. And it’s no coincidence that the ‘Deal of Century’ peace proposal sounded like I wrote it myself,” he might say. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Only with Netanyahu in the Prime Minister’s Office can Israel continue to enjoy the fruits of this remarkably tight partnership, his supporters will argue. The trend of Arab countries normalizing ties will only continue if Netanyahu pushes Trump to seek more such peace deals, they will insist. The Iranian threat? It was Netanyahu who got the American president to quit the deal, and it will take Netanyahu to prevent him from negotiating another flawed agreement. And if Biden wins? Then Netanyahu is needed more than ever, his backers will say. Advertisement “It takes an experienced statesman like him to stand up to pressure. Who else could take on an administration hellbent on appeasing Iran and trying to force Israeli concessions on the Palestinian question?” they will ask. The prime minister prides himself on having fended off immense pressure, especially regarding Israel’s West Bank settlement enterprise, from the last Democrat who sat in the Oval Office. The fact that he dared openly confront and even antagonize Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, over the 2015 nuclear deal, shows that only someone of his stature can be trusted to stand up to Biden, Netanyahu and his supporters will doubtlessly argue. To be sure, it will be more difficult to portray Biden as hostile to Israel than it was with Obama. As opposed to the former president, whose detractors often cast doubts over his support for Israel, Biden has a 40-year record of staunch support for the Jewish state. He is said to have once referred to Israel as his “second home.” “We must have no daylight between us,” he told then-Israeli ambassador to Washington Michael Oren before his first visit to Jerusalem as vice president in March 2010. “We’ve been personal friends for almost three decades,” Netanyahu said as he hosted Biden a few days later in his office. “And in all that time you’ve been a real friend to me and a real friend to Israel and to the Jewish people and you’ve come to Israel many times since you came here first on the eve of the Yom Kippur War.” Advertisement But the friendly atmosphere quickly turned sour as local authorities announced a plan to build 1,600 housing units in Ramat Shlomo, a Jerusalem neighborhood east of the Green Line, during the vice president’s stay. The planned settlement expansion “undermines the trust we need right now and runs counter to the constructive discussions that I’ve had here in Israel,” Biden fumed. It was one of many quarrels between the Netanyahu government and the Obama administration. Still, six years and one very contentious nuclear deal later, Biden came to Jerusalem for a second visit as Obama’s deputy, and was welcomed like a good friend. “I want to thank you personally for your, for our personal friendship of over 30 years,” Netanyahu said at their joint press conference. “We’ve known each other a long time. We’ve gone through many trials and tribulations. And we have an enduring bond that represents the enduring bond between our people.” Biden then recalled his first meeting with Netanyahu in the early 1980s. “We met in a parking lot outside of a restaurant where I was meeting with some American Jewish leaders, and we became close friends and I later signed a picture for you that I, as a joke I said ‘Bibi, I don’t agree with a damn thing you say, but I love you.’” On the flipside, Netanyahu’s political opponents argue that it is bad news for US-Israel relations regardless of who wins Tuesday’s election. We don’t want to find ourselves with a Democratic Party in the United States acting like the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn Advertisement Another Trump term will irrevocably turn Israel into a partisan issue, they will say, as the US president has claimed that the Democrats are hostile to Israel, trying to drive a wedge between American Jews and the party most of them have traditionally been voting for. And if Biden triumphs? Netanyahu and the former Delaware senator may have known each other for decades, but clashes over Iran and the Palestinians are inevitable regardless of any personal affinity, the prime minister’s critics can be expected to argue, noting that a Biden administration would be more than just the man on the top. Incidentally, Biden’s running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, is also known as a friend of Israel. But it’s not unreasonable to assume that Biden, in a bid to reunite a divided Democratic party, may appoint some members of its progressive wing to key posts in the administration. Support for Israel was always a bipartisan consensus, but Netanyahu “decided, mostly for internal reasons, to break with that principle,” opposition leader Yair Lapid charged Monday. “Netanyahu created an almost complete identification between the current Israeli government and the Republican Party, between himself and President Trump. He wanted to use President Trump’s justified popularity in Israel to gain some points at home,” Lapid said. The prime minister’s alleged preference of the Republicans is playing into the hands of “radical elements” within the Democratic party, Lapid went on. “He’s pushing the Democrats further and further away. We don’t want to find ourselves with a Democratic Party in the United States acting like the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.” Even if Trump wins, Jerusalem needs the support of Democrats in Congress, where decisions crucial to Israel’s security are being taken, he warned. Still, even Lapid agreed that Israel doesn’t have to fret about the identity of the person who will be inaugurated on January 20. “It’s a tight race but there are things we already know: The next president of the United States will be a friend of Israel. Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden are friends of Israel with a deep commitment to Israel and to Zionism,” he said.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated US President-elect Joe Biden on Sunday, hailing a strong alliance that could be burdened by differences over policy on Iran and the Palestinians, Reuters reports. "Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Joe, we've had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the US and Israel," Netanyahu said on his Twitter account, which still carries a photograph of him and incumbent US President Donald Trump at its head. Having been in lockstep with Trump for four years, Netanyahu will likely be challenged by any departure by Biden from Trump's tough policy on Iran and toward the Palestinians. Biden has pledged to restore U.S. involvement in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal – which Trump had pulled out of – and a likely opposition by the White House to Israeli settlement of occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood. Netanyahu thanked Trump in a subsequent tweet: "Thank you @realDonaldTrump for the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally, for recognizing Jerusalem and the Golan, for standing up to Iran, for the historic peace accords and for bringing the American-Israeli alliance to unprecedented heights." Netanyahu's message came hours after many world leaders had already congratulated Democrat Biden, even as Trump refused to concede and pressed ahead with legal fights against the outcome. A spokesman for Netanyahu did not respond to a request for comment on the relative delay. Dani Dayan, Israel's former consul to New York said Netanyahu's slowed response was a precautionary move. READ: Israel is getting ever more concerned about the result of the US election "There is a president in the White House who has not yet acknowledged his defeat and whose whims definitely play a major role in his decision-making process and he will be sitting in the White House for another two and a half months," Dayan told Army Radio. The right-wing Netanyahu's particularly close ties with Trump followed an acrimonious relationship with his predecessor Barack Obama, which some critics have said had alienated Democrats and compromised U.S. bipartisan support for Israel. Michael Oren, Netanyahu's ambassador to Washington when Obama was president, predicted warm ties with Biden. "They will have disagreements over the peace process. They will have disagreements certainly over the Iran nuclear deal but I think their friendship is solid." Israel's stock market responded positively to Biden's win. Both the blue-chip Tel Aviv 35 index and the broader TA-125 were up about 0.3% in morning trade. Still, among Israelis, Trump has won overwhelming popularity and many may be sad to see him go. "I think the problem is that Biden will not be as tough or as strong as Donald Trump," said Aaron Morali, a student from Tel Aviv. "He made it hard for the Iranian people to have a nuclear plan but I think with Biden they have someone very easy and I am very, very scared of what will happen."

READ: Israel is getting ever more concerned about the result of the US election "There is a president in the White House who has not yet acknowledged his defeat and whose whims definitely play a major role in his decision-making process and he will be sitting in the White House for another two and a half months," Dayan told Army Radio. The right-wing Netanyahu's particularly close ties with Trump followed an acrimonious relationship with his predecessor Barack Obama, which some critics have said had alienated Democrats and compromised U.S. bipartisan support for Israel. Michael Oren, Netanyahu's ambassador to Washington when Obama was president, predicted warm ties with Biden. "They will have disagreements over the peace process. They will have disagreements certainly over the Iran nuclear deal but I think their friendship is solid." Israel's stock market responded positively to Biden's win. Both the blue-chip Tel Aviv 35 index and the broader TA-125 were up about 0.3% in morning trade. Still, among Israelis, Trump has won overwhelming popularity and many may be sad to see him go. "I think the problem is that Biden will not be as tough or as strong as Donald Trump," said Aaron Morali, a student from Tel Aviv. "He made it hard for the Iranian people to have a nuclear plan but I think with Biden they have someone very easy and I am very, very scared of what will happen."

News article:
Kuwait City: Kuwait’s Emir, Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmed Al Sabah, congratulated the US President-elect, Joe Biden, after news broke on Saturday of his victory. The Emir also congratulated Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who is set to become the first woman, first black person and first person of Indian descent to be elected to the position. In the cable, Sheikh Nawaf praised the historic and strong relationship between the US and Kuwait and said that he is looking forward to strengthening relations and joint cooperation in various aspects. The crown prince, Sheikh Mishal Al Ahmed Al Sabah, and the Prime Minister, Sheikh Khaled Al Sabah, also congratulated the US President-elect and Vice-President-elect in two separate cables. Historic relationship The two countries share a long history, of cooperation, mutual benefit and friendship, that began well before Kuwait gained independence. In 1911, by invitation from Sheikh Mubarak Al Sabah, the Reformed Church of America opened a medical centre in Kuwait, known to Kuwaitis as the American Hospital, or Al Americani. Then around 20 years later, with the discovery of oil, Kuwait formed a joint venture with the American Gulf Oil company in 1933. Ten years before Kuwait gained independence, the US government began fostering its relationship with Kuwait as it set up a US consulate. Then in 1961, the US government established diplomatic relations with Kuwait and upgraded the consulate to an Embassy. Since the 1980s, much of the relationship has been one of security and stability, as both parties have benefited from one another. With around 13,000 US military personnel stationed across the country, the number of troops in Kuwait make up one-third of the total US forces deployed in the region, including Iraq and Afghanistan. When Iran began attacking Gulf shipping tankers, mainly Kuwaiti vessels, in 1986, the US and the Soviet Union were invited by Kuwait to ensure the security of its tankers. Then during the 1991 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the US spearheaded a coalition of 34 countries that launched an aerial campaign against the Iraqis. Following 1991 liberation, the US increased its military presence in Kuwait, to ensure its interest in the region as well as curb a future Iraqi attack.

News article:
AMMAN: Palestinian leaders watching the results of the US elections say they are hoping for a re-engagement with Washington after years of squandered efforts by the Trump administration in the quest for peace. Senior Palestinian officials were asked during the crucial days after the poll to stay quiet in order to avoid provoking the US president, who will stay in power until Jan. 20. Vera Baboun, former Bethlehem mayor and a member of the Palestinian National Council, told Arab News that Palestinians are looking forward to the US government acknowledging their cause. “We hope that President-elect Joe Biden will respond positively to the call by President (Mahmoud) Abbas for an international conference for peace early in 2021.” Baboun said that diplomatic contacts must be renewed at a high level quickly so the upcoming conference can have substantive discussions. Kamala Harris, Biden’s deputy and running mate, has said that a Biden administration is committed to a two-state solution and will renew contacts with the Palestinian leadership, including reopening the Palestinian mission in Washington and the US mission in East Jerusalem. She also said that the US will restore financial support to the United Nations Refugee Agency and other humanitarian programs supporting the Palestinian people. Wadie Abunassar, director of the Haifa-based International Center for Consultations, told Arab News that Biden will certainly help restart Israeli-Palestinian talks, but won’t necessarily bring Palestinians an independent state. “It is difficult seeing Biden granting high priority to the Israeli-Palestinian track, especially with current Israeli and Palestinian leaders (Netanyahu and Abbas) around.” But Abunassar believes that Biden will make serious efforts “to maintain good ties with Israel and will avoid pressing it too much, especially in the absence of any serious Muslim or Arab pressure on him to grant Palestinians the right to self-determination.” However, former Palestinian government spokesman Jamal Dajani warned that Biden is unlikely to be the savior of Palestinians. “I am not sure if Biden as president will be able to undo the damage done by Trump,” Dajani said before calling on the Palestinian leadership to “stop banking on the US.” While Palestinian leaders refuse to link the renewal of contacts with Washington to the resumption of security ties with Israel, a number of Palestinians contacted by Arab News said that they are hoping that the departure of Trump and the election of a friendlier Biden administration might help resolve the current impasse with Israel. Of extreme interest to many Palestinians is the resolution of the tax revenue conflict that has resulted in the deprivation of money earmarked for Palestinians that has been held by Israel.

News article:
From Cairo to Baghdad to Doha, heads of state across the Middle East sent their congratulations to US President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday night after his victory in the presidential election against incumbent Donald Trump. One major player, however, has remained silent. Saudi Arabia, which is widely believed to have preferred Trump to Biden, has yet to publicly comment on Biden’s victory. “Congratulations to President-elect Joe Biden and VP-elect Kamala Harris,” Jordanian King Abdullah II said in a tweet. “I look forward to working with you on further advancing the solid historic partnership between Jordan and the United States, in the interest of our shared objectives of peace, stability and prosperity.” Jordan, an important regional ally to both Israel and the United States, had a difficult relationship with the outgoing president. While relations between the Jordanian government and the United States remained close during the Trump years, the American administration’s policies were often deeply unpopular among the kingdom’s pro-Palestinian majority. Trump was as divisive a president in the Middle East as he was at home in the United States, cultivating close ties with some governments and engendering bitter enmity from others. Trump forged especially good relations with a regional alliance of largely Sunni Muslim states, including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi was the first Arab leader to congratulate Biden on his victory. “El-Sissi looks forward to cooperation and common action so as to strengthen bilateral strategic relations between Egypt and the United States for the good of both nations and the two friendly peoples,” said Egyptian presidential spokesperson Bassam Radi. The former general was widely reported to prefer Trump, with whom he enjoyed an excellent personal rapport. Trump once referred to Sissi as “my favorite dictator.” Advertisement “We know the chemistry which exists between el-Sissi and Trump,” popular pro-military TV commentator Amr Adeeb said before the election. “If I were American, I’d pick Trump.” Some Egyptians also take a dim view of Biden’s former boss, president Barack Obama, for his support for the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood government in 2012. After popular protests and a subsequent military coup deposed the Brotherhood in July 2013, Obama briefly suspended billions in US aid to Egypt. Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani also congratulated Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris. The Trump administration saw a major blockade of Qatar by its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia. A Biden administration could reset regional dynamics, leading to a change in Qatar’s relationship with Saudi Arabia and its allies. “My best wishes to the people of the United States and I look forward to working together to continue strengthening the friendship between our countries,” Qatar’s leader tweeted. Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, sent his congratulations as well. “Our sincere wishes for further development and prosperity for the American people. The UAE and USA are friends and allies with a strong historic partnership that we look forward to strengthening together,” bin Zayed said in a tweet. Advertisement The UAE recently inked a peace treaty with Israel as part of a normalization agreement that Trump helped broker. Much like Egypt and its large neighbor Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi reportedly hoped that Trump would remain in power. Bahraini King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa sent a letter to Biden congratulating him on his election win, according to a statement carried in state media. Bahrain, like the UAE, also recently signed a normalization deal with Israel. “The Kingdom of Bahrain values its historical, strong, and extensive relations with the United States of America, which are more than 120 years old. We will work to continue constructive cooperation at every level which strengthens strategic relations,” King Hamad said in a statement. Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok congratulated Biden. Sudan recently agreed to make peace with Israel after Trump removed Khartoum from the US State Department’s blacklist of state terror sponsors. The move was enormously controversial in the country, where there is little evident popular appetite for relations with Israel. “On behalf of the Sudanese people, I congratulate @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris for their election as President & Vice President. Looking forward to working closely with them both to continue building bridges of friendship and cooperation between our two nations and countries,” Hamdok said. Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi also congratulated Biden. The former vice president is a controversial figure among many Iraqis, however, who recall his strong support for the 2003 Iraqi war. “I extend my congratulations to the President-elect of the United States of America Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and I look forward to strengthening the strategic ties between our two countries towards a future based on mutual respect and the values of joint and close cooperation in order to overcome challenges, support peace and security, and achieve stability and prosperity,” al-Kadhimi said. In his congratulatory note, Lebanese President Michel Aoun “expressed his hope that during his term there will be balance in Lebanese-American relations for what is in the interest of the friendly Lebanese and American peoples.” Advertisement Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, was silent as of Sunday afternoon. Trump enjoyed a close relationship with his “friend” Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. He bucked a growing international consensus that bin Salman ordered the murder of opposition journalist Jamal Khashoggi and vetoed a resolution that would have ended American military support for the controversial Saudi-led campaign in Yemen. Two hours ago the king and crown prince of Saudi Arabia congratulated the president of Tanzania for his re-election. Nothing yet about the election of @JoeBiden Trump had pretty much given MbS a blank check, those days are over https://t.co/5lthtb9pb9 — Kim Ghattas (@KimGhattas) November 7, 2020 Biden, however, has had harsh words for his predecessor’s perceived leniency towards the kingdom. He has promised to “review the US relationship with the government of Saudi Arabia and end support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.” “I would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell more weapons to them. We were going to in fact make them pay the price, and make them in fact the pariah that they are,” Biden said in 2019. Since Biden’s win was announced, Saudi Arabia has issued congratulatory statements to two other heads of state, including a note to the president of Tanzania on his reelection. It has yet to comment on the Biden victory.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat UN chief Antonio Guterres congratulates US President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a UN spokesman said on Monday, describing US partnership with the world body as an “essential pillar” of global cooperation. Biden will succeed President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the 193-member United Nations and wary of the value of multilateralism during his four years in office. Guterres took up his role just a few weeks before Trump in 2017. Guterres “reaffirms that the partnership between the United States and the United Nations is an essential pillar of the international cooperation needed to address the dramatic challenges facing the world today,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. Since taking office, Trump has quit the UN Human Rights Council, the World Health Organization, the UN cultural agency UNESCO, a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. The Trump administration cut funding for the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). Biden, who was vice president under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, has pledged to rescind Trump’s decision to abandon the WHO and quickly rejoin the Paris climate accord, a signature achievement of the Obama-Biden administration. Biden has also said he will rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, also negotiated under the Obama administration, if Tehran also returns to compliance. On the election of Harris, who will become the first female US vice president, Dujarric said Guterres “is always pleased when a woman leader breaks yet another ceiling.”

News article:
LONDON — Sighs of relief rippled through capitals of longtime U.S. allies around the world after Joe Biden became president-elect on Saturday. Many leaders have been battered by four years of the convention-smashing President Donald Trump and see in Biden a counterpart who will try and return America onto a path of multilateralism and international cooperation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a fraught relationship with Trump, was among the first world leaders to issue a statement congratulating Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris. "Our two countries are close friends, partners, and allies. We share a relationship that's unique on the world stage," Trudeau wrote soon after news emerged that Biden had won the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, according to NBC News projections. "I'm really looking forward to working together and building on that with you both." Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was less diplomatic. "Welcome back America!" she wrote on Twitter. "Congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their election!" Messages from foreign leadersand officials are common when a new U.S. president is elected. Less common, however, is the number this time around who have been referring to the previous administration — perhaps tacitly signposting their relief that it's over — when delivering their congratulations. There were many mentions of the challenges the new White House faced. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven congratulated Biden and mentioned the need for "multilateralism" — something the Trump administration has explicitly shunned. My warmest congratulations to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Looking forward to strengthening excellent US-Swedish relations and to work jointly for multilateralism, democracy and global security. Together, we can lead a green transition creating jobs for the future. — SwedishPM (@SwedishPM) November 7, 2020 New Zealand Prime Minster Jacinda Ardern — lauded for her response to the coronavirus pandemic and the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks that killed 51 people — celebrated Biden's victory before saying there were "so many issues facing the international community." French President Emmanuel Macron also noted the international challenges piling up on the president-elect's desk. The Americans have chosen their President. Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris! We have a lot to do to overcome today’s challenges. Let's work together! — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 7, 2020 The rush of congratulations from many Europeans made sense given Biden's long track record as a supporter of strong trans-Atlantic ties. "Biden will be more diplomatic toward allies across the board, but particularly toward Europeans," Hans Kundnani, a senior research fellow focusing on Europe and trans-Atlantic relations at the U.K.-based think tank Chatham House, said before the election. "Europeans will be extremely relieved." German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom Trump has publicly criticized, congratulated Biden after he was named president-elect Saturday. On Monday, she spoke warmly of the former vice president in a speech. "I sincerely congratulate Joe Biden to his election as the 46th President of the United States of America. Joe Biden brings the experience of decades in domestic and foreign policy with him. He knows Germany and Europe well. I fondly remember meetings and conversations with him," she said. Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, welcomed the "clear figures" that propelled Biden to victory. German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks with Vice President Joe Biden in Berlin in 2013. Steffen Kugler-Bundesregierung / Getty Images file Relations with the European Union, NATO and, in particular, Germany were strained under Trump. "I know Joe Biden as a strong supporter of our alliance," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrote. "A strong NATO is good for both North America and Europe." Minutes after NBC News and others projected Biden's victory, Ireland's prime minister, Micheál Martin, offered his congratulations via Twitter. Biden is one of the 30 million Americans who identify as Irish — his great-great grandfather emigrated from County Mayo to the U.S. in 1850. On the campaign trail Biden warned the United Kingdom not to allow Brexit to risk the safety of the Good Friday Agreement, a 1998 peace deal between rival Irish factions that put an end to the sectarian conflict known as the Troubles. I want to congratulate the new President Elect of the USA @JoeBiden Joe Biden has been a true friend of this nation throughout his life and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead. I also look forward to welcoming him back home when the circumstances allow! 🇮🇪 🇺🇸 — Micheál Martin (@MichealMartinTD) November 7, 2020 To that end, while U.K. Prime Minister 's Boris Johnson also quickly issued a congratulatory message, referring to the U.S. as Britain's "most important ally," his message was not as enthusiastic as those of some of his counterparts. Biden has spoken against Britain's exit from Europe, a cause championed by Johnson, and in December he referred to Johnson as the "physical and emotional clone" of Trump, according to The Hill. On the other side of the globe, Australia, an important U.S. ally and a partner in managing its relations with China, welcomed Biden's win. "I particularly look forward to this with President-elect Biden because he comes to this relationship with a deep experience and a deep history," Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Sunday. Elsewhere, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi focused on vice-president-elect Kamala Harris, who is of South Asian American descent. He called Harris’ success “pathbreaking” and “a matter of immense pride” for all Indian-Americans. However, not everyone may be overjoyed at the prospect of a Biden presidency. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics A sense of unease is likely coursing through parts of the Middle East, where Trump's White House has had especially close relationships with the leaders of longtime U.S. partners Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Egypt. "They are going to try to coexist with Biden and make the best of a bad situation from their point of view," said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. "They put most of their eggs in Trump's basket — he's been good to them." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu, one of Trump’s closest international allies, took until Sunday to tweet his congratulations to Biden, calling the president-elect “a great friend of Israel.” But he also thanked Trump for “the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally” as well as for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and standing up to Iran. Trump is very popular in Israel, where 71 percent of people expressed confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs in a 2019 Pew Research Center poll. However, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement Sunday he hoped to work with Biden to strengthen the Palestinian-American relations. Palestinians have been holding out for a change of U.S. president for three years after being largely ostracized by Trump. Iran's president Hassan Rouhani called on Biden to "compensate for past mistakes" and return the U.S. to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, a state-run news agency reported Sunday. The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the deal and placed crippling sanctions on the country. Meanwhile, though Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will work with any U.S. leader, Biden's win will be perceived as a net negative for Russia, Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said before the election. There has been no official comment from Russia about Biden's win. But opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who was recently poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, congratulated Biden and Americans for “defining the new leadership in a free and fair election,” something he called “a privilege which is not available to all countries.” Biden called Russia the biggest threat to U.S. national security last month — an assessment the Kremlin said encouraged hatred of Russia. "Moscow is paying close attention to this and does not like what it sees," Frolov said. China, which has been in a bitter dispute with Trump over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Beijing's handling of the pandemic and many other issues, have remained quiet on Biden’s win so far. Meanwhile Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, welcomed Biden's victory and said he looked forward to working with the new administration. Trump took the unprecedented step in May of pulling the U.S. out of the WHO — a decision Biden promised to reverse "on day one" if elected. Tedros said in a speech Monday that since Trump signaled he would pull out of the 2015 Paris Accord on climate change, "the creeping guidance of nationalism and isolationism have eroded our sense of common purpose" in scientific progress. "In that spirit, we congratulate president elect Joe Biden and VP elect Kamala Harris and we look forward to working with this administration very closely," he said.

News article:
With the 2020 elections in the rearview mirror and preparations for a Biden White House underway, the world is watching to see who the president-elect chooses for the top foreign policy post. Israel, like other countries, is anxious to find out who will be the next Secretary of State, and what record that person will have on Middle East policy. The two names most frequently mentioned by insiders as being on Biden’s short list are former national security adviser and UN ambassador Susan Rice, and former deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken. Rice has several factors working in her favor. She was one of the final choices to serve as Biden’s running mate for vice president and, after he ultimately chose Sen. Kamala Harris, it has been widely assumed that Rice would have her pick of senior posts in the new administration. Furthermore, Biden has pledged to appoint a diverse cabinet that “looks like America” and, as a woman of color, Rice checks two boxes. Her biggest disadvantage is possible opposition to her confirmation in the Senate. Republicans have long held Rice responsible for misinformation surrounding the deadly attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in September 2012. Immediately following the incident, the hostility toward her was so great that she pulled her name out of contention when then-President Barack Obama was considering her as a candidate to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. At the time, she wrote Obama a letter, stating: “If nominated, I am now convinced that the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly – to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities.” Ultimately, Obama named her national security adviser instead - a position that does not require Senate confirmation. Open gallery view Susan Rice meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem in 2014. Credit: Haim Zach / GPO Blinken, by contrast, would likely have an easier ride through the Senate. Although he, like Rice, held senior policy roles in the Obama White House, he’s much closer to the president-elect than Rice: The 58-year-old served as Biden’s chief foreign policy adviser in the Senate and was a top aide on his presidential campaign. He is considered a moderate Democrat in his world view, and Republicans could find it difficult to raise credible objections to his appointment. Bad blood? “The current Israeli government would probably have a negative reaction to the choice of Rice,” said Nadav Tamir, a former Israeli diplomat and currently senior adviser for international and diplomatic affairs at the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation. “They will take it as a sign that the Biden administration will continue Obama’s policies.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also reportedly not particularly fond of Rice. He has surely not forgotten the account by former peace negotiator Dennis Ross, where she implied that Netanyahu was a racist. In Ross’ 2015 book “Doomed to Succeed: The U.S.-Israel Relationship From Truman to Obama,” he recounted that Rice, then national security adviser, “was so furious with Netanyahu’s angry reaction to news of an acceleration in Iran nuclear talks in November 2013 that she told Abraham Foxman, the Anti-Defamation League’s then-director, that Netanyahu did everything but “use the ‘N-word’ in describing the president.” Ross wrote that Rice’s “combative mind-set” and concealment of the details regarding the U.S. negotiations with Iran “damaged our relationship with Israel far more than we needed to.” While Tamir personally believes that Rice “would be great,” he said he thinks the Netanyahu government would surely prefer Blinken, who will hew more closely to Biden’s agenda when it comes to the Middle East. “Blinken will be Biden’s person, and because of that he will be received better in Israel than Rice” – who will always be identified with Obama – Tamir said. But it’s precisely because of Blinken’s close relationship with Biden that he’s expected to be offered the job of national security adviser – a White House role that would put him by Biden’s side. Open gallery view Tony Blinken meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem in 2016. Credit: Haim Zach / GPO Blinken is Jewish, with a stepfather who’s a Holocaust survivor. His message to Jewish voters during the campaign was that Trump wasn’t good for Israel, because the damage he’s done to the international standing of the United States ultimately hurts the Jewish state as well. He played a leading role in getting the 2015 Obama nuclear deal passed by Congress, and has said throughout the Biden campaign that Trump’s decision to withdraw from the deal in 2018 placed Israel in more, not less, peril from Iran. In an interview with Jewish Insider last month, Blinken said that even if the deal is renewed in some form and nuclear-related sanctions against Iran were suspended, “we will continue non-nuclear sanctions as a strong hedge against Iranian misbehavior in other areas.” Diplomatic sphere Other names reportedly under consideration are two veteran State Department hands, who happen to share the same last name. William Burns, 64, is a former Obama administration deputy secretary of state who served for 33 years as a foreign service officer under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and is now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

He also advised Biden during the presidential campaign. Tamir believes Israeli officials would be pleased with either of these choices, since “people who worked with several administrations like Nick Burns are more likely to be bipartisan in their approach.” Furthermore, as career diplomats who were not highly invested in Democratic Party politics, they “will be more easily accepted.” Open gallery view Nicholas Burns, then-under-secretary of state for political affairs, meeting with Israel's then-Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz in Tel Aviv, January 24, 2008. Credit: ARIEL SCHALIT / AP Old diplomatic hands will also be more capable of taking charge of the rebuilding of the State Department infrastructure after it was decimated under the Trump administration. But there’s also the possibility of a candidate from the political realm. Two sitting Democratic senators, one a centrist and the other more progressive, appear to be seriously interested in the job: Sen. Chris Coons (Delaware) and Sen. Chris Murphy (Connecticut). Coons is said to be the figure most visibly lobbying for the job, according to Politico. Last May, an article appeared in Jewish Insider claiming that Coons had “the inside track” for the job. It quoted a long list of Jewish leaders and politicians singing Coons’ praises, saying he would be “wonderful” for Israel, “understands the special relationship” between the two countries and would be “an excellent choice for … the pro-Israel community.” Open gallery view Sen.

But Gold, a Netanyahu ally who has described Biden as being “fundamentally friendly to Israel,” urged the incoming administration to choose a secretary of state with hands-on experience of previous Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. An outside candidate unfamiliar with the details of why those efforts hit a brick wall, Gold said, would come in with incorrect assumptions. “It must be recalled that the last round of negotiations in 2014 ended with [Palestinian President Mahmoud] Abbas telling President Obama, ‘I’ll get back to you,’ and he never did. There are those who want to put the entire blame for the stalled peace process on Israel, even though it’s factually wrong,” Gold said. Open gallery view Sen.

His message to Jewish voters during the campaign was that Trump wasn’t good for Israel, because the damage he’s done to the international standing of the United States ultimately hurts the Jewish state as well. He played a leading role in getting the 2015 Obama nuclear deal passed by Congress, and has said throughout the Biden campaign that Trump’s decision to withdraw from the deal in 2018 placed Israel in more, not less, peril from Iran. In an interview with Jewish Insider last month, Blinken said that even if the deal is renewed in some form and nuclear-related sanctions against Iran were suspended, “we will continue non-nuclear sanctions as a strong hedge against Iranian misbehavior in other areas.” Diplomatic sphere Other names reportedly under consideration are two veteran State Department hands, who happen to share the same last name. William Burns, 64, is a former Obama administration deputy secretary of state who served for 33 years as a foreign service officer under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and is now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

He also advised Biden during the presidential campaign. Tamir believes Israeli officials would be pleased with either of these choices, since “people who worked with several administrations like Nick Burns are more likely to be bipartisan in their approach.” Furthermore, as career diplomats who were not highly invested in Democratic Party politics, they “will be more easily accepted.” Open gallery view Nicholas Burns, then-under-secretary of state for political affairs, meeting with Israel's then-Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz in Tel Aviv, January 24, 2008. Credit: ARIEL SCHALIT / AP Old diplomatic hands will also be more capable of taking charge of the rebuilding of the State Department infrastructure after it was decimated under the Trump administration. But there’s also the possibility of a candidate from the political realm. Two sitting Democratic senators, one a centrist and the other more progressive, appear to be seriously interested in the job: Sen. Chris Coons (Delaware) and Sen. Chris Murphy (Connecticut). Coons is said to be the figure most visibly lobbying for the job, according to Politico. Last May, an article appeared in Jewish Insider claiming that Coons had “the inside track” for the job. It quoted a long list of Jewish leaders and politicians singing Coons’ praises, saying he would be “wonderful” for Israel, “understands the special relationship” between the two countries and would be “an excellent choice for … the pro-Israel community.” Open gallery view Sen.

Scott Applewhite/AP Dore Gold, former director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and currently president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, declined to discuss any candidates by name. But Gold, a Netanyahu ally who has described Biden as being “fundamentally friendly to Israel,” urged the incoming administration to choose a secretary of state with hands-on experience of previous Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. An outside candidate unfamiliar with the details of why those efforts hit a brick wall, Gold said, would come in with incorrect assumptions. “It must be recalled that the last round of negotiations in 2014 ended with [Palestinian President Mahmoud] Abbas telling President Obama, ‘I’ll get back to you,’ and he never did. There are those who want to put the entire blame for the stalled peace process on Israel, even though it’s factually wrong,” Gold said. Open gallery view Sen.

Russia and China have remained silent on congratulating President-elect Joe Biden after he was projected by news outlets to win the U.S. election. While leaders across Europe and the Middle East applauded Biden’s projected victory, China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin have kept counsel. As recently as the days leading up to the election, Putin was quoted by state media as he weighed in on the Hunter Biden allegations, saying, "I don’t see anything criminal about this, at least we don’t know anything about this [being criminal]." The leaders are possibly waiting for results to be confirmed before making any official statement, but the silence is deafening. Iran’s government has issued a number of comments, from the ayatollah decrying the result as “ugly” regardless of the winner while political aides established strong stances ahead of potential new dealings with a President Biden. WORLD LEADERS CONGRATULATE JOE BIDEN, PROJECTED WINNER OF 2020 US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Other nations who found themselves close allies of President Donald Trump have offered formal statements while avoiding any outright congratulations. Turkey Vice President Fuat Oktay simply stated that a Biden victory would not change relations between the two nations, but he did warn that the president-elect should reconsider any intentions to toughen America’s stance on Turkish foreign interventions, Haaretz reported. Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made no statement, but referred to Biden as an “interventionist” over the summer, referencing comments that Biden made that he would support “opposition leadership” in Turkey. IRAN CALLS US ELECTION A 'SPECTACLE,' SAYS IT IS A CLEAR SIGN OF 'DECLINE' “Not by a coup, not by a coup, but by the electoral process," Biden was quoted as saying in an interview with the New York Times editorial board years prior, according to Reuters. As such, Biden’s relationship with Turkey shows signs of turbulence before he has even prospectively taken office. Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued only a formal congratulations to Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, referring to a “long & warm personal friendship,” but never referring to him as president-elect. Netanyahu also wrote a statement thanking Trump for his work over the past four years, particularly for the “historic peace accords” from this past year. Meanwhile, China has offered support for the incumbent president of Guinea, who faces allegations of fraud during his reelection bid, the Independent reported. “China and Guinea are good friends. … We value our tradition of friendship and stand ready to work with the Guinean side to further advance our comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership to achieve benefits to our two peoples,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a regular briefing on Monday.

News article:
In March 2010, in the midst of a visit by the vice president of the United States, Israel announced the initial approval of 1,600 new homes in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem outside the pre-1967 lines. Joe Biden (for it was he) was furious. President Barack Obama, under whom he served, had repeatedly and publicly made clear his opposition to Israeli building both in West Bank settlements and in Jerusalem neighborhoods beyond the pre-1967 Green Line. And now here was Benjamin Netanyahu (for it was he) apparently insulting the administration by timing a major construction announcement to coincide precisely with the VP’s visit. Advertisement Except that this wasn’t actually the case. The approval for Ramat Shlomo’s new homes was not issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, but rather by a lower-level planning committee overseen by the Interior Ministry. The interior minister of the day, Shas’s Eli Yishai, likely didn’t even realize that Ramat Shlomo was over the Green Line (I kid you not). Netanyahu was almost certainly unaware that the decision was about to be announced. He had no desire to pick a fight with Biden, and had only days earlier telephoned Nir Barkat to tell the then-Jerusalem mayor to drop an incendiary project to redevelop the Silwan area outside the Old City. Biden had his officials look deeper into what had happened, and they doubtless told him all this. They doubtless told him too that Ramat Shlomo was an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood founded by the late Yitzhak Rabin that was already home to 20,000 people, in a part of the city that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was well aware would never be relinquished by Israel. In the main address of his visit, at Tel Aviv University, Biden condemned the new building plans, highlighting that what was most galling was the surprise and the apparent breach of trust. But he also vouchsafed that Netanyahu had apologized both for the timing and for not letting him know in advance, and said he had been assured that the building work would not start for years, thus leaving time for the Obama administration’s efforts to broker peace talks. “I can’t tell you that peace will come easily,” said the vice president at the conclusion of that address. “You know better.” With that, the vice president made clear that the incident was closed. At least as far as he was concerned. Evidently, however, Obama was not assuaged. That weekend, at the president’s instruction, Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, telephoned Netanyahu and, in a reportedly blistering 43-minute call, asserted that Israel had insulted America, had threatened to undermine the very essence of the bilateral relationship, and needed to demonstrate afresh its good-faith commitment to that partnership. The angry fallout continued into Sunday’s US political talk shows, where White House adviser David Axelrod popped up to issue further criticisms. Flash forward a decade. Those Ramat Shlomo homes have long since been built, and now it’s Joe Biden who will have the last word on the direction of American relations with Israel — an Israel still led by his old sparring partner Netanyahu. My hope is that Biden’s handling of the Ramat Shlomo incident, including that declared awareness that peace won’t come easily, will be a guide. The last time around The US under Obama clashed heavily and relentlessly with Israel under Netanyahu in two central areas — the Palestinian conflict and Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions. On the Palestinians, the administration criticized any and all Israeli building over the Green Line, including in Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem such as Ramat Shlomo, rather than focusing on preventing the expansion of settlements in West Bank areas Israel would ultimately need to relinquish in order to separate from the Palestinians and maintain a Jewish, democratic state. More significantly still, Obama and his (second) secretary of state John Kerry insistently underestimated the devastating impact on Israel, physically and psychologically, of the Second Intifada — the strategic onslaught of suicide bombings that killed 1,000 Israelis and were launched from the major West Bank cities that Israel had relinquished under the Oslo process. Everybody recalls Netanyahu going to the US Congress in 2015 to lobby against Obama’s Iran deal; most people have forgotten Obama coming to Jerusalem’s International Conference Center (Binyanei Ha’Uma) in 2013 to lobby against Netanyahu’s ultra-skeptical approach to negotiating with the Palestinians: “Peace is possible,” the US president assured a carefully chosen audience of young Israelis. “I know it doesn’t seem that way. There will always be a reason to avoid risk, and there’s a cost for failure. There will always be extremists who provide an excuse to not act. And there is something exhausting about endless talks about talks; the daily controversies, and grinding status quo.” On Iran, meanwhile, Obama and Kerry wanted to believe that the promise of international rehabilitation, rejoining the family of nations, would help deter the Islamist regime from pursuing the bomb. They thus negotiated and approved an agreement, many of whose core provisions apply for a limited period only, that neither fully dismantled nor even completely froze the Iranian program. The ayatollahs were allowed to improve their uranium enrichment process and refine their missile delivery systems within the terms of the 2015 deal, which they were also handsomely financially rewarded for signing. Rapacious ideologically and territorially, the Islamists in Tehran are playing the long game. They don’t want to rejoin the family of nations. They want to sit at the head of the table, set the agenda, and bend the rest of the world to their will. This harsh truth seemed lost on the Obama presidency. While he settles in If you’ve read my recent articles, you’ll know how I feel about US President Donald Trump’s behavior surrounding last week’s presidential elections. But that does not change the fact that 70% of Israeli Jews said shortly before the vote that they considered Trump the “preferable” candidate, as far as Israel’s interests are concerned, for clear, solid, sensibly self-interested reasons. Those reasons notably include his administration’s handling of the Palestinian and the Iranian issues. On the first, while ultimately blocking Netanyahu’s unilateral West Bank annexation plans, Trump’s White House made plain to the Palestinians that they would need to compromise on their maximalist demands, stop playing the victim game and end their demonization of Israel. And on the second, it ratcheted up the financial pressure on Tehran and urged a new deal that would, this time, genuinely require the regime to abandon its nuclear goals. As a consequence of those broad strategies, the Palestinians are being marginalized by former steadfast supporters in the Arab world, who are instead normalizing relations and joining forces with Israel in the effort to face down Iran. And the ayatollahs are feeling the financial heat. Now along comes Biden. The incoming US president will have a vast burden of domestic priorities with which to grapple. But there is already much talk of him rejoining the 2015 Iran deal, which was negotiated under his vice-presidential watch and from which Trump withdrew. And West Bank Palestinian leaders, who severed all relations with the Trump administration for its temerity in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s historic and modern capital, and preemptively rejected his peace plan, are delightedly contemplating the return of a US administration they believe will be more empathetic to their ambitions, more inclined to indulge their ongoing demonization of Israel, more willing to give them financial aid even as it is siphoned off to make payments to the families of terrorists, and more forgiving of their obduracy. At home, Biden will be inheriting a bitterly divided America, succeeding a president who, at this point, seems determined to resist the will of the people. Abroad, where Israel and this region are concerned, however, the Trump administration bequeaths him a far more realistic approach than it inherited. I don’t expect Biden — the most experienced incoming president since George H.W. Bush in 1989, and no neophyte when it comes to this region — to be guided by that “you know better” remark at the end of his Tel Aviv speech a decade ago. I also don’t think the status quo is beneficial on the Palestinian front (as Israel entangles itself more deeply with millions of hostile Palestinians) or on the Iranian front (as the ayatollahs continue their pursuit of the bomb). But, at least while he settles in, he might want to consider a Middle Eastern diplomatic application of the Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm. — ** An earlier version of this Editor’s Note was sent out Wednesday in ToI’s weekly update email to members of the Times of Israel Community.

News article:
In March 2010, in the midst of a visit by the vice president of the United States, Israel announced the initial approval of 1,600 new homes in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem outside the pre-1967 lines. Joe Biden (for it was he) was furious. President Barack Obama, under whom he served, had repeatedly and publicly made clear his opposition to Israeli building both in West Bank settlements and in Jerusalem neighborhoods beyond the pre-1967 Green Line. And now here was Benjamin Netanyahu (for it was he) apparently insulting the administration by timing a major construction announcement to coincide precisely with the VP’s visit. Advertisement Except that this wasn’t actually the case. The approval for Ramat Shlomo’s new homes was not issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, but rather by a lower-level planning committee overseen by the Interior Ministry. The interior minister of the day, Shas’s Eli Yishai, likely didn’t even realize that Ramat Shlomo was over the Green Line (I kid you not). Netanyahu was almost certainly unaware that the decision was about to be announced. He had no desire to pick a fight with Biden, and had only days earlier telephoned Nir Barkat to tell the then-Jerusalem mayor to drop an incendiary project to redevelop the Silwan area outside the Old City. Biden had his officials look deeper into what had happened, and they doubtless told him all this. They doubtless told him too that Ramat Shlomo was an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood founded by the late Yitzhak Rabin that was already home to 20,000 people, in a part of the city that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was well aware would never be relinquished by Israel. In the main address of his visit, at Tel Aviv University, Biden condemned the new building plans, highlighting that what was most galling was the surprise and the apparent breach of trust. But he also vouchsafed that Netanyahu had apologized both for the timing and for not letting him know in advance, and said he had been assured that the building work would not start for years, thus leaving time for the Obama administration’s efforts to broker peace talks. “I can’t tell you that peace will come easily,” said the vice president at the conclusion of that address. “You know better.” With that, the vice president made clear that the incident was closed. At least as far as he was concerned. Evidently, however, Obama was not assuaged. That weekend, at the president’s instruction, Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, telephoned Netanyahu and, in a reportedly blistering 43-minute call, asserted that Israel had insulted America, had threatened to undermine the very essence of the bilateral relationship, and needed to demonstrate afresh its good-faith commitment to that partnership. The angry fallout continued into Sunday’s US political talk shows, where White House adviser David Axelrod popped up to issue further criticisms. Flash forward a decade. Those Ramat Shlomo homes have long since been built, and now it’s Joe Biden who will have the last word on the direction of American relations with Israel — an Israel still led by his old sparring partner Netanyahu. My hope is that Biden’s handling of the Ramat Shlomo incident, including that declared awareness that peace won’t come easily, will be a guide. The last time around The US under Obama clashed heavily and relentlessly with Israel under Netanyahu in two central areas — the Palestinian conflict and Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions. On the Palestinians, the administration criticized any and all Israeli building over the Green Line, including in Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem such as Ramat Shlomo, rather than focusing on preventing the expansion of settlements in West Bank areas Israel would ultimately need to relinquish in order to separate from the Palestinians and maintain a Jewish, democratic state. More significantly still, Obama and his (second) secretary of state John Kerry insistently underestimated the devastating impact on Israel, physically and psychologically, of the Second Intifada — the strategic onslaught of suicide bombings that killed 1,000 Israelis and were launched from the major West Bank cities that Israel had relinquished under the Oslo process. Everybody recalls Netanyahu going to the US Congress in 2015 to lobby against Obama’s Iran deal; most people have forgotten Obama coming to Jerusalem’s International Conference Center (Binyanei Ha’Uma) in 2013 to lobby against Netanyahu’s ultra-skeptical approach to negotiating with the Palestinians: “Peace is possible,” the US president assured a carefully chosen audience of young Israelis. “I know it doesn’t seem that way. There will always be a reason to avoid risk, and there’s a cost for failure. There will always be extremists who provide an excuse to not act. And there is something exhausting about endless talks about talks; the daily controversies, and grinding status quo.” On Iran, meanwhile, Obama and Kerry wanted to believe that the promise of international rehabilitation, rejoining the family of nations, would help deter the Islamist regime from pursuing the bomb. They thus negotiated and approved an agreement, many of whose core provisions apply for a limited period only, that neither fully dismantled nor even completely froze the Iranian program. The ayatollahs were allowed to improve their uranium enrichment process and refine their missile delivery systems within the terms of the 2015 deal, which they were also handsomely financially rewarded for signing. Rapacious ideologically and territorially, the Islamists in Tehran are playing the long game. They don’t want to rejoin the family of nations. They want to sit at the head of the table, set the agenda, and bend the rest of the world to their will. This harsh truth seemed lost on the Obama presidency. While he settles in If you’ve read my recent articles, you’ll know how I feel about US President Donald Trump’s behavior surrounding last week’s presidential elections. But that does not change the fact that 70% of Israeli Jews said shortly before the vote that they considered Trump the “preferable” candidate, as far as Israel’s interests are concerned, for clear, solid, sensibly self-interested reasons. Those reasons notably include his administration’s handling of the Palestinian and the Iranian issues. On the first, while ultimately blocking Netanyahu’s unilateral West Bank annexation plans, Trump’s White House made plain to the Palestinians that they would need to compromise on their maximalist demands, stop playing the victim game and end their demonization of Israel. And on the second, it ratcheted up the financial pressure on Tehran and urged a new deal that would, this time, genuinely require the regime to abandon its nuclear goals. As a consequence of those broad strategies, the Palestinians are being marginalized by former steadfast supporters in the Arab world, who are instead normalizing relations and joining forces with Israel in the effort to face down Iran. And the ayatollahs are feeling the financial heat. Now along comes Biden. The incoming US president will have a vast burden of domestic priorities with which to grapple. But there is already much talk of him rejoining the 2015 Iran deal, which was negotiated under his vice-presidential watch and from which Trump withdrew. And West Bank Palestinian leaders, who severed all relations with the Trump administration for its temerity in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s historic and modern capital, and preemptively rejected his peace plan, are delightedly contemplating the return of a US administration they believe will be more empathetic to their ambitions, more inclined to indulge their ongoing demonization of Israel, more willing to give them financial aid even as it is siphoned off to make payments to the families of terrorists, and more forgiving of their obduracy.

News article:
Democratic candidate Joe Biden will be the 46th president of the United States, marking a new era for the U.S. and for Israel. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter On January 20, 2021, the term of Donald Trump comes to an end, bringing with it an end to the days in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could travel the world with a puffed up chest thanks to the absolute backing of the American president. 6 View gallery Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump clasp hands during the White House announcement on its Mideast peace plan, January 2020 ( Photo: EPA ) And while the days of unlimited U.S. support are seemingly over, Biden's time in the White House will not necessarily mean the incessant conflict between Washington and Jerusalem that was on display during the Obama era. Biden has no interest in confronting Israel. The long-standing personal friendship between Biden and Netanyahu will allow the prime minister (if he acts carefully and responsibly) to engage in dignified dialogue with the White House of Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Biden’s term will not be a walk in the park for Israel. There is still a lot of anger towards Netanyahu both in the Democratic Party and Biden's inner circle over to his hostility to Obama and his friendship with Trump. 6 View gallery Then-Vice President Joe Biden walks through Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem during a 2016 visit to Israel ( Photo: Getty Images ) The main concern is that the friction could escalate due to clashes with the people Biden appoints to deal with Israel, the Mideast peace process and Iran. Some of these people will no doubt be members of the Obama administration and they will not easily forget Netanyahu’s 2015 speech to Congress , in which he slammed the agreement with Iran laboriously brokered by the White House. The issues of Others in Biden's administration will no doubt remember the incident in March 2010, when then-interior minister Eli Yishai (Shas) announced the construction of 1,600 settlement housing units as Biden landed in Israel. The move was perceived as Netanyahu knifing Biden in the back and as an attempt to sabotage the vice president's visit. Biden also played a part in advancing Security Council Resolution 2334 on the illegality of Israel's West Bank settlements in the West Bank, which was adopted by the UN on January 20, 2017 - the day Trump entered the White House. 6 View gallery Benjamin Netanyahu slams the Iran nuclear deal in a 2015 speech to the U.S. Congress ( Photo: AFP ) It was none other than Joe Biden who personally persuaded several leaders including the president of Ukraine to support the proposal, which triggered a crisis between Jerusalem and Kiev. Biden was also the one who persuaded New Zealand to submit the resolution to the UN Security Council, after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi withdrew his support due to signals from Israel that he should not go against Trump. Biden, along with Susan Rice, Obama's then-national security adviser, were responsible for a decision seen as the Obama administration’s swan song. A source familiar with Israel-U.S. relations says that Biden's term as president could see repeated criticism of Israel’s actions akin to that of the Obama era. And while the approach may be more subtle, the Biden administration will not support construction of Israeli settlements or other steps it perceives as harmful to the two-state solution. One of the steps Israel will take with Biden's inauguration is to replace its current ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer, a former Republican operative who is persona non grata among Democrats. His replacement will be Israel's recently installed ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan, who will continue to hold both positions and work extremely hard to mend Israel’s relationship with the Democrats. 6 View gallery Israel's new ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan ( Photo: Ynet ) Despite the concerns, one thing is undisputed: Biden is a great friend of Israel and believes in the American commitment to Israel's security and to maintaining its qualitative military edge. The Israeli-Palestinian issue is close to Biden’s heart, and while he wishes to resolve the crisis, he is not expected to be in a hurry to try to bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table, mainly due to the political, economic and coronavirus chaos in Israel and the fact that Mahmoud Abbas’ term as Palestinian president is nearing its end. The assessment in the Biden campaign is that the president-elect will order the re-establishment of the American consulate in East Jerusalem that was responsible for relations with the Palestinians. Biden also intends to renew American financial aid to the Palestinians that was halted by Trump, while also reopening the Palestinian embassy in Washington. All of this is aimed restoring Palestinian confidence in the U.S. And while Biden does not intend to return the American embassy from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, it is still unclear if the ambassador’s residence will remain in the capital. 6 View gallery Then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2016 ( Photo: Archive ) Biden is a vocal advocate of the two-state solution and will try to take steps to encourage its fruition the solution come to fruition and act to condemn unilateral steps. Biden is expected to call on Israel to refrain from expanding the settlements and not talk about annexation anymore - while asking the Palestinians to refrain from taking such negative measures such as the delegitimization of Israel, and the payment of wages to terrorists. Biden will also most definitely wash his hands from Trump’s peace plan which made the Palestinians irrelevant, and may start a new Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. Another burning issue is Iran. Biden has previously stated that if Tehran returns to full compliance with the nuclear deal, the U.S. will rejoin the agreement and lift sanctions. Only then will his government negotiate with Tehran. Israel believes Biden will aim to be tougher than Obama on the Iranians and try to make improvements to the nuclear agreement. Even so, Jerusalem fears that the Iranians will not accept any changes to the agreement and will only benefit from the reversal of sanctions. 6 View gallery U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan ( Photo: Reuters ) Israel also believes that Biden will work to extend the Iran nuclear agreement - which is set to expire within the next few years - by a few decades. It is doubtful the Iranians will agree to this either. Regarding Turkey, Israel assesses that Biden will also be far tougher on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan than Trump, who more or less embraced him.

Palestine is hopeful that US President-elect Joe Biden will revive the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Anadolu news agency reported Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki saying yesterday. Speaking at a joint news conference with his German counterpart Heiko Maas in Berlin, Al-Maliki said Palestinians suffered tremendously during the Trump administration, which sided with Israel. "Now with the new administration in Washington, we see a change, we see a hope, and we want not to be victims of the past," he said, adding that they were ready to openly and positively engage with the Biden administration. "The new administration believes in the two-state solution [….] the new administration believes that the Deal of the Century should be off the table," he said. READ: Netanyahu has 'warm' talk with Biden, 10 days after Democrat declares victory "They talk about reversing most – if not all these actions. And this is really for us an indication that the new administration is different. And that's why we're ready to engage," he added. Relations between the US and the Palestinians have suffered greatly during the Trump era, as he recognised Jerusalem as the Israeli capital in 2017 and relocated the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to the occupied city in May 2018. Trump's controversial so-called 'deal of the century', which he revealed in January 2020, was widely criticised for favoring Israel and effectively killing the possibility of a two-state solution.

News article:
It’s risky to predict how any new president might interact with Israel. Will President-elect Joe Biden follow in the footsteps of Barak Obama, his revered leader under whom Biden served as vice president? That is a question of consequence for Israel since Obama easily qualifies as the least friendly president to Israel since its Proclamation of Independence on May 14, 1948. That evening, just 11 minutes after David Ben-Gurion, Israeli founding father and its first prime minister, declared independence, U.S. President Harry S. Truman recognized the first Jewish state in more than two millennia. That set the presidential standard for an official American embrace of Israel. Liberal Jews may cringe at the reality that the president who has followed most closely in Truman’s footsteps is Donald Trump. Under his administration, Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights was recognized and the U.S. embassy was relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, implicitly reaffirming the ancient Jewish holy city as Israel’s capital. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his forthcoming trip to Israel, may visit the settlement of Psagot, near Ramallah. If he does, he will be the first top American official to have set foot in an Israeli settlement. in fact, it would not be surprising if Trump, in a farewell gift, recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the settlements, home to 430,000 Israelis living in their biblical homeland. But what about Biden and Israel? Will he embrace or reject the palpable hostility of Obama, his political idol? Clearly, Israelis are not optimistic. Anticipating the recent election, they favored Trump over Biden by a 2:1 majority. History is on their side. Biden has frequently retold the story of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir in 1973. Showing him maps of the region, she described Israel’s precarious position. Noting his discomfort, she reassured him that Israelis had a secret weapon against hostile Arab states: They had nowhere else to go. Nearly a decade later, Prime Minister Menachem Begin met with senators at the U.S. Capitol. Biden advised him that the expansion of settlements would endanger American support for aid to Israel. Begin sharply responded: “Don’t threaten us with slashing aid. Do you think that because the U.S. lends us money it is entitled to impose on us what we must do,” adding: “I am a proud Jew. Three thousand years of culture are behind me, and you will not frighten me with threats.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Biden backed off, over time showing signs of warming towards Israel. At the 2013 AIPAC Policy Conference, he dated his affection towards Israel from when he first heard the phrase “Never Again.” It taught him that “the only way to ensure that it could never happen again was the establishment and the existence of a secure, Jewish state of Israel.” But Biden continued to waffle, especially as Obama’s loyal vice president. At an Israeli Independence Day celebration in 2015, he promised that “if you were attacked and overwhelmed, we would fight for you.” But Obama’s support for a settlement freeze and a two-state solution based on pre-1967 lines, with a state of Palestine occupying biblical Judea and Samaria, commanded Biden’s approval. In the waning days of the Obama administration, Biden promoted U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 declaring that settlements in “occupied Palestinian territory” are illegal. In a 2016 speech to left-wing J Street, he condemned “the steady and systematic expansion of settlements, the legalization of outposts, land seizures that are moving us toward a one-state reality, and that reality is dangerous.” Biden declared: “We have an overwhelming obligation … to push [Israelis] as hard as we can toward what they know in their gut is the only ultimate solution—a two-state solution.” He ignored decades of unrelenting Palestinian obduracy to that solution. Although Joe Biden has often touted himself as a “friend” of Israel, it has been, at best, an ambivalent friendship. He has promised to reverse the Trump administration’s “destructive cut-off of diplomatic ties with the Palestinian Authority,” while promising to reaffirm the demand of the Obama/Biden administration that Israel prohibit Jews from asserting their right to build homes in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). Biden has also promised to reopen the PLO office in Washington closed by Trump and reinstate funding to the Palestinian Authority that Trump ended because it would not halt payments to terrorists. In his waning days in office, Trump may yet have a farewell gift for Israel: recognition of its sovereignty over Jewish settlements. If delivered, it will be revealing to see whether President Biden resolves his ambivalent relationship with Israel. Will he embrace Barack Obama’s hostility or Donald Trump’s generosity?

News article:
It’s risky to predict how any new president might interact with Israel. Will President-elect Joe Biden follow in the footsteps of Barak Obama, his revered leader under whom Biden served as vice president? That is a question of consequence for Israel since Obama easily qualifies as the least friendly president to Israel since its Proclamation of Independence on May 14, 1948. That evening, just 11 minutes after David Ben-Gurion, Israeli founding father and its first prime minister, declared independence, U.S. President Harry S. Truman recognized the first Jewish state in more than two millennia. That set the presidential standard for an official American embrace of Israel. Liberal Jews may cringe at the reality that the president who has followed most closely in Truman’s footsteps is Donald Trump. Under his administration, Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights was recognized and the U.S. embassy was relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, implicitly reaffirming the ancient Jewish holy city as Israel’s capital. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his forthcoming trip to Israel, may visit the settlement of Psagot, near Ramallah. If he does, he will be the first top American official to have set foot in an Israeli settlement. in fact, it would not be surprising if Trump, in a farewell gift, recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the settlements, home to 430,000 Israelis living in their biblical homeland. But what about Biden and Israel? Will he embrace or reject the palpable hostility of Obama, his political idol? Clearly, Israelis are not optimistic. Anticipating the recent election, they favored Trump over Biden by a 2:1 majority. History is on their side. Biden has frequently retold the story of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir in 1973. Showing him maps of the region, she described Israel’s precarious position. Noting his discomfort, she reassured him that Israelis had a secret weapon against hostile Arab states: They had nowhere else to go. Nearly a decade later, Prime Minister Menachem Begin met with senators at the U.S. Capitol. Biden advised him that the expansion of settlements would endanger American support for aid to Israel. Begin sharply responded: “Don’t threaten us with slashing aid. Do you think that because the U.S. lends us money it is entitled to impose on us what we must do,” adding: “I am a proud Jew. Three thousand years of culture are behind me, and you will not frighten me with threats.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Biden backed off, over time showing signs of warming towards Israel.

News article:
By Ron Kampeas November 18, 2020 (JTA) — President-elect Joe Biden assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone call Tuesday that the ties between their countries would remain strong. “The president-elect noted that he expects to work closely with the prime minister to address the many challenges confronting our countries,” Biden’s transition team said in a statement following the call. “The president-elect expressed his determination to ensure that the U.S.-Israel relationship is strengthened and enjoys strong bipartisan support.” Netanyahu’s office put out a similarly worded statement on Twitter. “Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke this evening with US President-elect @JoeBiden,” the tweet said. “In a warm conversation, the President-elect reiterated his deep commitment to the State of Israel and its security.” Biden’s conversation with Netanyahu and a separate one the same day with President Reuven Rivlin consolidated international recognition that Biden is the next U.S. president, contrary to President Donald Trump’s continued insistence that he won the Nov. 3 election despite all evidence to the contrary. Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest allies, had previously congratulated Biden, but the tweet Tuesday was the first time he referred to Biden as “president-elect” — a title for the former vice president that Trump adamantly rejects. All but a handful of foreign leaders have already called Biden the president-elect. The statements also were significant because Biden appeared to be going out of his way following the election to reassure Netanyahu that the relationship would remain close. Some Democrats, including a number of Biden’s rivals during the primaries, have called for distancing from Netanyahu’s government as it drifts to the right, at one point considering annexation of parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu particularly would want reassurance that Biden would continue Trump’s policy of confronting Iran — one of the “challenges” Biden alluded to in his statement. In both statements describing the calls with Netanyahu and Rivlin, Biden also emphasized his support for “Israel’s security and its future as a Jewish and democratic state,” a reference to Biden’s oft-stated support for a two-state outcome and his opposition to any further Israeli encroachment on areas claimed by Palestinians.

News article:
President-elect Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday, making him the latest world leader to acknowledge, after a slight delay, Biden's win in the 2020 presidential race. President Donald Trump, who's been politically aligned with Netanyahu during his four years in office, continues to refuse to concede to the Democratic ex-vice president. The leaders of Russia, Brazil and Mexico have yet to offer congratulations to Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Tuesday he had spoken with Joe Biden. Netanyahu, who's been politically aligned with President Donald Trump, congratulated Biden 12 hours after the race was called and hasn't referred to him as president-elect President-elect Joe Biden has been taking calls with world leaders since the presidential race was called in his favor. President Donald Trump, however, refuses to concede. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday Netanyahu's office confirmed the call, according to Reuters, saying the two leaders had a 'warm conversation.' 'The two agreed to meet soon to discuss the many issues that are pending and reaffirmed the need to continue to strengthen the strong alliance between the United States and Israel,' the statement said. Biden also spoke with Israel's President Reuven Rivlin, the Biden-Harris transition team said. 'The president-elect thanked the prime minister for his congratulations and reiterated his steadfast support for Israel’s security and its future as a Jewish and democratic state,' a readout from Biden's team said later Tuesday. Biden also said he was determined that the U.S.-Israel relationship 'enjoys strong bi-partisan support.' The chat comes one day after Netanyahu, in a slip, called Biden the president. 'I have been told that in the near future I will talk with the president ...,' the prime minister said during a Hebrew press conference, according to the Times of Israel. 'Errr, with Joe Biden, who is supposed to be appointed the next president.' Netanyahu wouldn't give his thoughts on Trump's unfounded claims that the election was 'rigged,' thanks to widespread voter fraud. As of Monday, Trump was continuing to tweet that he had 'won' the election - despite a large deficit in both popular and Electoral College votes. 'We have enough politics over here,' Netanyahu said when asked about Trump's claims. Netanyahu waited 12 hours after the race was called for Biden to put out a congratulatory tweet. 'Congratulations Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,' he wrote. 'Joe, we’ve had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the U.S. and Israel.' Until his slip-up Monday, Netanyahu hasn't referred to Biden was the 'president-elect,' in a move that's likely because he fears upsetting Trump, who has backed pro-Israel policies like moving the U.S. embassy Jerusalem, which thrilled Israelis while infuriating Palestinians. Trump remains in office until January 20, 2021. Netanyahu follows the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Italy in touching base with Biden, whose transition has been hobbled by the Trump administration, which is refusing to allow him to tap into federal funds. The Biden transition team said that beyond talking to the two Israeli leaders Tuesday, the president-elect also spoke with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi, like Netanyahu, had a very friendly relationship with Trump. Trump traveled to India in late February, his last foreign trip before the coronavirus crisis took hold. Modi was in the U.S. in February 2019 for a 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston, Texas. Biden also spoke with President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and President Sebastián Piñera of Chile, the transition team said Tuesday. Biden, who will be the U.S.'s second Catholic president, also spoke with Pope Francis last week.

News article:
By Abe Silberstein November 19, 2020 On Thursday, the US State Department announced that it will allow products made in Area C of the West Bank — the section of the territory which is entirely governed by Israel under the interim Oslo Accords — to be labeled “Made in Israel” upon entry to the United States. The State Department said the decision stemmed from a “reality-based foreign policy approach,” and came on the same day Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke decades of diplomatic protocol by visiting a West Bank settlement. It’s hard to be shocked by the Trump administration’s willingness to smash decades-old American and international norms, especially when it comes to Israel and its settlements in the occupied West Bank. Indeed, few people were actually surprised by the announcement. But it nonetheless represents another layer of policy distortion which must be undone by the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden. However, unlike reversing other Trump administration policies, doing so here will likely involve a painful confrontation with an ally and its domestic supporters, including quite a few in the Democratic Party. The extent to which Biden withdraws some of the gifts granted to Israel during the Trump years, bestowed at the expense of American credibility, will test how serious he is about restoring America’s leadership role in the world. The inescapable truth is that President-elect Biden will not be able to reestablish trust in U.S. intentions and leadership if he keeps the policies of his norm-smashing predecessor. These include norms that were smashed to benefit Israel. The Trump administration’s friendly view of Israel’s activities in the occupied territories, from outright recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights, to setting aside the State Department’s traditional view of settlements as not legal under international law, to the Trump Plan’s support for annexation, to the announcement on Thursday, is not consistent with the American position on similar matters around the world, and is opposed by the rest of the international community. It is difficult to imagine the State Department regarding products originating in Crimea as being made in Russia, even though Russian control of the territory is the “reality” of the situation today. I do not doubt that Biden understands the U.S. can’t promote the principles of the post-Second World War order in one part of the world while legitimizing “might makes right” in another. But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is set to play a much smaller part of this administration’s foreign policy, which will be dominated by dealing with the pandemic and meeting the challenge a rising and revisionist China poses to the free world. There will be sensible-sounding arguments for not creating “daylight” between the U.S. and Israel with so much else on the agenda. Faced with the inevitable prospect of denunciations from pro-Israel groups and some senior members of his own party, a rational actor may conclude that its best to put these issues aside. This would be a mistake, a shortsighted political judgment that will undermine America’s standing to marshal partners to defend a rules-based international system under a cynical and sustained assault by Moscow and Beijing. In demonstrating to the world the value of America’s global role, Washington can do nothing worse than establish a naked double standard for its allies. This does not mean the U.S.-Israel relationship itself undermines America’s image; it absolutely does not. But Israel’s settlement project does run counter to the values we wish to project, and serves no discernible American national security interest that would justify the Trump administration’s unprecedented actions. President-elect Biden has several tough decisions to make here and should approach the situation with care. He is right not to reverse the decision on moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, as doing so would instigate an unnecessary confrontation. After all, the December 2017 announcement did not preclude a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. But on matters in which the U.S. legitimized activity in occupied territory that is widely viewed as illegal, a Biden administration must be willing to disappoint Israel. The West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights are occupied territory. The U.S. will not pressure Israel to withdraw from any of them, especially the Golan. But it can’t simply rewrite the rules for Israel. If Israel appreciates the role a strong, respected, and credible America could play in the world, it won’t make a particularly big deal over returning to the pre-Trump status quo in some areas. Unfortunately, domestic politics in both the U.S. and Israel may find a way to throw pragmatism and good strategic judgment to the wind.

News article:
JNS.org – In the winter of 2015, one of Israel’s most senior security cabinet officials asked me what advice he should give to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in regard to Speaker of the House John Boehner’s invitation to speak before the US Congress, laying out his case for why the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was a “bad deal” for both Israel and the United States. My answer surprised him. I told him not to accept the invitation, but to wait a few months until the Israeli election was concluded. I learned later that Netanyahu’s former ambassador Michael Oren also told him to decline the invitation. This is in contrast to Israel’s ambassador at the time, Ron Dermer, who incensed the Obama administration as the one who “orchestrated the invitation” and wrote much of the speech. Why is this history relevant for Netanyahu in 2020? There is an analogy to today. He is likely to create conditions in 2021 for a new election to avoid handing over power as promised to Israeli Alternate Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benny Gantz. The Biden administration would likely be negotiating with Iran, once again at a time when Netanyahu’s hold on the leadership of Israel is in doubt, as it was in 2014. This should be kept in mind by the Israeli prime minister before he has his first meeting with the Biden people, and strategizes how he should approach the new administration. The 2014 visit to Congress was ill-timed. If Netanyahu had won the election and formed a coalition, he could then have come later in the spring with a stronger mandate as the newly reelected leader of Israel with a better chance not to throw kerosene into the fire of American politics. Any newly elected Israeli leader would naturally have asked to come to speak to US leadership. If an audience with the president were denied, it would have been seen by much of the American public as petty politics on the part of the Obama administration. According to an NBC poll at the time, 68% of Americans “believed Iran was not going to abide by the nuclear agreement.” I was and still am a strong critic of the JCPOA, believing that it undermines American and Israeli security interests, being both dangerous and unprecedented in giving a nation on our terror list the right to enrich uranium. Yet knowing all of that, I still told my Israeli friend to try and dissuade Netanyahu from coming to Congress, even though I knew that Obama and his team had completely misled the Israelis, keeping them in the dark about the secret negotiations despite assurances that they would be kept in the loop, knowing the JCPOA was an existential issue for Israel’s survival. Although some blame the frosty relationship between Obama and Netanyahu for his administration’s actions, most think that US Vice President Joe Biden’s relationship with the Israeli prime minister was always warmer. However, we don’t really know whether Biden will prove more sympathetic to Israeli interests than Obama was. We do know that he fully supported the JCPOA and was aware of the behind-the-scenes maneuvers to keep the Israelis in the dark. The Obama administration policy from 2009 on was to create “daylight” between Israel and the United States, and to move closer to the Iranians. Keep in mind it was Biden who told the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America, “Bibi, I don’t agree with a damn thing that you say, but I love ya.” That was 2014 — the same year that the administration was secretly negotiating with Iran. So with act two of the JCPOA about to preview, it would behoove Israel and its supporters to review all of the history, mistakes, and consequences related to the nuclear agreement. In 2014, I spoke with the foreign-policy advisers of the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressing my concern that they were being outmaneuvered by the Obama administration, which was cleverly creating a backdoor pathway for Senate approval of the agreement with only a minority of the Senate in favor of the deal. I emphasized that the JCPOA rose to the level of a treaty and should be submitted to the Senate as such, which would require 60 senators to vote in favor of its passage, as it was the most significant American foreign-policy commitment of the 21st century. In the end, the Obama administration outmaneuvered the Republican leadership and was able to advance the agreement with something akin to an executive order, with only 42 senators in favor. The next year I was told by that same Senate office that when Europeans came to visit Washington, they were astonished that the JCPOA was not passed as a treaty. If President-elect Biden re-enters the JCPOA or renegotiates a new agreement, will the 2021 Republican Senate try to weigh in? Will Netanyahu try a new approach, having learned the lessons of interfering in American politics? Biden promises to reenter the deal in his first few months, so time will be of the essence. The Obama administration took its revenge for the Netanyahu speech before Congress, when a year-and-a-half later, in December 2016, the United States orchestrated the passage of UNSC Resolution 2334, labeling any Israeli presence over the 1949 armistice line (1967 line or Green Line) an international crime and upending UNSC Resolution 242, the keystone document that previously acknowledged that Israel was never supposed to return to the indefensible borders of 1967. So how should Netanyahu approach dealing with Biden, knowing he wants to restart the JCPOA in a few months’ time and wants to fulfill his campaign promise to reopen the PLO mission in Washington, the US consulate in eastern Jerusalem for Palestinian use, and restore some funding to the Palestinians, even if they have to ignore the Taylor Force Law denying American funding to a Palestinian Authority that rewards and incentivizes terrorism? The two leaders know each other very well. They also have clashed with each other for years over settlement building, most recently when mid-level Israeli officials announced settlement building during a Biden visit to Israel, embarrassing the vice president, who choose to publicly lash out at Netanyahu despite the prime minister’s apology. Unlike the administration of US President Donald Trump, which not only saw eye to eye with him on almost every issue — with tangible actions ranging from the US embassy move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to acknowledging that Israeli settlements do not break international law — Biden and his advisers want to promote a more balanced narrative and promote the aggrieved party of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They could, if challenged by the Israeli government, even choose to join the international community in boycotting Israeli goods from the West Bank (Judea and Samaria). Netanyahu needs to prioritize his goals before engaging with the new administration. There is no doubt that the nuclear deal is the number one issue on Israel’s plate, and there are rumors that the new administration, unlike the Obama one, will actually listen to Israeli suggestions for a new nuclear deal. The Israeli prime minister’s highest priority is to emphasize to Biden that he shouldn’t rush to rejoin the flawed deal without significant changes to the agreement, as many of its provisions will sunset in less than five years. He must convince Biden that the United States has new leverage with the Trump sanctions in place, which have caused the Iranian economy to be under tremendous strain. The revolutionary regime’s first goal is to stay in power, and it worries about a rebellion from within. This is a great American advantage for negotiations if it is appreciated, as it could force the ayatollah and his minions back to the table. “Patience, patience, patience with Iran” should be the bywords for the Biden administration, along with the willingness to leave negotiations if the regime’s leaders don’t meet the minimum threshold to truly end the Iranian nuclear program forever. Netanyahu’s second goal is to continue the normalization process with the Arab world. Getting the Biden administration to prioritize this early on when there is still a window of opportunity for new nations to join will require him to give Biden something back in return. That inevitably will be something in regard to the Palestinians and Israeli settlement-building. With the Israeli prime minister looking to renege on his deal to hand over power to rival Benny Gantz next year — and another potential contender, Naftali Bennett, gaining popularity from the right — he will be seriously challenged to advance Israel’s long-term goals while advancing his own political interests. For his legacy, I would urge him to think of the long-term survival of the US-Israel relationship in light of the challenges Biden will face from his own party regarding the Palestinians, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, and prioritize the nuclear deal and normalization, offering some carrots to the Palestinians. The PA is dysfunctional, and the Palestinian people don’t trust their leadership, now in the 15th year of their four-year term, so even optimists in the Biden administration know that there is a limit to what can be achieved. You don’t get something for nothing, and if Netanyahu can get 80% of Israel’s agenda in line with a President Biden, that is a huge win for America and Israel. Dr. Eric R.

News article:
President-elect Joe Biden is busy hiring staffers for his transition team and his administration, including some individuals with ties to the country’s largest technology companies. Biden named Louisa Terrell the White House director of legislative affairs Friday. Terrell is a former member of the Obama administration, though she also served in a senior position at Facebook. Biden last week announced members of the agency review teams, which include a number of individuals who worked for big technology companies ranging from Uber to Amazon. Former Apple lobbyist Cynthia Hogan is working full-time for the administration, as is Jessica Hertz, who worked for Facebook. BIDEN TRANSITION TEAM LEANS ON LEFT-WING GROUPS FOR STAFF: REPORT Lawmakers, especially the more progressive members of the Democratic Party, have criticized the country’s largest technology companies throughout recent years, over concerns ranging from anticompetitive behaviors to censorship. Progressives including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have advocated breaking up companies like Google and Amazon over their alleged monopolistic practices, said to limit the ability of others in their respective industries to compete. Big tech concerns, however, are shared by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Biden’s position on big tech is less well-known. He has said he would repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which protects companies like YouTube and Twitter from liability for most content posted on their sites by third-party users even though the companies themselves generally oversee that content. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., reportedly said she is concerned about the influence big tech – specifically Uber – may have on the administration, following the defeat of Proposition 22 in California. Prop 22 would have required companies in the gig economy to reclassify independent contractors as employees with benefits. As previously reported by Fox News, the Biden-Harris team also is leaning on left-wing philanthropic groups for staffers as it prepares to take over the Oval Office.

News article:
(JTA) — Tony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for secretary of state, is the stepson of a Holocaust survivor whose stories shaped his worldview and subsequently his policy decisions, including in the Middle East. Biden named Blinken to the post on Monday, a day after news leaked about his plans to bring on the Jewish former high-ranking official in the Obama administration. Blinken, 58, has been one of Biden’s closest policy advisers for over a decade and espouses the opposite of Trump’s “America First” agenda, which prioritized nationalist goals over international diplomacy. Multiple reports say that Blinken will seek to rejoin many of the international agreements that Trump left as president, notably the Paris Climate Accords and the Iran nuclear deal (an agreement with major diplomatic consequences for Israel). Under Blinken, the State Department will usher in a much different foreign policy era, including on Israel. Like Biden, Blinken has close ties to the country forged from his decades of strong support of the Jewish state. Here’s what you need to know about the new top diplomat, who hasn’t been much of a household name until now. His Jewish parents were influential in their own right. Blinken was born in New York City, where he spent most of his early years. His father, Donald, co-founded the hefty E.M. Warburg Pincus & Company (now Warbug Pincus) investment firm and served as the U.S. ambassador to Hungary for four years under President Bill Clinton’s administration. There is an archive at George Soros’ Central European University in Hungary named for Donald Blinken, now 95, and his second wife, Vera, who survived the Holocaust, in part for their support of the “democratization process in the United States and in Hungary.” Donald Blinken’s grandfather Meir Blinken also was a noted Yiddish author whose stories were published in a book in the 1980s that features an introduction by scholar Ruth Wisse. His stepfather’s Holocaust experience shaped his worldview. Tony Blinken’s mother, Judith, remarried Samuel Pisar, a Holocaust survivor and attorney who advised President John F. Kennedy and multiple French presidents. Pisar, who survived three concentration camps, also worked for the United Nations, wrote a libretto title “Kaddish-A Dialogue With God” at the behest of Leonard Bernstein and penned an award-winning memoir about his Holocaust experiences. Read more about him here in a Jewish Telegraphic Agency obituary and the description of a Yad Vashem program named after him. Blinken has said that Pisar’s experiences have informed his vision for the “engaged” role that the United States should play on the global stage. Here’s one story he tells frequently, via Jewish Insider: “One day as they were hiding out, they heard this deep rumbling sound,” Blinken recounted, “and as my stepfather looked out, he saw a sight that he had never seen before — not the dreaded Iron Cross, not a swastika, but on a tank a five-pointed white star. And, maybe in a foolhardy way, he rushed out toward it. He knew what it was. And he got to the tank, the hatch opened up, and a large African-American G.I. stared down at him. And he got down on his knees and he said the only three words that he knew in English, that his mother had taught him before the war: ‘God bless America.’ And at that point, the G.I. lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into America. That’s the story that I grew up with — about what our country is and what it represents, and what it means when the United States is engaged and leading.” His diplomatic career has spanned decades and gained him a reputation as a centrist. That career began on the National Security Council under Clinton. Blinken also was appointed staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which was headed by Biden during the George W. Bush years. In 2008, Biden tapped Blinken to help his presidential campaign, and when Biden was chosen as Barack Obama’s vice president, Blinken followed, becoming one of his national security advisers. In 2014, Obama elevated Blinken to deputy secretary of state under John Kerry. During those years, Blinken was heavily involved in the crafting of Middle East policy, including the landmark Iran deal. Blinken has been described as a centrist and an interventionist, and he’s said to have a “mind meld” with Biden on foreign policy — an area of governance in which the president-elect specializes and wants to prioritize in the Oval Office. Blinken is more hawkish on issues such as Russia, whom he considers a foe (he helped Obama’s team respond stiffly to Vladimir Putin’s encroachments into Crimea). On Israel, Blinken’s views reflect the Democratic mainstream. Within the Democratic Party, a minority of lawmakers and advocates have been trying to shift the party to the left on Israel issues. Progressives including Bernie Sanders have suggested that aid to Israel ought to be conditioned on certain policy choices. The Trump administration has shifted U.S. policy to the right in recent years, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and, just last week, saying that the United States would consider the movement to boycott Israel officially anti-Semitic. Blinken is a centrist here, too. He has said that a Biden administration will not condition aid to Israel on policy choices, will keep the embassy in Jerusalem and will staunchly support Israel at the United Nations — a body that often singles out the Jewish state for human rights abuses without condemning offenders such as Syria and China. In May, Biden wrote that he “firmly” rejects the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, and Blinken has backed up that stance. Blinken’s appointment drew praise from centrist Democrats on Sunday night, but also from Sanders’ foreign policy adviser, Matt Duss, who tweeted that it would be “a new and great thing to have a top diplomat who has regularly engaged with progressive grassroots.” Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., a progressive who is known for her harsh criticism of Israel and support for boycotting Israel, responded that she would be happy as long as “he doesn’t try to silence me and suppress my First Amendment right to speak out against Netanyahu’s racist and inhumane policies.” Blinken’s record has earned him respect from Israeli officials, even when he hasn’t always agreed with them. Michael Oren, a conservative former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., called Blinken a man of “singular intelligence and warmth” in a passage of his 2015 book “Ally: My Journey Across the American-Israeli Divide” — even in describing how Blinken rebuked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for expanding settlement building after agreeing not to. “How could you do this to Israel’s best friend?” Blinken said about Biden to Oren, who was the ambassador at the time. On Twitter Sunday night, Oren said he could think of “no finer choice” for the post, and news of Biden tapping Blinken drew praise from a cross-section of Israelis who have encountered him in the course of diplomacy. If there’s ever tension between Israeli and American leadership, don’t expect to know about it. A big part of keeping things copacetic, as Biden and Blinken see it, is leaving policy disputes behind closed doors — something Blinken pushed for during the Obama years, sometimes to no avail. As he told a “Sesame Street” character, Blinken is compassionate toward refugees. President Trump prioritized closing off U.S. borders and punishing immigrants who sought asylum in a policy set by a Jewish adviser, Stephen Miller. Biden has said his approach to immigration — an issue important to many American Jews — will be much different. Blinken explained his attitude about refugees in a 2016 video with the “Sesame Street” character Grover, in which he explains to the fuzzy blue puppet that refugees should be treated the same as “you and me.” “We all have something to learn and gain from one another, even when it doesn’t seem at first like we have much in common,” Blinken said after asking Grover to imagine how challenging it must be for someone to feel so unsafe that they decide to leave their home. This school year, some kids will have new classmates: refugees. @Grover & I discuss how to make them feel welcome in their new communities. pic.twitter.com/gKInM2Ahuw — Antony Blinken (@ABlinken) September 21, 2016 He’s got a lighter side — and a band with a clever name. At one point the Harvard grad — who married Evan Ryan, a former assistant secretary of state in a ceremony that involved both a rabbi and a priest — wanted to be a filmmaker. Blinken also has a ’70s-inspired band called Ablinken — wordplay on multiple levels — that has two tracks on Spotify and was making headlines Monday. Correction: This article originally incorrectly stated that Michael Oren was a U.S. ambassador to Israel. He was the opposite — the Israeli ambassador to the U.S.

News article:
US President-elect Joe Biden should seek to preserve the foreign policy accomplishments of the outgoing Trump administration in the Middle East, the editor-in-chief of The Algemeiner said in a television interview last week. Appearing on the “L’Chayim” talk show, hosted by Mark Golub on JBS, Dovid Efune remarked that if he was advising Biden, he would tell him, “Your first order of business in the Middle East should be to send emissaries to the capitals of moderate Sunni Arab states, and of course to Israel, and say, ‘Listen, we disagreed with the Trump administration on a hell of a lot, but on Middle East policy we’re going to keep it going.’” “Right now, you have the Saudis, the Moroccans, the Omanis, sitting and waiting,” Efune noted. “They’re asking a fundamental question before they feel prepared dive in to new relations with Israel, new relations with the West, like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan have done. They need to know where this administration stands on Iran. They need to know that this new administration has their back.

News article:
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden announced a number of cabinet and national security picks on Monday that offers a view into the direction his administration will pursue regarding foreign policy. For the Jewish and pro-Israel community, most of the selections by Biden are familiar names who have long-served in senior foreign-policy positions in previous Democratic administrations, while others are newer names to the American public. Tony Blinken, who served as Biden’s top foreign-policy adviser during his campaign, and was deputy secretary of state and deputy national security advisor under former U.S. President Barack Obama, will be nominated as U.S. secretary of state. A GOP-controlled Senate would likely be receptive to Blinken; whether that comes to fruition will be decided after the two Senate-seat runoffs in Georgia on Jan. 5. Blinken said during the campaign that a Biden administration would keep some of the U.S. sanctions on Iran and reiterated Biden’s stance that the United States would not return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal unless the Islamic Regime returned to compliance. Jake Sullivan, who also served as a foreign-policy adviser on Biden’s campaign and succeeded Blinken as national security advisor to Biden when he was vice president, has been named as incoming U.S. national security advisor—a position that does not involve Senate confirmation. Sullivan reportedly met with Iranian officials in 2013 in order to foster a possible nuclear agreement with the regime. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a 35-year diplomat, will be nominated as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Avril Haines, who served as deputy national security advisor and deputy CIA director under Obama, will be nominated as director of national intelligence. If confirmed, she would be the first woman to serve in the role, which oversees all U.S. intelligence agencies. Haines was a signee of a letter to the Democratic National Committee that called for the party’s platform to include language critical of Israel, expressed sympathy with the Palestinians and advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Alejandro Mayorkas, who served as U.S. deputy homeland security director and director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, will be nominated as U.S. homeland security secretary. If confirmed, he would be the first Latino and immigrant, and second Jewish person, to lead the agency. John Kerry, who served as secretary of state under Obama after serving for almost three decades as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, will be the special presidential envoy for climate and sit on the National Security Council. While Thomas-Greenfield is no stranger to the foreign-policy arena, she has no experience on issues pertaining to the Middle East or the Jewish community, as her career focused on African affairs. She was U.S. ambassador to Liberia from 2008 to 2012, director-general of the U.S. Foreign Service, and U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Nonetheless, a U.S. State Department official who works in African affairs and has worked with Thomas-Greenfield, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the official’s employment and not being authorized to speak to the press, told JNS that “she’s great and had a well-deserved wonderful reputation” at the department, and “knows the ins and outs of the department and is amazing to work with.” Additionally, Thomas-Greenfield met Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, in 2011 during the African Union Summit in the capital of Equatorial Guinea, Malabo. The unscheduled meeting happened after Hoenlein, who was part of a delegation not affiliated with the Conference of Presidents, voluntarily walked out of the plenary session after Iran, joined by the Palestinians, objected to Hoenlein being in the room. Thomas-Greenfield had already been excluded from the session. She approached Hoenlein and his delegation, and the parties discussed the Iranian threat and other issues. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told JNS that the national security team will reflect how the Biden administration will contrast itself from the current Trump administration. “Regardless of what happens abroad, this is going to be nothing short of a transformation,” he said. Miller remarked that the national interest “will be the object of this group’s attention rather than catering to the needs of a single man’s vanity, politics or personal interests,” referring to the varying picks of U.S. President Donald Trump. He said that Biden’s national security team will “for sure” continue the success of the Abraham Accords, though the Iranian issue will be “very complicated” for them. ‘Sympathetic to concerns about anti-Semitism’ Jewish Democratic Council of America executive director Halie Soifer tweeted that Thomas-Greenfield “will help restore America’s alliances & credibility at the [United Nations], which are critical to our national security & building back better.” Hoenlein, speaking for himself, applauded the choice of Blinken and Sullivan, noting that even where there were differences with them and the umbrella Jewish organization, “we were able to work with them.” “Both are very knowledgeable, experienced,” said Hoenlein, adding that Mayorkas is someone “very sympathetic to the concerns about anti-Semitism” and other concerns from the Jewish community. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Barbara Leaf told JNS that Blinken and Thomas-Greenfield as the first State nominees are “welcome on several levels: Both bring deep foreign-policy experience and expertise to their positions and have led within the department on both policy and the spectrum of personnel and resources issues.” As to whether Kerry will have any influence on Iran policy, considering that he negotiated the 2015 Iran nuclear as secretary of state, Leaf said, “I think John Kerry is being brought on to do climate, period—something he is passionate about. Two of his big trips in his final year as secretary of state were to the Arctic Circle and to Antarctica to witness and draw attention to the effects of climate change.” She noted that “Biden has a thicket of people on the campaign foreign-policy team to choose from who are steeped in Iran who are likely to populate the administration,” and while Kerry “will offer his views” to Biden, the president-elect “will put together a formal Team Iran to run the policy under Blinken and Sullivan.” Michael Makovsky, president and CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told JNS, “Given the approach of the Obama administration and the foreign-policy rhetoric during the Democratic primary, Blinken and Sullivan are certainly from the more moderate wing of the party, and that is reassuring. They’re also thoughtful and experienced experts.” “However,” he continued, “they were involved in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal and favor re-entering it. That will be a complicated effort, and one that would be disastrous to achieve, so it is best to withhold judgment until we see how they choose to proceed.” Regarding Haines, Leaf called her “one of the smartest, nimblest managers and navigators of the U.S. interagency” she has worked with and someone who “brings terrific expertise to the job—in intelligence, counter-terrorism and on a mix of key geopolitical issues.” If confirmed, Mayorkas will be in charge of the department that, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, manages the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP), which Jewish synagogues and other institutions have relied upon especially in the aftermath of synagogue shootings and other anti-Semitic attacks over the past few years. While the Orthodox Union declined to comment on the picks, Nathan Diament, the organization’s executive director for public policy, told Jewish Insider in November that Mayorkas “was a very good partner in the leadership of DHS.” Aviva Klompas, who was the director of speechwriting for Israel’s U.N. mission under then-Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Ron Prosor, expressed hope that the upcoming Biden administration will continue the Trump administration’s policies of brokering normalization deals between Israel and other countries and on the Iranian threat. “We find ourselves at a promising historic juncture in the Middle East in which relations between Israel and the Muslim world are blossoming,” she told JNS. “I have no doubt that the Biden administration appointees will want to bring more countries to the table to sign peace agreements and bring greater stability to the Middle East for the simple reason that doing so is beneficial to the region and to the United States.” “At the same time,” continued Klompas, “I hope they will listen to the many voices in the Middle East cautioning that Iran remains the primary impediment to peace and stability and should be managed accordingly.” ‘Meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions’ Democratic Majority for Israel president and CEO Mark Mellman told JNS, “President-elect Biden is assembling a national security and foreign policy team with broad knowledge, deep experience, and a strong commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship. Together with the president-elect, these experienced, crisis-tested professionals will begin to restore America’s world leadership.” The American Jewish Committee applauded Biden for announcing Blinken as his choice to lead Foggy Bottom. “Tony Blinken has the breadth and depth of experience to ably oversee the implementation of U.S. foreign policy under President Biden,” said AJC CEO David Harris, who has met with Blinken on numerous occasions in the latter’s various posts. “He is intimately familiar with the full scope of the president-elect’s foreign-policy views, as well the issues of utmost concern to the Jewish community, including full-throated support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, widening the growing circle of Arab-Israel peace, the fight against global anti-Semitism, and the danger posed by Iran and its proxies.” AJC also praised the appointment of Kerry to the climate role, with the organization telling JNS that “as the first national Jewish organization to have a LEED-certified building, we are delighted to see this new position filled by someone we know well and have hosted several times at our Global Forum.” In a Twitter post, Harris also lauded Thomas-Greenfield. In a Twitter thread, J Street president Jeremy Ben-Ami applauded Monday’s developments. “The National Security team announced today by President-elect Biden represents exactly the type of leadership this country deserves and the world needs after four years of diplomatic and national security malpractice,” he tweeted. “The challenges facing us globally in the 21st century, as well as in the Middle East more specifically, require not just America’s re-engagement but our meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions.” The challenges facing us globally in the 21st century, as well as in the Middle East more specifically, require not just America’s re-engagement but our meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions. — Jeremy Ben-Ami (@JeremyBenAmi) November 23, 2020 B’nai B’rith International provided a neutral stance on Biden’s selections of Blinken, Sullivan and Thomas-Greenfield, though declined to comment on Kerry, Haines and Mayorkas. “We hope the new appointments at State, the NSC and the U.N. will encourage an expansion of Israel’s relations with Arab countries and that they will take a tough line on Iran’s nuclear program and its malign behavior in the region, and will continue a long tradition of fighting bias against Israel at the United Nations,” the organization’s CEO, Daniel Mariaschin, told JNS. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee declined to comment, citing its longstanding policy of not discussing administration nominations and appointments.

News article:
Former Israeli permanent representative to the UN Danny Danon said this week he would rather U.S. President-elect Joe Biden adopts his Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton's approach to the Middle East rather than that of Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "Clinton was more of a negotiator, trying to mediate between the sides, while President Obama tried to force his views," Danon told Ynet. 5 View gallery U.S. President-elect Joe Biden ( Photo: Gettyimages ) "I think President-elect Biden will choose Clinton’s approach to the Middle East because he was there, and he knows it doesn’t work when you try to force your ideas. He was involved for many years, he knows the material, he knows the people and I’m sure he’ll bring his own ideas to the table." During his tenure, former Democratic President Barack Obama faced much scrutiny for his handling of Middle East affairs, more than once finding himself at loggerheads with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, especially over Iran's nuclear arms program. In September 2012, Danon — a former Cabinet minister on behalf of the Likud Party — published his first book titled " Israel: the Will to Prevail ” in which he analyzes the Israel-U.S. relationship, and presents alternative approaches to the conventional wisdom on negotiating peace between Israelis and Palestinians while criticizing Obama's approach to Israel. 5 View gallery Former U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikko Haley and Former permanent representative to the UN Danny Danon ( Photo: U.S. Embassy in Israel ) Danon will be co-headlining the DiploTech Global Summit 2020 on December 16 alongside former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley that will include world leaders, heads of states, ministers of foreign affairs, policymakers and diplomats who will meet with industry experts, investors and innovators for the first global summit of its kind. This exclusive event, headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel will see policymakers and world leaders conferring with leading experts from the fields of sustainable development, digitech, medtech and agtech. The prominent keynote speakers and carefully selected panelists will discuss and identify how our new world can best overcome the biggest global challenges and proactively prepare for a post-COVID world and collective sustainable future, where innovation and technology will play an even greater role. The event — initiated by Danon and chaired by Yossi Sagol, entrepreneur and Chairman of Sagol Holdings — will welcome Liz Claman, high profile anchor of the Fox Business Network show “The Claman Countdown”, as master of ceremonies for the diverse and prominent speakers, panelists and global guests. Keynote speakers will include Danon, Ambassador Haley, and Chairwoman and Chief Technology Officer at Diagnostic Robotics Kira Radinsky amongst others. 5 View gallery Diplotech takes place on December 16 in Tel Aviv Danon said he believed Israel will play a significant role in the global recovery from the pandemic thanks to its innovative nature and tumultuous history. "Every few years, we have a conflict or a war. If you look at Israel's history, we always had some challenges to overcome and each time we recovered very quickly. So I think we’ll be able to support not only our own economy and our own society but support other countries as well," he said. "There is a lot of interest in Israel from developing countries that look at it as a miracle and would like to emulate what we have done here in Israel." Danon also expressed hope that the signing of the Abraham Accords, a U.S.-brokered peace pact between Israel and Arab and Muslim states such as the Arabian Gulf states of Bahrain the United Arab Emirates, will mutually benefit all peoples of the region. 5 View gallery L-R: Bahrain FM Abdullatif al-Zayani, PM Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Emirati FM Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan at the signing ceremony of the Abraham Accords at the White House ( Photo: AFP ) "It won’t be only Israeli technology helping the people of the Gulf. This mutual cooperation will also benefit Israelis," he said. "At the beginning of the [coronavirus] crisis, one of the first countries to support Israel, in terms of medical supplies, was one of the Gulf countries. It’s important for me to make sure our colleagues know that we appreciate the mutual benefits of normalization. "More countries are interested in joining. I don’t know whether they’ll wait for the new U.S. president to step in but it's great for us and we’re looking forward to it." Amid a budget row between the government's two major parties, Likud and Blue & White, lawmakers last week passed in a preliminary vote a resolution to dissolve Knesset, seemingly setting the stage for Israel's fourth election in just under two years, which Danon deemed "irresponsible" and detrimental to Israel's COVID-19 response. 5 View gallery Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz ( Photo: GPO, AFP ) "I’m still hoping we’re not heading for another election. I think it's irresponsible. I expect both the defense minister [Blue & White Chairman Benny Gantz] and the prime minister [Likud Chairman Netanyahu] to settle their differences and postpone the election," he said. "I don’t think it’s what Israel needs right now before we head into the winter and before we have the vaccine available. Otherwise, we’ll have to invest a lot of funds and energy in the fourth election within two years instead of preparing ourselves for the winter.

News article:
Marking the third anniversary of President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently celebrated that gift by expressing his gratitude to the American president and posting a copy of the proclamation in the cabinet room. It joins President Harry Truman’s recognition of the fledgling Jewish state, moments after it declared independence, as one of the most generous gifts from the United States to Israel. Liberal American Jews may be delighted to join the majority of voters who cast their presidential votes for Joe Biden, but the departing president will surely be missed by appreciative Israelis who know a presidential friend when they see one. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem was only part of his generosity. It also included recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, crucial to Israel’s defense of its northern border, and 30% of Judea and Samaria (formerly Jordan’s “West Bank”), where 120 Jewish settlements are located. To secure Israel’s recent normalization deal with the United Arab Emirates, Trump backed off from approving settlement annexation. Nonetheless, a massive Israeli tunnel construction plan is currently underway to link settlement communities to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and other locations within Israel’s recognized borders, assuring their permanence. There was no objection from the White House. Little wonder that in anticipation of the recent presidential election Israelis preferred Trump to Biden by a 2:1 margin. President Joe Biden will surely follow Barack Obama, his mentor and model, not Donald Trump. Biden’s approach to Israel during his Senate years might best be described as waffling. In 1982 he threatened to cut off aid unless Israel halted settlement construction. He was sharply rebuked by Prime Minister Menachem Begin: “Don’t threaten us with cutting off your aid. It will not work. I am not a Jew with trembling knees. I am a proud Jew with 3,700 years of civilized history. … No one came to our aid when we were striving to create our country. We paid for it. We fought for it. We died for it. We will stand by our principles. … And, when necessary, we will die for them again, with or without your aid.” Biden was quieted. Biden’s vice presidency under the president least friendly to Israel had its impact. In 2014, he bluntly told Netanyahu, “I don’t agree with a damn thing you say.” Two years later he persuaded Ukraine to vote in favor of a UN Security Council Resolution ruling that even the Western Wall is in “occupied Palestinian territories.” Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... Like Obama, Biden frequently made clear his opposition to settlements. In a 2016 speech to J Street he stated: “I firmly believe that the actions that Israel’s government has taken over the past several years — the steady and systematic expansion of settlements, the legalization of outposts, land seizures — are moving Israel in the wrong direction.” He added: “We have an obligation to push them as hard as we can toward what they know in their gut is the only ultimate solution — a two-state solution.” But what is in Israel’s “gut” may not be what Biden imagines. Not long before the end of the Obama administration, Biden admonished Israel “to stop the threats of annexation and stop settlement activity because it will choke off any hope of peace” — overlooking the historical reality that Palestinians have long rejected any peace terms. UN Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted one month before the Obama presidency ended, stated (falsely) that Israel’s settlement activity constitutes a “flagrant violation” of international law and has “no legal validity.” It called on all states “to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.” According to the Resolution, even the Western Wall and Temple Mount are in occupied territory. President Obama and Vice President Biden acquiesced. During his presidential campaign, Biden promised to take steps necessary to preserve “the prospect of a two-state outcome.” He urged Israelis to “stop the expansion of West Bank settlements and talk of annexation that would make two states impossible to achieve.” He evidently forgot Menachem Begin’s sharp reminder that Israel could not “annex” its Biblical homeland — and ignored the repetitive refusal of the Palestinian Authority to accept peace with Israel under any terms. Perhaps Biden’s presidency may help him to finally resolve his waffling about Israel. More likely, given his past record of equivocation, it may not. Jerold S.

Perhaps Biden’s presidency may help him to finally resolve his waffling about Israel. More likely, given his past record of equivocation, it may not. Jerold S.

News article:
Marking the third anniversary of President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently celebrated that gift by expressing his gratitude to the American president and posting a copy of the proclamation in the cabinet room. It joins President Harry Truman’s recognition of the fledgling Jewish state, moments after it declared independence, as one of the most generous gifts from the United States to Israel. Liberal American Jews may be delighted to join the majority of voters who cast their presidential votes for Joe Biden, but the departing president will surely be missed by appreciative Israelis who know a presidential friend when they see one. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem was only part of his generosity. It also included recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, crucial to Israel’s defense of its northern border, and 30% of Judea and Samaria (formerly Jordan’s “West Bank”), where 120 Jewish settlements are located. To secure Israel’s recent normalization deal with the United Arab Emirates, Trump backed off from approving settlement annexation. Nonetheless, a massive Israeli tunnel construction plan is currently underway to link settlement communities to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and other locations within Israel’s recognized borders, assuring their permanence. There was no objection from the White House. Little wonder that in anticipation of the recent presidential election Israelis preferred Trump to Biden by a 2:1 margin. President Joe Biden will surely follow Barack Obama, his mentor and model, not Donald Trump. Biden’s approach to Israel during his Senate years might best be described as waffling. In 1982 he threatened to cut off aid unless Israel halted settlement construction. He was sharply rebuked by Prime Minister Menachem Begin: “Don’t threaten us with cutting off your aid. It will not work. I am not a Jew with trembling knees. I am a proud Jew with 3,700 years of civilized history. … No one came to our aid when we were striving to create our country. We paid for it. We fought for it. We died for it. We will stand by our principles. … And, when necessary, we will die for them again, with or without your aid.” Biden was quieted. Biden’s vice presidency under the president least friendly to Israel had its impact. In 2014, he bluntly told Netanyahu, “I don’t agree with a damn thing you say.” Two years later he persuaded Ukraine to vote in favor of a UN Security Council Resolution ruling that even the Western Wall is in “occupied Palestinian territories.” Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... Like Obama, Biden frequently made clear his opposition to settlements. In a 2016 speech to J Street he stated: “I firmly believe that the actions that Israel’s government has taken over the past several years — the steady and systematic expansion of settlements, the legalization of outposts, land seizures — are moving Israel in the wrong direction.” He added: “We have an obligation to push them as hard as we can toward what they know in their gut is the only ultimate solution — a two-state solution.” But what is in Israel’s “gut” may not be what Biden imagines. Not long before the end of the Obama administration, Biden admonished Israel “to stop the threats of annexation and stop settlement activity because it will choke off any hope of peace” — overlooking the historical reality that Palestinians have long rejected any peace terms. UN Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted one month before the Obama presidency ended, stated (falsely) that Israel’s settlement activity constitutes a “flagrant violation” of international law and has “no legal validity.” It called on all states “to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.” According to the Resolution, even the Western Wall and Temple Mount are in occupied territory. President Obama and Vice President Biden acquiesced. During his presidential campaign, Biden promised to take steps necessary to preserve “the prospect of a two-state outcome.” He urged Israelis to “stop the expansion of West Bank settlements and talk of annexation that would make two states impossible to achieve.” He evidently forgot Menachem Begin’s sharp reminder that Israel could not “annex” its Biblical homeland — and ignored the repetitive refusal of the Palestinian Authority to accept peace with Israel under any terms.

News article:
Preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons will be one of the top foreign policy and national security challenges facing Joe Biden when he becomes president Jan. 20. Realistically, diplomacy and empty threats won’t accomplish this vital task — we’ve seen them fail under both Democratic and Republican administrations. The only way for Biden to succeed will be to use military force against Iran. I realize this proposal will be met with cries of “warmonger” and doomsday scenarios of a massive U.S. invasion of Iran with heavy American casualties. But that’s not what I’m suggesting. UK, GERMANY, FRANCE CALLS IRAN NUCLEAR MOVES ‘DEEPLY WORRYING’ Marine Gen. James Mattis, then head of U.S. Central Command (and later President Trump’s defense secretary), said in 2013 that the American military could bring Iran to its knees. “There are a number of means to do that,” he said, “perhaps even short of open conflict.” The U.S. has an arsenal of weapons that can be used in coordination with allies including Israel and Arab nations that don’t require a Desert Storm-type of invasion of Iran. Unlike diplomacy, which has repeatedly failed to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions, limited force against the regime can succeed. President Trump rightly abandoned President Barack Obama’s overly generous Iran nuclear deal, which failed to stop Tehran from advancing toward a nuclear bomb. But while Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions has crippled Iran’s economy, it has not stopped the Islamic Republic’s malignant behavior. And Trump’s term in office is about to end with Iran closer to possessing nuclear weapons than it was when he became president in January 2017. What can Biden do differently to deal with a major Iranian threat to our national security and the security of U.S. allies? Unfortunately, Biden is starting off on the wrong path. He wants to return to Obama’s calamitous Iran nuclear deal and appears ready to ease the pressure on Iran to entice the regime to return to the negotiating table. The Iranians, however, have no interest in talks without being compensated for the economic damage of the Trump sanctions. But even if Biden takes this unwarranted step, there is zero chance Iran will agree to serious limits on its nuclear program, let alone restrictions on its other malign activities supporting terrorism and military action in the greater Middle East. Only military force can eliminate or at least seriously reduce the Iranian threat. Obama never seriously threatened military force against Iran. He appeared weak by failing to enforce his red line and attack Syria following the regime’s use of chemical weapons, and then furthered his profile in weakness by withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. The Iranians concluded they had nothing to fear from Obama. They used that to their advantage to out-negotiate the president and his team and get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without sacrificing their strategic objectives. Trump’s term in office is about to end with Iran closer to possessing nuclear weapons than it was when he became president in January 2017. Trump initially frightened Iranian leaders when he attacked Syria. He gave the Iranians another scare when he approved the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the terrorist commander of the Iranian Quds Force. But Trump’s unpredictability, his calls for withdrawing troops from the Middle East and elsewhere, and his failure to respond to Iranian provocations — even after a ballistic missile attack on a U.S. base in Iraq — revealed his belligerent threats to be just bluster. To be effective, threats must be credible. Biden must demonstrate he is prepared to use force against Iran if necessary. That means a U.S. response must take place if Iran attacks our allies or if our assets are attacked. We should not seek escalation, but shouldn’t shrink from it either. One way to contain the Iranians is by keeping U.S. forces in the region, especially in neighboring Iraq. The ayatollahs who rule Iran were petrified they might be the next target after the American military deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein under President George W. Bush. But the threat from the U.S. dissipated with the removal of our troops and the reluctance of the next two American presidents to use force. While our armed forces must be ready to act if necessary, we have a range of other options — one of which is cyberwarfare. The U.S.-Israeli intelligence operation Olympic Games, started under President George W. Bush and expanded under Obama, for example, is believed to have set the Iranian nuclear weapons program back months, if not years. PENTAGON SENDS B-52 BOMBERS TO PERSIAN GULF, AS US LAUNCHES AIRSTRIKES IN SOMALIA AFTER PULLING OUT In 2019, the U.S. Cyber Command targeted computer systems that control Iranian missile launches and those used by an Iranian intelligence group believed to be involved in planning attacks against oil tankers. The United States also reportedly conducted a cyber operation in response to Iran’s attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities. Likewise, in response to an Iranian cyberattack, Israel reportedly hacked into Iranian computers that regulate the flow of vessels, trucks, and goods — bringing shipping traffic at Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port terminal to a halt. Sabotage may be carried out in other ways. Over the summer, for example, several explosions and fires attributed to Israel damaged weapons facilities across Iran. One blast destroyed parts of a secret facility in Parchin associated with nuclear weapons research and damaged part of a missile facility. Another explosion destroyed a building at the Natanz enrichment facility where Iran has been developing advanced centrifuges to significantly speed up the enrichment of uranium. The Institute for Science and International Security reported that this represented “a significant setback to Iran’s plans and ability to mass produce advanced centrifuges” and said rebuilding the plant would likely take at least a year. Decapitating the leadership of Iran’s terror and nuclear networks can also weaken the regime. Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani, the mastermind of Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria, who the Pentagon said was “actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.” Israel has been accused of killing at least six Iranian scientists, most recently the head of the Iranian nuclear weapons program, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Contrary to the appeasers’ claims that such assassinations have no impact, former CIA Director Michael Hayden told Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman that “the death of those human beings had a great impact on their nuclear program.” The killings hurt Iran in three ways: “the loss of the know-how in the dead men’s minds; the significant delays in the program resulting from the need to beef up measures to prevent penetration by Western intelligence; and the abandonment of the program by experienced experts for fear that they would suffer a similar fate,” Hayden said. The killing of Fakhrizadeh and sabotage operations exposed the weakness of Iran’s intelligence agencies. This was an embarrassment to the regime and caused officials to engage in recriminations and lose confidence in their ability to protect their personnel and facilities. Knowing its nuclear facilities are targets, Iran has moved some underground. The United States could target them using bunker-busting bombs, which former Defense Secretary Ash Carter said have the capability to “shut down, set back, and destroy” Iran’s nuclear program. Airstrikes could also destroy Iranian air bases, naval bases, and ballistic missile installations. Iran has harassed American ships in the Persian Gulf and threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. has planned for this contingency and could send a message if tensions escalated by sinking Iran’s brand-new warship. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER A U.S. operation could target Kharg Island — from which Iran exports 90% of its oil and natural gas — or the port of Bandar Abbas, which is responsible for 90% of Iran’s container trade. A broader strike might include air and missile strikes against oil refineries, natural gas terminals, railways, bridges, roads and power plants. America could also impose a no-fly zone and/or a naval embargo on Iran. Military planners always hope their operations will succeed. However, they must also consider worst-case scenarios, including many of those suggested by opponents of the use of force. Even limited attacks could provoke Iranian retaliation against U.S. troops and allies, and escalate to war. But here’s what’s important to remember: If Iran develops nuclear weapons, most — if not all — our options will be foreclosed. Nuclear weapons would virtually guarantee that no nation would dare attack the Islamic Republic. This is why the Iranian leaders have been working for years to develop a nuclear force. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even worse, if Iranian leaders actually ordered the use of nuclear weapons to attack another nation or U.S. forces, the consequences would be horrific. Ultimately, incoming President Biden will have to decide whether the risks of military action against Iran outweigh the benefit of preventing it from acquiring nuclear weapons. But he will also have to consider the costs and benefits of inaction. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MITCHELL BARD

However, they must also consider worst-case scenarios, including many of those suggested by opponents of the use of force. Even limited attacks could provoke Iranian retaliation against U.S. troops and allies, and escalate to war. But here’s what’s important to remember: If Iran develops nuclear weapons, most — if not all — our options will be foreclosed. Nuclear weapons would virtually guarantee that no nation would dare attack the Islamic Republic. This is why the Iranian leaders have been working for years to develop a nuclear force. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even worse, if Iranian leaders actually ordered the use of nuclear weapons to attack another nation or U.S. forces, the consequences would be horrific. Ultimately, incoming President Biden will have to decide whether the risks of military action against Iran outweigh the benefit of preventing it from acquiring nuclear weapons. But he will also have to consider the costs and benefits of inaction. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MITCHELL BARD

News article:
i24 News – US President-elect Joe Biden’s advisers are divided on the prospect of rejoining the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Israel Hayom reported Monday. According to the report, while the Biden campaign has said it wanted to rejoin the accord that US President Donald Trump pulled the US out of in 2018, some of Biden’s aides are pushing against it. The move would waste the headway made by the Trump administration in pressuring Tehran through its maximum pressure policy, they argue. The way to move forward, they purportedly assert, is to keep up the pressure from the sanctions slapped on Tehran by the Trump team to force Iran to expand the deal. The approach essentially mimics Trump’s strategy, with the sitting president betting on the sanctions to force Tehran to give up its ballistic missile program and support for regional terrorist groups — the areas that were not covered by the 2015 accord, which only zoomed in on Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Iran denies that its nuclear aspirations have a military dimension and angrily lashes out at demands to give up the ballistic missile development project as well as regional meddling. After Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, Iran has been gradually rolling back its own commitments to the agreement. According to media reports, it recently notified the UN nuclear watchdog of an intention to install more advanced centrifuges underground and rebuilt a centrifuge assembly center destroyed by sabotage in summer.

News article:
Iran’s supreme leader and the country’s president both warned America on Wednesday that the departure of President Donald Trump does not immediately mean better relations between the two nations. The remarks come as Iran approaches the first anniversary of the U.S. drone strike that killed Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, an attack that nearly plunged Washington and Tehran into an open war after months of tensions. In recent weeks, a scientist who founded Iran’s military nuclear program two decades ago was gunned down in an attack in a rural area outside of Tehran that The Associated Press accessed for the first time Wednesday. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke in Tehran at the Imam Khomeini Hosseinieh, or congregation hall, where he attended a meeting with Soleimani’s family and top military leaders. They all sat some 16 feet away from the 81-year-old Khamenei, who wore a face mask due to the coronavirus pandemic still raging in Iran. US BLAMES IRAN FOR PRESUMED DEATH OF ROBERT LEVINSON, SANCTIONS TWO INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS "You saw that what Trump’s America and (former President Barack) Obama’s America did to you," Khamenei said. "The hostilities are not just for Trump’s America, which ends when he leaves. Obama’s America also did bad things to you and the Iranian nation." Earlier in the day, Rouhani, speaking during a Cabinet meeting, made a similar point to criticize Trump -- at one point even saying the U.S. president "has committed so many crimes, he was an assassin and a terrorist." "Some people say, ‘You are excited for Mr. Biden,’" Rouhani said. "No, we are not excited Mr. Biden is taking office, but we are very happy Mr. Trump is gone." "The upcoming American administration can choose what to do," Rouhani said. "The path is open. It’s up to them if they are grateful or ungrateful. If they want the right path, it’s ready. If they want the wrong path, that one is ready for them as well." Biden has suggested the U.S. could rejoin Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, from which Trump unilaterally pulled America in 2018 and imposed harsher sanctions on Iran. That decision marked the start of increased tensions between the two countries as Iran abandoned uranium enrichment limits and the Mideast saw a series of escalating incidents and attacks. TRUMP, BIDEN OFFICIALS CONDEMN IRAN REGIME’S KIDNAPPING, EXECUTION OF REPORTER In response to Soleimani’s death, Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack that injured dozens of U.S. troops in Iraq. That same night, it also mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian airliner taking off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. Hoping to pressure Europe, Iran’s parliament recently passed a bill calling on Tehran to increase its uranium enrichment to 20 percent, a short technical step from weapons-grade levels, and to throw out international inspectors. Rouhani’s government has opposed the bill, exposing a rift inside Iran’s civilian government that the supreme leader appeared to touch on in his speech Wednesday. "Resolve your disputes by negotiating with each other," Khamenei said. "Are you not saying that we should negotiate with the world, is it not possible to negotiate and resolve disputes with the internal element?" That bill came after the Nov. 27 killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who headed Iran’s so-called AMAD project, which Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that "structured program" ended in 2003. U.S. intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report and the State Department agreed with it as recently as last year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Israel, suspected of carrying out Fakhrizadeh’s slaying, insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran’s ballistic missile program and research into other technologies. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful. AP journalists accessed the site of Fakhrizadeh’s killing for the first time on Wednesday just outside the town of Absard. Apple orchards line the road in front of the snowcapped Alborz mountain range. A new sign hung over a damaged electrical power pole where his bullet-riddled car came to rest, identifying it as "the site of ascension of martyred scientist ... to heaven."

News article:
Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, cautioned on Wednesday that the relationship between Tehran and the U.S. would not immediately thaw with the exit of President Trump. Reuters reported that the supreme leader in comments published on his official website pointed to the Obama administration, in which President-elect Joe Biden served as vice president. “The hostility is not just from Trump’s America, which will not end when he leaves, as Obama’s America also did bad things to … the Iranian nation,” said Khamenei, according to Reuters. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, indicated earlier this week that his government would be eager to reenter the nuclear agreement with the U.S. and European allies should Biden rejoin it, which the president-elect has vowed to do. In a speech on Monday, Rouhani reportedly said that Iran would rejoin the nuclear pact within an hour after the U.S. restores it, while cautioning the Biden administration against seeking limits on Iran’s ballistic missile program. The current administration and the government in Tehran largely avoided negotiations or any formal diplomacy after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-era Iran nuclear accord and reinstituted a series of crippling sanctions.

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani continued Tehran's stubborn, combative rhetoric regarding President-Elect Joe Biden on Thursday, vowing that the incoming American administration will be forced to make concessions if it wants to revive the beleaguered nuclear deal. Rouhani said Thursday while inaugurating transportation and urban development projects that Iran would seek to nullify American sanctions on Tehran—as ordered by Ayatollah Ali Khamanei on Wednesday—which have intensified since President Donald Trump lost November's election. Iranian leaders have met the sanctions—plus the assassination of top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in November—with aggressive rhetoric and expanded nuclear activities. Though Tehran is grappling with an economic crisis, the coronavirus pandemic and social unrest, regime leaders are maneuvering for leverage with the incoming Biden team. "I have no doubt that the three-year resistance of the Iranian nation will force the future U.S. administration to succumb to the people and return to their commitments and break the sanctions," Rouhani said, according to the Mehr News Agency. Trump tried and failed to force Iran back to the negotiating table to agree a new, more restrictive version of the President Barack Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which lifted international sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. Instead, sanctions and military actions have pushed Iran away from the JCPOA. Tehran now has an enriched uranium stockpile 12 times that allowed under the deal, and has moved to block international inspections, expand its stockpile further and enrich uranium up to 20 percent—a relatively short technical step from weapons-grade 90 percent enriched uranium. Iran has also more than tripled the budget for the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, formerly headed by Fakhrizadeh and responsible for military nuclear research. These steps will all make life more difficult for Biden, who has been open about his wish to revive the JCPOA, which was considered a major foreign policy achievement by the Obama administration in which he served as vice president. Rouhani said that Iran would try to nullify sanctions while also looking for opportunities to have them lifted, something Iran is desperately in need of despite the stubborn public rhetoric of its leaders. "Our first task is to try to make sanctions ineffective or less effective," Rouhani said, adding, "We are trying to remove the sanctions, and as the leader said yesterday, this should not be delayed even for an hour," referring to Khamenei's Wednesday remarks. Also on Wednesday, Rouhani said that while Tehran is "not excited" by the prospect of Biden's administration, though added the regime was glad that Trump—who he called a "terrorist"—was leaving office. International Atomic Energy Agency Director Rafael Mariano Grossi told CBS News on Wednesday that Trump had increased the risk of nuclear crisis by withdrawing from the JCPOA in 2018, a step opposed by all major U.S. allies apart from Israel. "From that moment, Iran, as a response to this, decided to gradually start diminishing its compliance" with the deal, Grossi said, before urging the incoming administration to revive dialogue with Tehran. Iran's continued human rights abuses and support for regional proxy militias targeting American interests and allies will also be hurdles. Still, the president-elect and his top foreign policy aides have been clear in their belief that reviving the JCPOA is a key step in addressing other grievances with Tehran's behavior. Sanctions relief is a tantalizing reward for Iran, which has been cut off from global financial markets, seen its vital oil exports dwindle, and struggled to import vital goods and medical supplies. This has been especially punishing as the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the country. For all the tit-for-tat escalations, Iranian leaders have encouraged JCPOA talks. But they have made it clear they expect full U.S. compliance with the original deal and will not consider any limits on their ballistic missile program or regional activities; two key U.S. grievances. Even more hard line officials have not ruled out negotiations, significant as Rouhani is expected to be replaced by a more conservative president—perhaps even one from the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—when his term ends in June IRGC Brigadier General Rasol Sanaei Rad, who works in Khamenei's office, for example said in an interview published Thursday that talks are an option, though stressed that Tehran needs to ensure it has leverage in future negotiations.

News article:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Joe Biden will not shy away from using President Donald Trump’s weapon of choice - sanctions - as he seeks to reshape America’s foreign policy, according to people familiar with his thinking. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President-elect Joe Biden speaks as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris stands by in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., November 16, 2020. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo But when Biden takes office on Jan. 20, he is expected to quickly begin recalibrating Trump’s blunt-force approach while taking time to deliberate before making any major changes with top sanctions targets like Iran and China, the sources said. His challenge will be to sort out which sanctions to keep, which to undo and which to expand. This will come after four years in which Trump has imposed punitive economic measures at a record pace – often unilaterally - but has failed to bend U.S. rivals to his will. The revised strategy will be crafted with help from a broad review of sanctions programs that will begin soon after Biden’s inauguration, the sources said on condition of anonymity. But even before this assessment is complete, Biden is expected to make clear that sanctions will remain a central instrument of U.S. power - although it will no longer be deployed with the “America First” bravado that has driven Trump’s foreign policy. “It won’t be a pullback or a push forward,” said one person close to Biden’s transition team. “It will be a readjustment in the use of the sanctions tool.” Among the early possibilities, according to two sources, could be lifting sanctions Trump imposed in September on officials of the International Criminal Court over its investigation into whether the U.S. military committed war crimes in Afghanistan, a move denounced by European allies. Biden could also match British and European Union sanctions against Russians over the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, said one person familiar with the matter. Moscow has denied any involvement. Biden’s team had no official comment. PILING ON NEW SANCTIONS Adding to Biden’s challenges, Trump has kept up a drum beat of sanctions in the chaotic, waning days of his administration. He has imposed measures that could make it harder for his successor to return to a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and to quickly establish a working relationship with China after Communist Party officials were targeted. Since taking office, Trump has employed sanctions as his go-to response to international problems ranging from Iran’s military activities to North Korea’s nuclear arsenal to Venezuela’s political crisis. The Trump administration has issued around 3,800 new sanctions “designations” compared with 2,350 in President Barack Obama’s second term, while approving far fewer delistings, the means by which Washington rewards those who change behavior, according to figures compiled by the Center for a New American Security think tank. At the same time, his administration has pioneered the imposition of U.S. visa bans, hitting more than 200 foreign officials with travel sanctions rarely used before Trump, and has sharply escalated the use of so-called secondary sanctions that have punished friends as well as foes. While Biden is expected to continue robust use of such coercive measures, there will be changes, including more deliberative decision-making and closer coordination with allies, the sources said. “Sanctions are not a silver bullet,” said Hagar Hajjar Chemali, who served as a sanctions officer under Obama. “They need to be deployed as part of a broader strategy, and this is what has often been lacking with the Trump administration.” Trump officials insist that this flexing of U.S. economic muscle has inflicted serious damage to some of America’s foes that could provide leverage for Biden. Slideshow ( 2 images ) But those governments show no signs of giving in to Trump’s demands. Iran, despite Trump’s restoration of U.S. sanctions, refuses to renegotiate the nuclear deal he abandoned. Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro has defied efforts to oust him. North Korea continues to build up its nuclear arsenal. And China also has appeared unmoved by a barrage of sanctions over technology, Hong Kong, the South China Sea and the crackdown on its Muslim minority. Some critics have questioned Trump’s expansion of individual sanctions, the blacklisting of foreign officials with asset freezes and prohibitions on Americans doing business with them. Such moves can be effective when targets are wealthy or invested in the United States but mostly symbolic when they are not. Biden’s aides worry that the perceived overuse of sanctions could backfire, especially if it spurs other countries to develop mechanisms to circumvent U.S.-dominated financial networks. ‘LASER-FOCUSED’ Still, Biden’s choice of Antony Blinken as secretary of state and Jake Sullivan as national security adviser suggests that while he will be multilateral in using sanctions, there will not be much of a letup. Adewale Adeyemo, the incoming number two official at Treasury, vowed this month to be “laser-focused” on national security, including “using our sanctions regime to hold bad actors accountable.” He will lead Biden’s sanctions evaluation, multiple sources said. Iran is likely to be Biden’s biggest sanctions dilemma. He has said he would return to the nuclear deal – which Trump left in 2018 despite opposition from European allies - if Iran resumes compliance. Iran has put the onus on the new administration to act first and may seek concessions. While it will be hard for Biden to offer Iran significant sanctions relief anytime soon, he could create an opening for re-engagement by easing restrictions that have impeded Iran’s access to humanitarian goods amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to the person close to his team. Sanctions as part of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign have driven down the OPEC nation’s oil revenues and crippled foreign trade. Iran has been hurt by being frozen out of the U.S. financial system. Most countries and companies have shied away because of concern they themselves will be sanctioned for doing business with Tehran. Even so, Trump has continued piling on new measures over Tehran’s human rights, missile development and support for militants that will be politically difficult for Biden to unwind. “There’s a rush of actions as this administration heads toward the exits … to cause more economic pain, set back Iran’s nuclear program and complicate Biden’s path forward,” said Robert Malley, who served as Obama’s Iran adviser and has informally advised Biden’s team. But Trump officials counter that they are actually doing Biden a favor by putting Iran under so much economic duress that it will have no choice but to return to negotiations. “No, no, no, no,” Elliott Abrams, Trump’s envoy on Iran and Venezuela, told Reuters when asked whether the purpose of stepped-up Iran sanctions was to box Biden in. “It strengthens their hand.” Moreover, he insisted sanctioning Iran and other adversaries represents a better option than the alternatives: “One is the use of military force. Another is give up, walk away.” TOUGHER ON HUMAN RIGHTS Biden will also face the question of what to do about sanctions on China, the world’s second-biggest economy. While Trump charged during the election campaign that Biden would sell out to Beijing, the president-elect has said he will take a tougher stand, especially on human rights. This will likely mean further sanctions over Hong Kong, China’s Xinjiang region and possibly Tibet, the person close to Biden’s transition team said. But one Biden adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested that the sanctions threat could also be used to help pressure China to resolve trade disputes. Among Biden’s challenges with North Korea will be to clear up confusion over Trump’s policy and shore up sanctions enforcement aimed at compelling it to give up nuclear weapons. Trump’s “bromance” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has undermined international sanctions pressure, experts say, although Pyongyang remains economically debilitated by restrictions on access to the global financial and trade system. Biden has branded Kim a “thug,” and advisers predict a sterner approach. Biden has also signaled possible sanctions on Russia over election meddling, and the newly exposed breach of federal agencies’ computers could give further impetus. He could act, as well, on an issue Trump has been reluctant to tackle: intelligence assessments that Russia offered bounties to militants to kill U.S and allied soldiers in Afghanistan, two sources said. At home, Biden will face the challenge of repairing the government’s sanctions apparatus. Inter-agency collaboration has often been neglected amid Trump’s top-down, policymaking-by-tweet, according to people inside and outside his administration. This has sown frustration at the State and Treasury Departments, spurring departures of experienced staff. “People are overworked and getting burnt out,” said one former official of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. “So the hope is the process will change for the better.”

Topic: Security Region: Middle East Tags: IranJCPOATerrorismIsraelSaudi ArabiaBallistic Missiles Iran is one of the nations that is most likely to try to test Joe Biden’s resolve. Iran is one of the nations that is most likely to try to test Joe Biden’s resolve. It may exploit the confusion caused by the transition. For example, there was just a mysterious explosion of a Singapore-flagged oil tanker that was in port in Saudi Arabia, to which the media paid next to no attention. This is clearly the time to explore what the policy of the United States—and its allies—ought to be toward Iran. During his term, President Donald Trump quit the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but several other nations continued to uphold it. During the campaign, President-elect Joe Biden wrote that, under his administration, “[i]f Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations.” Since the election, Iran has indicated that it expects the Biden administration to rejoin the 2015 deal, which suggests that Iran itself is willing to return to full compliance in exchange for the lifting of U.S. sanctions. Critics point out several major defects of the JCPOA and warn against rejoining it. Hence, the focus of the media debate around foreign policy toward Iran is on whether to rejoin or not. However, even if the JCPOA is perfected and faithfully implemented, Iran will still pose a major threat to peace in the region and beyond. Currently, the JCPOA limits Iran’s nuclear developments for a few more years, until 2030, after which Iran will be free to have an industrial-scale nuclear program with no limitations on the number and type of centrifuges, nor on its stockpiling and development of fissile material. Let’s assume that Iran would somehow agree to extend those restrictions for another twenty years. Currently, the deal does not require Iran to submit to “anytime, anywhere” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of all its facilities. While inspectors can monitor known nuclear sites, they must ask Iran for access to other sites, “including military sites where there is suspected nuclear activity.” Iran can negotiate with the inspectors for fourteen days after a request. If the parties do not reach an agreement, the joint commission has a week to negotiate, and, if the final deal includes inspector access, Iran still has another three days before it has to allow the inspectors to enter the site. Let’s assume that Iran agrees to allow all of its facilities to be inspected all the time, including immediately following inspectors’ requests. According to IAEA, as of last month, Iran had over eight times the maximum amount of enriched uranium allowed under the terms of the JCPOA. Let’s assume that Iran agrees to roll back the advances it made in the last two years, in violation of the deal. The current U.S. sanctions hurt Iran badly and, once they are lifted, they are very difficult to reinstate. Nevertheless, Iran insists that all sanctions must first be lifted before it will comply again with the deal. In other words, Iran demands to get the ice cream before it takes the medicine. Let’s assume that Iran will give up even on this requirement. Even if all of the assumptions listed above hold true, a possibility that requires a very considerable suspension of disbelief, Iran would still pose a major threat due to other concerns. Most importantly, Iran is in violation of a UN resolution that “called upon” Iran to desist from its effort to create ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear weapons. The United States, France, and Britain claim that Iran’s ballistic missile launches violate the terms of the resolution, while Iran argues that these missiles are not equipped to hold nuclear weapons. Moreover, at issue are not merely nuclear-tipped missiles. There is no better way to highlight the danger that Iran’s non-nuclear missiles, which are not covered by the JCPOA, pose than to offer a reminder of what happened last year. Iran’s missiles struck Saudi Arabia at Abqaiq and Khurais, crucial petroleum processing sites and oil fields, on September 14, 2019. The attack and the resulting fires eliminated 5.7 million barrels of oil per day from the global market, nearly half of Saudi Arabia’s output. The kingdom was caught completely unaware. The expensive U.S.-made surface-to-air missiles that Saudi Arabia has purchased were powerless. The missiles (and drones) used in the attack were too low-flying to appear on the radar. The attackers were able to specifically target their strike, hitting valuable, difficult-to-replace equipment and flammable storage tanks. Reports by U.S. analysts “describe the attack as a kind of wake-up call: evidence of a vastly improved arsenal of high-precision missiles that Iran has quietly developed and shared with allies over the past decade,” according to the Washington Post. (Hezbollah has been one ally on the receiving end of this technology, and Iran has been building factories to ramp up its capability to provide such supplies in Syria and possibly in Lebanon.) Robert McNally, who was a national security adviser to President George W. Bush, said, “This attack was about Iran demonstrating that it has the means and will to execute exquisitely precise attacks on the most vital oil infrastructure in the world by far. And they can come back next Tuesday or a week from Friday – they can do this again.” In a recent New York Times column, Thomas L. Friedman writes about the significance of the attack, explaining that Israeli military analysts are correct to call “this surprise attack…the Middle East’s ‘Pearl Harbor.’” The fact that the U.S. response was deliberately mild further affirms these concerns. In short, we need a rather different deal, one that does not merely remedy the several serious defects the current one has, but that also governs ballistic missiles and precision-guided munitions—and a commitment from Iran to stop supporting terrorism.

News article:
Amid the pandemic, some US Congressmen already appear to be spending their political capital on one thing: Appeasing the Iranian regime and pushing for a softer policy towards the mullahs. More than 100 Congressmen recently signed a letter expressing their support and urging presumptive President-Elect Joe Biden to rejoin the nuclear deal, which, incidentally, Iran never signed. Entering the nuclear deal again would lift sanctions against the Iranian regime. The letter, led by Reps Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), David Price (D-N.C.); Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), and Abigail Spanberger (D-VA.), read: “We are united in our support for swiftly taking the necessary diplomatic steps” in order to “return both Iran and the United States to compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as a starting point for further negotiations.” Biden, as he pointed out in an opinion piece for CNN, also appears to be on board with the lawmakers to appease the mullahs: “I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy. If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations. With our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal’s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern.” This means that as sanctions will be lifted against the Iranian regime, the ruling clerics will ensure the survival of their theocratic establishment and militia groups across the Middle East. That is why the Iranian leaders are excited. Tehran is also confident that the next US administration will rejoin the nuclear deal; Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani recently said that he had “no doubt” about a pending return to the status quo under Joe Biden’s administration. Have these lawmakers and Biden learned nothing from recent history? Some may argue that Iran’s mullahs would change their destructive behavior if they were rewarded in advance with appeasement policies and financial incentives. This argument, however, has been proven to be breathtakingly wrong. There was an opportunity to initiate and expand peaceful policies during the eight-year administration of President Barack Obama. Throughout this time, Obama made unprecedented concessions in an attempt to appease the ruling mullahs. He met them with generosity and flexibility every step of the way. What was the outcome? As sanctions against Iran were lifted during the Obama administration, it quickly became clear that those actions, instead of moderating the malign activity of the mullahs, gave Iran an unmerited global legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. These gifts from the US — the newfound legitimacy, the billions in cash and the lifting of sanctions — generated even more billions in revenue for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), as well as for Iran’s militias and terror groups. Tehran also used that influx of revenues to expand its influence throughout the region, including in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon — and as far away as Venezuela. Iran apparently sees Venezuela as its “beachhead for diplomatic and commercial expansion into Latin America,” including “underground ‘missile cities’” along the Gulf coast. Iran’s expansion campaign has proved to be immensely successful. These lawmakers, who are pushing for a softer policy towards the mullahs, do not seem even slightly concerned about Iran’s role as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, a threat far more immediate and closer to home, as its agents or proxies could strike virtually anywhere in the world, at any time. These lawmakers are emboldening and empowering a regime that does not hesitate to kill American citizens, whether 241 marines in Beirut in 1983; 17 killed and 39 injured when an Iranian vessel attacked the USS Cole, or on 9/11, nearly 3,000 killed. Recently, Iran’s leadership attacked the US Embassy in Iraq. “Our embassy in Baghdad got hit Sunday by several rockets,” tweeted President Donald J. Trump. “Three rockets failed to launch. Guess where they were from: IRAN. Now we hear chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq.” Trump rightfully warned the Tehran regime: “Some friendly health advice to Iran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over”. These lawmakers also do not seem even slightly concerned about the Iranian regime repeatedly calling for annihilating its UN member state, Israel — a threat that should compel Iran’s removal from the UN: “….Article 2 (4) of the Charter states that all Members of the United Nations shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made Iran’s intentions clear while meeting with students in May 2019. “You young people,” he said, “should be assured that you will witness the demise of the enemies of humanity, meaning the degenerate American civilization, and the demise of Israel”. The Deputy Commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, on Iran’s Channel 2 TV, also announced that Israel is “vulnerable and bringing itself closer to death”. Salami made the strategy of the Iranian government unmistakably clear by stating: “Our strategy is to erase Israel from the global political map. And, it seems that, considering the evil that Israel is doing, it is bringing itself closer to that.” It is unfortunate that the priority of these lawmakers does not seem to concern advancing the interests of American people or the West, but instead appeasing the mullahs of Iran — who do not stop killing Americans, chanting “Death to America” and calling for annihilation of Israel.

He served in the Soviet Union as an inspector implementing the INF Treaty, in General Schwarzkopf’s staff during the Gulf War, and from 1991-1998 as a UN weapons inspector. Scott Ritter is a former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and author of 'Disarmament in the Time of Perestroika: Arms Control and the End of the Soviet Union.' He served in the Soviet Union as an inspector implementing the INF Treaty, in General Schwarzkopf’s staff during the Gulf War, and from 1991-1998 as a UN weapons inspector. In a series of aggressive moves designed to assert its position both regionally and regarding the JCPOA, the Islamic Republic is making it clear that it won’t be intimidated by the US, regardless of who is in the White House. Iranian domestic politics have supercharged the nation’s diplomatic posture as it awaits the transfer of power in the United States from President Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Emotions inside Iran, already inflamed by the assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani by the US a year ago, boiled over following a second assassination of a prominent Iranian figure, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, on November 27, 2020. The murder of Fakhrizadeh, a nuclear scientist with connections to the nuclear program, was believed to have been orchestrated by Israel. Prior to Fakhrizadeh’s killing, the Iranian government seemed content with waiting out the final months of the Trump presidency free of controversy that could lead to a confrontation with the US or its regional allies. His death dramatically changed that. Also on rt.com Caitlin Johnstone: Americans fixate on America, as their gazes are manipulated away from where their leaders carry out atrocities Following elections in February 2020, the Iranian Parliament came under the control of hardline conservatives opposed to the moderate policies of President Hassan Rouhani. It quickly passed a bill which would terminate the last two remaining commitments under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). These commitments – enhanced inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and a moratorium on enriching uranium beyond 3.5 percent – were all that remained of the sweeping restrictions mandated under the JCPOA. In May 2019, one year after President Trump’s precipitous withdrawal from the deal and the resulting reimposition of stringent economic sanctions, Iran began exercising its rights under Article 36 of that agreement to curtail its commitments considering the demonstrable non-compliance by the EU, a party to the JCPOA, to abide by its obligations to actively promote trade between Europe and Iran. Instead, the EU buckled under the threat of US secondary sanctions, curtailing rather than expanding economic ties with Iran. President Rouhani initially called the actions of the Iranian Parliament “harmful for the trend of diplomatic activities”, and voiced his objection. The law, known as the ‘Strategic Action to Lift Embargoes’, was initially rejected by the Guardian Council, a panel whose job it is to rule on the constitutionality of parliamentary actions, on the grounds that it usurped the authority of the Supreme National Security Council, which Rouhani chairs. However, the Council itself later found that the law did not “create a specific issue that damages national interests,” forcing Rouhani’s hand. On December 29, 2020, the Iranian president signed the law into effect. Also on rt.com China plays the peacemaker, urging ‘calm’ and ‘restraint’ following Iran’s uranium enrichment announcement As implemented, it required the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization to submit a plan which addressed the technical and financial requirements of the law within two months (i.e., by the end of February), buying Rouhani some time to see if a Biden administration was serious about rejoining the JCPOA without preconditions. Diplomacy, however, does not take place in a vacuum. The US, which had placed its forces on high alert in the aftermath of the Fakhrizadeh assassination, undertook a number of aggressive deployments it claimed were intended to deter any effort by Iran to exploit the political transition of power from Trump to Biden. On December 21, the USS Georgia, a nuclear-powered guided missile submarine armed with up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, entered the Persian Gulf, accompanied by two missile-armed cruisers, the USS Port Royal and USS Philippine Sea. On December 30, a pair of B-52s were flown from bases in the US to the Persian Gulf in a demonstration of America’s global reach – the third such exercise in two months. These forces join several US Air Force fighter squadrons currently stationed at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, and Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The USS Nimitz, a nuclear power aircraft carrier, was likewise deployed in the region. Iran viewed the US deployments differently, though. Its foreign minister, Javad Zarif, claimed to have intelligence that the US was seeking to fabricate a pretext for war with the Islamic Republic in the waning days of the Trump administration. Zarif’s words were backed up by General Hossein Salami, the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, who declared that Iran had “no problem, concern or apprehension toward encountering any powers. We will give our final words to our enemies on the battlefield.” To reduce tensions with Iran, US Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller ordered the USS Nimitz to return to the US. The illusion of a reduction in regional tension quickly evaporated when, on the first anniversary of Qassem Soleimani’s assassination, Iran issued a “red notice” to Interpol, calling for the arrest of President Trump and 47 other American officials identified as playing a role in Soleimani’s death. The killing was ruled a violation of international law by Agnes Callamard, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in July 2020. The US responded by countermanding the order withdrawing the USS Nimitz, instead extending its stay in the region “[d]ue to the recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other US government officials,” Christopher Miller said. In what was apparently a coordinated move, Iran announced on January 4 that it was initiating the enrichment of uranium to 20 percent at its underground enrichment facility in Fordow, bringing to an end its commitment under the JCPOA to forgo such activity. This action was followed by the seizure of a Korean tanker, the MT Hankuk Chemi, in the Strait of Hormuz, on charges that it was in violation of environmental law by polluting the territorial waters of Iran – a charge the South Koreans deny. Also on rt.com Iran says it started enriching uranium to 20%, drifting further away from US-violated nuclear deal Both of these actions come as President-elect Joe Biden’s designated national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, declared that any return of the US to the JCPOA must be predicated on Iran’s ballistic missile programs “being on the table” in any follow-on negotiation if and when the US rejoins the JCPOA. Iran has repeatedly made it clear that its ballistic missile program, which provides Iran with a credible regional deterrent, was, is, and forever will be, non-negotiable. The Iranian actions are calculated to appease hard-line conservatives who had been calling for a decisive response to the assassination of Soleimani, while keeping the door open for diplomacy once a Biden administration takes over in Washington. The seizure of the South Korean tanker appears designed to pressure the Seoul government to pay Iran some $7 billion owed for oil delivered prior to the US embargo on the sale of Iranian oil taking effect. South Korea has held back making the payment, under pressure from the Trump administration. By pressuring Seoul, on the eve of Biden assuming power, Iran hopes for a rapid reversal of its current policy. Likewise, Iran has made it clear that its efforts to enrich uranium to 20 percent are reversible should the US return to the JCPOA. By making 20-percent enrichment a reality, Iran is sending a signal to the Biden administration that it will not tolerate any effort on the part of the US to attach new conditions to the Iran nuclear agreement. Also on rt.com UK, France and Germany urge Iran to stop uranium enrichment program ‘without delay’ as Tehran ups the stakes Iran’s actions are an indication that President Rouhani has lost the domestic political fight on how diplomacy will be conducted going forward. Previously, Iran’s actions were measured and sought to avoid decisive confrontation with the West over its nuclear program. No more – the acceleration of Iran’s enrichment of uranium to 20 percent, combined with the seizure of the South Korean tanker, are a clear signal that the conservatives are a factor in Iranian foreign policy that cannot be ignored. The clock is not in Joe Biden’s favor, either – the window of opportunity for an agreement with Iran on a US return to the JCPOA closes in June 2021, when Rouhani, a moderate, will almost certainly be replaced by a conservative whose policies are aligned with those who already control the Iranian Parliament.

News article:
Tensions are brewing between Washington and Tehran like never before as Donald Trump’s presidency winds down with less than three weeks remaining before Joe Biden is sown in. The US has warned Iran against carrying out attacks against its troops and interests in the region, as Iran and its proxies mark the first anniversary of the assassination of Iran’s top general Qassem Soliemani near Baghdad airport. On Sunday acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller instructed the USS Nimitz to remain in the Gulf in reaction to Iranian threats. Last week, the US dispatched additional B-52 strategic bombers to the region as a warning to Tehran. And on Saturday Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran had new intelligence from Iraqi sources showing that “Israeli agent-provocateurs” were staging attacks on US targets, laying a “trap” for President Trump to start a conflict that could damage Biden’s plans to salvage the 2015 nuclear accord. While Iranian leaders had threatened to avenge the death of Soliemani, it is inconceivable that they would risk provoking the Trump administration a few weeks before Biden’s inauguration. Iraq fears that rogue pro-Iran militias could launch an attack on the US embassy in Baghdad or military bases where US soldiers are deployed. The Iraqi government had increased security around the Green Zone and sent messages to Tehran asking it to keep its proxies under control. Restraint and patience are now Tehran’s key strategies although the possibility of an incident taking place where US interests are threatened remains high. Even more worrying is Iran’s plans to increase its uranium enrichment capacity to 20 percent purity, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA said earlier this week that Iran plans to substantially increase enrichment levels at its underground Fordow nuclear site in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal. Following Trump’s 2018 decision to withdraw from the deal, Tehran resumed enrichment but at a low 4.5 per cent rate. The move is believed to put pressure on the Europeans and the incoming Biden administration to speed up re-engagement on the nuclear deal. Tehran hopes that the new US administration will rejoin the deal and lift biting US economic sanctions. But that would be a gross miscalculation. While Trump’s actions against Tehran have failed to pressure it into renegotiating a new deal, they did underline the need to review Iran’s medium and long range missile program as well as its meddling in the internal affairs of neighboring countries. Much has changed since 2015 and it would be wrong to assume that Biden would rejoin the nuclear agreement unconditionally. Biden would have the support of key European partners, like France, in seeking to expand the scope of the agreement. President Hassan Rouhani and Zarif have repeatedly rejected any suggestion to negotiate a new deal. While Israel continues to reject the nuclear agreement and is seeking to ban Iran from any nuclear activity, the reality is that Tehran’s nuclear program needs to be checked and restrained. But that is only one side of the region’s problem with Tehran. Iran has supplied its proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen with missile capabilities. Iran has been directly accused of carrying out missile attacks against targets in Saudi Arabia. Iran’s missile programme is a strategic threat to the region’s security and stability. In the midst of threats exchange this week, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards’ Corp Aerospace Force stated that the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has given the green light for Tehran-backed proxies in Lebanon and Gaza Strip to level two of Israel’s three largest cities. “All the missile capabilities of Gaza and Lebanon have been supported by Iran, and they are the front line for confrontation,” he added. This irresponsible statement has angered the Lebanese public and deepened the chasm between Lebanon’s key political players and Hizbollah. So brazen was the statement that it prompted Hizbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, to declare that Iran “doesn’t need help” from its allies and will take revenge “when it decides so”, adding that Tehran will not ask any other country or body to conduct a retaliatory strike on its behalf. Iran cannot expect to have the sanctions lifted and to be treated like a normal country when it is creating havoc in Iraq, meddling in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Syria and backing a terror group in Yemen. The nuclear deal is only part of a bigger problem that the region has with a belligerent Iran. Any new agreement must check Iran’s missile capabilities as well as retrain its proxies across the region. Biden must listen to America’s allies and send a stern message to Iranian leaders that it will not be rewarded for its disruptive policies.

News article:
Tensions are brewing between Washington and Tehran like never before as Donald Trump’s presidency winds down with less than three weeks remaining before Joe Biden is sown in. The US has warned Iran against carrying out attacks against its troops and interests in the region, as Iran and its proxies mark the first anniversary of the assassination of Iran’s top general Qassem Soliemani near Baghdad airport. On Sunday acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller instructed the USS Nimitz to remain in the Gulf in reaction to Iranian threats. Last week, the US dispatched additional B-52 strategic bombers to the region as a warning to Tehran. And on Saturday Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran had new intelligence from Iraqi sources showing that “Israeli agent-provocateurs” were staging attacks on US targets, laying a “trap” for President Trump to start a conflict that could damage Biden’s plans to salvage the 2015 nuclear accord. While Iranian leaders had threatened to avenge the death of Soliemani, it is inconceivable that they would risk provoking the Trump administration a few weeks before Biden’s inauguration. Iraq fears that rogue pro-Iran militias could launch an attack on the US embassy in Baghdad or military bases where US soldiers are deployed. The Iraqi government had increased security around the Green Zone and sent messages to Tehran asking it to keep its proxies under control. Restraint and patience are now Tehran’s key strategies although the possibility of an incident taking place where US interests are threatened remains high. Even more worrying is Iran’s plans to increase its uranium enrichment capacity to 20 percent purity, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA said earlier this week that Iran plans to substantially increase enrichment levels at its underground Fordow nuclear site in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal. Following Trump’s 2018 decision to withdraw from the deal, Tehran resumed enrichment but at a low 4.5 per cent rate. The move is believed to put pressure on the Europeans and the incoming Biden administration to speed up re-engagement on the nuclear deal. Tehran hopes that the new US administration will rejoin the deal and lift biting US economic sanctions. But that would be a gross miscalculation.

News article:
President Trump’s administration expects Iran to avoid attacking Americans in the near future as the regime prepares for an expected negotiation with President-elect Joe Biden later this year. "Iran is trying to pile up chips for a negotiation with the Biden administration," a senior administration official told the Washington Examiner. “Of course, that’s our hope, that they recognize that they would be making a negotiation impossible, or extremely difficult, should they kill any Americans." The fallout from the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday has stoked unease that American adversaries might feel emboldened to strike at a moment of domestic chaos, but current and former Trump administration officials believe that the U.S. military and Tehran’s optimism about talks with Biden will combine to restrain them. “If Iran thought that what they're seeing meant they had an opportunity to do something, it would be a catastrophic mistake on their part,” said Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior adviser Richard Goldberg, the White House National Security Council’s director countering Iran’s nuclear weapons program in 2019. “But also, it would be out of line with their current strategy, which appears to be escalating a crisis environment, so they are a high priority for sanctions relief — potentially when the Biden administration comes into office.” A tactical dance has unfolded between Trump’s team and Iranian officials in recent years, such as Tehran using proxy forces to threaten U.S. personnel in Iraq, while the United States raises the daunting specter of retaliation if any Americans die as a result of Iranian aggression. That process continued with a pair of provocations from Iran: the seizure of a South Korean oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and a vote in Iran’s Parliament to begin enriching uranium up to 20%. "The message from the United States has been clear ... that we're prepared to deal with any attacks," the senior administration official said. "But obviously, the hope is that they will recognize that their strategic interest is not served by attacking us." The latest violation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal drew condemnation from European leaders, who aired their own misgivings that Tehran would preclude the restoration of the pact that Western European allies credit with defusing a nuclear crisis. “Such a move would jeopardize our shared efforts to preserve the JCPoA and risks compromising the important opportunity for a return to diplomacy with the incoming US Administration,” the governments of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom said Wednesday in a joint statement, using the official acronym for the deal. “A return to the JCPoA would also be beneficial for Iran.” The seizure of the oil tanker is a display of Iran’s financial fragility due to the sanctions imposed since Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal in 2018, according to Iran hawks. “This is both a chip, by holding the ship, but also a signal that what they need quickly from the new administration is access to frozen funds,” the senior administration official said. The targeting of a South Korean vessel makes the message even more specific, as roughly $7 billion in Iran money is reportedly frozen in South Korean banks. “They’re literally giving you the road map for the most immediate sanctions relief they're going to request for Biden ministration,” Goldberg concurred. That plan might help avoid a violent crisis in the Gulf, at a time when congressional leaders have aired greater doubts about Trump’s leadership than ever: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for instance, revealed that she spoke with Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about “available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike" in the waning days of this presidency. "The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy,” the California Democrat wrote in a letter to colleagues Friday. That message drew criticism from within the military. “It makes America look weak and weakness is provocative,” said a Defense Department official who advises nuclear commanders told Politico. "I don’t think what Pelosi is doing is helpful.” In any case, Iran hawks expect Tehran to stick with its current plan to try to induce Biden to provide a financial windfall. And while the Trump administration hemorrhages personnel due to internal anger over the president’s handling of the crisis at the Capitol, current and former officials trust that enough of his national security team will remain in place to send a clear message to Iran. “Given key national security figures involved in the defense of the United States and foreign policy are still in place,” Goldberg said, "there is no reason for enemies to believe that the political chaos would in any way disrupt our intelligence capabilities from detecting a threat, the process for reporting that threat through the chain-of-command quickly and alerting the president and key national security principals to decide on a response.”

News article:
Joe Biden’s pick for CIA director led the secretive “back channel” with the Iranian regime during the lead-up to the Iran nuclear deal, signaling the former vice president’s continued commitment to rejoining the controversial deal that the Trump administration left in 2018. William Burns, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, served as the U.S. ambassador to Jordan and to Russia, also working in a number of other key State Department posts, including deputy secretary of state from 2011 to 2014. A 2019 book by Burns, The Back Channel: A Memoir of American Diplomacy and the Case for Its Renewal, contained an entire chapter on “Iran and the Bomb: The Secret Talks.” The diplomat recounted President Barack Obama’s early efforts at outreach to Iran but admitted that “this halting momentum … came to an abrupt stop when the Iranian presidential elections in June turned into a bloodbath” as the Iranian regime suppressed Iran’s Green Movement opposition in 2009. He admitted that “the White House’s public response was initially tepid” and that “in hindsight, we should have … been sharper in our public criticism from the start.” Burns said that “Oman sent the new U.S. administration a series of low-key overtures about its readiness to establish a channel to Iran" for years, and when John Kerry took over from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after Obama won reelection in 2012, it was decided that Burns would “lead the American team” with future Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan as his “alter ego” to start secretly negotiating with the Iranians beginning in March 2013 in Oman. Burns said Obama convened meetings in February 2013 to hammer out their approach and that “in all my three decades in government, this was — along with the bin Laden raid in 2011 — the most tightly held effort.” Burns wrote of Obama that “secrecy would help prevent opponents in both capitals from smothering the initiative in its crib — but it would carry future costs, feeding stab-in-the-back criticisms from some of our closest partners, particularly the Israelis, Saudis, and Emiratis.” Burns said Obama stressed that he should “focus the back-channel talks on the nuclear issue” and recounted that the president “was convinced that we’d never get an agreement with the Iranians without some limited form of domestic enrichment.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced in 2018 that Israel had obtained thousands of “Iran’s secret nuclear files” that showed “new and conclusive proof of the secret nuclear weapons program that Iran has been hiding for years from the international community.” President Trump pointed to the revelations by Israel when he pulled the United States out of the deal in May 2018. “No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them … In theory, the so-called ‘Iran deal’ was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb ... In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout,” Trump said. “The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime’s nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world.” The book by Burns described secret meetings with the Iranians in Oman as well as back in the U.S., noting one at Waldorf and a series of rounds at a hotel in Manhattan away from the United Nations meetings. Burns said he believed that his two main Iranian counterparts, Abbas Ravanchi and Majid Takht Araghchi, “were professional diplomats, not ideologues.” He said the back channel soon fell into a regular pattern, “sometimes one-on-one and often Araghchi and Ravanchi with Jake and me, while our colleagues would get into more detail on the limitations and verification measures we had in mind, and the sanctions relief at the front of the Iranians’ mind.” “It was hard to imagine when we embarked on that first secret flight to Oman in early 2013 that diplomacy could resolve the Iranian nuclear issue,” Burns wrote, adding, “we couldn’t neatly erase by military or diplomatic means Iran’s basic know-how about enrichment. What we could do was to sharply constrain it over a long duration, monitor it with unprecedented intrusiveness, and prevent its leadership from building a bomb." Burns wrote that “Trump’s demolition of the Iran deal was a further blow to our own credibility.” Biden said Monday that “Bill Burns is an exemplary diplomat with decades of experience on the world stage keeping our people and our country safe and secure." Burns noted “familiar threats” such as terrorism and nuclear proliferation while calling climate change and global health security “increasingly powerful challenges” in a short Monday video. Iran received an influx of billions in cash as a result of the Iran nuclear deal. The U.S. flew a jet carrying $400 million in euros and Swiss francs to Tehran in January 2016 as an apparent ransom payment as Iran released four U.S. hostages, and the U.S. provided another $1.3 billion in cash to the Iranian regime, allegedly to settle outstanding claims. The Iran deal also released up to $150 billion in frozen Iranian assets, and the lifting of international sanctions also provided Iran with hundreds of billions in relief. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was reached between the “P5+1” (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.), the European Union, and Iran in June 2015. Burns wrote that “the IAEA and the U.S. intelligence community repeatedly affirmed Iranian compliance,” but he acknowledged that “Iran continued to export instability across the Middle East, exploiting and accelerating chaos in Syria and Yemen." He also admitted that “we could have done a better job ... of confronting the wider challenge of Iran in the Middle East." Critics of the deal have said it did not properly restrain Iran's nuclear aspirations or address the regime's funding of terrorism. When the Senate voted on the Iran deal in September 2015, it was 58-42 in opposition, including Democrats such as Sens. Chuck Schumer, Bob Menendez, Ben Cardin, and Joe Manchin, but the Obama administration implemented it nevertheless. Biden reaffirmed his determination to rejoin the Iran deal in December, telling the New York Times that “there’s a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilizing the region” but that “the best way to achieve getting some stability in the region” is to deal “with the nuclear program,” and so “in consultation with our allies and partners, we’re going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran’s nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile program.” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in December that “we will not renegotiate a deal which we negotiated.” Iran said it resumed its 20% uranium enrichment earlier this month, and Iran’s Parliament passed a law late last year vowing to block International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of nuclear sites starting a month after Biden’s inauguration if U.S. sanctions aren’t lifted. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this weekend that “the Iranian regime is using its nuclear program to extort the international community and threaten regional security."

Joe Biden’s pick for CIA director led the secretive “back channel” with the Iranian regime during the lead-up to the Iran nuclear deal, signaling the former vice president’s continued commitment to rejoining the controversial deal that the Trump administration left in 2018.

KEY POINTS Iran aims to enrich uranium to 20%, well beyond the level outlined in the JCPOA Biden’s first goal is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon Iran is tentatively scheduled to hold presidential elections in June Iran and the U.S. could be on a collision course over the former's nuclear ambitions, leaving President-elect Joe Biden with delicate work to do during his first days in office. Conservative leaders in the Iranian parliament are calling to enrich uranium to 20%, far greater than the permissible level outlined in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the U.N.-backed nuclear agreement abandoned by President Donald Trump in 2018. Anne Harrington, a specialist in nuclear proliferation issues at Cardiff University in Wales, told CNBC on Tuesday that Iran’s intentions are meant to pressure the incoming Biden administration into rejoining the JCPOA rather than renegotiating its terms. “The fact that the more hawkish Iranian parliament is able to push through a law mandating that Iran expand its nuclear program on multiple fronts is worrying,” she said. “At its worst, this strategy could exacerbate tensions and result in a dangerous game of chicken.” Iranian presidential elections are tentatively scheduled for June. That gives Biden only a few short months to work with outgoing Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is viewed as generally less hostile to the West relative to the more conservative members of parliament. By entering the JCPOA in 2016, Iran agreed to step back its uranium enrichment program from 20% to around 3.7%. Weapons-grade enrichment is closer to 90%, though anything above 4% is considered a breakthrough level toward developing a nuclear bomb. In an op-ed published by CNN in November, Biden said his first priority as president would be to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. “If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations,” he wrote. On Tuesday, Ali Rabiei, a spokesperson for Rouhani, said renegotiating the agreement “is out of the question,” Iranian broadcaster Press TV reported. Early opposition to the agreement came from Republicans, who argued during the negotiation period that it left Iran free to enrich small amounts of uranium and was lax on the inspection of Iranian military sites. Trump spent much of his tenure advancing a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, seeking to force Tehran’s hand by enacting sanctions against the Islamic republic at a dizzying pace. U.S. military forces assassinated a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, while he was visiting Iraq in early 2020. Iran, for its part, has tried to show resilience while at the same time threatening shipping lanes in the busy Strait of Hormuz. Last week, Iran's president used his official website to call Trump an “unhealthy person" one day after protestors stormed the Capitol building in Washington D.C. Sanam Vakil, the deputy head of the Middle East program at London think tank Chatham House, told CNBC the different policies over reentering or renegotiation put both sides between a rock and a hard place. For Iran, it wants to avoid returning to the agreement too quickly. For Biden, “the optics are quite difficult to justify giving in to the Islamic Republic and giving in to pressure tactics, particularly in light of the past criticism of the deal,” he said.

Iran, for its part, has tried to show resilience while at the same time threatening shipping lanes in the busy Strait of Hormuz. Last week, Iran's president used his official website to call Trump an “unhealthy person" one day after protestors stormed the Capitol building in Washington D.C. Sanam Vakil, the deputy head of the Middle East program at London think tank Chatham House, told CNBC the different policies over reentering or renegotiation put both sides between a rock and a hard place. For Iran, it wants to avoid returning to the agreement too quickly. For Biden, “the optics are quite difficult to justify giving in to the Islamic Republic and giving in to pressure tactics, particularly in light of the past criticism of the deal,” he said.

News article:
Brussels: The EU said Monday it looks forward to working soon with US President-elect Joe Biden on resurrecting the Iran nuclear deal, and rejected Tehran's accusations it had aligned with Washington's sanctions. "We welcome President-elect Biden's positive statements on the JCPOA, and look forward to working with the incoming US administration," European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement on behalf of the bloc, using the official initials for the deal. The EU supported "intensive diplomacy with the goal of facilitating a US return to the JCPOA and Iran's return to full JCPOA implementation," he said. Biden, who takes office on January 20, has suggested the United States return to the Iran deal, which it withdrew from in 2018 under President Donald Trump, who reinstated and increased US sanctions. Iran from 2019 has increasingly breached its own commitments under the deal, arguing it had the right to do so under its terms because the US was no longer abiding by it. Most problematically, last week it started again enriching uranium to 20 percent, a step just below what is needed to produce material for nuclear weapons. It has also accused the European signatories - EU members France and Germany and former EU member Britain - of going along with the US sanctions, even as their governments defied Trump to keep the deal alive. Borrell rejected that, saying that "the EU has upheld its JCPOA commitments, including regarding sanctions," adding: "Despite the severe challenges to the JCPOA, the EU has continued to work hard to preserve it." The EU warned Tehran, however, that its 20 percent enrichment was "a very serious development" with "potentially severe proliferation implications". "We urge Iran to refrain from further escalation and reverse this course of action without delay. Continued full and timely cooperation with the (UN nuclear watchdog) IAEA remains critical," the statement said. In a likely sign of Biden's intention to quickly address the Iran nuclear deal, the US president-elect on Monday tapped William Burns, a retired diplomat, to be his CIA chief.

News article:
Tensions are brewing between Washington and Tehran like never before as Donald Trump’s presidency winds down with less than three weeks remaining before Joe Biden is sown in. The US has warned Iran against carrying out attacks against its troops and interests in the region as Iran and its proxies mark the first anniversary of the assassination of Iran’s top general Qassem Soliemani near Baghdad airport. On Sunday acting Secretary of Defence Christopher Miller instructed the USS Nimitz to remain in the Gulf in reaction to Iranian threats. Last week, the US dispatched additional B-52 strategic bombers to the region as a warning to Tehran. And on Saturday Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran had new intelligence from Iraqi sources showing that “Israeli agent-provocateurs” were staging attacks on US targets, laying a “trap” for President Trump to start a conflict that could damage Biden’s plans to salvage the 2015 nuclear accord. While Iranian leaders had threatened to avenge the death of Soliemani, it is inconceivable that they would risk provoking the Trump administration a few weeks before Biden’s inauguration. Iraq fears that rogue pro-Iran militias could launch an attack on the US embassy in Baghdad or military bases where US soldiers are deployed. The Iraqi government had increased security around the Green Zone and sent messages to Tehran asking it to keep its proxies under control. Restraint and patience are now Tehran’s key strategies although the possibility of an incident taking place where US interests are threatened remains high. Even more worrying is Iran’s plans to increase its uranium enrichment capacity to 20 per cent purity, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA said earlier this week that Iran plans to substantially increase enrichment levels at its underground Fordow nuclear site in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal. Following Trump’s 2018 decision to withdraw from the deal, Tehran resumed enrichment but at a low 4.5 per cent rate. The move is believed to put pressure on the Europeans and the incoming Biden administration to speed up re-engagement on the nuclear deal. Tehran hopes that the new US administration will rejoin the deal and lift biting US economic sanctions. But that would be a gross miscalculation. While Trump’s actions against Tehran have failed to pressure it into renegotiating a new deal, they did underline the need to review Iran’s medium and long range missile program as well as its meddling in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries. Much has changed since 2015 and it would be wrong to assume that Biden would rejoin the nuclear agreement unconditionally. Biden would have the support of key European partners, like France, in seeking to expand the scope of the agreement. President Hassan Rouhani and Zarif have repeatedly rejected any suggestion to negotiate a new deal. While Israel continues to reject the nuclear agreement and is seeking to ban Iran from any nuclear activity, the reality is that Tehran’s nuclear program needs to be checked and restrained. But that is only one side of the region’s problem with Tehran. Iran has supplied its proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen with missile capabilities. Iran has been directly accused of carrying out missile attacks against targets in Saudi Arabia. Iran’s missile programme is a strategic threat to the region’s security and stability. In the midst of threats exchange this week, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards’ Corp (IRGC) Aerospace Force stated that the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has given the green light for Tehran-backed proxies in Lebanon and Gaza Strip to level two of Israel’s three largest cities. “All the missile capabilities of Gaza and Lebanon have been supported by Iran, and they are the front line for confrontation,” he added. This irresponsible statement has angered the Lebanese public and deepened the chasm between Lebanon’s key political players and Hizbollah. So brazen was the statement that it prompted Hizbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, to declare that Iran “doesn’t need help” from its allies and will take revenge “when it decides so”, adding that Tehran will not ask any other country or body to conduct a retaliatory strike on its behalf. Iran cannot expect to have the sanctions lifted and to be treated like a normal country when it is creating havoc in Iraq, meddling in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Syria and backing a terror group in Yemen. The nuclear deal is only part of a bigger problem that the region has with a belligerent Iran. Any new agreement must check Iran’s missile capabilities as well as retrain its proxies across the region. Biden must listen to America’s allies and send a stern message to Iranian leaders that it will not be rewarded for its disruptive policies.

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Americas Tags: Joe BidenIranSecurityIRGCMaximum Pressure Biden needs to make clear on day one that any Iranian attempt to avenge Soleimani and Fakhrizadeh by targeting Trump administration veterans or, indeed, any American will be a casus belli. On April 13, 1993, shortly after leaving office, President George H.W. Bush traveled to Kuwait in order to celebrate that country’s liberation from Iraqi occupation. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, still smarting from defeat in the 100-hour ground war, saw an opportunity for revenge. The Iraqi plot allegedly involved using a car bomb to assassinate Bush. Fortunately, Kuwaiti security found the bomb and, the day before Bush’s arrival, arrested seventeen plotters. Forensic examination of the bomb’s circuity showed the Iraqi connection and so, on June 26, 1993, President Bill Clinton ordered a Tomahawk missile strike on Iraq’s intelligence headquarters. Biden’s team may want a different relationship with the Tehran, but the president-elect may nevertheless face a similar scenario. When Biden enters office, his team will roll back if not end the “maximum pressure” campaign. This would be a mistake—one based on Biden’s belief in an imaginary Iran in which the so-called reformists both do not share core regime ideology and exert meaningful control over the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and intelligence services—but elections matter and Biden won. While Biden and other Obama administration veterans may believe that Tehran shares their desire for détente if not reconciliation, important elements within the Iranian regime believe otherwise. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have taken the hardest line on Iran since Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher oversaw multiple executive orders tightening sanctions on Iran and plugging extraterritorial loopholes. Certainly, Biden’s team will want to loosen “maximum pressure” sanctions if only to give some incentive for the Iranians to return to the negotiating table. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, however, has already made clear that the lifting of all sanctions is a precondition to returning to the table. Of greater concern, however, should be Iran’s continued insistence on avenging the deaths of Qods Force chief Qassem Soleimani and chief nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Just a day before the first anniversary of Soleimani’s death, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps chief Hassan Salami told Guardsmen, “Any action taken by the enemy against us will be responded with a reciprocal, decisive, and firm blow.” It is a threat that Biden’s team should not ignore. Iranian officials have repeatedly promised revenge for the death of Soleimani and Fakhrizadeh. While some pundits and politicians worried at the time of the strike on Soleimani that war could be on the horizon, Tehran knows that would be suicidal: the last time the Iranian military sought to confront the United States directly, they lost their navy and much of their air force. Rather, it is likely Iranian officials could try a more personal response against Pompeo and those most closely involved with constructing his Iran policy or those it deems involved in the death of Soleimani and Fakhrizadeh. It would not be the first time the Islamic Republic has turned to assassination. The Carter administration did not sever diplomatic relations with Iran due to the seizure of the American embassy in Tehran: Carter hoped keeping the Iranian embassy in Washington open could facilitate diplomacy. Rather, he shuttered Iran’s Massachusetts Avenue embassy after it helped direct the assassination of an Iranian dissident in Bethesda, Maryland. Nine months after the USS Vincennes accidently shot down an Iranian civilian airliner, a pipe bomb blew up a minivan driven by Sharon Rogers, the wife of the Vincennes’ captain; that case remains unsolved. The New Haven-based Iran Human Rights Documentation Center has documented many other Iranian assassinations in both Europe and the Middle East. Over the last decade and, especially in recent years, Iranian authorities have re-embraced the tactic with enthusiasm. That the Biden administration, having embraced the calumny that tightened visa restrictions were a “Muslim ban” may make any Iranian retaliation easier although Iranian authorities just as often pay Lebanese and others to do their dirty work. Iranian authorities may also misjudge the rancor of the U.S. political debate and believe that both progressive animosity toward Trump administration veterans and moral equivalence would temper a Democratic administration’s reaction. Former presidents and their spouses get lifelong secret service protection, but cabinet secretaries and their aides do not. Biden, however, should consider making an exception for those whom Iran has placed in its crosshairs. Even if Biden, Secretary of State-select Tony Blinken, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wish to believe that diplomacy can tip the power inside Tehran toward reform, they must recognize that Iranian security forces act autonomously from elected political officials. They need to make clear on day one that any Iranian attempt to avenge Soleimani and Fakhrizadeh by targeting Trump administration veterans or, indeed, any American will be a casus belli. And, lest the Iranian government not fully understand American seriousness or have any control over the Revolutionary Guards and intelligence service, they must take proactive steps to protect Pompeo and his Iran team.

Iran regime ups pressure on Biden to return to nuclear deal Dr. Majid Rafizadeh President Hassan Rouhani, right, and Atomic Energy Organization chief Ali Akbar Salehi in the control room of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. (AFP) Short Url https://arab.news/pj46s The Iranian regime has started its campaign to rush the incoming Biden administration into immediately rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. However, the strategy the Iranian leaders are employing is not anchored in diplomacy; instead it is based on issuing threats, fear-mongering tactics, and the ratcheting up of military adventurism in the region. For instance, the theocratic establishment last week began enriching uranium to 20 percent purity at the underground Fordow nuclear facility, meaning it is now just a short technical step away from weapons-grade level. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is also playing its part. It last week seized a South Korean-flagged ship, which it claimed was carrying thousands of tons of ethanol, in the Gulf. This alarmed the US State Department, with a spokesperson noting: “The regime continues to threaten navigational rights and freedoms in the Gulf as part of a clear attempt to extort the international community into relieving the pressure of sanctions. We join the Republic of Korea’s call for Iran to immediately release the tanker.” In addition, the Iranian parliament in November passed a law that requires the government to expel all International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from the country if US sanctions are not lifted by Feb. 21. These tactics are aimed at giving the regime more leverage ahead of the start of negotiations with the Biden administration, as well as the means to obtain more concessions and greater appeasement from the next US president. Tehran even wants compensation for the economic losses it has suffered since President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear deal in 2018. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in 2019: “If you wish more, if you require more, you should give and pay more.” The regime even came up with a figure, with the judiciary demanding the US pays $130 billion in damages. In September last year, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told a forum organized by New York’s Council on Foreign Relations: “Compensate us for our losses.” He added: “A sign of good faith is not to try to renegotiate what has already been negotiated.” The Iranian leaders used the same threatening tactics ahead of the signing of the nuclear deal in 2015. The Obama administration’s negotiating team gave unprecedented concessions to the regime, including the deal’s sunset clauses, which set an expiration date for the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, and exempting Iran’s military sites from being inspected by the IAEA. Military sites are the most likely locations where Iran advances its nuclear program, with satellite images recently indicating that new facilities are being built near the fortified Fordow site. While the regime has made no public statement about the work, it previously acknowledged similar defensive construction at the Natanz nuclear facility. Meanwhile, the main coalition of Iranian opposition groups, known as the National Council of Resistance of Iran, in October announced the discovery of a secret new military facility east of Tehran. The group claimed the site was controlled by the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, which is primarily responsible for weaponizing Iran’s nuclear program. Its tactics are aimed at gaining leverage ahead of the start of negotiations with the Biden administration. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh The regime’s heightened threats and warnings betray the fact that Tehran is desperate to re-enter the nuclear deal and have all sanctions lifted. It is anticipating that President-elect Joe Biden will adopt a softer policy than his predecessor after he stated in a September op-ed for CNN: “I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy. If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations. With our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal’s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern.” However, the Iranian leaders want more than just the US re-entering the 2015 nuclear deal. The Iranian regime is using its nuclear program to extort other governments, particularly by escalating its threats and nuclear violations in order to rush Biden into rejoining the nuclear deal and to get more concessions from his administration.

We join the Republic of Korea’s call for Iran to immediately release the tanker.” In addition, the Iranian parliament in November passed a law that requires the government to expel all International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from the country if US sanctions are not lifted by Feb. 21. These tactics are aimed at giving the regime more leverage ahead of the start of negotiations with the Biden administration, as well as the means to obtain more concessions and greater appeasement from the next US president. Tehran even wants compensation for the economic losses it has suffered since President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear deal in 2018. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in 2019: “If you wish more, if you require more, you should give and pay more.” The regime even came up with a figure, with the judiciary demanding the US pays $130 billion in damages. In September last year, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told a forum organized by New York’s Council on Foreign Relations: “Compensate us for our losses.” He added: “A sign of good faith is not to try to renegotiate what has already been negotiated.” The Iranian leaders used the same threatening tactics ahead of the signing of the nuclear deal in 2015. The Obama administration’s negotiating team gave unprecedented concessions to the regime, including the deal’s sunset clauses, which set an expiration date for the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, and exempting Iran’s military sites from being inspected by the IAEA. Military sites are the most likely locations where Iran advances its nuclear program, with satellite images recently indicating that new facilities are being built near the fortified Fordow site. While the regime has made no public statement about the work, it previously acknowledged similar defensive construction at the Natanz nuclear facility. Meanwhile, the main coalition of Iranian opposition groups, known as the National Council of Resistance of Iran, in October announced the discovery of a secret new military facility east of Tehran. The group claimed the site was controlled by the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, which is primarily responsible for weaponizing Iran’s nuclear program. Its tactics are aimed at gaining leverage ahead of the start of negotiations with the Biden administration. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh The regime’s heightened threats and warnings betray the fact that Tehran is desperate to re-enter the nuclear deal and have all sanctions lifted. It is anticipating that President-elect Joe Biden will adopt a softer policy than his predecessor after he stated in a September op-ed for CNN: “I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy. If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations. With our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal’s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern.” However, the Iranian leaders want more than just the US re-entering the 2015 nuclear deal. The Iranian regime is using its nuclear program to extort other governments, particularly by escalating its threats and nuclear violations in order to rush Biden into rejoining the nuclear deal and to get more concessions from his administration.

News article:
Officials in the incoming Biden administration have already begun holding quiet talks with Iran on a return to the 2015 nuclear deal, and have updated Israel on those conversations, Channel 12 News reported Saturday. The network gave no sourcing for the report, and no details on what was allegedly discussed. US President-elect Joe Biden has indicated his desire to return to the accord, while Israel is pushing for any return to the deal to include fresh limitations on Iran’s ballistic missile program and support for terror and destabilization around the world. On Wednesday, Walla News reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is assembling a team to strategize for the first talks with the Biden administration on Iran’s nuclear program. The team will include officials representing national security elements, the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Ministry, the military, the Mossad spy agency, and the Atomic Energy Commission, the report said, citing unnamed sources in the Prime Minister’s Office. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu is considering appointing a senior official to head the team and to serve as an envoy in talks with the US on the Iranian nuclear program, the report said. A possible candidate to head the team is Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, the report said. Channel 12 reported Saturday that Cohen was in Washington this week to meet with officials in the outgoing and incoming administrations. Advertisement US President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a more conciliatory approach to Iran than the Trump administration and has said that if Iran returns to the terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement, he too would rejoin, removing the crushing economic sanctions that have wreaked havoc on the Iranian economy over the past two years. The US president-elect has indicated that he wants to negotiate more broadly with Tehran if Washington returns to the deal, notably over its missiles and influence across the Middle East. Iran has said it could welcome the return of the Americans to the agreement, but only after they lift sanctions. It has rejected negotiation on other issues. Former US president Barack Obama, with Biden as his vice president, signed the Iran nuclear deal with world powers in 2015. The Trump administration withdrew from the accord in 2018 and pressured Iran with crippling economic sanctions and other measures. Obama signed the agreement despite fierce protest from Israel, and had a rocky relationship with Jerusalem and Netanyahu, while the premier and Trump have been in lockstep on most Middle East policy issues. The prospect of the US reengaging with Tehran has drawn warnings and alarm from Netanyahu and his allies. Last week, speaking alongside US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in Jerusalem, Netanyahu warned against the US rejoining the nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Advertisement “If we just go back to the JCPOA, what will happen and may already be happening is that many other countries in the Middle East will rush to arm themselves with nuclear weapons. That is a nightmare and that is folly. It should not happen,” Netanyahu said. Likud MK Tzachi Hanegbi said Wednesday the incoming US administration must not “appease” Iran, and warned Tehran the Jewish state will not tolerate its military presence in Syria or its development of nuclear weapons. In one of the most forceful statements recently made by an Israeli official, Hanegbi, considered an ally of Netanyahu, threatened that Israel could attack Iran’s nuclear program if the United States rejoined the nuclear deal. Iran and the Trump administration have engaged in an ongoing exchange in recent months as President Donald Trump’s tenure draws to a close and Iran marked the one-year anniversary of the US assassination of its general Qassem Soleimani. The back and forth has included threats, military maneuvers, legal action and escalating Iranian violations of the nuclear deal. Israeli and Iranian officials have also exchanged threats in recent weeks. Channel 12 said Saturday that during his meetings with top Trump administration officials, Mossad chief Cohen was given the impression that there was no plan to attack Iran during the final days of the administration. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly accused Iran of harboring al-Qaeda terrorists on Wednesday. Iran resumed enriching uranium to 20 percent last week, well in excess of the threshold set out in the nuclear deal and a short jump from the level of enrichment needed to produce weapons. Further complicating the Biden administration’s plans to reengage with Tehran were two high profile assassinations this year in Iran that were attributed to Israel. Top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was gunned down outside Tehran in November in a hit Iranian officials blamed on Israel. In August, Israeli agents killed al-Qaeda’s second-in-command in Tehran at the behest of the US, according to a New York Times report.

News article:
Top Iranian officials are demanding that President-elect Joe Biden lift sanctions and return to the Iran nuclear deal before any further negotiations can move forward. Biden signaled during his presidential campaign that he aimed to return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which granted Iran sanctions relief and international investment in exchange for curbing its nuclear program. President Donald Trump withdrew from the international accord in 2018 and reimplemented punitive sanctions against the Persian Gulf nation and its leaders. "What we say is that whatever has happened under Trump's administration must go back to the pre-Trump era. We are serious about it," Mahmoud Vaezi, chief of staff to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, told Iran's Tasnim News Agency on Monday. Vaezi asserted that all the sanctions implemented under Trump's administration must be lifted for ties to improve with the U.S. Shahriar Heydari, the deputy head of the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, shared a similar perspective with Iranian media on Sunday. "If the cruel sanctions that were imposed on the Iranian nation under Trump are not to be lifted, the JCPOA will certainly be a loss for Iran," Heydari said. "The Islamic Republic of Iran fulfilled these obligations, but the United States withdrew from this international agreement, and the Europeans did not fulfill their obligations under the pressure of the White House, [which] brought the JCPOA close to destruction," the Iranian official said. Heydari warned that U.S. officials should not attempt to "buy more time" with negotiations before lifting the sanctions. Newsweek reached out to Biden's transition team for comment, but did not immediately receive a response. In September, Biden wrote an opinion piece for CNN calling the Trump administration's Iran policy a "dangerous failure," adding that he would reach out to Tehran and offer "a credible path back to diplomacy." Former President Barack Obama joined with Iran, the European Union, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Russia and China in signing the nuclear deal back in 2015. The treaty marked a landmark shift in relations between the U.S. and Iran, which have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980. However, the respite in tensions was short-lived as Trump withdrew from the international accord in May 2018, despite consistent reports from the United Nations nuclear watchdog showing that Iran remained in compliance with the deal. The Trump administration argued that the deal was bad for the U.S. and allowed Iran to fund extremists throughout the Middle East. But if Trump wanted to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power, his policy has thus far failed. Analysts believe Iran is within months of having weapons grade nuclear material whereas it would have taken at least a year when Trump took office. European signatories hope Biden makes good on his commitment to return to the international deal. They have been consistent in their criticism of the Trump administration's policy toward Iran, having worked with China and Russia in their efforts to save the JCPOA. Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in December that he had urged Iran to be cautious in its ongoing nuclear development, pointing out that this could hinder the Biden administration from returning to the 2015 deal. "To make possible rapprochement under Biden, there must be no more tactical maneuvers of the kind we have seen plenty of in recent times—they would do nothing but further undermine the agreement," Maas said.

Nuclear Extortion: Mullahs Want More Concessions from Biden by Majid Rafizadeh https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/16975/iran-nuclear-extortion Iran… rejoined the global financial system with full legitimacy — plus billions of dollars flowing into the treasury of the IRGC and its expanding militias across the Middle East. You would think, then, that the regime would be delighted to return to the same nuclear deal, right? Wrong. The mullahs want an even sweeter deal. Biden already showed his cards by stating that he wants the deal. The regime now knows that Biden seems desperate for a deal, and doubtless sees this as a delectable weakness. The ruling mullahs also most likely assume that they can extort even more concessions from a Democrat administration, particularly Biden’s, because they successfully did so in the past…. Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif… told a forum… that he wants a new deal. “A sign of good faith is not to try to renegotiate what has already been negotiated,” he said, adding in the same speech that the US must “Compensate us for our losses.” Iran’s top judicial body had already demanded that the US pay $130 billion in “damages.” deal. “A sign of good faith is not to try to renegotiate what has already been negotiated,” he said, adding in the same speech that the US must “Compensate us for our losses.” Iran’s top judicial body had already demanded that the US pay $130 billion in “damages.” The regime, in addition, is playing another dangerous game, as it did with the Obama administration, to program to extort greater concessions from the Biden administration: It is ratcheting up nuclear threats. The Iranian regime received a dangerous and unprecedented level of concessions from the Obama administration for Iran’s 2015 “nuclear deal,” known as the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) — which, by the way, Tehran never signed. The major concession was that the deal paved the way for Iran legally to become a full-blown nuclear state. The sunset clauses, which enshrined that commitment, had set a firm expiration date for restricting Iran’s nuclear program. The Obama administration also helped swiftly lift all four rounds of UN sanctions against Iran — sanctions it had taken decades to put in place. Furthermore, Iran’s military sites were exempt from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other inspections were only to be at the times and places of Iran’s choosing — if ever. Iran then rejoined the global financial system with full legitimacy — plus billions of dollars flowing into the treasury of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its expanding militias across the Middle East. You would think, then, that the regime would be delighted to return to the same nuclear deal, right? Wrong. The mullahs want an even sweeter deal. Why? Partially because Joe Biden already showed his cards by stating that he wants the deal. “I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy,” Biden stated in a CNN op-ed. “If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations. With our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal’s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern.” The regime now knows that Biden seems desperate for a deal, and doubtless sees this as a delectable weakness. Just as enticing to the mullahs, Biden has appointed Wendy Sherman — a key negotiator in the talks which led to the nuclear deal in 2015 during the Obama administration — to be Deputy Secretary of State. Biden actually pointed to this professed accomplishment: “She [Sherman] has successfully rallied the world to strengthen democracy and confront some of the biggest national security challenges of our time, including leading the U.S. negotiating team for the Iran Deal”. That sent a further strong message to Iran that the Biden administration was desperate to return to the nuclear deal. Meanwhile, the Iranian regime can only feel emboldened by the position of the European Union. The EU is lobbying for returning to the JCPOA and lifting sanctions on Iran — in spite of the fact, as France’s Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian recently acknowledged, that Tehran is rapidly acquiring nuclear weapons capacity. The EU announced last week its “strong commitment” to the Iranian nuclear deal and urged Biden swiftly to rejoin it: “The EU reiterates its strong commitment to and continued support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The JCPoA is a key element of the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture and an achievement of multilateral diplomacy, endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council through resolution 2231.” Iran’s ruling mullahs also most likely assume that they can extort even more concessions from a Democrat administration, particularly Biden’s, because they successfully did so in the past, with the Obama administration, when Biden served as Vice President. Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, nevertheless, told a forum organized by New York’s Council on Foreign Relations that he wants a new deal. “A sign of good faith is not to try to renegotiate what has already been negotiated,” he said, adding in the same speech that the US must “Compensate us for our losses.” Iran’s top judicial body had already demanded that the US pay $130 billion in “damages.” Iran’s regime, in addition, is playing another dangerous game, as it did with the Obama administration, to program to extort greater concessions from the Biden administration: It is ratcheting up nuclear threats. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the civilian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, stated on January 1, 2021 that Tehran will enrich uranium at a higher level, a short technical step away from weapons-grade level. The IAEA confirmed the plan: “Iran has informed the agency that in order to comply with a legal act recently passed by the country’s parliament, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran intends to produce low-enriched uranium (LEU) up to 20 percent at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. Iran’s letter to the agency, dated [Dec. 31, 2020] did not say when this enrichment activity would take place.” Now, at an underground facility, Iran’s theocratic establishment is enriching uranium at 20 percent. Furthermore, on January 4, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), seized in the Gulf a South Korean-flagged ship carrying thousands of tons of ethanol, according to Fars News. The move alarmed the US State Department. A spokesperson noted: “The (Iranian) regime continues to threaten navigational rights and freedoms in the Persian Gulf as part of a clear attempt to extort the international community into relieving the pressure of sanctions. We join the Republic of Korea’s call for Iran to immediately release the tanker,” Meanwhile, General Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of the IRGC, recently threatened the U.S. and the United Kingdom. “If you cross our red line,” he announced, “we will destroy you. We will not leave any move unanswered. The enemy will not have security anywhere.” He added that the regime’s “patience has a limit.” The Iranian parliament also recently passed another law, requiring the government to expel the nuclear inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). All these measures — using threats and nuclear violations — are just aimed at getting a still sweeter deal from the Biden administration.

Topic: Iran Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: RussiaIranJCPOANuclear WeaponsSyriaIran Missile Though Moscow’s stance on Iran’s regional activities might be ambivalent, Russian competition with Iran in Syria, as well as their military-defense cooperation, will afford Washington limited opportunities to rely on Russian leverage-plays with Tehran. As Joe Biden embarks on his first weeks in office as U.S. president, an intensive debate is raging in Washington and global capitals on how to construct a Middle Eastern regional security process alongside the resumption of JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, related diplomacy vis-à-vis Iran. That debate is sustained by the frequently made assertion that it would be a mistake for Biden to return to the Iran nuclear deal, without correcting what some call its “original sins”—the deal’s failure to address Iran’s regional policies and missiles, alongside its “sunset provisions.” Experts and officials have called for a “nuclear agreement plus,” a “broader follow-on negotiation,” or a three-phased approach, to name but a few offers on today’s marketplace of Iran-related proposals. Pursuing such a broader effort will be a tall order for U.S. officials regardless of the precise format and sequencing; involving Iran’s formidable partner, Russia, in any diplomatic choreography, therefore, seems essential. However, assuming that the Iran file could be a “low-hanging fruit” for cooperation in an otherwise strained U.S.-Russian relationship ignores Moscow’s ambivalent attitude toward Iran’s proxy activities and missile program—components of Tehran’s so-called “offensive defense” strategy. For the most part, Russia does not view Iran’s cultivation of proxy actors in Arab societies—from Lebanon via Iraq to Yemen—as a threat to its own interests. And where its views are more nuanced, as in Syria, Russia’s record of being able to rein in the Iranians is mixed at best. For starters, Russia has consistently argued that Iranian activities in the region are unrelated to the nuclear file as a matter of principle. It has backed Tehran’s argument—especially amid the arms embargo dispute last fall—that raising issues originally considered “extraneous to the JCPOA by mutual agreement” is impermissible. That position has reflected a deeper concern in Moscow with the integrity of the P5+1 process, which affords the Russian government respect and status, but also its broader apprehensions with an alleged “rules-based international order,” in which the United States invents “rules” as it sees fit while flouting established international agreements like the JCPOA. As a matter of practical policy, however, Russia’s view on Iran’s ties with the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), the Yemeni Houthis, and the Lebanese Hezbollah is best described as a mixture of indifference and impotence. Though the recently sanctioned chairman of the PMF, Faleh al-Fayyad, has been an occasional visitor to Moscow, Russia can neither further nor contain Iran’s ambitions in Iraq—and it does not want to. Notwithstanding a desire among Russian diplomats to avoid perceptions of an exclusive alignment with a “Shia camp” in the region, given Moscow’s interests in good ties with Israel and the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Russia lacks both appetite and leverage to meddle in Iraq’s domestic lay-of-the-land. In Yemen, claims over Moscow’s sway over the Houthis have been consistently overblown. Besides, Russia’s approach toward Yemen has been one of “strategic non-alignment,” aimed at preserving a balanced relationship with both Saudi Arabia and Iran. As such, while condemning the September 2019 Houthi attacks on Saudi oil facilities, Moscow has refused to blame Iran for its role in the war-torn country and has even blocked U.S. efforts to do so in the United Nations. And in Lebanon, Hezbollah’s entrenchment has such deep and robust roots, that it is hard to see how Moscow could tip the domestic balance of power even if it wanted to—and listening to Russia’s top diplomat serving in Beirut, one gets the impression that it doesn’t. More fundamentally, Russian interlocutors either reject the view that Iran’s proxies cause the havoc often ascribed to them from within the anti-JCPOA camp, or believe that such havoc is simply not Russia’s problem. The only exception to Russia’s reluctance in reining in Iran’s influence might be Syria, where Tehran’s attempts to establish a network of allied local militias and import foreign proxies have been at odds with Moscow’s desire to form unified, Russia-oriented military and security structures. Russia has also worried that Iran might turn Syria into a base for targeting Israel. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that the frequent Israeli strikes against Iranian positions in Syria have elicited little to no official Russian reactions. That said, Moscow’s limited leverage over Tehran was put on display when the Russians failed to deliver on their 2018 promise to keep Iran-backed forces at least 60 kilometers away from the Syrian-Israeli border. Notwithstanding the competition for influence with Iran, Russian calculations in Syria are nuanced: a full Iranian withdrawal would unduly change the balance of power in favor of the United States and Turkey in that country and is therefore not in Moscow’s interest either. As for the Iranian missile program, Moscow has consistently defended Tehran’s right to develop and test missiles, emphasizing that such activities do not violate international regulations and are intended to mitigate Iran’s sense of insecurity. That said, Russian officials have been hopeful that their military-technical cooperation with Iran, including on advanced air defense systems, may contribute to alleviating Iran’s perceived own vulnerability and prevent Tehran from taking escalatory steps that might exacerbate friction with the West. In 2015, for example, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov justified supplying Iran with S-300 air defense systems with the need to “beef up Iran’s defense capabilities and stimulate negotiations” on the nuclear issue. A broader reason for Russia’s ambivalent stance on Iran’s missiles and proxy activities is that the conflict potential they generate can play into Russia’s hands—as long as it does not precipitate full-blown war. So long as Iran’s regional policies are problematic for Western and regional countries, Russia benefits from being the chief intermediary between them and Tehran—as Foreign Minister Lavrov offered to his Saudi counterpart in Moscow just last week. Iran either finding too much common ground with its present foes or alternatively overstepping and inviting military escalation—neither option would be in Russia’s interest. In light of the ambiguity emanating from Moscow regarding those regional issues Washington wishes to tackle in resuming its nuclear diplomacy with Iran, how should a Biden administration engage Moscow? One could argue that the United States, in unilaterally pursuing the “Abraham Accords,” intra-GCC reconciliation, Israeli-Lebanese maritime border talks, and its “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, has recently proven that things can get done in the region without involving Russia. That said, the Iranians—in responding to Russia’s own Collective Security Concept for the Persian Gulf Area—have repeatedly insisted on Moscow’s involvement in any regional security effort, to ensure a “balance of power” among extra-regional actors involved. Considering Tehran’s principled skepticism towards any diplomatic effort that extends beyond the nuclear—which will only further increase in case a more conservative government emerges from the upcoming Iranian elections—Washington should heed these demands. It is certainly better to have Russia in the process than to leave it out in the cold. Though Moscow’s stance on Iran’s regional activities might be ambivalent, Russian competition with Iran in Syria, as well as their military-defense cooperation, will afford Washington limited opportunities to rely on Russian leverage-plays with Tehran—particularly if other dimensions of the U.S.-Russia relationship will become less hostile. Still, Biden’s diplomats should go to Moscow with their eyes wide open to the constraints in getting it to act against Tehran.

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani urged the incoming U.S. administration on Wednesday to return to a 2015 nuclear agreement and lift sanctions on Tehran, while welcoming the end of "tyrant" President Donald Trump's era. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Wednesday, has said the United States will rejoin the pact, which includes restrictions on Iran's nuclear work, if Tehran resumes strict compliance. "The ball is in the U.S. court now. If Washington returns to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact," Rouhani said in a televised cabinet meeting. "Today, we expect the incoming U.S. administration to return to the rule of law and commit themselves, and if they can, in the next four years, to remove all the black spots of the previous four years," he said. Tensions have grown between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when Trump quit the deal between Iran and six world powers that sought to limit Tehran's nuclear program and prevent it developing atomic weapons. Washington reimposed sanctions that have badly hit Iran's economy. Iran, which denies ever seeking nuclear arms, retaliated to Trump's "maximum pressure" policy by gradually breaching the accord. Tehran has repeatedly said it can quickly reverse those violations if U.S. sanctions are removed. "Tyrant Trump's political career and his ominous reign are over today and his 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran has completely failed," Rouhani said. "Trump is dead but the nuclear deal is still alive." Antony Blinken, Biden's choice for secretary of state, said on Tuesday the U.S. would not take a quick decision on whether to rejoin the pact. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Biden appears to see a return to the deal as a prelude to wider talks on Iran's nuclear work, its ballistic missiles and regional activities. But Tehran has ruled out halting its missile program or changing its regional policy. Biden's choice to lead the Pentagon, retired Army General Lloyd Austin, said on Tuesday that Iran posed a threat to American allies in the region and forces stationed in the Middle East. "The United States and other Western countries have turned our region to a powder keg, not Iran," Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told state TV.

US President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said Tuesday that the incoming administration will consult with Israel and Arab allies in the Middle East before it makes decisions about reentering the Iran nuclear agreement. Biden “believes that if Iran comes back into compliance, we would too,” Blinken said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “But we would use that as a platform with our allies and partners, who would once again be on the same side with us, to seek a longer and stronger agreement,” Blinken said. “It’s vitally important that we engage on the takeoff, not the landing, with our allies and partners in the region, to include Israel and to include the Gulf countries,” he said, adding that a new agreement could address Iran’s “destabilizing activities” in the region as well as its missiles. “Having said that, I think we’re a long way from there,” Blinken said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Biden has said that returning to the 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), would be a top priority for him in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and imposed crushing sanctions that have wreaked havoc on the Iranian economy. Biden has said the US would return to the JCPOA so long as Iran returns to strict compliance with the deal first. Over the past several weeks, Tehran has begun enriching uranium up to 20%, in direct violation of the accord. Biden has also said he intends to enter subsequent negotiations to reach a “longer and stronger” deal with Tehran that would also address its ballistic missile program and regional hegemony. Iran has said it is not interested in reaching subsequent agreements. Advertisement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned against the US rejoining the agreement, speaking out in November and December against the move and urging Biden to continue Trump’s maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Iran. However, Israel’s ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, called on Biden to consult with Israel and the Gulf states before returning to the JCPOA. At his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Blinken assured the committee that the Biden administration would do just that and also engage with Congress before striking any deal with Iran. Blinken was more circumspect when asked if he would be willing to discuss an alternative to the JCPOA: “I welcome talking to… the members of this committee about the way forward on Iran.” “We are much better off if we can try and work through these issues together. You have my commitment that we intend and will do that and I look forward to the consultations that we’ll have,” he said. “President-elect Biden is committed to the proposition that Iran will not be permitted to acquire a nuclear weapon,” Blinken continued, while saying the Iran deal signed under former president Barack Obama, with Biden as his vice president, “was succeeding on its own terms.” Advertisement “If Iran comes back into compliance, then we would too,” Blinken said, while acknowledging that “we are a long way from there.” As for Trump’s decision to assassinate top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani last year, Blinken argued that it made the region less safe. Normalization deals, two-state solution Blinken praised the Abraham Accords negotiated by the Trump administration that saw Israel normalize ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, saying such agreements make the region safer. However, he said the Biden administration would “take a hard look at” some of the “commitments” that were made in tandem with those accords. He appeared to be referencing weapons deals made with the UAE, which was set to receive 50 F-35 advanced fighter jets from the US following the signing of the normalization agreement. In a November interview with The Times of Israel, Blinken panned the apparent “quid pro quo” nature of the F-35 sale that immediately followed the normalization agreement. “The Obama-Biden administration made those planes available to Israel and only Israel in the region,” said Blinken, who served as Biden’s national security adviser, deputy national security adviser to the president and deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration. During the Tuesday committee hearing, Blinken expressed hope that the Abraham Accords will provide Israel with a new sense of “confidence and security” to reach an agreement with the Palestinians. He went on to call the US commitment to Israel’s security “sacrosanct” and later said that he does not consider Israel a “racist nation” when asked by Senator Lindsey Graham. Advertisement Blinken threw his support behind a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, while expressing doubt that such a deal could be reached in the near future. “The only way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,” Blinken said, while adding that he opposes “unilateral” efforts by either party that make reaching such a solution more difficult. Blinken later said he and Biden are “resolutely opposed” to the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel because it “unfairly and inappropriately singles out Israel and creates a double standard that we do not apply to other countries.” “At the same time, I fully respect the first amendment rights of Americans to say what they believe,” he added, saying he would oppose measures backed by some US Jewish groups to sanction those who boycott Israel. Blinken also committed to not reversing Trump’s decision to transfer the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, adding that the holy city is Israel’s capital.

Source: Xinhua| 2021-01-20 13:48:10|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's nominee for Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday proposed several changes to the Trump administration's foreign policy after taking office. During his confirmation hearing at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Blinken said that the incoming Biden administration would seek to rejoin the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, if Tehran returns to compliance. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in May 2018 and slapped harsh sanctions against Iran. In response, Tehran has gradually dropped some of its JCPOA commitments since May 2019. "The President-elect believes that if Iran comes back into compliance, we would too," with an intention to seek a "longer and stronger agreement," he said. The incoming secretary of state indicated that the objective of a new agreement with Iran would involve Iran's missile program and its activities in the region, while underlining "we're a long way from there." Blinken, Jewish, voiced his support for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, a policy stance that was backed by successive U.S. governments for decades but was largely abandoned by the Trump administration. "What would be important is to make sure that neither party takes steps that make the already difficult proposition even more challenging," he said. Blinken questioned the designation of Yemen's Houthi group as a terrorist group, which was announced last week by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to double down the pressure campaign against Iran. He added that the incoming administration would extend a key arms control treaty with Moscow. "I think we're going to seek an extension," Blinken said when asked if the Biden administration would extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty expiring on Feb. 5. The treaty stipulates limits to the numbers of deployed nuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems by both, and can be extended by a maximum of five years with the consent of the two countries. Blinken, 58, served as Deputy National Security Advisor and Deputy Secretary of State under former President Barack Obama. A close aide to Biden for nearly two decades, Blinken was one of Biden's first cabinet picks. Enditem

News article:
A Nobel Peace Prize winner is calling on President Joe Biden to reverse his predecessors' nuclear buildup and give up his strategic arsenal entirely, as a landmark United Nations treaty outlawing the world's most powerful weapons of mass destruction comes into effect. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) entered into effect Friday, amounting to the world's first legally binding international agreement to ban the development of nuclear weapons and seek their total elimination. It comes into force just two days after the inauguration of a new U.S. president. And now, Nobel Prize-winner Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), tells Newsweek she wants Biden to join it, breaking with policies pursued by former Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama. "If Joe Biden wants to secure his place in history and secure the United States' place in the future, he needs to reverse course not just of Trump, but also of Obama and stop developing new nuclear weapons at a cost of $1.7 trillion," Fihn said. Fihn accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 on behalf of ICAN, which played a crucial role in the U.N. adopting the TPNW that same year. Also in 2017, Trump came to office with an avowed affinity for the very weapons that ICAN sought to ban. Trump would go on not only to expand and modernize the U.S. nuclear weapons program but also to pull the country out of milestone treaties with Russia. That left the top two world nuclear powers with only one remaining non-proliferation agreement: the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). Despite Moscow's offers to immediately extend the deal, the Trump administration sought added conditions that brought the two to a stalemate that threatened the pact's collapse on Feb. 5. On his first full day in office, Biden announced he would seek to quickly and unconditionally renew New START, a move welcomed by the Kremlin and anti-nuclear weapons activists. Biden has drawn acclaim from a number of arms control advocates for his historic efforts to limit the development of nuclear weapons. The Council for a Livable World, which says on its website that it is an " advocacy organization dedicated to eliminating the U.S. arsenal of nuclear weapons," was the first national organization to endorse Biden when he first ran for Senate in 1972. In 2020, the leading disarmament think tank broke with their tradition of not endorsing presidential candidates by supporting his 2020 run for president. Biden's official policy sheet says he seeks to limit the role of nuclear weapons. "President Biden would take other steps to demonstrate our commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons," the policy reads. "As he said in 2017, Biden believes the sole purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal should be deterring—and if necessary, retaliating against—a nuclear attack. As president, he will work to put that belief into practice, in consultation with our allies and military." On Friday, Biden appointed Alexandra Bell, the Obama-era senior advisor to the State Department Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, as deputy assistant secretary to the office. Last May, Bell acknowledged the lasting significance of the TPNW in a tweet, writing: "TPNW is here to stay. Time to find common ground." Read more Biden's Plan to Extend Russia Nuclear Treaty Praised by Arms Control Groups Biden's Plan to Extend Russia Nuclear Treaty Praised by Arms Control Groups But Fihn said she wants the Biden administration to go further, and sign the TPNW. "A plan to limit nuclear weapons is not enough," Fihn told Newsweek. "It's time for a commitment to complete abolition rooted in international law with the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. That is the leadership needed from the U.S." She cited support from a top official of former President Bill Clinton's administration in her call for the U.S. to join the U.N. pact. "Former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry has called on the United States to join the TPNW, to be the first nuclear-armed state to do so, and we fully agree," Fihn said. The nine world nuclear powers are Russia, the U.S., France, China, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, North Korea and Israel (although Israel will neither confirm nor deny its widely-suspected arsenal). So far none has signed the TPNW that would commit them to extra measures toward forfeiting their nuclear weapons, a goal already envisioned in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) signed by Moscow, Washington, Paris, Beijing and London. The Russian Foreign Ministry was quick to express its disapproval of the TPNW. "We respect the views of those who support an early renunciation of nuclear weapons," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told reporters Thursday. "However, we do not share approaches to achieving this goal that presuppose the artificial acceleration of the nuclear disarmament process. This treaty is incapable of contributing to the process of limiting and reducing nuclear arms." China too defended its outlook on nuclear capabilities, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying calling Beijing "an advocate for the comprehensive prohibition and complete elimination of nuclear weapons." She also made clear that China had no intention of signing the TPNW. "It is China's view that nuclear disarmament cannot lose sight of the reality of the international security landscape," Hua said. "Progress should be sought step by step under the principle of maintaining global strategic stability and undiminished security for all. The process must be consensus-based and stay within the framework of the existing international disarmament and non-proliferation regime." The TPNW, Hua argued, "runs counter to the above-mentioned principle and is detrimental to the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime with the NPT as a cornerstone." France emphasized its commitment to the NPT, a treaty that a Foreign Ministry spokesperson argued the TPNW "undermines." "It will not contribute to reducing growing tensions or effectively address the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that characterize it," the spokesperson said of the TPNW. "This treaty will not make it possible to eliminate any nuclear weapons." India also dismissed the TPNW as unhelpful. Read more Atom Bomb Survivors Fear Trump Policies Could Lead to New Nuclear Attacks Atom Bomb Survivors Fear Trump Policies Could Lead to New Nuclear Attacks But Fihn disagrees. She sees the TPNW as a game-changer for the seven-decade international movement to eliminate nuclear weapons. She gives credit to the hibakusha, the survivors of the U.S. atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that introduced the world to such weapons of mass destruction, and touts Friday's accomplishment as historic. "This treaty is the first to achieve entry-into-force that bans the most destructive weapons in human history; outlaws nuclear testing; prohibits all efforts to develop nuclear weapons or in any way support them," Fihn told Newsweek. "It does not just ban the weapons, but outlaws the entire nuclear weapons structure — drastically changing the state of play on nuclear weapons abolition." She called nuclear weapons "immoral, illegal and tremendously unpopular," and offered new data to support her argument. A poll published Friday by the YouGov research firm showed that support for banning nuclear weapons among the populations of six members of the U.S.-led NATO Western military alliance, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain ranged between 77% and 89%. Additionally, majorities living in countries hosting nuclear weapons wanted them out, according to the survey. This included 74% of Italians, 58% of Dutch, 57% of Belgians and 83% of Germans. More than half the survey respondents in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands also didn't want nuclear-capable jets, and at least three-quarters polled in those countries didn't even know about them. With these figures in mind, Fihn argued that "opposition to this treaty is politically untenable." "Change is coming," she told Newsweek, "and it is coming faster than most expect as the treaty forces research universities, financial institutions and weapons producers to support our mission or find themselves outside international law and facing legal, financial and political risk."

Iran’s Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, on Friday urged US President Joe Biden to "choose a better path" by returning to the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, Reuters reports. Zarif, writing in Foreign Affairs magazine, also warned that the opportunity would be lost if Washington insists on further Iranian concessions up front.

News article:
Expect more belligerence from Iran under Biden administration Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th President of the United States. (Reuters) Short Url https://arab.news/83xa5 Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei surprisingly ordered all factions of Iraqi armed groups to stop attacking US interests in Iraq late last year. A senior commander of an Iranian-backed armed group involved in such attacks told Middle East Eye: “Khamenei’s orders were straightforward and clear. All attacks targeting US interests in Iraq must stop.” This was not a strategic shift but a tactical one. The regime was fearful that the Trump administration would attack Iran if US entities were targeted. Some Iranian leaders thought the White House was looking for an excuse to attack. As a result, the theocratic establishment halted its provocations in order to avoid giving Donald Trump a political victory and risk its own hold on power. Now, however, with the Biden administration in power, the Tehran regime is tactically shifting gears again. It has already ratcheted up its military adventurism and threats. Just five days before President Joe Biden’s inauguration, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) conducted a military drill that involved “suicide drones” hitting targets and exploding. The drones reportedly strongly resembled those used in the attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil installations at Abqaiq and Khurais in 2019. It also fired long-range ballistic missiles into the Indian Ocean on the second day of its military exercise. IRGC commander Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami boasted that the objective was to “use long-range ballistic missiles against enemy warships, including aircraft carriers,” according to state media. Iran possesses the largest and most diverse ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East, and no other country has ever acquired long-range ballistic missiles before obtaining nuclear weapons. Tehran’s ballistic missile capability is one of the most critical pillars of the regime’s national security policy. They can be used for offensive or defensive purposes, but sophisticated missiles are mainly developed as delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons. The regime’s expansion of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the stability of the region and the national interests of other countries too. Such military tests create a sense of insecurity and inevitably lead to further destabilization, militarization and an arms race in the region. In addition, while the Iranian leaders argue that they are not breaching any international laws by test-firing ballistic missiles, Tehran is clearly violating UN Security Council Resolution 2231. This calls on Tehran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.” The resolution adds that Iran should not undertake any ballistic missile activity “until the date eight years after the JCPOA Adoption Day (Oct. 18, 2015) or until the date on which the IAEA submits a report confirming the broader conclusion, whichever is earlier.” The Iranian leaders are also demanding the release of $7 billion in funds frozen in South Korean banks in order to release a South Korean-flagged ship, which it recently seized in the Gulf. The Iranian leaders are emboldened partially because they have learned in their four-decade history that US Democratic administrations do not want a war with Iran. And this is not any new Democratic administration — it is one that Iran is familiar and comfortable with, as Biden was vice president at the time the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal was reached. The Iranian leaders have learned in their four-decade history that US Democratic administrations do not want a war with Iran. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Unfortunately, Biden’s announcements concerning his intention to return to the nuclear deal have already made the Iranian regime more emboldened to pursue its hegemonic ambitions. If Biden had not stated that he wants to rejoin the nuclear deal, Tehran would have been more cautious. Biden has also appointed Wendy Sherman, a professor and director at the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, as undersecretary of state. She was a key negotiator in the talks that led to the nuclear deal. Biden even pointed to this issue in his statement announcing her nomination: “She has successfully rallied the world to strengthen democracy and confront some of the biggest national security challenges of our time, including leading the US negotiating team for the Iran deal.” This further sends a strong message to Tehran that the US wants to return to the nuclear deal. Expect more aggression, belligerence and military adventurism from the Iranian regime under the Biden administration. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is a Harvard-educated Iranian-American political scientist.

News article:
London, Tehran - Asharq Al-Awsat Divisions started to emerge in Iran over the expected negotiations with the new US administration, following the inauguration of US President Joe Biden. President Hassan Rouhani blasted those criticizing the government’s efforts to preserve the nuclear deal, stressing the importance of diplomacy to boost the economy and save the sovereign fund from bankruptcy. In a televised speech during the opening of an oil refinery in Al-Ahvaz region, Rouhani defended the role of foreign policy, saying: “Had it not been for our foreign life and the 2015 nuclear deal, we would not have obtained the funds for the opening of these large projects.” He added: “The conditions of the sovereign fund improved in 2015, 2016 and 2017 when we were able to sell our oil.” Government officials said that the natural gas refinery, in southwestern Iran, “is the third largest in the world of its kind, and the largest in the Middle East.” The president was implicitly referring to two warnings that his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, received in parliament on Tuesday. Zarif was rebuked for his efforts to negotiate with the United States only three weeks after the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a US drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020. In contrast, Ebrahim Raisi, head of the judiciary, said: “Those who think that the country’s problems can be solved through negotiations are wrong.” “When we act with determination in any field, the enemy will retreat and despair,” he added. Raisi referred on statements made by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei about “the importance of aborting sanctions instead of waiting for them to be lifted.” “What frustrates the Americans and Europeans, and aborts the sanctions, is the implementation of the parliament law, to emphasize the necessity of executing the orders of the spiritual leader,” he stated. Last month, the parliament approved a law obliging the government to violate the obligations of the nuclear deal in an attempt to pressure the Biden administration to lift the sanctions and backtrack on the policy of “maximum pressure” approved by former US President Donald Trump to change Tehran’s behavior.

News article:
While the world has been distracted by COVID-19 and the changing Administration in Washington, Iran has quietly moved closer to developing weapons-grade nuclear material. As Joe Biden steps into the U.S. Presidency this month amid a range of crises, the threat of nuclear proliferation cannot be ignored. Biden must quickly address Iran’s growing nuclear capabilities in addition to the raging pandemic, a troubled U.S. vaccine rollout, a failing economy and the potential for more violence from right-wing extremists. The insidious danger of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East is an undeniable threat to America’s national security and global stability. Iran will continue its menacing forward march to enrich uranium unless the United States takes a firm stance to curtail the country’s dangerous behavior. Biden must confront Iran and thwart this growing nuclear threat which has continued to expand since the Trump administration withdrew from the deeply flawed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018. Pressure will be on the Biden Administration to address this challenge and contain Iran, which continues to blatantly ignore the restrictions set in place by the JCPOA to control the mullah’s pursuit of an atomic arsenal. We have learned through the media that Iran has restarted its enrichment program and is capable of producing even more quantities of highly-enriched uranium. The danger of nuclear proliferation is growing exponentially with each passing day. Reports indicate that Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium exceeds the JCPOA limit by more than 12 times and that its uranium had been enriched up to 4.5 percent, far above the 3.67 percent threshold established by the Iran nuclear deal. This unfettered proliferation is a clear threat to world peace. Biden and his foreign policy team must address this growing threat without returning to the JCPOA, which failed to halt Iran’s missile program or its aggressive military moves and rhetoric against its neighbors. America will need to remain engaged and alert on this issue. Iran continues to be a dangerous force in the Middle East and the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Iran has been labeled as such by the State Department since 1984, and continues to provide moral, economic and military support to Hezbollah, as well as various Palestinian terror groups in Gaza. This is in addition to other terrorist organizations in Iraq, Syria and throughout the Middle East. It was the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah that launched a rocket attack against American interests in Iraq in December 2019 that left an American citizen dead. In addition, tensions have risen steadily since the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, nearly erupting in conflict in 2020 after President Trump ordered a military strike that killed a top general responsible for attacks that killed dozens of innocents. Advertisement These next few weeks following Biden’s swearing-in as President will be hectic, but his national security team must view Iran as an urgent priority as it begins its meetings. Last September, Biden told the media the United States would rejoin the Iran nuclear deal as a starting point if Iran agreed to strictly comply with the pact’s provisions. But this path is fraught with problems. The JCPOA included unacceptable sunset clauses that stipulated when Iran could resume some of its weapons programs, among other shortcomings. The Biden administration may also find itself under pressure to continue the strict economic sanctions put into place by the Trump Administration. Iran is hoping to see those rolled back. Expect Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize discussions about Iran during meetings with Biden. The two know each other well because they have worked together over a span of nearly 40 years. Biden has in-depth knowledge of the Iran nuclear issue, having served as a longtime member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as Chairman and Ranking Member. The Iran nuclear deal was clearly a major focus during his two terms as Vice President in the Obama Administration when the agreement was negotiated. Biden must move to contain Iran and make certain the country’s leaders no longer feel they have free rein to continue down the dangerous path of nuclear proliferation.

Iran will continue its menacing forward march to enrich uranium unless the United States takes a firm stance to curtail the country’s dangerous behavior. Biden must confront Iran and thwart this growing nuclear threat which has continued to expand since the Trump administration withdrew from the deeply flawed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018. Pressure will be on the Biden Administration to address this challenge and contain Iran, which continues to blatantly ignore the restrictions set in place by the JCPOA to control the mullah’s pursuit of an atomic arsenal. We have learned through the media that Iran has restarted its enrichment program and is capable of producing even more quantities of highly-enriched uranium. The danger of nuclear proliferation is growing exponentially with each passing day. Reports indicate that Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium exceeds the JCPOA limit by more than 12 times and that its uranium had been enriched up to 4.5 percent, far above the 3.67 percent threshold established by the Iran nuclear deal. This unfettered proliferation is a clear threat to world peace. Biden and his foreign policy team must address this growing threat without returning to the JCPOA, which failed to halt Iran’s missile program or its aggressive military moves and rhetoric against its neighbors. America will need to remain engaged and alert on this issue. Iran continues to be a dangerous force in the Middle East and the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Iran has been labeled as such by the State Department since 1984, and continues to provide moral, economic and military support to Hezbollah, as well as various Palestinian terror groups in Gaza. This is in addition to other terrorist organizations in Iraq, Syria and throughout the Middle East. It was the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah that launched a rocket attack against American interests in Iraq in December 2019 that left an American citizen dead. In addition, tensions have risen steadily since the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, nearly erupting in conflict in 2020 after President Trump ordered a military strike that killed a top general responsible for attacks that killed dozens of innocents. Advertisement These next few weeks following Biden’s swearing-in as President will be hectic, but his national security team must view Iran as an urgent priority as it begins its meetings. Last September, Biden told the media the United States would rejoin the Iran nuclear deal as a starting point if Iran agreed to strictly comply with the pact’s provisions. But this path is fraught with problems. The JCPOA included unacceptable sunset clauses that stipulated when Iran could resume some of its weapons programs, among other shortcomings. The Biden administration may also find itself under pressure to continue the strict economic sanctions put into place by the Trump Administration. Iran is hoping to see those rolled back. Expect Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize discussions about Iran during meetings with Biden. The two know each other well because they have worked together over a span of nearly 40 years. Biden has in-depth knowledge of the Iran nuclear issue, having served as a longtime member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as Chairman and Ranking Member. The Iran nuclear deal was clearly a major focus during his two terms as Vice President in the Obama Administration when the agreement was negotiated. Biden must move to contain Iran and make certain the country’s leaders no longer feel they have free rein to continue down the dangerous path of nuclear proliferation.

News article:
President Joe Biden has done a good job so far of calming the anxieties of allies that the US will rush into negotiations to re-enter the flawed 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Appointing Robert Malley as special envoy to Iran could change that. On Iran, other Biden advisers have been reassuring. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last month that it was “really up to Iran” whether the US would re-enter the deal, meaning Iran must be in compliance with it before the US lifts sanctions. Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, told the Senate that he wanted a “longer and stronger” nuclear deal with Iran and pledged to consult regional allies such as Israel and the Arab Gulf states if and when negotiations with Iran resumed. So it’s strange that, according to the Jewish Insider, Biden is considering Robert Malley, the former Middle East director for Barack Obama’s National Security Council, to be his special envoy to Iran. Unlike Sullivan, Blinken and for that matter Biden himself, Malley seems to believe that engagement with rogues is the only way to tame them. It’s been a theme in Malley’s career. After Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed at the end of the Clinton administration, Malley, who engaged in those talks, publicly dissented from Clinton’s own view that the talks failed because of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s failure to make a counter-offer. In 2008, he stopped advising the Obama presidential campaign on foreign policy after reports emerged that he had met with leaders of Hamas, an organization the US and Israel consider to be terrorists. Malley, of course, is not the first or only person to support diplomacy with America’s adversaries. Indeed, the Trump administration itself explained its maximum pressure policy on Iran as a means to coercing the regime to submit to a better deal. But Malley’s public advocacy out of government undercuts the message of Sullivan and Blinken that they seek a stronger deal than the one Malley helped negotiate. In a 2019 interview with the Intercept, for example, Malley said former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s 12 conditions for lifting sanctions on Iran were tantamount to a policy of regime change and that there was “no way” any Iranian leader could agree to them. Yet Pompeo’s demands were not unreasonable. They pointedly did not include making internal democratic reforms or releasing political prisoners. Rather, Pompeo’s conditions sought to end Iran’s own aggressive behavior, such as its support for terrorist groups, its development of missiles and its hostage-taking of foreign nationals. More important, the notion that Iran’s regime does not respond to pressure is a talking point of the Iranian regime, especially Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. It also happens to be false. Wang Xiyue, who was unjustly imprisoned in Iran between 2016 and 2019 as he was doing research for his doctorate, told me that appointing Malley as the envoy would undermine Blinken’s own assurance that the Biden administration sought to strengthen the 2015 nuclear deal. “If I were Javad Zarif, I would not believe Blinken if Malley is appointed as the envoy.” Xiyue is one of 12 former Iranian hostages and human-rights activists who have signed a letter to Blinken asking him not to appoint Malley. Appointing him “would send a chilling signal to the dictatorship in Iran that the United States is solely focused on re-entering the Iran nuclear deal, and ignoring its regional terror and domestic crimes against humanity,” they write. “It would also send a signal to Iranians, Syrians, Iraqis, Lebanese, and all others that are being repressed by the Iranian regime and its proxies that the Biden administration does not care about their human rights.” Bloomberg

News article:
Newly inaugurated US President Joe Biden’s administration will launch an initiative through European mediators to open a direct dialogue with Tehran, a source in Washington told Sky News Arabia on Monday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that “there will be a new approach that seeks to reassert US deterrence in the region and create a solution to the conflict with Tehran.” The official said the new approach will be accompanied by contacts with the allies of the United States in the region, specifically with Gulf countries and Israel. An unsourced report by Israel’s Channel 12 news said last week that officials in the Biden administration have already begun holding quiet talks with Iran on a return to the 2015 nuclear deal, and have updated Israel on those conversations. Biden has indicated his desire to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the deal is known, while Israel has been pushing for any return to the agreement to include fresh limitations on Iran’s ballistic missile program and its support for terror and destabilization around the world. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The JCPOA was signed by Iran and six world powers known as the P5+1 in 2015. Then-US president Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the deal in 2018, opting instead for a “maximum pressure” sanctions effort. Since 2019, Tehran has suspended its compliance with most of the limits set by the agreement in response to Washington’s abandonment of sanctions relief and the failure of other parties to the deal to make up for it. It is now enriching uranium to 20 percent, just a short step away from weapons-grade levels. Iranian diplomats have been in touch with members of Biden’s administration about restarting talks on Tehran’s nuclear program and have laid out seven preconditions, a source in Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s office told a Kuwaiti newspaper on Sunday. Advertisement Speaking to Kuwait’s al-Jarida newspaper, the Iranian official said that contacts began before Biden took office, and indicated that they are ongoing but informal. In an article published Friday in Foreign Affairs, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote that Iran will not accept any new demands or terms to the deal proposed by Washington or any other signatories to the agreement. If the US began by “unconditionally removing, with full effect, all sanctions imposed, reimposed, or relabeled since Trump took office,” Iran would reverse the measures it has taken since the American withdrawal from the deal in 2018, Zarif said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to dispatch Mossad chief Yossi Cohen to Washington in the coming weeks to lay out Israel’s demands of the Biden administration for any new version of the Iran nuclear deal, Channel 12 news reported Saturday night. The network said Cohen, one of Netanyahu’s most trusted operatives, is to travel to the US within the next month and will be the first senior Israeli official to meet Biden. Cohen is also expected to meet with the head of the CIA. Lazar Berman contributed to this report.

Robert Malley (second from right) attends negotiations of the Iran nuclear deal in Vienna in 2015. AFP file photo Washington - Heba El Koudsy Media leaks have said US President Joe Biden intends to appoint Robert Malley, president of the International Crisis Group and former Obama administration’s national security advisor on the Middle East, as the new US Special Representative for Iran. The possibility of Malley’s appointment stirred fears among US parties who oppose reentering a nuclear deal with Iran. These concerns stem from a belief that Biden is seeking to hire back almost all individuals that worked with the Obama administration on achieving the 2015 nuclear agreement. Many have warned that Biden would be committing a massive foreign policy blunder if he moves forward with appointing Malley. Nevertheless, some have defended the potential candidate as a perfect fit for the position given the good relations he enjoys among circles connected to the Obama administration. If picked, Malley will replace Elliott Abrams, who last year replaced Brian Hook. The Biden administration has acknowledged its desire to renegotiate an agreement with Iran that guarantees that the latter does not acquire a nuclear weapon. New diplomacy would also address Iran’s ballistic missile program and its destabilizing activities in the Middle East. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Biden’s pick for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, have made statements in the last few days to confirm that the new US administration will treat Iran strictly. Blinken and Sullivan explained that the Biden administration is in no rush to reenter the nuclear deal with Iran and will not lift sanctions formerly imposed on the cleric-led country by the Trump administration. The nominee for top diplomat said he would seek a “longer and stronger” nuclear agreement with Iran.

Many have warned that Biden would be committing a massive foreign policy blunder if he moves forward with appointing Malley. Nevertheless, some have defended the potential candidate as a perfect fit for the position given the good relations he enjoys among circles connected to the Obama administration. If picked, Malley will replace Elliott Abrams, who last year replaced Brian Hook. The Biden administration has acknowledged its desire to renegotiate an agreement with Iran that guarantees that the latter does not acquire a nuclear weapon. New diplomacy would also address Iran’s ballistic missile program and its destabilizing activities in the Middle East. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Biden’s pick for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, have made statements in the last few days to confirm that the new US administration will treat Iran strictly. Blinken and Sullivan explained that the Biden administration is in no rush to reenter the nuclear deal with Iran and will not lift sanctions formerly imposed on the cleric-led country by the Trump administration. The nominee for top diplomat said he would seek a “longer and stronger” nuclear agreement with Iran.

News article:
GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards rejected on Thursday a U.S. claim that they tried to stop a British tanker in the Gulf a day earlier, the Guards said in a statement carried by the semi-official Fars news agency. Five boats believed to belong to the Guards approached a British oil tanker in the Gulf on Wednesday and asked it to stop in Iranian waters close by but withdrew after a British warship warned them, U.S. officials said. The Guards’ Navy said in a statement their patrol boats were carrying out normal duties, according to Fars. “In the past 24 hours there has been no encounter with foreign ships including English ships,” the statement said. However, the British government said on Thursday three Iranian vessels had tried to block the passage of the British Heritage through the Straits of Hormuz but backed off after receiving a warning. “HMS Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away,” a British government representative said in a statement. Tensions between Iran and the United States and its allies have risen sharply since Washington stepped up economic sanctions against Iran and moved to bring its oil exports to zero as part of a “maximum pressure” policy to make Iran halt actions that it said undermined regional security. British Royal Marines boarded an Iranian tanker, Grace 1, off Gibraltar last week and seized it on suspicion that it was breaking sanctions by taking oil to Syria.

South Korean tanker the MT Hankuk Chemi was boarded by armed members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) under the pretext of an unspecified inspection, an anonymous official from DM Shipping, which owns the vessel, told the AP. According to the source, the tanker was sailing from Jubail, Saudi Arabia, to Fujairah, the UAE, when Iranian forces requested to board the ship. The ship's captain reportedly alerted the company's security while IRGC troops were purportedly storming the ship. An Iranian helicopter was allegedly circling around the vessel during the process.

News article:
South Korea is sending military forces to respond to the seizure of one of its tankers by Iran, an endeavor in which it is seeking to work with other nations operating in the region. Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard announced Monday that its Zulfiqar fleet had seized a South Korean vessel operating in the Islamic Republic's First Naval District in the Persian Gulf "due to a series of violations of marine environmental laws" after it departed from Saudi Arabia's Al-Jubail port. The ship, Hankuk Chemi, was said to be transporting up to 7,200 tons of oil-based chemicals, and carrying a crew of South Korean, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Myanmar nationals. Both ship and crew are being held at Iran's Bandar Abbas port, where the Revolutionary Guard said "the issue is to be dealt with by the judicial officials." In response to the incident, a South Korean Defense Ministry official told Newsweek the country, officially known as the Republic of Korea (ROK), had "sent anti-piracy troops near the Strait of Hormuz for the ROK oil tanker directly." Asked if South Korea would seek support from the International Maritime Security Construct, a U.S.-led coalition of at least nine nations designed to prevent acts of sabotage and prevent Iran from seizing international ships after a restive 2019 near the Strait of Hormuz, the official said Seoul sought "close cooperation with regards to the ROK government's and multinational anti-piracy naval troops." The Strait of Hormuz is the world's most important maritime oil traffic chokepoint and a recurring flashpoint for U.S.-Iran tensions and threats that have severely escalated since Donald Trump took office in 2017. U.S. Central Command's Navy 5th Fleet did not immediately respond to Newsweek's for comment. The U.S. and South Korea are military allies and, while their mutual defense was established to ward off attacks from rival North Korea, it obliges each to come to the other's aid in the event of any "external armed attack." Anxieties over potential escalations in the Persian Gulf have run especially high around the one-year anniversary over the past weekend of the U.S. killing of Revolutionary Guard Quds Force commander Major General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq. Iranian permanent mission to the United Nations spokesperson Alireza Miryousefi recently denounced the killing of the influential and controversial Iranian military leader's death last year as "something that was almost universally condemned as an illegal and terror act (by even U.S. allies)." He added that "it has not affected Iran's national security policy." "What it has done is illustrate to the entire world the true nature of the Administration in flouting international law and norms, and the desperation it feels in its inability to bring Iran to its knees," he told Newsweek. "Iran has endured Trump and his allies, and will continue its foreign and security policies as it always has." Miryousefi added a warning. "There is an appearance that the U.S. is setting traps or provocations to provide an excuse to initiate armed conflict in the last days of the administration," he said. "Iran is fully prepared to defend itself and will, if it comes to pass, react openly and decisively." The U.S. military twice flew nuclear-capable B-52 bombers over the Middle East in recent weeks in a show of force against the Islamic Republic, which Trump accused of plotting to attack U.S. interests in the wake of a rocket attack that hit Washington's embassy in Baghdad last month. The U.S. leader has just over two weeks left in office but has refused to recognize the electoral victory of his rival, President-elect Joe Biden, who has signaled a more diplomatic approach to Iran. Uncertainty over Trump's actions have spread globally, and friends and foes alike have kept a careful eye on U.S. movements. The USS Nimitz aircraft carrier was set to depart the region but was abruptly ordered to remain due to "the recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other U.S. government officials," according to a statement issued Sunday by Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller. "No one should doubt the resolve of the United States of America," he added. The South Korean Foreign Ministry has called for the early release of Hankuk Chemi, the latest international ship to be seized by the Revolutionary Guard, which has a history of detaining foreign vessels deemed to be endangering maritime traffic or in violation of rules near or within the critical crossing. A ministry spokesperson later confirmed to Newsweek that the ship's crew were in good condition and that efforts were being made both in South Korea and Iran to ensure their safety. The spokesperson reiterated that consultations were being made both with Iran and other members of the international community to resolve the issue. A previously scheduled visit by First Vice Minister Choi Jong-kun to Iran on Sunday was set to take place regardless of the incident, the spokesperson said. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said additional information on the incident would soon be released, but maintained that "the matter is purely technical" and related to the vessel's alleged pollution of the waterway. "The Islamic Republic of Iran, like other countries, is sensitive to such violations, especially pollution of the marine environment, so it will deal with it within the framework of the law," Khatibzadeh said. "This incident is not exceptional and has occurred in similar previous cases in Iran and the waters of other countries, and is normal." South Korea was one of Iran's top oil buyers prior to the imposition of sanctions by the Trump administration after the unilateral exit of the U.S. from a 2015 nuclear deal in 2018. Tehran officials have since urged Seoul to release of billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen by South Korea as a result of its adherence to U.S. sanctions, though South Korea has so far refused despite successive meetings on the issue. Iran also enjoys friendly ties to North Korea, another U.S.-sanctioned state with which South Korea has struggled to improve relations amid an unprecedented peace process launched as Washington left the Iran nuclear agreement two and a half years ago. The U.S.-North Korea relationship has since frayed, leaving their future uncertain ahead of Biden's inauguration set for January 20 and North Korea's upcoming Eighth Party Congress set to be held sometime this month. As for Washington and Tehran, things remain especially tense as Iran—which, unlike North Korea, has maintained it didn't seek nuclear weapons—announced Monday it would enrich uranium at 20%, straying further from the limits of the nuclear deal the U.S. abandoned entirely under Trump. Iranian officials have assured that the country would immediately return to the accord's limits once the U.S. reentered into compliance, as Biden has vowed to do.

News article:
SEOUL: A Seoul government delegation sent to Tehran on Thursday will attempt to secure the release of a South Korean oil tanker seized by Iranian authorities near the Strait of Hormuz, the foreign ministry’s top official said. The South Korean-flagged MT Hankuk Chemi with 20 crew members on board was traveling from Saudi Arabia to the UAE when it was intercepted by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on Monday and taken to the port of Bandar Abbas. According to Iran, the ship violated environmental protocols — claims that the vessel’s operator has denied. “We will ask them to exchange due evidence or data to verify the facts,” Koh Kyung-sok, South Korea’s director-general of Africa and Middle East affairs, told reporters before boarding a plane at Incheon International Airport, west of the capital. Koh, who is leading the delegation, said that besides meeting their Iranian counterparts, Korean diplomats will hold talks with other Iranian stakeholders to resolve the issue. The delegation will travel to Iran via Qatar. While officials in Seoul say they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the standoff, the South Korean navy’s anti-piracy unit was deployed in waters near the Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday to “ensure the safety” of Korean nationals on board the MT Hankuk Chemi. The vessel’s crew of 20 includes nationals from South Korea, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam. All are reportedly safe. It remains unclear if negotiations between the South Korean delegation and Iranian authorities will be successful. When Seoul announced the plan to send the delegation earlier this week, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Saeed Khatibzadeh, was quoted by the state news agency IRNA as saying that the South Korean government’s behavior is “incomprehensible.” Khatibzadeh claimed that the matter is moving “along its legal path and does not require a diplomatic trip.” Diplomatic sources and South Korean experts believe the ship’s seizure is linked to tensions over the freezing of Iran’s money in South Korean banks under US financial sanctions. Iranian assets worth $7 billion in two Korean bank accounts have been frozen after the Trump administration withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018 and toughened sanctions against the Islamic Republic. In an effort to end the impasse, Seoul and Tehran discussed using the frozen money to purchase $1 billion of medical equipment. Iran has also reportedly requested the use of $10 million or more from the frozen assets to buy coronavirus vaccines from the global vaccine procurement facility COVAX. Jung Sang-ryul, a professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Affairs at Myongji University in Seoul, believes that the current standoff will be solved through diplomatic channels. “There is a high possibility the confrontation will be settled diplomatically,” he told Arab News, adding that Seoul-Tehran relations are unlikely to be compromised by the incident. The two countries enjoy strong economic ties, with South Korea the third-largest importer of Iranian oil in 2017. South Korea also became the biggest buyer of Iranian condensate, which its petrochemical industry processed in refineries designed to handle the commodity. However, following US sanctions, South Korea’s oil imports from Iran fell from $7.8 billion to $2.1 billion by 2019 with no further imports last year. “Relations between the US and Iran are the problem, not between South Korean and Iran,” Jung said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it was seeking details about 25 of its nationals who were among 61 crew on two supertankers seized by Indonesia on suspicion of illegally transferring oil. Panamanian-flagged MT Freya tanker is escorted to Batam, Riau Islands, Indonesia January 26, 2021 in this still image taken from video. Indonesian Coast Guard (BAKAMLA)/Indonesian Navy (TNI AL)/Handout via REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES. MANDATORY CREDIT Indonesia said on Sunday it had seized the vessels after they were detected making the transfer from Iranian-flagged MT Horse to Panamanian-flagged MT Freya, causing an oil spill. The Indonesian authorities said the seizure was not related to U.S. sanctions, which Washington imposed in a bid to shut off Iran’s oil exports in a dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The MT Horse, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company, and MT Freya, managed by Shanghai Future Ship Management Co, were detected off Indonesia’s Kalimantan island. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said 25 of the crew members were Chinese, without saying whether the crew were all on one vessel or split between both. “Our embassy has expressed concern to Indonesia,” Zhao said. “We urged them to verify the situation about the Chinese seamen as soon as possible and inform us formally.” He said China called on Indonesia to conduct an investigation “fairly and in accordance with the law”. Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah, told Reuters there had been “initial communication” with China and Iran, and said further discussion would depend on results from the investigation. Iran’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday the seizure of its tanker was over a technical issue and that it had asked Indonesia to provide more details. Iran has been accused of seeking to conceal the destination of its oil sales by disabling tracking systems on its tankers. The Indonesian authorities said the ships concealed their identity by not showing national flags, turning off automatic identification systems and failing to respond to a radio call. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires ships to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards. “We welcome the Indonesian Coast Guard efforts to counter illicit maritime activity,” a U.S. embassy spokesman in Jakarta told Reuters, saying Washington supported efforts to ensure IMO standards for safety and environmental compliance were upheld.

News article:
The crew of a South Korean tanker seized by Iran are still on board the ship, Seoul said Thursday, despite Tehran announcing earlier this week it would release them in a humanitarian move. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized the Hankuk Chemi and arrested its multinational crew of 20 sailors near the strategic Strait of Hormuz on January 4, saying it had polluted the waters. The development came as Tehran urged Seoul to release billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen in South Korea due to US sanctions. On Tuesday, Iran's foreign ministry said the crew of the seized tanker had been granted permission to leave the country "in a humanitarian move", although it would retain the vessel and its captain. South Korean reports say the partial release complicates the situation as the ship needs personnel present to maintain it. All the crew members remained on board, Seoul's foreign ministry said Thursday, adding South Korean officials had been allowed to meet them Wednesday for the first time since the seizure. "The foreign ministry is discussing with the tanker company on the disembarkation and return of the crew and will put all efforts to secure the release of the captain and the ship as early as possible," it said in a statement. A representative at the tanker company DM Shipping said nothing was certain despite Tehran's announcement the crew would be released. "Discussions for their return are still ongoing," he told AFP. "It hasn't been decided whether they will return 100 percent." The arrested crew were from South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Former US president Donald Trump in 2018 withdrew Washington from a landmark nuclear agreement with world powers and then reimposed and reinforced crippling sanctions on Iran. Iran was a key oil supplier to resource-poor South Korea until Washington's rules blocked the purchases. According to government spokesman Ali Rabiei, Iran has $7 billion of funds blocked in Seoul. Tehran has repeatedly denied any link between the ship's seizure and the funds issue.

News article:
Iran has no knowledge of US plans to seize some two million barrels' worth of crude oil on board the Achilleas tanker, Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia has said. “I don’t know anything about it”, the deputy oil minister said while speaking to reporters in Tehran on Sunday, as cited by Bloomberg. Zamaninia’s comments come in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the DoJ last week charging that the tanker had been used by the Revolutionary Guards and its elite Quds Force formation (which the US designates as "terrorist organisations") to smuggle Iranian oil abroad and avoid crushing US restrictions. According to the complaint, Capital Ship Management Corp, the tanker’s Greece-based operator, appeared to have no knowledge about the oil’s true origins. The Achilleas was reportedly ordered to set course for the US shortly before Joe Biden’s inauguration as president last month. The forfeiture complaint, filed with the US District Court for the District of Columbia, claims that the ship carried out a ship-to-ship transfer of crude in October 2020 in the Gulf of Oman near the Emirati port of Fujairah. Officially, the ship was said to have been chartered to carry a cargo of Basrah light crude to China.

News article:
A photo released by the US Department of Justice shows the Bella oil tanker seized by the US. AFP file photo Asharq Al-Awsat The United States has sold more than a million barrels of Iranian fuel seized under its sanctions program last year, a Department of Justice official said, as another ship with intercepted Iranian crude oil sails to a US port. The seizures are part of Washington's tough economic sanctions on Tehran imposed over its nuclear program and the US designation of a number of Iranian groups as terrorists. In a new approach last year, the administration of former US President Donald Trump used civil forfeiture procedures to seize some 1.2 million barrels of gasoline it said were being sent from Iran to Venezuela aboard four tankers. Department of Justice spokesman Marc Raimondi told Reuters this week that the sale of the cargoes had been completed, adding that the government was "still working out the final expenses." "The petroleum has been seized, and an interlocutory sale has preserved the cash value of the petroleum, which is now held by the US Marshals Service" he said. The value of the gasoline was not known, but was likely worth tens of millions of dollars based on benchmark European gasoline prices. Raimondi said the department still needs the US District Court in Washington, DC, to enter an order of forfeiture "and then the funds will be transferred to the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund." Last week, the United States filed a lawsuit to seize another cargo, this one of crude oil it says came from Iran -rather than Iraq, as stated on the bill of lading - contravening US terrorism regulations.

News article:
The US has finished selling the 1.2 million barrels of fuel it seized from tankers purportedly sent by Iran to Venezuela, spokesman for the Department of Justice, Marc Raimondi, said in an interview with Reuters. The US official did not mention the sale price of the petroleum, but if it was anywhere near the price tag on benchmark European gasoline, then Washington could have made tens of millions of dollars on the deal, Reuters suggested. This bulk of the cash will go to the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund after a district court in Washington, DC rules to approve the order of forfeiture, Raimondi claimed. The fund was created to award payouts to the victims of terrorism the US linked to a nation unilaterally designated by Washington as a "state sponsor of terrorism". The list of such "sponsors" currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Sudan was recently removed from the list in exchange for normalising ties with Israel. US Seizure of 'Iranian' Fuel The fuel the US sold was originally seized from tankers that, according to Washington, carried it from Iran to Venezuela as part of the help from the Islamic Republic to crisis-hit Caracas. The vessels in question did not travel under the Iranian flag and were intercepted at sea under civil forfeiture procedures, with their cargo unloaded onto other ships and then delivered to US soil. Iran claims the fuel on these tankers did not belong to it and insists that all of its tankers, sailing under the country's flag, successfully reached Venezuela.

News article:
Cairo- Mohammed Abdu Hassanein Egypt has been seeking to push Ethiopia to conclude a binding legal agreement that spares it the potential negative impact of the mega dam, which Addis Ababa is constructing on the Nile River. Cairo fears the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) would affect the flow of its annual share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic meters of water especially that it relies on it for more than 90 percent of its water supplies. In a phone conversation with his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi stressed his country’s firm position on formulating a binding legal agreement that preserves Egyptian water rights and includes Sudan, Ethiopia, and Egypt. The agreement shall define the rules for filling and operating the dam while preserving Cairo’s water rights, he noted. The African Union has been sponsoring talks among Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum since July and attended by observers from the United States and the European Union. For nearly a decade, talks over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered. The latest GERD meeting was held on Nov. 21 between Egypt and Ethiopia’s irrigation ministers. Sudan boycotted the talks, calling on the AU to change the negotiation’s approach and expand the role of experts. The ministers agreed to prepare separate reports, including their countries’ visions to advance the negotiations, and send them to South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Dr. Naledi Pandor. According to Presidential spokesman Bassam Rady, Sisi received a phone call from Ramaphosa during which both sides discussed and exchanged views on the issue. Ramaphosa praised Egypt’s efforts to reach a solution on this vital issue and called for coordination during the coming period to work on reaching a fair and balanced agreement. South Africa’s term ends at the end of 2020 and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will take over the AU presidency in 2021. On Saturday, Sisi also held a phone conversation with his Congolese counterpart Felix Tshisekedi during which they discussed regional and continental issues of mutual interest.

News article:
Egypt slammed on Thursday the statements of Ethiopia’s foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti, made on Tuesday, regarding Cairo’s internal affairs, describing them as a “flagrant transgression.” Egypt’s foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Hafez said Mufti's statements on Egypt were "totally unacceptable." Mufti, Ethiopia’s former ambassador to Cairo, claimed that Egypt "has turned Ethiopia into a threat" and that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) would cause thirst and hunger for Egyptians, reflecting on the "depth of the internal crisis in Egypt." “The statements represent a blunt violation of commitments scribed in the constitutional foundations of the African Union, which stipulate clearly in its fourth article a commitment by member countries on non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs,” Hafez said. "This is considered a violation of established African values which promote fraternity and respect for the other," Hafez added. The Egyptian foreign ministry summoned the Ethiopian chargé d'affaires to Cairo on Wednesday to clarify the background of Mufti's statements. A day earlier, according to news reports, Mufti criticised Egypt’s approach towards the GERD, which Ethiopia has started building on the Blue Nile in 2011. Mufti also claimed that Egypt "is doing this to create a distraction from its internal problems," and to blame Ethiopia on the near-finished dam. In response, Hafez stressed on Thursday that the transgression against the Egyptian state and the interference in its internal affairs are nothing but "a continuation of the approach to employ an aggressive tone and to inflame emotions." This approach, Hafez added, aims at covering the "successive Ethiopian failures" on multiple levels, internally and externally, whereas Egypt has always preferred to refrain from discussing the internal developments in Ethiopia. "The Ethiopian spokesperson should have paid attention to the deteriorating conditions in his country, which is witnessing many conflicts and human tragedies that have led to the killing of hundreds and the displacement of tens of thousands of innocent citizens," the Egyptian foreign ministry spokesperson said. The latest of such Ethiopian incidents are the events in the Ethiopian Tigray and Benishangul regions in full view of everyone, as well as the continuous tension and instability in the Oromia region, he noted. The war in the Tigray region between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Ethiopian government troops has been ongoing for several weeks. According to Reuters, it has killed hundreds and probably thousands, sent tens of thousands of refugees across the border into Sudan, enmeshed Eritrea, impacted a peacekeeping mission in Somalia, and heightened frictions between Ethiopia's myriad ethnic groups. On Friday, Reuters quoted a volunteer from the country's Red Cross as saying that the death toll from an attack on 23 December in the western Benishangul-Gumuz region of Ethiopia has risen to 222 people. This, Hafez added, comes in addition to the Ethiopian continuous hostile practices towards its regional surroundings, including what the border strip with Sudan has witnessed recently in terms of military actions and escalating tension. There have been armed clashes between Sudanese and Ethiopian forces in recent weeks. Tensions in the border region have flared since the outbreak of conflict in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region in early November and the arrival of more than 50,000 mainly Tigrayan refugees in eastern Sudan. On Saturday, the Sudanese information minister said that Khartoum has taken control of most of the land it accuses Ethiopians of encroaching upon near the border between the two countries.

News article:
CAIRO: Egypt's foreign ministry said it has summoned Ethiopia's top diplomat in Cairo over comments by an Addis Ababa official regarding a controversial dam on the Nile. The Egyptian ministry "summoned the Ethiopian Charge d'Affaires in Cairo to explain comments by the spokesperson for the Ethiopian Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding domestic Egyptian affairs," it said late Wednesday. The statement did not cite specific comments but followed a statement by the Ethiopian official on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's biggest hydroelectric project, which has raised fears for vital water supplies downstream in Egypt and Sudan. "They know the GERD won't harm them, it's a diversion from internal problems," Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian ministry's spokesman and a former ambassador to Egypt, said Tuesday. Mufti contended that without this "distraction", Egypt and Sudan would "have to deal with many local issues waiting to explode, especially up there (in Egypt)." The three countries have been in talks since 2011 but have failed to reach a deal on filling the dam. The negotiations have been stalled since August. The Nile, the world's longest river at 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles), is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to 10 countries. Ethiopia views the dam as essential for its growing power needs, and insists that the flow of water downstream will not be affected. But Egypt, a country of more than 100 million people who depend on the Nile for 97 percent of their water needs, opposes unilateral moves by Ethiopia. Along with Sudan, it has called for a legally binding political solution to the dispute.

In press statements, Egypt’s foreign ministry Spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Mohamed Abdel-Aty will participate in the negotiations. Sudan will also participate in the GERD negotiations under the leadership of the current AU chair, South Africa, with the talks due to be held after a one-month deadlock caused by Khartoum’s withdrawal from the talks, when it objected to the adopted methodology of the talks. A source told Sudanese news agency SUNA that "the meeting will discuss Sudan’s proposal, aimed at reactivating the negotiations by giving a greater role to the AU experts" to reach a binding legal agreement on the GERD, which Ethiopia started building on the Blue Nile in 2011. The European Union (EU), which acts as an observer to the negotiations, has welcomed the resumption of the GERD talks, describing it as one that “offers an important opportunity for progress towards an agreement on the filling and related operations of the dam.” “As an observer to the talks, the EU encourages all the parties to show the political will to engage in this round of talks in a constructive and open-minded spirit,” a statement by the spokesperson said. The scheduled talks come days after Egypt slammed statements made by Ethiopia’s foreign ministry Spokesman Dina Mufti, last week, regarding Cairo’s internal affairs, describing them as a “flagrant transgression.” Mufti, Ethiopia’s former ambassador to Cairo, claimed that Egypt "has turned Ethiopia into a threat" and that it would cause thirst and hunger for Egyptians, reflecting on the "depth of the internal crisis in Egypt.” The Egyptian foreign ministry summoned last week the Ethiopian chargé d'affaires to Cairo for clarifications over Mufti's statements. Egypt and Sudan have been in talks with Ethiopia for a decade to reach a legally binding agreement on the filling and operating of the $4.8 billion near-complete mega dam. South Africa has been mediating negotiations recently between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia to resolve the dispute. The GERD, built 15 kilometres from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since its construction began in 2011. The first filling of the controversial dam took place last summer, despite Ethiopia not having reached a binding agreement with its downstream neighbours. Cairo fears the massive hydropower project will significantly cut its crucial water supplies from the Nile River, while Sudan fears it could endanger the safety of its own dams. Ethiopia says the 6,000-megawatt dam is key to its development and hopes to become Africa’s biggest electricity exporter. Search Keywords: Short link:

The recent round of talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan concerning the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has gotten off to a rough start after Khartoum skipped Monday's meeting in objection to "not receiving a response to its request to grant experts participating in the negotiations a greater role." After a one-month impasse, the three nations held a meeting on Sunday, agreeing to resume the talks under the brokerage of the AU for one week as of today, and to hold a follow-up meeting next Sunday, which will be attended by the three countries' irrigation and foreign ministers to review the outcome of the week-long round of talks. After Sudan's decision, today's meeting was terminated by Egypt, Ethiopia and the AU observers, according to a statement issued by the Egyptian irrigation ministry, which said that "the negotiations require the participation of the three parties to reach a legally-binding agreement on the rules of filling and operating the GERD." In an official statement, the Sudanese irrigation ministry said Khartoum voiced its reservation about participating in today's trilateral meeting without holding a bilateral meeting with AU's experts and observers on the same day. "Based on the outcomes of the trilateral ministerial meeting held on Sunday, Sudan asked for holding a bilateral meeting with the African Union's experts as well as observers in the evening of the same day, [but] Sudan did not receive a response to its request," the ministry added. The AU-mediated talks have been observed by representatives from the EU, the US, the AU, as well as legal and technical experts. “Sudan received an invitation to continue the direct trilateral negotiations, which prompted it to express its reservation about participating in [today's meeting]," the ministry said. The Sudanese side reasserted its position about the necessity of giving a bigger role to the AU's experts to facilitate negotiations and reconcile opinions. Also, the Sudanese irrigation ministry affirmed its adherence to the negotiation process under the aegis of the continental body in accordance with the principle of "African solutions to African problems," the statement added. According to the Egyptian irrigation ministry, the participating parties in today's meeting agreed to refer the matter to South Africa, the current chair of the AU, to review the coming steps during the anticipated six-member meeting between the three countries' irrigation and foreign ministers next Sunday. This is the second time Sudan has skipped AU-mediated meetings. In November, Sudan decided to not take part in a tripartite ministerial meeting that was scheduled to discuss guidelines for further negotiations, saying that the way previous talks were held proved to be "unproductive." Ethiopia and the African Union have yet not commented on Sudan’s step. Egypt and Sudan have been in talks with Ethiopia for a decade to reach a legally binding agreement on the filling and operating of the near-complete $4.8 billion mega dam. The GERD, built 15 kilometres from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since its construction began in 2011.

News article:
A handout satellite image shows a closeup view of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia (Reuters) Cairo, Khartoum- Mohammed Abdu Hassanein and Mohammed Amin Yassine Sudan announced it was not attending the new round of talks on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), in a new setback for the negotiation process led by the African Union (AU). The AU called Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan for a one-week round of negotiations on January 3 to discuss the GERD issue, after talks had been suspended for a month. A six-way meeting was also scheduled for the end of the week between foreign and irrigation ministers of the three countries, chaired by South Africa, current AU president, to consider the outcomes of the tripartite negotiations round. The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation announced that Ethiopia sent an invitation for the meeting, which was also meant to include irrigation ministers, technical and legal delegations, and AU observers and experts. However, Sudan announced its reservation over participation in the Tripartite Ministerial Meeting, requesting a bilateral meeting with the AU experts and observers. Sudan’s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources explained in a statement that it did not receive a response to its request, but received an invitation to resume the direct tripartite negotiations. “Instead of a reply to this request, Sudan received an invitation for a direct tripartite meeting, so it has expressed its reservations over participating in this meeting.” Khartoum reiterated its firm position on the necessity of giving a greater role to the Union experts to facilitate negotiations. Egypt agreed with Ethiopia to raise the matter to the South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, so that future steps will be discussed during the ministerial meeting, scheduled for January 10. The three countries have been engaged in strenuous negotiations for about 10 years to agree on mechanisms for operating and filling the dam, without yielding any results so far. Cairo and Khartoum want to reach an agreement before the second phase of filling the reservoir in a way that achieves the common interests of the three countries and secures Egypt's rights and water interests. Addis Ababa finished last July the first phase of filling the reservoir, in preparation for its operation, and the second phase is expected to begin next June. The negotiations are held with the participation of experts and observers from the US, EU, World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the African Union.

News article:
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia on Saturday summoned the U.S. ambassador over what it called an “incitement of war” between Ethiopia and Egypt from President Donald Trump over their dispute about the filling and operation of a massive hydropower dam. Slideshow ( 2 images ) Trump called on Friday for an agreement between the countries, but added it was a dangerous situation and that Cairo could end up “blowing up that dam”. Ethiopian Foreign Affairs Minister Gedu Andargachew summoned U.S. Ambassador to Addis Ababa Mike Raynor to seek clarifications on the comments. “The incitement of war between Ethiopia and Egypt from a sitting U.S. president neither reflects the longstanding partnership and strategic alliance between Ethiopia and the United States nor is acceptable in international law governing interstate relations,” Gedu’s ministry said in a statement. Trump made the comments during a call with Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok following Sudan and Israel’s announcement to normalise ties. Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt have been locked in a bitter dispute over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which remains unresolved although the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July. Trump said on Friday he had brokered an agreement to resolve the issue but that Ethiopia had broken the pact, forcing him to cut funds, adding: “They will never see that money unless they adhere to the agreement ... You can’t blame Egypt for being a little upset.” He said he had also urged Egypt to resolve the dispute. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s office said earlier on Saturday: “Occasional statements of belligerent threats to have Ethiopia succumb to unfair terms still abound.” The first phase of filling the dam was completed in August, it said. Egypt says it is dependent on the Nile for more than 90% of its scarce fresh water supplies, and fears the dam could have a devastating effect on its economy. Abiy’s office said there had been significant progress made in resolving the dispute since the African Union took over the negotiations. “Now is the time for action and not for increasing tensions,” European Union’s European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said before the Ethiopian ministry issued its statement.

News article:
Khartoum insists on granting bigger role for experts participating in the talks as well as reaching a comprehensive and binding agreement The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) negotiations between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia are scheduled to resume on Sunday under the aegis of the African Union (AU), along with the participation of each country’s foreign and irrigation ministers. Sunday’s gathering is expected to look into Sudan’s absence from last week's talks and review the coming steps of the long-running standoff, which has been of concern to Cairo and Khartoum since 2011. Sudan skipped the meeting, according to an official statement released last week, in objection to not receiving a response to its demands of holding bilateral meetings between the AU experts participating in the negotiations and each of the three countries' representatives separately to discuss and identify points of differences while continuing to hold only trilateral meetings between the three countries' negotiating teams. The AU-mediated talks have been observed by representatives from the EU, the US, the AU, as well as legal and technical experts. Only 24 hours before Sunday's six-member meeting, Sudan called for the AU to play a leading and more effective role in the negotiations, which the continental body has been mediating. The call came during a meeting held on Saturday between the Sudanese negotiating team and the AU experts' team participating in the talks that are being held. During the bilateral meeting, the Sudanese side called for granting experts a bigger role and establishing a clear frame of reference for their role, the Sudanese official news agency SUNA reported. Sudan affirmed the need for the AU to “play a leading” and “effective” role more than it had been doing during the previous rounds of negotiations, SUNA added. The team reiterated the necessity of reaching a comprehensive and binding agreement on the rule of filling and operating the dam, that includes clear mechanisms for settling potential disputes. The Sudanese government warned that it would withdraw from Sunday's meeting if its demand of granting a bigger role for experts will not be met, the Saudi-owned new website Asharq reported, citing Sudanese diplomatic sources. The GERD, built 15 kilometres from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since its construction began in 2011. Cairo fears the project will significantly cut its crucial water supplies from the River Nile, while Sudan has concerns over how the reservoir will be managed. Ethiopia says the massive project - which it hopes will make it Africa’s largest power exporter - is key to its development efforts. Search Keywords: Short link:

Sudan reiterated the necessity of reaching a legally binding agreement on the rules for filling and operating the near-complete dam to preserve the interests of all three nations Khartoum has said it "will not accept the imposition of a fait accompli policy" in the dispute caused by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), referring to Ethiopia's intention to embark on the second filling of the dam's reservoir in July despite a lack of agreement with downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdok and the Sudanese higher committee for following up on the GERD developments held a meeting on Monday, where it was stated that risking the safety of 20 million Sudanese whose lives rely on the Blue Nile is unacceptable. The meeting reiterated Sudan’s stance on the necessity of reaching a legally binding agreement on the rules for filling and operating the near-complete dam to preserve the interests of all three nations, Sudanese news agency SUNA reported. Also, the meeting dealt with the potential hazards of Ethiopia's anticipated step to start the second filling of the dam in July without reaching an agreement. The meeting highlighted the consequences of this step, if it happens, on the safety of the operation of the Sudanese Roseires Dam, which is located close to the GERD, and other water facilities in the country. In a step that angered Sudan and Egypt, Addis Ababa declared last summer that it had achieved the first-year filling (4.9 billion cubic metres) during the rainy season flooding of the Blue Nile. Days following the move by Ethiopia, Sudan announced that it had recorded a decline in water levels on the Blue Nile coming from Ethiopia. Both downstream countries have repeatedly reiterated their rejection of taking any unilateral action without reaching a binding agreement. Khartoum and Cairo have been in talks with Addis Ababa for a decade to reach a legally binding agreement on the filling and operating of the $4.8 billion mega-dam, which has been under construction on the Blue Nile since 2011. The Sudanese remarks come almost two weeks after Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas sent a letter to the African Union (AU), the current mediator of the dam negotiations, expressing his country’s grave concerns over Addis Ababa's announcement that it would go on with the second filling of the GERD in the summer of 2021. Monday's talks, attended by Sudan's cabinet members and directors of the General Intelligence Service and Military Intelligence, came a week after the latest round of GERD talks failed to resolve the differences between the three countries. The talks tackled alternative options after the halt of the AU negotiations, according to SUNA. The last round of negotiations came to a standstill over Sudan’s withdrawal due to its rejection of the methodology upon which the negotiations were held, calling for a bigger role by the experts assigned by the AU to reconcile opinions instead of the direct trilateral talks.

CAIRO (Reuters) - The Egyptian foreign ministry summoned the Ethiopian Chargé d’Affairs to Cairo on Wednesday to provide clarifications over comments made by the spokesman of the Ethiopian foreign ministry, it said. The comments “addressed” Egyptian internal affairs, the ministry added without providing more details. It was not immediately clear what comments had angered Egypt. Egyptian officials were not immediately available to comment. However, Qatar’s Al Jazeera Media Network reported earlier today that Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesperson, attacked Cairo for criticizing a giant dam that Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile and using the project to cover several internal problems. Reuters could not immediately verify the translation of his comments by Al Jazeera. Negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan failed so far to end a bitter dispute between the three countries over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) even after the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July. Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile fears the multi-billion dollar dam could devastate its economy.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia warned Sudan on Tuesday it was running out of patience with its neighbour’s continued military build-up in a disputed border area despite attempts to diffuse tensions with diplomacy. The decades-old dispute over al-Fashqa, land within Sudan’s international boundaries that has long been settled by Ethiopian farmers, erupted into weeks of clashes between forces from both sides late last year. “The Sudanese side seems to be pushing in so as to inflame the situation on the ground,” Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti told reporters. “Is Ethiopia going to start a war? Well, we are saying let’s work on diplomacy.” “How long will Ethiopia continue to resolve the issue using diplomacy? Well, there is nothing that has no limit. Everything has a limit,” he told a briefing in Addis Ababa. Sudan’s information minister and government spokesman Feisal Mohamed Saleh said the country did not want war with Ethiopia but its forces would respond to any aggression. “We fear that these comments contain a hostile position towards Sudan. We ask of Ethiopia to stop attacking Sudanese territory and Sudanese farmers,” he told Reuters. Sudan said on Dec. 31 that it had taken control of all of Sudanese territory in the area. Ethiopia says Sudan took advantage of its forces being distracted by the Tigray conflict to occupy Ethiopian land and loot properties. The United Nations said in a report last week on the humanitarian situation in Tigray that there were reports of a military build-up on both sides of the border around the area. The border tensions come at a time when Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt are also trying to resolve a three-way row over Ethiopia’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ethiopia sees the dam as key to plans to become Africa’s largest power exporter. Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile, fears the dam across the Blue Nile could devastate its economy. Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan said on Sunday that they reached a new impasse in the dispute. Egypt and Ethiopia separately blamed Sudanese objections to the framework for the talks. On Tuesday, Ethiopia’s Dina criticised both Egypt and Sudan for delaying the negotiations. “Are the two speaking the same language? More or less. The two are speaking the same language when it comes to stalling it.”

News article:
CAIRO: The Arab League said on Tuesday that it supports the rights of Egypt and Sudan in the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) dispute, warning Ethiopia about rising tensions over the issue. It also said that Ethiopia “must deal rationally” to protect Egyptian and Sudanese rights in the dispute. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, secretary-general of the body, expressed his appreciation of the role played by the African Union in sponsoring negotiations between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia regarding GERD. “We hope that these negotiations will lead to their desired goal, which is to reach a legal, binding and fair agreement that takes into account the interests of all parties and organizes the process of filling and operating the dam, preserving the water rights of Egypt and Sudan,” he said during the ninth General Cooperation meeting between the African Union Commission and the League of Arab States. “Ethiopia must deal rationally to ensure the rights of Sudan and Egypt in the waters of the Nile. The Arab League has a resolution to support the rights of Egypt and Sudan in the waters of the Nile,” he added. Ethiopia had accused Egypt and Sudan of obstructing negotiations and responded to rumors of an imminent conflict over Nile waters. “The prediction about the outbreak of a war over the waters of the Nile is wrong … it is a factor in strengthening and developing the Nile Basin countries,” Ethiopian Minister of Irrigation Seleshi Bekele said in statements to Al-Jazeera. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the six-party meeting held on Jan. 10 to discuss the dam failed to achieve any progress, while Sudan warned that discussions cannot continue indefinitely, given the threat posed by the dam. The Sudanese government also warned against a second filling of the dam before an agreement is reached. The country said it cannot accept the imposition of a de facto policy that threatens the safety of 20 million Sudanese citizens who depend on the Blue Nile. Sudan stressed the need for a binding legal agreement on filling and operating the dam that preserves and takes into account the interests of all three parties.

News article:
Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein Egypt has continued its international diplomatic efforts to move forward the stalled talks on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), hoping to pressure Ethiopia to reach a legally binding agreement on regulating the dam’s filling and operation. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi received on Tuesday his Congolese counterpart Felix Tshisekedi, the next president of the African Union (AU), which has been sponsoring talks between Cairo, Khartoum and Addis Ababa since July 2020. According to presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady, they discussed the latest regional developments, especially the GERD issue, and agreed to bolster coordination and joint consultation. Sisi highlighted Egypt’s position that “the Nile River is a source of cooperation and development and a lifeline that links peoples of the Nile Basin countries.” Leaders held individual discussions followed by expanded discussions between both countries’ delegations, the presidential statement noted. The statement quoted Tshisekedi as expressing appreciation for the distinguished historic relations with Egypt and the sincere and firm Egyptian political support for Congo. He stressed his country’s keenness to develop these relations in various fields, especially trade and economic cooperation. Meanwhile, the Egyptian embassy in Washington held on Monday an expanded virtual session with Congress aides from the House and Senate. During the session, Ambassador Motaz Zahran reviewed the GERD’s “negative impact” on Egypt and Sudan’s water security. Cairo is not opposed to Ethiopia's right to development, provided that its aspirations do not affect Egyptian interests and water security, Zahran stressed. The meeting aims to provide an accurate explanation to Congress members on Egypt’s stance on the negotiations. Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries, and include a mechanism for settling disputes filling and operation of the dam. They fear the potential negative impact of GERD on the flow of their annual share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic meters of water. The GERD dispute has taken two courses of so far faltered negotiations. The first was mediated by the US, the World Bank and European Union observers in early 2020 and the second by the AU.

News article:
Sudan has recently started to state clearly that a legally binding solution is the only way out of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) crisis and Khartoum will not accept a second filling of the dam in the absence of an agreement, noted a diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity. He added that “Addis Ababa has always found a reason for procrastination and will use its current internal problems in the Tigray region together with mounting tension with Sudan” to continue along the same path, despite Khartoum’s position growing closer to Cairo’s. That Sudan had now joined Egypt in stating unequivocally that a legally binding agreement is the only way out of the dam impasse is unlikely to shift Addis Ababa’s position, says Abbas Sharaki, professor of geology and water resources at Cairo University. For that to happen, he argues, Egypt and Sudan need to unify their stand across the dam file. Egypt also reiterated its position on the dam this week when President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi repeated Cairo’s longstanding position that a legally-binding agreement is needed to resolve the crisis during a meeting in Cairo with the chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki. Faki was in Egypt to exchange views with Cairo on a range of African issues, including the upcoming AU Summit scheduled for 6 and 7 February, and the commission’s leadership elections which will be held on the periphery of the summit. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri held a separate meeting with Faki during which he stressed Egypt’s continued willingness to engage in serious negotiations in order to reach a legally binding agreement, provided it is matched by a similar commitment on the Ethiopian side. Speaking to the newly-elected House of Representatives last week about the latest developments over GERD, Shoukri underlined that Egypt will not allow anyone to impose de facto policies or control the Nile. He told MPs that Cairo had managed to involve the international community in the dam file, one result of which was the unprecedented UN Security Council session in June 2020 addressing the dispute. Last week, Sudan’s acting Foreign Minister Omar Qamareddin told the media that “a binding agreement that regulates the filling and operating of the dam is a must,” a position that Khartoum is increasingly keen to explain to the world. Last week, it held a series of meetings with foreign ambassadors in Khartoum, including representatives of UN Security Council permanent member states. Continuing the diplomatic push, this week Sudan’s Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasser Abbas met the German and Spanish ambassadors to Khartoum. Late last month, Abbas and Qamareddin visited the Congolese capital Kinshasa where they met with Felix Antoine Cheskidy, president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC will take over the chairmanship of the AU from South Africa during this weekend’s AU summit. During their meeting, the Sudanese officials said Khartoum was ready to continue with the AU-mediated tripartite negotiations. Cheskidy, in turn, said he would discuss the issue with Egypt and Ethiopia in an attempt to close the gap between the three parties. Political analysts question whether the Congo can succeed in pushing forward a deal on the dam, something South Africa failed to do during last year’s AU-mediated talks. Sharaki is far from optimistic, not least because “the AU lacks a strong mechanism to impose its resolutions its member states.” Hani Raslan, an expert on African affairs at Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, argues that however differently Congo manages the file it is unlikely to lead to an agreement. “Ethiopia has already rejected the mediation of the World Bank and the US. What we now need is concerted international pressure, from the US and influential European states, especially those involved in the building of the dam, like Italy and the UK. If the international will is there, Addis Ababa will have to respond,” says Raslan. Sudan withdrew twice from the AU-mediated talks called by South Africa, demanding a greater role for AU experts in mediating the dispute, and claiming the current negotiating approach had rendered the talks redundant. Although both Egypt and Sudan have said repeatedly they cannot accept a second filling before an agreement is reached, Addis Ababa insists it will go ahead and fill the reservoir this summer regardless of whether an agreement is in place. Ethiopia’s Irrigation Minister Selshi Bekele tweeted this week that “construction progresses as scheduled. Support of Ethiopians for GERD at home and abroad is at its climax. We shall deliver this clean energy for the prosperity of Ethiopia and Africa.” The first filling of the dam’s reservoir took place last summer despite the absence of a binding agreement, a move that angered Cairo and Khartoum, both of whom saw it as a violation of the Declaration of Principles (DoP) signed in Sudan in March 2015. The DoP states that the three countries must first agree on guidelines and rules for the operating processes of the dam before filling the reservoir. The dam, 15km from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since construction began in 2011. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 February , 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

(Adds details, background) By Khalid Abdelaziz KHARTOUM, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Any unilateral step by Ethiopia to fill its hydropower project, called the Renaissance Dam, in July would directly threaten Sudan's national security, Sudanese Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Yasser Abbas said on Saturday. Sudan is also proposing a mediation role for the United States, European Union, United Nations and African Union as a way of breaking the deadlock in talks about the dam between Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia, Abbas told Reuters in an interview. His comments come at a time of increased tension between Sudan and Ethiopia over disputed farmland near their shared border. This is on top of tension over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, close to the border with Sudan. Ethiopia began filling the reservoir behind the dam after the summer rains last year despite demands from Egypt and Sudan that it should first reach a binding agreement on the dam's operation. Egypt views the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as a major threat to its fresh water supplies, more than 90% of which come from the Nile. The Blue Nile flows north into Sudan then Egypt and is the Nile's main tributary. Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development. "The filling of the Renaissance Dam by one side next July represents a direct threat to Sudan's national security," said Abbas. He said unilateral filling of the reservoir threatened electricity generation from Sudan's Merowe Dam and Roseires Dam, as well as the safety of the Roseires Dam and of 20 million Sudanese living downstream of the GERD. Sudanese drinking water stations could also be put at risk, he added. The African Union has convened recent negotiations over the GERD between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt but talks have repeatedly stalled. Talks hosted by the United States last year also failed to secure a deal. "Sudan is now leading a diplomatic and political campaign to clarify its position and reach a legal and binding solution," Abbas said. "We are optimistic that if there is political will, a mutually agreed solution can be reached."

News article:
Any unilateral step by Ethiopia to fill its Dam in July would directly threaten Sudan's national security, Sudanese Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Yasser Abbas said Sudan warned Ethiopia Saturday against going ahead with the second phase of filling its mega dam on the Blue Nile, saying it would pose a "direct threat to Sudanese national security". "If Ethiopia goes ahead with filling the renaissance dam next July, this will be a direct threat to our national security," Sudan's Water Minister Yasser Abbas told AFP in an interview in the capital Khartoum. "It will also threaten the lives of half the population in central Sudan, as well as irrigation water for agricultural projects and power generation from (Sudan's) Roseires Dam." Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia have been locked in inconclusive talks for nearly a decade over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, after Addis Ababa broke ground on the project in 2011. Ethiopia, which says it has already reached its first-year target for filling the dam's reservoir, has recently signalled it would proceed with the filling regardless of whether a deal was struck. Khartoum hopes the dam will regulate annual flooding, but fears that its own dams, including the Roseires and Merowe, would be harmed if no agreement is reached. "It will be impossible to operate the Roseires Dam without a binding agreement and daily exchange of information on the amount of water flowing from the renaissance dam," Abbas said. Without a deal, the minister added, the "Merowe Dam will also lose 30 percent of the electric energy it generates and drinking water stations will be affected". Sudan has suggested mediation by the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and the United States to help break the impasse. The latest three-way talks were held last month in the presence of observers from the African Union and European Union, but failed to make headway. Relations between Addis Ababa and Khartoum have been sour in recent weeks following tensions over the Al-Fashaqa border region, where Ethiopian farmers cultivate fertile land claimed by Sudan.

Any unilateral step by Ethiopia to fill its Dam in July would directly threaten Sudan's national security, Sudanese Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Yasser Abbas said Sudan warned Ethiopia Saturday against going ahead with the second phase of filling its mega dam on the Blue Nile, saying it would pose a "direct threat to Sudanese national security". "If Ethiopia goes ahead with filling the renaissance dam next July, this will be a direct threat to our national security," Sudan's Water Minister Yasser Abbas told AFP in an interview in the capital Khartoum. "It will also threaten the lives of half the population in central Sudan, as well as irrigation water for agricultural projects and power generation from (Sudan's) Roseires Dam." Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia have been locked in inconclusive talks for nearly a decade over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, after Addis Ababa broke ground on the project in 2011. Ethiopia, which says it has already reached its first-year target for filling the dam's reservoir, has recently signalled it would proceed with the filling regardless of whether a deal was struck. Khartoum hopes the dam will regulate annual flooding, but fears that its own dams, including the Roseires and Merowe, would be harmed if no agreement is reached. "It will be impossible to operate the Roseires Dam without a binding agreement and daily exchange of information on the amount of water flowing from the renaissance dam," Abbas said. Without a deal, the minister added, the "Merowe Dam will also lose 30 percent of the electric energy it generates and drinking water stations will be affected". Sudan has suggested mediation by the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and the United States to help break the impasse. The latest three-way talks were held last month in the presence of observers from the African Union and European Union, but failed to make headway. Relations between Addis Ababa and Khartoum have been sour in recent weeks following tensions over the Al-Fashaqa border region, where Ethiopian farmers cultivate fertile land claimed by Sudan. The Nile, the world's longest river, is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to the 10 countries it traverses. Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Nile, converge in Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea. Search Keywords: Short link:

Source: Xinhua| 2021-02-07 03:58:43|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close CAIRO, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi expressed confidence on Saturday in the African Union's (AU) efforts aimed at reaching an agreement on the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Sisi made the remarks during the two-day virtual 34th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the AU, which kicked off on Saturday, Egyptian Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said in a statement. The assembly is anticipated to deliberate and consider the report on the institutional reform of the AU, report on the progress of the AU response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, as well as elections and appointments of the leadership of the AU Commission. During the summit, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will officially take over the rotating chair of the continental bloc from the outgoing chair South Africa, according to the AU. Addressing the summit, Sisi said he is confident that the AU, under the leadership of the DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, will contribute to pushing forward the efforts to reach the desired agreement in a manner that takes into account the interests of the parties concerned and preserves Egypt's Nile water rights. Sisi also thanked the outgoing chair of the AU, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, for his efforts within the framework of sponsoring the tripartite negotiations seeking a "comprehensive, fair and binding agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD." Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia have been negotiating under the mediation of the AU over technical and legal issues related to the filling and operation of the GERD. Enditem

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as it appears in a satellite image taken on July 20, 2020 (AFP) Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein Ethiopia stressed on Thursday its keenness to solve differences with Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), weeks after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the operation and filling of the mega-dam. Ethiopian Ambassador to Cairo Markos Tekle held talks Thursday with Egypt’s Assistant Foreign Minister for African Affairs, Sherif Issa. He explained Ethiopia’s longstanding position on the GERD negotiations and said the country was willing to resolve the remaining differences among the parties “through talks.” Issa expressed Egypt’s commitment to hold talks on GERD, according to the Ethiopian Embassy in Cairo. The meeting has also deliberated on bilateral relations, and the two sides exchanged views on the implementation of initiatives aimed at strengthening the historic relationship between Cairo and Addis Ababa. Last month, the African Union-sponsored talks to reach a fair and balanced agreement between Cairo, Addis Ababa and Khartoum over the operation and filling of the mega-dam faltered. Egypt has called GERD an existential threat and worries that it will reduce the country’s share of Nile waters. Ethiopia says the 145-meter tall dam will be an engine of development and is vital to meet the power needs of its population. Sudan, in the middle, worries about the effects on its own dams, although it stands to benefit from access to cheap electricity. The Blue Nile, which meets the White Nile in the Sudanese capital, provides the great majority of the combined Nile’s flow through northern Sudan and Egypt to the Mediterranean.

Egypt is looking forward to the resumption of African Union-sponsored GERD negotiations under the new presidency of the Democratic Republic of Congo Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told his Finnish counterpart that “Egypt had hoped for the success of the African Union’s (AU) efforts in managing the file of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), but the negotiations did not yield something tangible and did not achieve the aspired results.” In a phone call on Sunday, Shoukry stressed to the Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto that “Egypt is looking forward to the resumption of negotiations” under the presidency of Félix Tshisekedi, the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the new head of the AU. The DRC assumed the presidency of the AU in 2021 in early February, replacing South Africa as chair. The months-long attempts by South Africa, in its capacity as the chair of the AU in 2020, at mediating a deal to end the deadlock in negotiations in the GERD dispute between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia have failed due to Addis Ababa’s persistent intransigence. According to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry, Shoukry, moreover, stressed to Haavisto Egypt’s insistence on the need to reach a legally binding agreement in the GERD dispute between the three countries before Ethiopia initiates the second stage of filling the dam’s reservoir. Ethiopia has recently announced that it would start the second phase of filling the GERD’s 74 billion cubic metre reservoir during the rainy season of 2021 with 18.4 billion cubic metres of the Blue Nile’s waters, a year after completing the first filling with 4.9 billion cubic metres. Shoukry also stressed to his Finnish counterpart that the legally binding agreement could be reached through launching a serious negotiation path, taking into account the interests of the three concerned countries. Egypt and Sudan have been in talks with Ethiopia for years now to reach a legally binding agreement on the filling and operating of the $4.8 billion near-complete mega dam, which Ethiopia has started building on the Blue Nile since 2011. Ethiopia, however, has proposed a package of “non-binding guidelines” for the filling and operation of the GERD which were rejected by both downstream countries. “The Egyptian state has expressed its sincere political will to reach a fair and balanced agreement that achieves Ethiopia’s development goals and at the same time preserves Egypt’s rights and secures the two downstream countries from the risks and damages of the GERD,” Shoukry told Haavisto. Egypt’s 100 million-plus population relies on the Nile River for more than 95 percent of its renewable water resources. It fears the massive $4.8 billion hydropower near-complete project will significantly diminish its crucial water supply, which is already below scarcity level. Sudan, however, fears the GERD would put the operation of its Roseires dam, whose reservoir is located only 15km away from the Ethiopian dam, and the lives of 20 million Sudanese citizens at “a very high risk” if an agreement regulating its operation and filling is not reached. Ethiopia, on the other hand, hopes its 6,000-megawatt dam will make it Africa’s largest power exporter and will be a key to its development efforts. The two foreign ministers also discussed other pertinent issues in the Horn of Africa, according to the statement. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Cairo- Mohammed Abdu Hassanein Egypt has warned Ethiopia against filling the Renaissance Dam it is building on the Blue Nile before reaching a binding and legal agreement on the filling and operation process. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Sunday that his country is ready to launch a new serious negotiation process that takes into account the interests of Cairo, Khartoum, and Addis Ababa. Ethiopia has been building the dam on the main tributary of the Nile since 2011, and its Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy announced the completion of about 78 percent of the construction so far. Last week, it announced the dam is expected to hold 13.5 billion cubic meters of water in the upcoming rainy season. Authorities started filling the reservoir on July 21, 2020. However, the completion of the first filling phase prior to reaching an agreement with Egypt and Sudan irked both countries. Cairo has been seeking through intense diplomatic efforts to receive international support for its position against Addis Ababa’s. On Sunday, Shoukry received a phone call from Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister Pekka Haavisto, during which he affirmed that his country “had hoped for the success of the African Union (AU) efforts in resolving the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam’s (GERD) issue.” The AU-sponsored talks between Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered and were stalled in January, despite the intervention of international actors such as the United States and the European Union with observers. Shoukry expressed his country’s aspirations to resume talks under the AU's new chairmanship of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi. “The Egyptian state has expressed its political determination to reach a fair and balanced agreement that achieves Ethiopia’s development goals while preserving Egypt’s rights and protecting the two downstream countries from the dam’s potential dangers,” a foreign ministry statement read. Addis Ababa refuses to legalize any agreement reached, which binds it to specific measures to alleviate the drought.

News article:
A view of Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam as it undergoes construction work on the river Nile in Guba Woreda, Benishangul Gumuz Region, Ethiopia. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt said Wednesday it has endorsed a Sudanese proposal to internationalize arbitration in a years-long dispute with Ethiopia over a massive dam Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Cairo backs the formation of an “international quartet” including the US, the European Union, and the UN, along with the African Union to facilitate reaching a deal on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam. The dispute centers on how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs and how the three countries would settle any future disputes. Egypt and Sudan also call for a legally binding agreement on the dam’s filling and operation, while Ethiopia insists on guidelines. Shoukry said Egypt wants to develop the negotiating mechanism to reach a “legally binding agreement” at the earliest possible opportunity.” He announced Egypt’s position during a meeting Wednesday in Cairo with Alphonse Ntumba Luaba, the coordination of Democratic Republic of the Congo’s current leadership of the African Union. There were no immediate comments from Washington, Brussels, or the UN. Sudan has announced its proposal earlier this year after AU-led talks failed to achieve progress. Since then, Khartoum has become vocal against Ethiopia’s plans to start the second filling during the next rainy season. Prime Minister Abddalla Hamdok said earlier this month that the dam threatens at least 20 million Sudanese, roughly half the country’s population. Sudan wants Ethiopia to coordinate and share data on dam’s operation to avoid flooding and protect its own power-generating dams on the Blue Nile, the main tributary of the Nile River. The Blue Nile meets with the White Nile in central Sudan from where the Nile winds northward through Egypt and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. There was no comment from Ethiopia that had left a US-led attempt to mediate the dispute, alleging bias. The administration of former President Donald Trump last year sanctioned Ethiopia over the dam’s first filling before reaching a deal with Egypt and Sudan. On Friday, President Joe Biden's administration said it has de-linked the sanctions from the dam dispute. About 85 percent of the Nile's flow originates from Ethiopia. Officials hope the dam, now more than three-quarters complete, will reach full power-generating capacity in 2023, helping pull millions of its people out of poverty. Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country with over 100 million people, called the dam an existential threat and worries that it would reduce its share of Nile waters. The country relies almost entirely on the Nile to supply water for agriculture and its people.

(Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt said Wednesday it has endorsed a Sudanese proposal to internationalize arbitration in a years-long dispute with Ethiopia over a massive dam Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Cairo backs the formation of an “international quartet” including the US, the European Union, and the UN, along with the African Union to facilitate reaching a deal on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam. The dispute centers on how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs and how the three countries would settle any future disputes. Egypt and Sudan also call for a legally binding agreement on the dam’s filling and operation, while Ethiopia insists on guidelines. Shoukry said Egypt wants to develop the negotiating mechanism to reach a “legally binding agreement” at the earliest possible opportunity.” He announced Egypt’s position during a meeting Wednesday in Cairo with Alphonse Ntumba Luaba, the coordination of Democratic Republic of the Congo’s current leadership of the African Union. There were no immediate comments from Washington, Brussels, or the UN. Sudan has announced its proposal earlier this year after AU-led talks failed to achieve progress. Since then, Khartoum has become vocal against Ethiopia’s plans to start the second filling during the next rainy season. Prime Minister Abddalla Hamdok said earlier this month that the dam threatens at least 20 million Sudanese, roughly half the country’s population. Sudan wants Ethiopia to coordinate and share data on dam’s operation to avoid flooding and protect its own power-generating dams on the Blue Nile, the main tributary of the Nile River. The Blue Nile meets with the White Nile in central Sudan from where the Nile winds northward through Egypt and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. There was no comment from Ethiopia that had left a US-led attempt to mediate the dispute, alleging bias. The administration of former President Donald Trump last year sanctioned Ethiopia over the dam’s first filling before reaching a deal with Egypt and Sudan. On Friday, President Joe Biden's administration said it has de-linked the sanctions from the dam dispute. About 85 percent of the Nile's flow originates from Ethiopia. Officials hope the dam, now more than three-quarters complete, will reach full power-generating capacity in 2023, helping pull millions of its people out of poverty. Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country with over 100 million people, called the dam an existential threat and worries that it would reduce its share of Nile waters. The country relies almost entirely on the Nile to supply water for agriculture and its people.

Khartoum - Ahmed Younis Sudan has toughened its rhetoric in the dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) that Addis Ababa is constructing on the Blue Nile. It called for international mediators to resolve the dispute, including the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and the United States. Sudanese Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasser Abbas urged parties to the negotiations on the dam to consider GERD a means for regional cooperation rather than political tension between Khartoum, Addis Ababa and Cairo. The unilateral second filling of the dam in July represents a “direct threat” to Sudan’s national security, SUNA quoted Abbas as saying on Monday. He hoped for a binding agreement between the three countries before the deadline. He said the filling of GERD threatens electricity generation from Sudan’s Merowe Dam and Roseires Dam, as well as the safety of the Roseires Dam and of 20 million Sudanese living downstream, he stressed. The Irrigation Ministry has taken several technical and diplomatic precautionary measures to face the possible filling of the mega dam, Abbas noted. He affirmed that his country is currently working on bolstering the AU mediation and include the UN, EU, and the US in the talks as mediators. Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries and includes a mechanism for settling disputes on the filling and operation of the dam. Ethiopia refused to sign a final agreement on the rules of filling and operating the dam earlier in 2020, under the mediation of the US and World Bank, prompting Khartoum to boycott the tripartite talks on January 10.

REUTERS/Francis Kokoroko//File Photo Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat Egyptian ambassador to Accra Emad Hanna has attended the swearing-in ceremony of Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo for the second term on Thursday, according to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. The ministry stated that Hanna attended the event upon the request of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi to convey his greetings to his Ghanaian counterpart. Egypt’s invitation to participate in the presidential inauguration ceremony reflects the deep-rooted friendship and cooperation between the Egyptian and Ghanaian peoples and presidents, as well as the appreciation of the significance of Egypt’s role at the continental and international levels, the statement read. The ministry also pointed out that this participation indicates a similar vision of both political leaderships regarding many African issues of mutual concern. These include achieving continental integration through the optimal benefit from African energies and resources and supporting efforts to launch the continental free trade area with the permanent headquarters in Accra. It is noteworthy that Egypt had played an active role during its African Union presidency to push forward the implementation of the trade area, being certain of the pivotal turning point such an agreement could bring about in line with the 2063 Agenda.

News article:
The delegation is expected to discuss mounting tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan over the disputed eastern border region of Al-Fashqa A high-level Sudanese delegation led by Sudan’s ruling Sovereign Council member Lieutenant General Shamseldin Kabashi arrived Egypt on Thursday to discuss bilateral ties and push means of joint cooperation. According to an official statement, Sudan’s Sovereign Council said Kabashi, who is accompanied by intelligence chief Lieutenant General Jamal Abdel Majeed and other officials, was received by Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry. Earlier, state-owned Al-Arabiya said the delegation will head to Egypt to discuss mounting tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan over the disputed eastern border region of Al-Fashqa. Ethiopia and Sudan have been exchanging accusations over ownership rights of the agricultural area. The visit comes one day after Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, the head of Sudan’s Sovereign Council, had visited Al-Qadarif, an area of which Al-Fashqa is part, to “emphasise the ability of the armed forces to protect the territory.” It also comes one day after a high-level delegation from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) concluded a one-day visit to Khartoum in an attempt to break the deadlock on the disputed Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) after a recent collapse of African Union sponsored talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan this week. Sudan accused Ethiopia on Wednesday of a “dangerous and unjustified escalation” after an Ethiopian military aircraft crossed the disputed border area. The move “could have dangerous consequences and cause more tension in the border area,” Sudan’s foreign ministry said. Ethiopia warned Sudan on Tuesday that its patience was wearing out over Khartoum’s military build-up in the area despite efforts to resolve the rift diplomatically. The Ethiopian statement came as Sudan said armed Ethiopian “gangs” killed five women and a child in the area. Search Keywords: Short link:

The delegation is expected to discuss mounting tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan over the disputed eastern border region of Al-Fashqa A high-level Sudanese delegation led by Sudan’s ruling Sovereign Council member Lieutenant General Shamseldin Kabashi arrived Egypt on Thursday to discuss bilateral ties and push means of joint cooperation. According to an official statement, Sudan’s Sovereign Council said Kabashi, who is accompanied by intelligence chief Lieutenant General Jamal Abdel Majeed and other officials, was received by Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry. Earlier, state-owned Al-Arabiya said the delegation will head to Egypt to discuss mounting tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan over the disputed eastern border region of Al-Fashqa. Ethiopia and Sudan have been exchanging accusations over ownership rights of the agricultural area. The visit comes one day after Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, the head of Sudan’s Sovereign Council, had visited Al-Qadarif, an area of which Al-Fashqa is part, to “emphasise the ability of the armed forces to protect the territory.” It also comes one day after a high-level delegation from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) concluded a one-day visit to Khartoum in an attempt to break the deadlock on the disputed Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) after a recent collapse of African Union sponsored talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan this week. Sudan accused Ethiopia on Wednesday of a “dangerous and unjustified escalation” after an Ethiopian military aircraft crossed the disputed border area. The move “could have dangerous consequences and cause more tension in the border area,” Sudan’s foreign ministry said. Ethiopia warned Sudan on Tuesday that its patience was wearing out over Khartoum’s military build-up in the area despite efforts to resolve the rift diplomatically. The Ethiopian statement came as Sudan said armed Ethiopian “gangs” killed five women and a child in the area. Search Keywords: Short link:

Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi received Thursday a Sudanese delegation in Cairo to discuss the recent border tensions between Khartoum and Addis Ababa, in addition to the latest regional developments, especially the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Sisi held talks with members of the Transitional Sovereignty Council (TSC) Lt-General Shamsedeen Kabashi and his accompanying delegation, including Sudanese Minister of Culture and Information Fisal Mohammed Salih, Chief of General Intelligence Gamal Abdel Meguid, and Secretary-General of the council Mohamed Youssef. The talks tackled the latest developments concerning the mounting tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan over the disputed eastern border region of Al-Fashqa. Sisi said that Egypt is looking forward to continuing cooperation and coordination with Sudan in various areas, given the long-standing ties and common interests between the two countries. For his part, Kabashi stressed the distinguished and historical relations binding between Cairo and Khartoum, hailing Egypt's sustained support for Sudan during the current transitional period. The delegation also discussed with Sisi the GERD issue and the necessity of coordinating efforts and stances to achieve the interests of both countries. The visit comes after border tension between the two countries escalated during the conflict in the Tigray region. Ethiopian forces and militias attacked Sudanese forces inside their territory, killing three individuals and a high-ranking officer. The Sudanese army redeployed within its territory and regained control over more than 80 percent of the areas that had been witnessing an Ethiopian presence for many years. The negotiations to demarcate the border between Sudan and Ethiopia last December failed to reach an agreement. After arriving in Khartoum Thursday, Salih said the delegation briefed Sisi on the recent developments on the Sudanese-Ethiopian borders, pointing out that the visit is a part of an integrated program for visiting the neighboring and sisterly countries to brief them on the reality of the developments of the situations in the region. He also said it comes as part of the political and diplomatic efforts being exerted by the government to inform the leaders and the governments on Sudan’s position concerning the situations on the Sudanese-Ethiopian borders.

News article:
Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company, of the Ministry of Public Enterprise, signed two agreements with China's Dongfeng Motor Corporation to reconstruct its factory to produce the first electric car in Egypt. Egypt’s Public Enterprise Minister Hisham Tawfik and the Chinese Ambassador to Cairo Liao Liqiang attended the online ceremony, which also included top officials from Nasr and Dongfeng. Speaking at the ceremony, Tawfiq stressed that the agreements mark the launch of Nasr towards the project of localizing the electric car industry in Egypt. Earlier, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued directives to relevant authorities on localizing and using national capabilities to manufacture electric vehicles. Tawfik explained that the project aims to preserve the environment by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and thermal emissions that have negative impacts on people and the economy. He explained that the agreements included a framework agreement for the production of the electric car in Nasr factories in cooperation with Dongfeng. Dongfeng is one of the four largest car manufacturers in China that produces about 3.5 million cars annually with its main partners in the auto industry worldwide, he mentioned. The two companies also signed an agreement to renew the Nasr factory with the latest technologies and production methods. The project comes within the framework of the automobile manufacturing strategy adopted by the political leadership, which takes into account all the associated factors, according to the Minister. Tawfik indicated that all relevant authorities and ministries are cooperating to ensure the success of this strategic project. They will deploy fast chargers in the streets and parking lots all over the country and prepare electricity networks to accommodate the expected increase in consumption. The authorities will also launch the necessary support policies which help encourage consumers to shift to new methods of transportation. He pointed out that the ministry relied on technical and commercial studies which led to choosing China’s Dongfeng, as well as the “E70” model. E70 electric vehicles will be used to reduce emissions and ensure successful sustainability while keeping pace with the increasing global trend of electric transport. In light of the President’s directives, Nasr Company will start its production of electric cars at a localization rate of 50 percent. At a later stage, the plan will include a research and development center, with the participation of national cadres and specialized Egyptian companies. An agreement is currently underway to establish a research and development center with Dongfeng and Egyptآ's Brightskies Technologies company. The Minister also reported that the project aims to produce 25,000 cars annually in one shift, and according to market studies, the volume of demand is expected to increase with the anticipated governmental support and incentives to double this amount.

Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi listens to US Secretary of State John Kerry during their meeting at the Presidential palace in Cairo, Egypt, Wednesday, April 20, 2016. REUTERS/Amr Nabil/Pool Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Egyptian President Abdul Fattah el-Sisi said Wednesday that the COVID-19 crisis has been a significant opportunity “to accelerate digitalization, and to improve our policies to become socially, economically, and environmentally more sustainable.” The president’s remarks were made in a televised speech he delivered on the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). "The year 2020 was full of challenges and negative repercussions posed by the coronavirus pandemic, to the extent that the post-COVID-19 world will be different than the one before," Sisi explained. However, the crisis "has availed important opportunities, notably to accelerate digitalization, and to improve our policies to become socially, economically, and environmentally more sustainable, which would contribute to achieving a comprehensive recovery as soon as possible," he stressed. Sisi said the crisis "highlights the role of the OECD, with its 60 years of experience in multilateral cooperation, in formulating policies that promote transparency and governance, accommodating the evolving trends and the needs of the global economy.” “It also highlights the OECD’s positive contribution to the formulation of the required global path and the sought-after solidarity to tackle this unprecedented crisis in the efforts to alleviate the burden shouldered by all countries regardless of their degree of development, in addition to guiding such joint efforts to a win-win situation," he added. The president has assured that despite the severity of the economic repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic, the Egyptian economy has demonstrated a resilience that helped sustain its positive growth rates. "This was possible in light of the structural economic reform program that Egypt adopted over the last few years, achieving significant successes in a short period,” he said. Sisi highlighted the positive impact of the program on development efforts and enhancing the government’s ability to effectively intervene when needed by introducing stimulus packages for key economic sectors, as well as providing support for the most vulnerable segments of the society. The president expressed Egypt's deep appreciation for the prominent role the OECD plays at the bilateral level with Egypt. He added that the organization "has significantly contributed to the development of standards and the formulation of economic and development policies capable of achieving the slogan agreed upon by its member states: Better Policies for Better Life."

Egypt is planning to establish an industrial zone in Sudan to facilitate the set up of joint projects. The strategy will be implemented by the private sector to boost the economic integration between the two sides, Egypt’s Minister of Trade and Industry Niveen Gamea said on Thursday. Gamea made the announcement during an extended discussion in Khartoum with the Sudanese Minister of Trade and Industry Abbas Madany and a number of Sudanese officials, in the attendance of Egypt’s Ambassador to Sudan Hossam Eissa. The session was held on the sidelines of Gamea’s visit to Sudan to represent Egypt in the 38th round of the Khartoum International Expo. Egypt is the expo’s guest of honour in its current round. Gamea called on Sudan to hold the joint trade committee in Cairo to discuss the technical aspects regarding the trade flow between the two countries, noting that trade exchange between Egypt and Sudan recorded $862 million in 2020. She added that Egypt’s exports to Sudan amounted to $496 million, while Egypt’s imports from Sudan recorded $366 billion in 2020. Chemicals, processed products, machines, foodstuffs, textiles, transport means, livestock, and agricultural products are the main traded goods between the two countries, according to Gamea. The minister pointed out to the possibility of boosting industrial cooperation between the two sides in pharmaceutical industries and increasing Egyptian pharmaceutical exports to Sudan. “Egypt is willing to extend its economic support to brotherly Sudan in the ongoing transitional phase. Egypt’s business community is also keen on establishing partnerships with the country in line with Sudan’s agenda for industrial and infrastructure projects it targets to establish,” said Gamea. Gamea discussed with the Sudanese minister of transport and infrastructure the possibility of participating in the Sudanese capital triangle zone improvement project that includes establishing bridges, renewing sanitation networks and rerouting roads through partnering with Egypt’s private sector. Madany said that Sudan is eager to enhance economic cooperation prospects with Egypt, especially in the industrial sector, as Sudan targets producing high value-added products by establishing private sector partnerships between the two countries.

News article:
New efforts are being made to boost economic and trade relations between Egypt and Sudan Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry Nevine Gamea met with her Sudanese counterparts to mull over increasing bilateral trade cooperation when she attended the Khartoum International Fair from 21 to 28 January in the Sudanese capital. Egypt was the guest of honour at the fair, and Gamea’s meetings were part of Egypt’s determination to open a new page in its trade relations with Sudan. Topping the agenda at the meetings was renewing the licence for the Egyptian Trade Centre in Sudan, this helping to make Egyptian goods available to Sudanese consumers at a lower cost and in a shorter time. Gamea met with Madani Abbas Madani, Sudan’s minister of industry and trade, and Hashim Mohamed bin Auf, minister of infrastructure and transport, to discuss opportunities for economic cooperation and developments in the commercial, industrial, and transport sectors. One of the main challenges facing Egyptian exporters and hindering the flow of trade was the sometimes poor quality of the road network in Sudan, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council told Al-Ahram Weekly. He said that the Egyptian government’s intention to establish an integrated transportation company to establish regular transport lines with Sudan would boost bilateral trade, since Egyptian exporters have great potential in Sudanese markets if they can overcome transport problems. According to Gamea, trade between Egypt and Sudan last year reached $862 million, $496 million of which were Egyptian exports to Sudan and $366 million were imports. The most important items traded between the two countries are chemicals, manufactured products, machinery and equipment, food products, textiles, transportation materials, livestock, and agricultural products. Trade with Sudan is already on the rise. In 2019, trade exchanges between Egypt and Sudan recorded around $675 million, up from around $611 million in 2018, an increase of 10.4 per cent. Egyptian exports to Sudan made up 1.5 per cent of total Egyptian exports in 2019, while imports from Sudan were 5.1 per cent of total Sudanese exports. Plastic products were prominent on Egypt’s export list to Sudan in 2019. Exports worth around $81 million were recorded in 2019, up from around $77 million in 2018. Egypt’s exports to Sudan represent about four per cent of its total plastic exports. Iron and steel come second on the list of Egypt’s exports to Sudan, with fertilisers occupying third place followed by glass, utensils, and pharmaceutical products. Constituting almost 98 per cent of Sudan’s exports to Egypt in 2019 were seeds and fruit, livestock, cotton, and meat. In August 2020, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli travelled to Sudan to discuss with Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok the transport challenges facing Egyptian exporters to Sudan. They agreed on the need to restructure the Nile Valley Authority for Riverine Navigation (NVARN) to increase its efficiency and upgrade its fleet. NVARN is an Egyptian-Sudanese organisation that transports passengers as well as goods. It was established in 1975 as the only international transporter working on Lake Nasser. Egypt and Sudan have also discussed a project to link the railways of the two countries to increase economic and trade cooperation, develop maritime navigation, and update the cooperation agreement on land transport between Cairo and Khartoum. Madbouli’s visit to Sudan resulted in an agreement to remove obstacles hindering the flow of trade, especially concerning roads leading to land ports. Putting this deal into effect will be a crucial step in achieving economic integration between Egypt and Sudan. Some 21 Egyptian companies participated in this month’s Khartoum International Fair, regarding it as an opportunity to increase their exports to Sudan. The companies specialised in the commercial and service sectors as well as in engineering, food, construction, chemicals, crops, and leather. Ahmed Gaber, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council, said that despite the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) agreements to which Egypt and Sudan are signatories, there are still 54 Egyptian products on which customs are imposed when entering Sudan, constituting a hindrance to Egyptian exports. Regulations related to the Covid-19 currently prevent vehicle traffic across the Egyptian-Sudanese border. Exporters offload their cargoes on the border, from where they are transported by the other country’s vehicles. A problem facing Sudanese importers is a shortage of foreign currency, which affects their ability to import Egyptian products, Gaber said. Were the Egyptian and Sudanese central banks to reach an agreement on credit arrangements, Egyptian exports could win the lion’s share of Sudan’s imports, estimated at $7 billion annually. The establishment of an Egyptian industrial zone in Sudan was another topic of discussion at the meetings between Gamea and her Sudanese counterparts. A feasibility study of the zone has been completed and is awaiting input from the Sudanese side, she said. The industrial zone is expected to attract Egyptian investments into Sudan, Gamea said. According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Sudan’s investments in Egypt were $1.9 million in 2018-19, up from $300,000 in 2017-18, an increase of 53.3 per cent. These investments are in the fields of industry, finance, services, agriculture, construction, tourism, and communications. Egypt established 229 projects in Sudan between 2000 and 2013, representing a total investment of $10.8 billion. The projects focused on the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. The moves to boost prospects for bilateral cooperation with Sudan are part of Egypt’s desire to bolster cooperation with the African countries in the infrastructure, electricity, agricultural, industrial, and irrigation sectors. Sudan is Egypt’s southern gateway to Africa, making it even more necessary for the two countries to cooperate fully in boosting their respective roles on the African continent. *A version of this article appears in print in the 28 January, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

Egypt’s government has launched the second phase of initiative supporting export companies, announcing that the registration will open as of 7 February through until the end of the month. Minister of Finance, Mohamed Maait said on Sunday that the initiative came in implementation of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi's directives to back the sector, adding that it aims at disbursing the export companies' arrears from the Export Development Fund (EDF) before the end of the current FY2020/2021 (ending in June). The initiative’s second phase will be executed with the same conditions of the first phase, according to Maait. He added that this initiative contributes in providing cash liquidity that enables export companies to meet their financial obligations, keep their labour force and boost the competitiveness of Egyptian products in international markets, especially with the severe impacts that hit the sector due to the COVID-19 crisis. In September, Egypt’s government launched the first phase of the initiative that targeted instant and cash repayment of the entirety of export companies’ arrears from the EDF before the end of 2020 at a repay acceleration discount of 15 percent. 1069 export companies benefitted from the first phase, with total disbursements of EGP 13.5 billion, according to the minister. The initiative is implemented in collaboration with the banking system, as the finance ministry deposits a guarantee at the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) to allow for the payment of the arrears for the companies that are willing to pay their entire dues, according to minister. This will be allowed for the companies that will subscribe to the initiative before the end of February, end of April and the end of June, said Maait. He added that the finance ministry will repay these sums and their proceeds to the banks that contributed to the initiative over three years. The minister revealed that the government disbursed EGP 21 billion over a year in order to support the exports sector through six initiatives. 2500 export companies benefitted from the other five initiatives with a total of EGP 5.6 billion disbursed for the exports during FY2019/2020 as well as EGP 2.4 billion disbursed from July to November 2020. The cabinet has approved five initiatives since October 2019 that aimed to settle the exporters’ arrears through June 2019. The initiatives included the repayment of small investors with a maximum of EGP 5 million, the repayment of 30 percent of the whole arrears to the exporters, holding a set-off between the exporters’ arrears and the payable tax and custom obligations on them, the repayment of the total arrear sums over four to five years while expanding their investments in return, in addition to the land allocation initiative.

Al-Mashat met Ambassador of France Stéphane Romatet on Sunday to follow up on the multi-sectoral development agreements made during President Sisi's visit to France in December. The French Minister of Finance will visit Egypt in February and is expected to hold a lineup of meetings with various Egyptian ministries and governmental institutions in order to finalise details of the bilateral projects that will be executed under Egypt’s sustainable development 2030 agenda and their financing conditions, said Egypt’s Minister of International Cooperation, Rania Al-Mashat.

The first phase of a national project aimed at improving living conditions and creating job opportunities for more than 5,000 poor villages nationwide was launched last week. President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi who spearheaded the project instructed the government to facilitate improving 1,500 villages in its first phase. This phase of the plan, entitled the National Programme for the Development of Egyptian Villages, will last until the end of the year and will target improving the quality of life in villages where 57 per cent of Egypt’s population resides. The rate of poverty in these villages exceeds 55 per cent. The rates of illiteracy and the percentage of households where women are the bread-winners are higher than in other villages and urban areas. Most of these villages lack potable water, proper sanitation, natural gas networks, and paved roads. The villages included in the first phase are in Assiut, Sohag, Beheira, Qena, Minya, Aswan, Luxor, Menoufiya, Fayoum, Beni Sweif, Giza, Al-Wadi Al-Gedid, Qalioubiya, Daqahliya, Alexandria, Gharbiya, Sharqiya, Ismailia, Damietta, and Kafr Al-Sheikh governorates. “There is a dire need to rally the efforts of the state bodies together with civil society organisations and individuals to successfully implement this huge project,” said Presidential Spokesperson Bassam Radi. Radi said the project is designed to complement Egypt’s “Decent Life” programme to improve rural communities by ensuring better living conditions, reducing poverty, upgrading infrastructure and improving public services, especially educational, housing, healthcare, power, sanitation, drinking water, and natural gas services. “The programme also focuses on supporting small and medium enterprises [SMEs] in these villages, improving healthcare units, upgrading the efficiency of irrigation networks, enhancing agricultural and veterinary services and establishing advanced dairy collection centres,” Radi pointed out. He said the plan will include the relocation of public service offices in governorates and villages, and connecting them electronically to the related ministries in their new headquarters in the New Administrative Capital. This is not the first time the country’s poorest villages have been focused on, according to Hani Younis, the spokesman of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Construction. In 2019, there was a presidential initiative to develop 143 villages in 11 governorates; civil society participated in improving 37 of them in the governorates of Minya, Assiut, Sohag, and Qena. The rate of internal migration from the countryside to the cities, according to Younis, has reached 55 per cent. Developing Egyptian villages will contribute to the reduction of migration to the cities. “The prime minister announced that Egyptian, not foreign, companies will be tasked with providing the resources needed for the project,” Younis said. Younis said he believed the scheme would provide several job opportunities for youth. Factories would cooperate with the government to implement this national project, thus revitalising the country’s economy.

News article:
The agenda can mobilise up to €30 billion in private and public investments in the region over the next decade The European Commission and the high representative announced the adoption of a new agenda for the Mediterranean region, including Egypt, the European delegation in Egypt said on Wednesday. The European Union (EU) in Brussels said the agenda is meant to boost the strategic partnership between the EU and the Mediterranean, according to the EU statement. “The new agenda is based on the conviction that by working together and in a spirit of partnership, common challenges can be turned into opportunities, in the mutual interest of the EU and its Southern Neighbours,” said the EU. The agenda includes an economic and investment plan that targets boosting the long-term socio-economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in the southern neighbourhood, read the statement. Under the new EU's Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), up to €7 billion for the period 2021 to 2027 will be allocated to its implementation, which can mobilise around €30 billion in private and public investments in the region over the next decade. “This communication sends a crucial message about the importance we attach to our Southern Neighbourhood. A strengthened Mediterranean partnership remains a strategic imperative for the European Union. 25 years after the Barcelona Declaration and 10 years after the Arab Spring, challenges in the Mediterranean – many of which resulting from global trends – remain daunting,”, said EU High Representative and Vice-President Josep Borrell. “To address these challenges, we need to renew our mutual efforts and act closely together as partners, in the interest of all of us. This is what this new agenda is all about. We are determined to work together with our Southern Partners on a new agenda that will focus on people, especially women and youth, and help them meet their hopes for the future, enjoy their rights and build a peaceful, secure, more democratic, greener, prosperous and inclusive Southern Neighbourhood,” Borrell explained. The Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Olivér Várhelyi said that the renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood presents a new beginning in EU’s relations with its southern partners. “Based on common interests and common challenges, developed together with our neighbours... Europe wants to contribute directly to a long-term vision of prosperity and stability of the region, especially in the social and economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. In close dialogue with our partners, we have identified a number of priority sectors, from creating growth and jobs, investing in human capital, and good governance. We consider migration to be a common challenge, where we are ready to work to fight irregular migration and smugglers together with our partners as it is a risk for all of us. We will work together to bring real change on the ground for the benefit of both our neighbours and Europe,” according to Várhelyi. The EU said that the new agenda focuses on five policy areas, including human development, good governance and the rule of law, resilience, prosperity, and digital transition. It also includes providing support to countries to address security challenges and find solutions to ongoing conflicts, in addition to addressing the challenges of forced displacement and irregular migration, and facilitating safe and legal pathways for migration and mobility. The agenda concentrates on green transition as well as introducing an economic investment plan for the Southern Neighbours to ensure the quality of life for people in the region improves and economic recovery is realised. The plan includes preliminary flagship initiatives to strengthen resilience, build prosperity and increase trade and investment to support competitiveness and inclusive growth. The EU provided support to Egypt mainly through the European Neighbourhood Instrument with €756 million in the period from 2014 to 2020. Since 2008, Egypt has been a beneficiary of the Neighbourhood Investment Platform which leveraged €7 billion in concessional loans from European Financial Institutions combined with public and private sector financing for projects in the sector of renewable energy, energy efficiency, irrigation, water and wastewater management, transport, financial inclusion, support to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and education, according to the EU. Moreover, projects under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF Africa) in Egypt amount to €89 million, stated the EU. In addition, Egypt benefits from EU thematic programmes and instruments, including the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the Civil Society Organisations and Local Authorities programme under the Development Cooperation Instrument, the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA) and Horizon 2020.

The two officials discussed bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy and combating terrorism and extremist ideology Cairo is looking forward to increasing the ongoing coordination with Jordan at the bilateral level, and within the framework of the two countries’ trilateral cooperation mechanism with Iraq, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told Jordanian Prime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh on Thursday. El-Sisi received PM Al-Khasawneh, who is on an official visit to the Egyptian capital. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and head of Egypt's General Intelligence Service Abbas Kamel attended the meeting, according to a statement by presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady. During the meeting, El-Sisi described Egypt-Jordan relations as historical and close, the statement added. The Jordanian prime minister expressed his country's keenness to continue to coordinate with Egypt on different fronts as well as promote bilateral cooperation in a way that contributes to confronting the joint challenges facing the Arab world. He added that Egypt is playing a "pivotal" role in the region, the statement added. The meeting dealt with bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy, combating terrorism and extremist ideology, bolstering economic ties and enhancing trade. The mechanisms of implementing the ventures agreed upon within the framework of the trilateral cooperation between Egypt, Jordan and Iraq were also tackled during the meeting, which followed a meeting between El-Sisi and Iraq's Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein in Cairo a day prior. Egypt, Jordan and Iraq have been pushing for fostering trilateral cooperation in terms of the economy, trade, energy and investment to establish strategic integration between Egypt, Jordan and Iraq. The three leaders held three trilateral summits to push forward their efforts, the latest of which was held in the Jordanian capital Amman in August 2020. A fourth summit is set to be held soon to follow up on the previous steps. The meeting also touched upon the latest developments in the regional situations as both countries' officials agreed to maintain coordination to affirm the principle of a comprehensive political settlement for various disputes and issues in the region. They also discussed the developments of the peace process in the Middle East in light of the results of the last ministerial meeting of the Arab League on Monday. The statement added that the officials agreed to work on intensifying international efforts to settle the Palestinian crisis based on international legitimacy resolutions to resume peace negotiations. Cairo has been in talks with several Western parties to push forward the frozen Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In February 2020, Egypt, along with Jordan, France, and Germany, formed the quartet committee to revive the halted negotiations. The committee has so far held four meetings, the latest of which was hosted by Cairo earlier this month, where the foreign ministers of the four countries forged 11 provisions detailed in a joint statement outlining the endeavours to revive the peace process.

Madbouly said the ongoing development, part of a greater development scheme for historic Cairo, is expected to restore the 150-year-old square to its former glory Egypt's Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and his Jordanian counterpart, Bishr Al-Khasawneh, made a visit to Downtown Cairo to inspect the ongoing development works at Tahrir square. Madbouly explained to Al-Khasawneh details surrounding the project, which will extend to sites in and around the square like Omar Makram Mosque, the Mogamma government building, the Egyptian Museum, the historic building that formerly housed the foreign ministry, and the newly established Tahrir parking garage. Madbouly said the ongoing development, part of a greater development scheme for historic Cairo, is expected to restore the 150-year-old square to its former glory, adding that it will become a civilised facade symbolising the spirit of ongoing development in the old capital. The inspection came after a joint meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries, in the presence of a number of ministers, to discuss ways to help strengthen relations between Egypt and Jordan to encourage joint industrialisation and commercial exchange. Madbouly said the project will involve painting the facades of buildings, planting trees to create green spaces, and decorating the entire square with pure light LEDs to create a festive atmosphere. The square is already home to a 17-metre obelisk that weighs 90 tons, dating back to the reign of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II, and four ram-headed sphinx statues from Luxor’s Karnak Temple, turning it into an open-air museum commemorating Egyptian history and celebrating pharaonic heritage. The project is funded by the Ministry of Housing, Utilities, and Urban Communities in coordination with Cairo and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities as part of the plan to showcase Egypt’s civilisation.

Both leaders met on the sidelines of the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Mecca in 2019 and then on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly in New York in the same year. In 2020, PM Khan had a telephone conversation with President El-Sisi regarding the Global Initiative on Debt Relief’ for developing countries, which was proposed by Islamabad and was supported by Cairo. During these meetings, the two leaders agreed to further strengthen bilateral cooperation and enhance high-level exchanges, the statement added. The three-day visit will include detailed consultations with Egyptian counterpart officials and with leading Egyptian businessmen and members of the Pakistani community. The visit is expected to further strengthen and diversify Pakistan’s bilateral ties with Egypt, noted the statement. The statement added that Egypt plays a key role in the Middle East, while its deep linkages with the African continent make it a gateway to Africa. Pakistan values its partnership with Egypt, which is in line with its desire to forge stronger ties with the Islamic world, as well as its initiative dubbed ‘Engage Africa’, the Pakistani foreign ministry’s statement pointed out. The two countries have similar perceptions on a range of regional and global issues, with more than 40 agreements signed between both sides in diverse fields, providing a firm basis for enhanced cooperation. Bilateral cooperation is advanced through strong institutional mechanisms, including the Joint Ministerial Commission, Annual Bilateral Consultations, and Joint Business Council, the statement added.

News article:
Egypt plays a key role in the Middle East, while its deep links with the African continent make it a gateway to Africa,” read the statement issued by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry ahead of Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s three-day visit to Egypt. Qureshi arrived in Cairo on Tuesday night, Doaa El-Bey reports. Pakistan and Egypt enjoy close relations, share a common faith, culture and values, and face similar challenges when it comes to coronavirus and terrorism, noted Ali Al-Hefni, former deputy to Egypt’s Foreign Minister. “It is therefore important to hold periodic bilateral meetings to discuss issues of common interest,” he said, adding that “the two countries have similar views on a range of regional and international issues.” Egypt is in a position to open doors for Pakistan in Africa. “During its chairmanship of the African Union in 2019, Egypt noticeably improved its relations with African states and can help Pakistan enhance its presence in Africa. And in the light of the ongoing rivalry between India and Pakistan, it is only to be expected that Pakistan will seek to open up its relations across the African continent, not least in response to the India-Africa Forum, an official platform for African-Indian relations that holds regular summits,” Al-Hefni added. During the three-day visit, Islamabad also hoped to benefit from Egypt’s expertise in social housing. Pakistan is currently considering expanding its densely populated cities. The crises in Libya and Syria were also high on the agenda. Qureshi’s visit included consultations with Egyptian officials and businessmen, as well as members of the Pakistani community in Egypt. They discussed ways to strengthen bilateral trade and develop scientific and cultural cooperation. The visit also tackled the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic and ways of combating terrorism. Qureshi’s visit followed an invitation from his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukri, and came on the back of meetings between Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan. The two leaders met on the sidelines of the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Mecca in 2019 and at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly in New York the same year. During the meetings the two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation and enhance high-level exchanges. Last year, Khan discussed his Global Initiative on Debt Relief in a telephone conversation with Al-Sisi. The initiative aims to provide debt relief for developing countries and free up funds to fight the coronavirus pandemic. In the most recent call between Shoukri and Qureshi in December the two ministers expressed a desire for continuous coordination. Cairo and Islamabad have jointly signed more than 40 agreements and work together closely in the multilateral arena, in particular the United Nations, OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement. *A version of this article appears in print in the 18 February, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

Pakistan and Egypt are working towards enhancing bilateral ties and dynamic multilateral cooperation. Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi called on Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in Cairo Wednesday. He conveyed the warm greetings of Pakistan's leadership to the Egyptian president and appreciated the stability and progress achieved by Egypt under his able leadership. Pakistan will always look to be a partner in peace and progress with Egypt and believes that the two countries could share their experience in countering terrorism and extremism, FM Qureshi said. He stressed that the vision of “Naya Pakistan” was predicated on economic connectivity and ensuring peace within and beyond its borders. According to the Foreign Office, President Sisi welcomed the foreign minister and reciprocated the warm feelings of the Pakistani leadership. He also accepted an invitation to visit Pakistan at the earliest opportunity. Qureshi said his visit indicated Pakistan’s keenness to reinvigorate traditional bilateral relationship rooted in shared faith, culture and values. The minister briefed the Egyptian president on the situation in Pakistan’s neighbourhood, in particular Pakistan’s efforts to facilitate the Afghan peace process, the ongoing human rights violations in Indian Kashmir and continued denial of the Kashmiri people’s legitimate right to self-determination.

News article:
The President's statement came during a virtual preparatory meeting ahead of the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference set to be hosted in Cairo this year Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told the heads of African constitutional and supreme courts and constitutional councils that constitutions should always be reviewed and updated to keep up with challenges affecting the fast-changing world. In a speech Saturday during the virtual preparatory meeting Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) hosted ahead of the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference, El-Sisi asked participating parties to discuss the challenges that face the continent and to work collectively to set joint constitutional rules to support visions. He said the meeting is meant to bring African judicial bodies under one umbrella. El-Sisi added that the status quo forces African countries to deal with the repercussions of the pandemic, adding that the digital transformation requires regulating the legal framework to manage cybersecurity and social media platforms. “The status quo requires us to think collectively in dealing with emerging challenges from the pandemic from a legal and constitutional perspective, and other traditional challenges, led by cooperation for combating terrorism as an obstacle for development and stability,” he said. Combating terrorism, therefore, requires contributions through constitutional law mechanisms to eliminate imminent threats, especially amid efforts to make Africa a unified and harmonious continent, he said. El-Sisi said that the unprecedented and accelerated shift towards digital transformation in societies, the rehabilitation of healthcare systems, and the transition towards a green economy were among emerging challenges arising from the pandemic. He said these changes require “the availability of the [needed] modern constitutional infrastructure capable of dealing with the challenges.” El-Sisi stressed the necessity of regulating the legal framework dealing with cybersecurity, legal governance for social media platforms and its content, and others related to large databases and personal information of citizens. El-Sisi highlighted Egypt’s efforts in the past few years to undertake effective steps towards providing the needed infrastructure to achieve the digital transformation of governmental services. Such steps have emerged as crucial amid the pandemic outbreak, he said. The president invited the participants to benefit from the digital judicial platform launched in previous meetings for the benefit of Africa. The fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference is scheduled to be held later this year in Cairo, according to a SCC statement on Friday. Saturday’s meeting, held under the auspices of President El-Sisi, was chaired by the head of the SCC, Chancellor Said Marei, and attended by senior African judges and international experts, the statement added. The meeting tackled the agenda that will be discussed during the conference, including the "E-justice in Africa since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic," according to Adel Omar Sherif, the vice-chairperson of the SCC.

Traditional trade ties with MENA nations vital for post-Brexit UK Zaid M. Belbagi Turkish Trade Minister, Ruhsar Pekcan and the UK's Ambassador to Turkey Dominick Chilcott attend the signing ceremony of Free Trade Agreement between Turkey and the UK. (File/Getty Images) Short Url https://arab.news/4d3f5 The UK’s departure from the EU has created fear and anxiety over its economic impact. Responsible for 43 percent of UK exports and 53 percent of its imports, the bloc constitutes a key trading partner for the country. Their parting has, however, invigorated London’s efforts to strengthen ties with emerging markets just beyond Europe, including Turkey, Egypt and Morocco. Such trade relationships have existed for centuries and, to many, represent a reversion to a buccaneering and internationally geared Britain that has always sought trade beyond Europe. Where such trade may have historically been exploitative and one-sided, the Brexit phenomenon has made a new relationship an imperative for all parties. For a country that brought the world free trade, the departure from what was a trading bloc may seem incongruous. However, what it has precipitated is an effort to reinvigorate an international trade policy known as “Global Britain.” In seeking to navigate its new geopolitical landscape, the UK government is seeking new commercial opportunities beyond the realm of Brussels. Turkey began its accession process to the EU 25 years ago but it seems no closer to achieving this goal than it was at the beginning. Despite the accession of states with lower levels of development to the EU, the admittance of a Muslim-majority country to a club of European states remains improbable. The UK, however, is no longer bound by the EU’s convoluted Turkey policy and can build a relationship that complements the fact it is the second-largest export destination for Turkish goods. Turkey and the UK signed a free trade agreement on Dec. 29 last year, just before the end of the Brexit transition period. Under this deal, Turkish and British companies can continue to export and import under preferential tariffs. According to Turkish trade analyst Mustafa Oguz, “Turkey is the UK’s 19th-largest trading partner, accounting for 1.3 percent of its total trade in 2019. There is a real opportunity to explore ties with the UK whilst trade contracts with the EU.” Though cooperation with Europe was no doubt transformational, Britain’s worldview was under-exercised while a member of the EU. Zaid M. Belbagi Egypt, with a population a quarter of the size the EU’s, is an important market for the UK. As Europe ages, young nations like those in the Arab world will become critical to international trade, especially for the UK. Bilateral trade in 2019 reached £3.6 billion ($5.05 billion) and UK exports to Egypt accounted for £2.3 billion. This foundation was essential to the association agreement signed by the two nations in early December to replace the Egypt-EU Association Agreement that previously governed relations. The accord was an important proof of concept for the UK, which would have otherwise reverted to World Trade Organization most-favored-nation terms of trade, under which Egypt would have imposed tariffs of up to 19 percent on UK goods. In not only providing a market for Egyptian goods, but also the opportunity to grow the export of UK services to Egypt, which most recently were valued at £826 million, the agreement will reintegrate the UK with a nation it has a long-standing association with. Having neglected relationships “East of Suez” in the late 1960s as it pursued the European Common Market, the UK can now benefit from more widespread international relationships in key growth markets like Egypt. Arguably among the most exciting prospects for UK trade just outside the euro zone is with Morocco. Not only have the two countries had diplomatic relations for more than 800 years, but they are also neighboring countries through the British Mediterranean possession of Gibraltar. Geographic proximity and trade complementarities provide a strong basis upon which to build trade. Most importantly, however, the growth of integral Moroccan infrastructure has the potential to provide an important hub for UK trade in Africa. Though Spanish ports have traditionally dominated the freight traffic between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, the thriving new Moroccan rival at Tanger Med last year processed 20 percent more cargo than in 2019, making it the area’s busiest container port. Though Morocco has done a great deal to integrate itself with the European single market, trade with the UK requires a greater focus — despite their historic ties, the UK is only the eighth-largest investor in Morocco. The Gibraltar-Tangier tunnel plan, which is now being given serious thought, has the potential to connect two continents and provide a conduit for trade that would greatly offset the UK’s short-term costs of leaving the EU. As in the case of other long-standing relationships London has, its ties with Morocco require a review in light of Brexit. A trade partner with cheaper labor costs and an increasingly high-quality infrastructure network can contribute as a key hub for UK business in Africa. The historian Niall Ferguson described the Victorians, who escorted the world into a British vision of free trade, as being advocates of policies that could have been “just published by the International Monetary Fund, if not the World Bank: Free trade, balanced budgets, sound money, the common law, incorrupt administration and investment in infrastructure financed by international loans.” His analysis, though coy, does highlight that the UK’s post-Brexit policy is far more aligned with the country’s traditional internationalist outlook than the constraints of the EU allowed. Though cooperation with Europe was no doubt transformational, Britain’s worldview was under-exercised while a member of the EU. Developing trade with traditional partners in the Middle East and North Africa region is a great opportunity for the UK to both reconfigure its economic policy and to pick up the thread as a go-to international partner for emerging markets.

Developing trade with traditional partners in the Middle East and North Africa region is a great opportunity for the UK to both reconfigure its economic policy and to pick up the thread as a go-to international partner for emerging markets.

"Shoukry affirmed the strategic ties binding Egypt and the United States, looking forward to enhancing their prospects in a manner that would serve the two countries' interests," said the statement. The two diplomats also discussed the latest developments in Libya as well as the Palestinian cause, asserting the need to continue joint work to combat terrorism and address other challenges and threats facing the region. The phone talks came a day after Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi met with head of the U.S. Central Command Kenneth McKenzie in Cairo, where they discussed ways to strengthen military and security cooperation. Cairo has been a key regional ally of Washington for decades. Egypt has been receiving military and economic aid from the United States, amounting to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars annually, since it signed the U.S.-sponsored peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Enditem

The private sector should direct its investments to state projects, Madbouly said Egypt counts on the private sector to raise growth levels through its investments in the government's projects and initiatives, said Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly at a webinar organised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Egypt on Thursday. Madbouly added that the government has allocated EGP 500 billion for the Decent Life initiative and its affiliated projects despite the coronavirus crisis and the subsequent pressure on the state budget. The projects of the initiative are meant to upgrade the infrastructure of Egyptian villages, improve the quality of life of their people, create job opportunities, reduce the harsh repercussions of the pandemic on the vulnerable, and enable them to access basic needs and services, Madbouly said. The private sector should play a pivotal role in this regard through investing in the initiative’s projects. “We will not continue to spend more and more from the state budget in such projects. The private sector should be at the fore, directing its investments to state projects.” Madbouly urged American investors to tap the opportunities that Egypt have, asserting Egypt’s desire for more involvement in the Egyptian economy by the US private sector. He noted that US investments in Egypt stood at about $23 billion in 2020. The prime minister stated that COVID-19 has caused the harshest impact on the economy in seven decades. He highlighted the precautionary and pre-emptive measures that Egypt adopted during the first wave of the pandemic that contributed to, together with the successful economic reform programme, making Egypt the only country in the region to see positive growth in 2020 and to navigate the crisis with minimum losses. He noted that the government managed to set the balance between preserving public health and managing the economy without resorting to a total lockdown. The measures included allocating EGP 100 billion to mitigate the repercussions of the pandemic, appropriating a total of EGP 13 billion to support the export sector, applying a comprehensive system of detecting and tracking infected cases, launching the Universal Health Insurance system, and securing the basic food and medical supplies the market needs. On the support Egypt’s banking sector extended, Madbouly explained that it has allocated EGP 50 billion to back real-estate for low and middle-income classes and EGP 20 billion to support the stock market. Egypt has also launched launching other initiatives that target boosting the private sector, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and retail loans. “Egypt is focused now on regaining its macroeconomic pre-pandemic levels. For this purpose, we are working on upgrading the country’s road networks, ports, and implementing projects that secure a sustainable and resilient economy, including establishing sustainable cities, such as the New Administrative Capital,” Madbouly said. He underscored Egypt’s strategic target to be a regional energy hub, noting that the private sector has a critical role to play in this regard and has the chance to tap the significant opportunities that the sector provides. Madbouly added that Egypt targets securing 20 percent of its energy needs from renewable resources by 2022. He said the country has started the vaccination process already, adding that Egypt has contracted with the COVAX Coalition to receive vaccine shipments in a bid to secure the country’s needs. Coronavirus infections in Egypt are now under control, however, he added. Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of the International Affairs Division at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said that the US business community is focusing on investing in healthcare, fintech, digitisation, agri-business, and energy in Egypt. Brilliant added that the US business community is committed to strengthening bilateral economic relations and investing in Egypt’s growth, stressing that the US businesspersons in Washington and Egypt are paying great attention to investing in Egypt and to bring new investors to the domestic market as well. He lauded Egypt’s economic and structural reforms that enabled the country to navigate the crisis with resilience and strength. Search Keywords: Short link:

Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) Counselor Mohammed Abdel Wahab met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on Friday. Iraqi officials and ministers, as well as Egypt’s ambassador to Iraq, attended the meeting, which came in line with the Iraqi-Egyptian cooperation in all economic aspects and the establishment of a successful bilateral partnership between private sector representatives. During the meeting, participants reviewed cooperation mechanisms and Egyptian companies’ implementation of development projects in Iraq that would contribute to doubling bilateral cooperation and increasing national income. According to an Egyptian government statement, Kadhimi highlighted the strong Iraqi-Egyptian relations and Cairo’s pivotal role at the regional and international levels under the leadership of President Abdel Fattah El Sisi. The PM hailed Sisi’s support for Baghdad in various fields of common interest. He welcomed all Egyptian companies operating in Iraq, asserting his keenness to provide all the support needed to facilitate implementation of their projects. Kadhimi further praised Egypt’s success in preserving its position as the largest recipient of foreign direct investments in the African continent. Meanwhile, Abdel Wahab conveyed to Kadhimi greetings by the Egyptian Prime Minister, Mostafa Madbouly. He explained the outcomes of the joint work between GAFI and the Iraqi National Investment Authority, aimed at “maximizing mutual benefit from both countries’ experiences and taking the maximum advantage of their cooperation.” The Egyptian senior official stressed keenness to benefit from the productive potential, double investment rates, and increase the added value of natural resources in a way that achieves both countries’ common interests and creates more job opportunities. Egyptian companies are eager to study the investment opportunities available in the Iraqi market, he noted, especially in light of the reliable expertise that many of these companies have and can be transferred to Iraqi cadres. Abdel Wahab affirmed the GAFI’s willingness to provide all the support to Iraqi investors interested in various investment opportunities in his country. He pointed to initiating implementation steps to provide a training program to several Iraqi National Investment Authority cadres in Egypt, including exchanging expertise in measures and services provided by investor service centers, as well as promoting and attracting foreign direct investment.

Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly gave a speech via video conference in an African Union (AU) meeting on behalf of the president Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi stressed on Wednesday the importance of intensifying international cooperation to eradicate the coronavirus pandemic and its implications in Africa through efforts including fair vaccine distribution among countries. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly delivered El-Sisi's statement in a speech via video conference in an African Union (AU) meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi, who is the current chair of the AU, and African leaders participated in the meeting. In the speech, El-Sisi urged continuing coordination between the African Union and international partners to support the health systems in Africa. He also affirmed the importance of cooperation to enable the African continent to produce coronavirus vaccine doses amid challenges related to the production capacities and fair distribution of medicines and vaccines. In this regard, El-Sisi expressed appreciation for his French counterpart’s efforts to continuously coordinate with AU member states in order to support the health and medical systems in Africa against the pandemic and enable African countries to have fair access to vaccine doses in the appropriate time and with acceptable prices. The president also hailed Macron’s representation of the African voice at the latest Group of Seven Summit, saying that this representation contributed positively to the G7 Leaders statement released after the summit. According to the 19 February statement, the G7 Leaders committed over $4 billion to the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator ACT-A and the Gavi-led global initiative aimed at equitable access to coronavirus vaccines, known as COVAX. This raised the collective G7 support to $7.5 billion. In an interview with the Financial Times in February, Macron proposed that rich Western countries give 3 to 5 percent of their current coronavirus vaccine stock to Africa. “I would like to emphasise that our African peoples deserve a lot from us in order to advance our health system,” El-Sisi’s statement said. He added that advancing the African health system requires “continuing our relentless efforts to develop our continental work and international solidarity in order to overcome the negative challenges the coronavirus pandemic has posed.” “Let us always bear in mind the aspirations and hopes of our African peoples, who rely on us in securing the vaccine. This invites us to speak with one voice in all regional and international forums, to ensure the advancement of the African health system,” the president added. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Against the backdrop of various high-level meetings between Egypt and Sudan, President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi is expected to visit the Sudanese capital Khartoum between Thursday and Saturday, according to informed government sources. The expected presidential visit comes shortly after Egypt extended an invitation to Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Homdok to visit Cairo. It also comes after President Al-Sisi received Mariam Sadek Al-Mahdi, Sudan’s newly appointed minister of foreign affairs, in Cairo. Most significantly, it comes hours after top military personnel from both Egypt and Sudan signed a new agreement on military cooperation in Khartoum. On Tuesday, the military chiefs-of-staff of Egypt and Sudan, Mohamed Farid and Mohamed Othman, respectively, said that the military cooperation agreement was set to allow for closer cooperation on all issues of relevance to national security in every possible way and on every front. “We are faced with common regional threats, and we have to work together to face these threats on all fronts,” Farid said. Also on Tuesday, this time in Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri and Al-Mahdi were echoing their equal determination for joint coordination to take place in the negotiations with Ethiopia over the construction, filling, and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a mega-dam built on the Blue Nile in Ethiopia without the agreement of the two downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan. The two ministers called for international mediation to facilitate a legally binding agreement with Ethiopia ahead of the second filling of the dam that Addis Ababa is planning to execute this summer without the agreement of either Cairo or Khartoum, just as it did last summer during the first filling of the dam. Khartoum has requested the Democratic Republic of Congo, the current chair of the African Union (AU), to engage the UN, the EU, and the US to help push for a deal on the dam in the coming weeks or months. In Cairo, Egypt’s top diplomat gave his full support to the proposal on Tuesday. “We are seeing a moment in which Egypt and Sudan have the equal political will to consolidate cooperation to serve their common interests,” said another Egyptian diplomat. “We don’t necessarily agree on everything, but we do agree that we need one another to help face up to some serious threats,” he added. According to this diplomat and to a Sudanese diplomat, both speaking on condition of anonymity, the GERD is a pressing concern for both countries, though it is not the only one. They said that the security of the Horn of Africa and the situation in the Sahel and Sahara, with its impact on the overall situation in North and East Africa, were also matters of concern for both countries. “Sudan stands at a strategically sensitive point between the Sahel and the Sahara and the Red Sea coast. This area faces serious security threats, including trafficking by militant groups, arms, and drugs,” the Egyptian diplomat said. He added that the new military pact that Egypt and Sudan signed in Khartoum on Tuesday would help both countries coordinate their security strategy “on these very troubling fronts”. “We have been seeing an increase in militant activities all along the shores of the Red Sea, especially around Somalia and Eritrea, and we have been monitoring the infiltration of militants that are being pushed through into the Sahel and Sahara zone to end up first in Chad and then in Libya,” the Egyptian diplomat said. He added that Egypt was “discussing military cooperation deals with several other countries in both the Horn of Africa and the Sahel and Sahara,” stating that “we have good reasons to want to act promptly there. We cannot just let things go.” According to the Sudanese diplomat, Khartoum is equally keen to avoid possible militant infiltration. The country has recently seen its name removed from the US list of countries supporting terrorism, and it is hoping for stability and security in order to be able to better position itself as an attractive destination for investment and to help a frail economy get back on its feet. “In this respect, we welcome cooperation with Egypt to serve the interests of our two countries,” he said. What is mostly at stake today, however, according to both diplomats, is security in the Red Sea. With the fluid situation in Yemen that is verging on the status of becoming a failed or non-viable state and the growing foreign military presence in and around the ports of the Red Sea, both Egypt and Sudan need to make sure that they are alert to possible security breaches. Both Egypt and Sudan are members of the recently launched Red Sea Forum along with six other countries from Africa and Asia. However, as the Egyptian and Sudanese diplomats said, what Egypt and Sudan share is perhaps much more than either shares with the other members of the forum. Late last year, Egypt and Sudan carried out their first joint military drills called Nile Eagles-1. These were conducted in Sudan. According to Egyptian and Sudanese diplomatic sources, future naval drills could be coming up this year. The prospects of military cooperation, crucial as it is for both countries, and the question of the equally crucial GERD negotiations are not the only matters of common interest for Cairo and Khartoum. Economic cooperation in gas and oil, mining, agriculture, and trade are also of interest to both Egypt and Sudan. Cairo and Khartoum have been slowly but surely discussing major schemes for economic cooperation that would cover agriculture and industry. The launch of these could be announced during the visit by Hamdok to Cairo in the coming days or weeks. “Much will depend on the talks that President Al-Sisi will be holding in Khartoum. This visit is a very firm show of the commitment on the side of Egypt at the highest level to reach out to Sudan. It shows that for Egypt Sudan matters whoever is ruling in Khartoum,” the Egyptian diplomat said. According to Amany Al-Tawil, a senior Sudan expert at the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, the current movement in Egyptian-Sudanese relations will produce a new framework for bilateral relations between the two Nile Basin countries. “I think we are about to see qualitative progress in cooperation between the two countries. We are seeing the beginning of an unprecedented process of strategic bonding,” Al-Tawil said. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 March, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

The prospects of military cooperation, crucial as it is for both countries, and the question of the equally crucial GERD negotiations are not the only matters of common interest for Cairo and Khartoum. Economic cooperation in gas and oil, mining, agriculture, and trade are also of interest to both Egypt and Sudan. Cairo and Khartoum have been slowly but surely discussing major schemes for economic cooperation that would cover agriculture and industry. The launch of these could be announced during the visit by Hamdok to Cairo in the coming days or weeks. “Much will depend on the talks that President Al-Sisi will be holding in Khartoum. This visit is a very firm show of the commitment on the side of Egypt at the highest level to reach out to Sudan. It shows that for Egypt Sudan matters whoever is ruling in Khartoum,” the Egyptian diplomat said. According to Amany Al-Tawil, a senior Sudan expert at the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, the current movement in Egyptian-Sudanese relations will produce a new framework for bilateral relations between the two Nile Basin countries. “I think we are about to see qualitative progress in cooperation between the two countries. We are seeing the beginning of an unprecedented process of strategic bonding,” Al-Tawil said. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 March, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

Against the backdrop of various high-level meetings between Egypt and Sudan, President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi is expected to visit the Sudanese capital Khartoum between Thursday and Saturday, according to informed government sources. The expected presidential visit comes shortly after Egypt extended an invitation to Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Homdok to visit Cairo. It also comes after President Al-Sisi received Mariam Sadek Al-Mahdi, Sudan’s newly appointed minister of foreign affairs, in Cairo. Most significantly, it comes hours after top military personnel from both Egypt and Sudan signed a new agreement on military cooperation in Khartoum. On Tuesday, the military chiefs-of-staff of Egypt and Sudan, Mohamed Farid and Mohamed Othman, respectively, said that the military cooperation agreement was set to allow for closer cooperation on all issues of relevance to national security in every possible way and on every front. “We are faced with common regional threats, and we have to work together to face these threats on all fronts,” Farid said. Also on Tuesday, this time in Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri and Al-Mahdi were echoing their equal determination for joint coordination to take place in the negotiations with Ethiopia over the construction, filling, and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a mega-dam built on the Blue Nile in Ethiopia without the agreement of the two downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan. The two ministers called for international mediation to facilitate a legally binding agreement with Ethiopia ahead of the second filling of the dam that Addis Ababa is planning to execute this summer without the agreement of either Cairo or Khartoum, just as it did last summer during the first filling of the dam. Khartoum has requested the Democratic Republic of Congo, the current chair of the African Union (AU), to engage the UN, the EU, and the US to help push for a deal on the dam in the coming weeks or months. In Cairo, Egypt’s top diplomat gave his full support to the proposal on Tuesday. “We are seeing a moment in which Egypt and Sudan have the equal political will to consolidate cooperation to serve their common interests,” said another Egyptian diplomat. “We don’t necessarily agree on everything, but we do agree that we need one another to help face up to some serious threats,” he added. According to this diplomat and to a Sudanese diplomat, both speaking on condition of anonymity, the GERD is a pressing concern for both countries, though it is not the only one. They said that the security of the Horn of Africa and the situation in the Sahel and Sahara, with its impact on the overall situation in North and East Africa, were also matters of concern for both countries. “Sudan stands at a strategically sensitive point between the Sahel and the Sahara and the Red Sea coast. This area faces serious security threats, including trafficking by militant groups, arms, and drugs,” the Egyptian diplomat said. He added that the new military pact that Egypt and Sudan signed in Khartoum on Tuesday would help both countries coordinate their security strategy “on these very troubling fronts”. “We have been seeing an increase in militant activities all along the shores of the Red Sea, especially around Somalia and Eritrea, and we have been monitoring the infiltration of militants that are being pushed through into the Sahel and Sahara zone to end up first in Chad and then in Libya,” the Egyptian diplomat said. He added that Egypt was “discussing military cooperation deals with several other countries in both the Horn of Africa and the Sahel and Sahara,” stating that “we have good reasons to want to act promptly there. We cannot just let things go.” According to the Sudanese diplomat, Khartoum is equally keen to avoid possible militant infiltration. The country has recently seen its name removed from the US list of countries supporting terrorism, and it is hoping for stability and security in order to be able to better position itself as an attractive destination for investment and to help a frail economy get back on its feet. “In this respect, we welcome cooperation with Egypt to serve the interests of our two countries,” he said. What is mostly at stake today, however, according to both diplomats, is security in the Red Sea. With the fluid situation in Yemen that is verging on the status of becoming a failed or non-viable state and the growing foreign military presence in and around the ports of the Red Sea, both Egypt and Sudan need to make sure that they are alert to possible security breaches. Both Egypt and Sudan are members of the recently launched Red Sea Forum along with six other countries from Africa and Asia. However, as the Egyptian and Sudanese diplomats said, what Egypt and Sudan share is perhaps much more than either shares with the other members of the forum. Late last year, Egypt and Sudan carried out their first joint military drills called Nile Eagles-1. These were conducted in Sudan. According to Egyptian and Sudanese diplomatic sources, future naval drills could be coming up this year. The prospects of military cooperation, crucial as it is for both countries, and the question of the equally crucial GERD negotiations are not the only matters of common interest for Cairo and Khartoum. Economic cooperation in gas and oil, mining, agriculture, and trade are also of interest to both Egypt and Sudan.

The second edition of the Aswan Forum shed light on challenges facing the African continent. Covid-19 topped the list Policymakers and experts are expected to develop context-specific and action-oriented recommendations as to how Africa can recover from the coronavirus pandemic after the Aswan II Forum ends on 5 March. Through the so-called “Aswan Conclusions”, African, national, regional and continental stakeholders, together with global partners, are expected to join forces to ensure that the ramifications of the pandemic do not impede the achievement of the African Union’s 2063 Agenda “The Africa We Want”. The Aswan Forum II was held this week under the theme “Shaping Africa’s New Normal: Recovering Stronger, Rebuilding Better”. The forum’s second edition was held virtually starting 1 March. The first was held in December 2019 in Aswan. In the keynote speech that he delivered in the opening session, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri highlighted the importance of joint African action and “diligent work” to achieve peace and development in the continent. More importantly, he stressed the importance of finding ways to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on various fields and trying to find the required solutions to the unprecedented challenge in a way that realises the targets of the AU’s 2063 Agenda and the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. “The pandemic contributed to exacerbating the traditional challenges that Africa faces in the fields of peace and security. Thus, it is important to bolster African countries’ capabilities to face the present security challenges, topped by combating terrorism and foreign terrorists,” Shoukri said in his address to the inaugural session. In his speech, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi highlighted that Egypt was keen to hold the second edition of the forum to use the momentum generated by the first edition and its successes. “Driven by its faith, Egypt believes that the present time is optimum to discuss together the daunting challenges facing our continent to seek the best ways and mechanisms to shore up our common efforts to get over the pandemic and to rebuild better to take our continent to safety,” he said. Al-Sisi described the activation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) earlier this year as a “good example of the success of our collective work”. He said that besides the challenge of Covid-19, the continent was still suffering from the danger of armed conflicts and civil wars, as well as organized crime, the spread of weapons, illegal emigration and forced displacement. “All these challenges require joint efforts to support the mechanism that stops and settles conflicts and enhances the continent’s abilities to face these challenges.” Thus, he said, African and international solidarity is an urgent matter for humanity to overcome these challenges as well as that of the coronavirus. “The current stage has brought new challenges, foremost of which is providing the necessary vaccine for our peoples. I would like to emphasise the necessity of providing such a vaccine in a more equitable and just manner in response to the demands of the peoples of our continent,” he said. Al-Sisi’s speech was followed by addresses from several other African presidents, including those of Rwanda, Burundi, Tunisia, and South Sudan who agreed that the continent is passing through exceptional circumstances and that solidarity and joint work is the only way to deal with the challenge. UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Chairperson of the African Union Commission Musa Faki participated in the forum. Guterres called for a global vaccination plan that makes the coronavirus vaccines available and equally distributed. He also urged the international community to support the world’s most vulnerable people and countries by taking various measures, from strengthening health systems to providing debt relief. “Pandemic recovery is also an opportunity to address the fragilities and inequalities that have been exposed by the pandemic, and to pursue a more inclusive and sustainable path that advances gender equality and safeguards the global environment,” he said in his address to the opening session. Guterres concluded by praising the Africans’ efforts to advance the well-being of the continent’s people. “The United Nations will continue to support Africa’s efforts across this agenda, including silencing the guns,” Guterres said. Faki said that the pandemic revealed the dire need for African countries to build more resilient economies to face crises. He highlighted the need to work on establishing a new healthcare system and building health capacities to ensure proper healthcare to all Africans. The first day’s sessions of the forum were devoted to discussing the impact of the pandemic, ways to recover from it, how to strengthen sustainable peace and development, and the need for an integrated response to the growth of terrorism in the shadow of the pandemic. The AU theme for the forum is “Arts, Culture and Heritage: Levers for Building the Africa We Want”. The issue was discussed in detail on the third day. Soft power was said to be likely to bring nations together in a way that helps them address challenges with enlightened thought that fits the culture and civilisation of the African nations. It also tackled other fields, including enhancing intra-African trade after the launch of the AfCFTA in January. The forum, which saw the participation of African leaders, senior officials and heads of governments, will end on Friday with the closing session “Chartering Africa’s Way Forward: Recovering Stronger Rebuilding Better”. The event is organised by the Cairo International Centre for Conflict Resolution, Peacebuilding and Peacekeeping. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 March, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

'My first trip was to South Sudan, my second was to Egypt,' said Khartoum's new top diplomat Sudan's Foreign Minister Mariam Al-Saddiq Al-Mahdi expressed on Thursday her country’s keenness to enhance cooperation with Egypt, saying Khartoum's relations with Cairo are strategic to security in the region. "My first trip was to South Sudan, my second was to Egypt," said Al-Mahdi as she addressed policy experts and journalists at Egypt's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies (ACPSS) in Cairo. Al-Mahdi said that Sudan's relations with Egypt are "of strategic importance to the security of the region," adding that both states share African and Islamic identities and are part of the Nile Basin group of states and the international community. She also called for establishing an Egyptian-Sudanese dialogue on how to develop relations between the two states in the future. On Tuesday, Al-Mahdi met her Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry, where the latter said that Egypt supports Sudan’s recent suggestion regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) negotiations. Sudan recently called for international mediation in the stalled GERD talks, involving a quartet committee composed of the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and the United States, in order to reach a legally binding agreement with Ethiopia on the filling and operation of the dam. “The second filling of the GERD endangers the lives of 20 million Sudanese citizens,” the Sudanese minister said. Al-Mahdi said that both Egypt and Sudan are committed to reaching a legally binding agreement on the filling and operation of the dam before the second filling. Last month, the daughter of Sudan's former premier and Al-Umma Party leader Saddiq Al-Mahdi, was appointed as top diplomat in Abdallah Hamdok's new cabinet. Shoukry congratulated her at the time for becoming Khartoum's new prime minister in a phone call and invited her to visit Cairo at the earliest opportunity. Search Keywords: Short link:

American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is calling on its supporters to urge US senators to seek a broader nuclear agreement with Iran, media reported on Saturday. According to a text message cited by Press TV, AIPAC says that Iran “Israel's and America's greatest threat in the Middle East,” and asks its supporters to convince US lawmakers to sign the Menendez/Graham draft letter that opposes reviving the 2015 agreement in its current form. “Please urge your senators to sign a bipartisan letter to President Biden... expressing the bipartisan consensus that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat to US national security interests and our allies and partners,” said the group. While this call is not rejecting the idea of reviving the deal, AIPAC has also launched a campaign against the deal itself.

News article:
Reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran is supposed to be one of President Joe Biden's landmark foreign policy achievements. A return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal would, according to its supporters, end the immediate threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and take the heat out of simmering tensions across the Middle East, allowing Biden to refocus U.S. foreign policy on its next great challenges, especially China. The Biden administration and President Hassan Rouhani's government in Tehran both want to revive the JCPOA. But their window is closing. The U.S. and Iran have spent the first months of the year stuck in a stalemate, waiting for the other to blink first. Rouhani's term will end in June when Iranians head to the polls. The country's ruling clerics are all but certain to pave the way for a hardliner to become the next president, perhaps even a candidate drawn from the ranks of the zealous Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). As Iranian activity slows during its Nowruz new year holiday, there are no signs of an imminent breakthrough between Washington, D.C. and Tehran. After the holiday, the presidential election campaign will kick into a higher gear. Less than three months into his term, Biden might have already missed his shot. "I have a hard time believing that if Rouhani is gone, the JCPOA is going to be viable," said Sina Toossi, a senior research analyst at the National Iranian American Council. Rouhani has "fought tooth and nail" to keep the deal alive despite domestic skepticism, Toossi added, but his options are almost exhausted. "Rouhani's hands are largely tied, he's a true lame duck," he said. Rouhani and his Foreign Minister Javad Zarif have weathered much domestic criticism of the JCPOA and recently had to defend their desire to revive the accord to the conservative-dominated parliament. With the end of the Rouhani era in sight, the momentum is with the conservatives. Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 and subsequent sanctions campaign vindicated those Iranians who were skeptical of engaging with the U.S. in the first place. The assassinations of Major General Qassem Soleimani and nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh are further evidence for the skeptics that the U.S. and its allies cannot be trusted to engage in good faith. Deterrence is the order of the day, they say, at the heart of which could sit a nuclear arsenal. Above all other concerns sits the security of the Islamic Republic. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 81 and unwell. Several past reports of his imminent demise have proved unfounded, but Khamenei knows his time is nearly up. The regime has resorted to mass violence to suppress protests in recent years. At the end of 2019, it killed about 1,500 people in order to put down unrest sparked by a new fuel tax. Tehran has also periodically throttled internet connections to try to stem the spread of public anger at state corruption and brutality. Anti-regime sentiment in Iran is real and widespread, though there is still no realistic political alternative to marshal that anger. A conservative president—in Khamenei's words a "young and hezbollahi" (ideologically hardline) figure—would ensure a smooth transition to the next supreme leader. As Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, this election is "all about Iran's most important voter, which is Khamenei." Among the candidates vying to be Khamenei's chosen man is Hossein Dehghan, a former IRGC air force brigadier general who served as Rouhani's defense minister. Another is Parviz Fattah, a former IRGC member who heads the Mostazafan Foundation charity, which was recently put under sanctions by the Treasury Department. A third is one of the IRGC's youngest generals, Saeed Mohammad, a 53-year-old highly educated technocrat who until recently was the commander of the guard corps' Khatam-al Anbiya engineering operation. It remains to be seen whether an IRGC or conservative candidate would—with approval from Khamenei—still pursue JCPOA revival. Iran knows it needs relief from U.S. sanctions,and hawks point to suspicions of secret nuclear sites in Iran as evidence that Tehran might continue advanced research nuclear even under a resurrected deal. But a conservative president is unlikely to prove an easier negotiating partner for Biden. There would be a "constellation of diplomacy skeptics" in such an administration, Taleblu said. This might make escalation more likely, whether through increased regional proxy attacks, covert actions or expanded nuclear activity. Then, said Toossi, "America is going to be left to choose between either launching military strikes, or it's going to come to the negotiating table and negotiate a new deal with the hardliners." For Iran hawks in Congress, the identity of Iran's next president is largely irrelevant. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said the ayatollah-controlled regime would "continue seeking the destruction of the United States regardless of the outcomes of their sham elections." Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) dismissed the elections as "a farce controlled by the Iranian regime," one that "violated Obama's deal, funnels weapons to terrorists, takes Americans hostage, and brutally represses the Iranian people." Rubio added: "The U.S. should continue to put maximum pressure on the Iranian regime until it halts its malign and destabilizing behavior. It is in the interest of our nation's security to accept nothing less." One congressional GOP staffer told Newsweek that Republicans on Capitol Hill believe Biden is fully committed to an Obama-style approach to Iran—prioritizing a deal with Tehran over maximum pressure. Some believe Biden is genuinely trying to constrain Iran, but others fear the president will embolden the regime in its malign regional activities. Most will likely continue to defend maximum pressure and remain skeptical of diplomacy. Characterizing Biden's approach as "reckless," the congressional staffer said: "The Iranians remain a violent terrorist expansionist regime." Biden's public lack of progress on the JCPOA is concerning supporters of the accord, especially after the president's special envoy on Iran, Rob Malley, said the administration would not let the June election dictate the speed of talks. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said "the window for meaningful diplomatic engagement on Iran's nuclear activities is narrowing." Van Hollen added that he "fully" supported Biden's so far unsuccessful push for a mutual return to compliance by both sides ahead of the "likely" election of a hardliner president. "Time is of the essence to constrain Iran's nuclear program through smart diplomacy," Van Hollen said. Van Hollen and other Democrats have blamed Trump for the state of U.S.-Iran relations. "The Trump administration's reckless foreign policy moves isolated us from our allies and allowed Iran to ramp up its uranium enrichment activities, reducing its breakout time from more than a year to a matter of months today," he said, adding that Iranian hardliners had been "buoyed by the Trump administration's feckless strategy." If Biden does miss the Rouhani window, Iran's next president will try to present the U.S. with a choice between "a regional war that's going to be very costly, or a new nuclear deal that is probably less strong than the JCPOA," Toossi said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has also acknowledged that the election will have a bearing on what role his inspectors play. Asked about the election, Grossi told Newsweek on Tuesday: "It's a factor." "I would say that in whatever scenario—hardliners, softliners, any liners—we have to solve this issue, one way or the other," Grossi said. "I hope it can be done and I think it's in everyone's interest and everyone's advantage to come to a solution to this problem, and I think the Iranians recognise this themselves." There is still hope for JCPOA progress in the coming months, even if both sides are sticking to their guns—at least publicly—and denying there has been any behind-the-scenes contact. Any success would come despite conservatives in both countries pushing to kill the deal, with the help of U.S. allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia. "There's so much pressure here," Toossi said, "from Congress, hawks, hawkish organizations, pro-Israel groups and lobbies." "I think Biden is trying to navigate this pressure," he added. "They're trying to placate a lot of these people in Congress. They ultimately do want JCPOA return, I believe, but the way they're going about it, they risk losing this opportunity."

News article:
Reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran is supposed to be one of President Joe Biden's landmark foreign policy achievements. A return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal would, according to its supporters, end the immediate threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and take the heat out of simmering tensions across the Middle East, allowing Biden to refocus U.S. foreign policy on its next great challenges, especially China. The Biden administration and President Hassan Rouhani's government in Tehran both want to revive the JCPOA. But their window is closing. The U.S. and Iran have spent the first months of the year stuck in a stalemate, waiting for the other to blink first. Rouhani's term will end in June when Iranians head to the polls. The country's ruling clerics are all but certain to pave the way for a hardliner to become the next president, perhaps even a candidate drawn from the ranks of the zealous Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). As Iranian activity slows during its Nowruz new year holiday, there are no signs of an imminent breakthrough between Washington, D.C. and Tehran. After the holiday, the presidential election campaign will kick into a higher gear. Less than three months into his term, Biden might have already missed his shot. "I have a hard time believing that if Rouhani is gone, the JCPOA is going to be viable," said Sina Toossi, a senior research analyst at the National Iranian American Council. Rouhani has "fought tooth and nail" to keep the deal alive despite domestic skepticism, Toossi added, but his options are almost exhausted. "Rouhani's hands are largely tied, he's a true lame duck," he said. Rouhani and his Foreign Minister Javad Zarif have weathered much domestic criticism of the JCPOA and recently had to defend their desire to revive the accord to the conservative-dominated parliament. With the end of the Rouhani era in sight, the momentum is with the conservatives. Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 and subsequent sanctions campaign vindicated those Iranians who were skeptical of engaging with the U.S. in the first place. The assassinations of Major General Qassem Soleimani and nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh are further evidence for the skeptics that the U.S. and its allies cannot be trusted to engage in good faith. Deterrence is the order of the day, they say, at the heart of which could sit a nuclear arsenal. Above all other concerns sits the security of the Islamic Republic. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 81 and unwell. Several past reports of his imminent demise have proved unfounded, but Khamenei knows his time is nearly up. The regime has resorted to mass violence to suppress protests in recent years. At the end of 2019, it killed about 1,500 people in order to put down unrest sparked by a new fuel tax. Tehran has also periodically throttled internet connections to try to stem the spread of public anger at state corruption and brutality. Anti-regime sentiment in Iran is real and widespread, though there is still no realistic political alternative to marshal that anger. A conservative president—in Khamenei's words a "young and hezbollahi" (ideologically hardline) figure—would ensure a smooth transition to the next supreme leader. As Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, this election is "all about Iran's most important voter, which is Khamenei." Among the candidates vying to be Khamenei's chosen man is Hossein Dehghan, a former IRGC air force brigadier general who served as Rouhani's defense minister. Another is Parviz Fattah, a former IRGC member who heads the Mostazafan Foundation charity, which was recently put under sanctions by the Treasury Department. A third is one of the IRGC's youngest generals, Saeed Mohammad, a 53-year-old highly educated technocrat who until recently was the commander of the guard corps' Khatam-al Anbiya engineering operation. It remains to be seen whether an IRGC or conservative candidate would—with approval from Khamenei—still pursue JCPOA revival. Iran knows it needs relief from U.S. sanctions,and hawks point to suspicions of secret nuclear sites in Iran as evidence that Tehran might continue advanced research nuclear even under a resurrected deal. But a conservative president is unlikely to prove an easier negotiating partner for Biden. There would be a "constellation of diplomacy skeptics" in such an administration, Taleblu said. This might make escalation more likely, whether through increased regional proxy attacks, covert actions or expanded nuclear activity. Then, said Toossi, "America is going to be left to choose between either launching military strikes, or it's going to come to the negotiating table and negotiate a new deal with the hardliners." For Iran hawks in Congress, the identity of Iran's next president is largely irrelevant. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said the ayatollah-controlled regime would "continue seeking the destruction of the United States regardless of the outcomes of their sham elections." Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) dismissed the elections as "a farce controlled by the Iranian regime," one that "violated Obama's deal, funnels weapons to terrorists, takes Americans hostage, and brutally represses the Iranian people."

News article:
A bipartisan group of more than 40 senators is sounding the alarm on Iran’s nuclear program, urging President Biden to use a mix of “diplomatic and economic tools.” The letter to Biden — led by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) — comes as Biden seeks to have the U.S. rejoin the Iran nuclear deal that former President Trump withdrew from in 2018, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “While we may have differing views on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action of 2015 and the overall approach of the Trump Administration’s maximum pressure campaign, we must confront the reality that Iran has accelerated its nuclear activity in alarming ways including increasing its centrifuge research and production and enriching uranium up to 20 percent,” the 41 senators wrote. “Iran should have no doubt about America’s policy. Democrats and Republicans may have tactical differences, but we are united on preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior,” they continued. The Biden administration has said it does not intend to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that targeted a wide range of Iranian sectors until Tehran returns to compliance with the JCPOA — in particular, limiting the country’s uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent under the terms of the deal. Iran has rejected those terms, calling for the Biden administration and international community to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration before it will agree to return to compliance with the deal. Tehran also has threatened to ban visits by international nuclear inspectors that are required by the terms of the deal if concessions are not reached. Most Democratic lawmakers have thrown their support behind Biden’s efforts to rejoin the JCPOA. But Republicans have outright rejected rejoining the agreement even as the Biden administration says it would use it as a starting point to negotiate a “longer and stronger” deal that addresses Iran’s other behavior. This includes confronting Iran over its ballistic missile program; funding for terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East; human rights abuses against its own citizens; and politically motivated arrests of American citizens. The bipartisan letter sent Thursday acknowledged such differences between Democrats and Republicans. “Looking ahead, we strongly believe that you should use the full force of our diplomatic and economic tools in concert with our allies on the United Nations Security Council and in the region to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,” the senators wrote. They also raised concerns about ongoing attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias and called for the administration to prioritize the release of American citizens held in Iran: Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz and Emad Shargi. The lawmakers further called it “critical” for the administration to consult with key Middle East allies — Israel and Gulf nations – on a “path forward with Iran.” The bipartisan letter from senators follows an initiative by Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the House. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of 140 House lawmakers called on the Biden administration to take a “comprehensive” approach to threats posed by Iran beyond engagement on the nuclear deal.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has dug up an old Biden tweet and used it to attack his administration's stubborn intransigence on returning to the JCPOA.

"It's sadly ironic that the State Dept is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump administration abandoned."@POTUS, 2019 Your admin follows Trump's footsteps while trying to use his unlawful sanctions as "leverage".

Zarif's commentary was accentuated by his decision to change his profile pic to a hilarious caricature of himself. The diplomat indicated on his Instagram page that he plans to use caricatures created throughout his seven-and-a-half-year tenure as foreign minister throughout the remainder of his term, which is expected to wrap up in June after presidential elections.

Time to kick this one. pic.twitter.com/PIhN1YwT3e — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) March 30, 2021 "Your administration follows Trump's footsteps while trying to use his unlawful sanctions as 'leverage'. Nasty habits die hard. Time to kick this one", the foreign minister suggested, encouraging the US president to live up to his own rhetoric. Zarif's commentary was accentuated by his decision to change his profile pic to a hilarious caricature of himself. The diplomat indicated on his Instagram page that he plans to use caricatures created throughout his seven-and-a-half-year tenure as foreign minister throughout the remainder of his term, which is expected to wrap up in June after presidential elections.

One of the unidentified individuals informed the outlet that the proposal is “more than anything about trying to get the conversation started” between the two countries, which have been at odds for decades and saw tensions hit a new boiling point under the Trump administration. A looming expiration to an agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is also serving as a push to establish renewed talks. The deal between the pair allows the UN watchdog to continue inspections of its nuclear facilities, but is due to expire in June and take with it the agency’s access to Iranian facilities. Shahrokh Nazemi, the head of press at Iran’s mission to the United Nations, responded to the Politico revelation by indicating that “the [deal] needs no specific proposal,” and that the US just needs to follow implementation of the 2015 agreement. The Biden camp did not offer details of the ongoing diplomatic talks. In 2018, the Trump administration walked away from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which in turn re-imposed sanctions on Iran, and initiated even stricter financial hurdles as Trump sought a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. As a result, Tehran has taken several steps against denuclearization and argues that since the US abandoned the deal first, they should take the first step in renegotiating and ultimately removing sanctions. Biden stated on the campaign trail that he wanted to reverse his predecessor’s actions against Iran. However, he has been working under the assumption that he will either remake or at least update the 2015 deal. Most recently, the Biden White House has stated that sanctions will not be lifted unless Iran returns to compliance with the original deal. Reports have indicated that the US is willing to make the first move in returning to negotiations. Biden is facing increased tension in competition as Iran continues its attempt at nuclear growth including signing a $400 billion deal with China, which includes investment into the renewable energy and nuclear energy infrastructure. — Permanent Mission of China in Vienna (@ChinaMissionVie) March 29, 2021 ​European officials have also attempted to salvage the agreement, setting up talks between Iran and the US, an effort subsequently rejected by both parties. — Saeed Khatibzadeh (@SKhatibzadeh) February 28, 2021 ​Europe faces its own challenge of encountering US sanctions of their own if they attempt to do business with Iran.

News article:
By desperately seeking Iran's return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear accord, the Biden administration is squandering the vast economic leverage bequeathed to it by the Trump administration. President Joe Biden is encouraging Iran to play hardball in negotiations pertaining to its return to compliance with the nuclear deal. It has just been announced that the United States will participate in a meeting in Vienna on Tuesday with Iran. Also included will be the other signatory members of the nuclear accord — Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia. But while the U.S. is expected to play a passive role in these discussions, the Iranians evidently believe that they now hold the strategic initiative. Iran's Fars News state media outlet reported one Iranian official's comment on Friday that no negotiations were necessary. This is because, the official said, "The United States can return to the agreement and end lawbreaking just in the way that it pulled out of it and imposed illegal sanctions against Iran." This is not the rhetoric of a regime desperate for sanctions relief. This is the rallying cry of a regime that senses appeasement has returned to American foreign policy. Biden is making a huge mistake. The appropriate way to deal with Iran is for Biden to hold true to what he pledged to do in early February — to keep all U.S. sanctions in place until Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suspends his enrichment of uranium beyond purity caps imposed under the 2015 accord. That strategy would ensure that Iran's leaders are the ones begging for a deal, rather than the other way around. It would also recognize the basic reality that Iran's economic collapse, precipitated in large part by the Trump administration's sanctions, has greatly damaged the patronage relationships upon which Tehran's hard-liner elite root their power. These sanctions have also restrained the regime's ability to export the revolution. Unfortunately, the Biden administration now appears willing to sacrifice this leverage. On Friday, an administration official told the New York Times that "the United States would not seek to retain some sanctions for leverage ... arguing that the previous 'maximum pressure' campaign waged against Iran by the Trump administration had failed." This is absurd. The Biden administration has the very same access to U.S. intelligence reporting on Iran as the Trump administration did. In turn, Biden and his senior officials should be confident that were they willing to maintain sanctions pressure, Iran would be forced into a desperate negotiating stance. Absent that desperate negotiating, the regime's very survival would come under question. Recent years have seen escalating street protests and a fundamental collapse of the Revolutionary Guard Corps finance structures. How much more of that strain can Khamenei's regime handle? It's a question he most certainly does not want to answer. Intelligence on this reality is surely why Biden was willing to play hardball back in February. It's not clear why Biden abandoned his previously prudent strategy. But the shift in Biden's position is obvious. Washington is even now begging the Chinese to persuade the Iranians to give some ground. The Chinese have, of course, loved this show of desperation from Washington and delivered nothing in return. On the contrary, Beijing has just given Iran the economic gift of a 25-year strategic partnership. Iran is now sitting pretty. Expect Biden to suspend major U.S. sanctions in return for Iran's reduction of some enrichment activities. Iran will get its payday and the fundamental flaws of the 2015 accord, such as Iran's ballistic missile research, will remain in place.

News article:
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/17228/biden-iran-secret-deals “The Biden administration appears to be using loopholes when dealing with the Iranian regime. I am again asking direct, yes or no questions on the United States’ involvement in facilitating a South Korean ransom payment to Iran. If the Biden administration is involved in transferring funds to Iran, Congress and the American people must be informed. Biden administration officials continue to deflect and refuse to answer questions from members of Congress regarding this issue.” — Congressman Bryan Steil (R-WI), letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, March 25, 2021. When President Biden was vice president during the Obama administration, the administration was all too eager to grant concessions to the Iranian regime and, it turns out, made multiple secret deals with the mullahs….. These secret deals meant that when sanctions against Iranian banks were lifted and permission given to the leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to resume conducting business, there was no longer any mechanism to check or stop Iran’s illegal activities such as advancing its ballistic missile program. The Obama administration also helped swiftly to lift all four rounds of UN sanctions against Iran — sanctions it had taken decades to put in place. Iran’s military sites also were exempted from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency; other inspections were only to be at the times and places of Iran’s choosing — if ever. Another concession, usually overlooked, is that Iran never even signed the JCPOA deal — what sort of deal, then, is that? Appeasement policies, secret deals and generous concessions to predatory regimes do not work, as history has repeatedly shown. They only empower and embolden leaders whose record reveals that they have no intention of honoring whatever they agreed to in the first place, and for whom commitments have been mainly a means of buying time to accomplish the goals they really want. The Biden administration is ratcheting up its appeasement policies towards the Iranian regime in an apparent effort to revive the 2015 nuclear deal — which by the way, Iran never signed. US President Joe Biden made his intention to return to the nuclear deal public before he took office; after, he appointed as Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman — a key negotiator in the talks which led to the nuclear deal in 2015 during the Obama administration. Biden actually publicized Sherman’s professed accomplishment: “She has successfully rallied the world to strengthen democracy and confront some of the biggest national security challenges of our time, including leading the U.S. negotiating team for the Iran Deal”. The administration proceeded to revoke the designation of the Houthis, an Iran-backed terror group, as an officially-designated terrorist organization. Republican foreign policy leaders in Congress are now requesting from the Secretary of State Antony Blinken answers to questions about the secret talks held with South Korea that resulted in South Korea giving the Iranian regime $1 billion in ransom money. The letter was “led” by Congressman Bryan Steil (WI), Congressman Greg Steube (FL) and Republican Study Committee (RSC) Chairman Jim Banks (IN). Steil pointed out: “The Biden administration appears to be using loopholes when dealing with the Iranian regime. I am again asking direct, yes or no questions on the United States’ involvement in facilitating a South Korean ransom payment to Iran. If the Biden administration is involved in transferring funds to Iran, Congress and the American people must be informed. Biden administration officials continue to deflect and refuse to answer questions from members of Congress regarding this issue. I want answers. Congress must be informed of the administration’s actions”. In January, the Iranian regime, apparently as part of an extortion maneuver, had seized a South Korean ship in the Gulf and demanded ransom for its release. Congressman Banks stated: “The Biden administration has to stop stonewalling and must come clean regarding whether they facilitated sanctions relief for the thugs in Tehran. I’m glad to co-lead this letter with my colleagues Rep. Bryan Steil and Rep. Greg Steube. The RSC will continue to investigate until we get to the bottom of what is going on”. Secret talks to appease the Iranian regime should not come as surprise. When President Biden was vice president during the Obama administration, the administration was all too eager to grant concessions to the Iranian regime and, it turns out, made multiple secret deals with the mullahs. One of the secret deals consisted of allowing the Iranian regime to have access to US dollars by sidestepping sanctions. “The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran”, said Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), who chaired the Senate panel conducting the investigation at the time. The Obama administration also secretly agreed to remove sanctions on several Iranian banks, including Bank Sepah and Sepah International. These banks had long been sanctioned by the United Nations due to their illegal activities in financing missile development and skirting UN Security Council resolutions regarding the arms embargo. These secret deals meant that when sanctions against Iranian banks were lifted and permission given to the leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to resume conducting business, there was no longer any mechanism to check or stop Iran’s illegal activities such as advancing its ballistic missile program. When, in return for Iran releasing hostages, the Obama administration released Iranian-born prisoners, some of whom were threats to the US national security, it shocked many and infuriated some of the officials at the Justice Department — as did shipping $400 million in cash to Tehran as ostensibly a “not quid-pro-quo” ransom for the hostages. In addition, according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, the Obama administration agreed “‘in secret’ to allow Iran to evade some restrictions” in the last year of the nuclear agreement. David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector, stated that “The exemptions or loopholes are happening in secret, and it appears that they favor Iran.” These are only few examples of the secret deals conducted with the Iranian regime to appease it. In addition to the secret deals, Iran also received dangerous and unprecedented concessions from the Obama administration for the Islamic Republic’s 2015 “nuclear deal,” the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The major concession was that the deal paved the way for Iran legally to become a full-blown nuclear state. The sunset clauses, which enshrined that commitment, had set a firm expiration date for restricting Iran’s nuclear program, after which the country’s leaders would be free to have, legitimately, as many nuclear weapons as they like. The Obama administration also helped swiftly to lift all four rounds of UN sanctions against Iran — sanctions it had taken decades to put in place. Iran’s military sites also were exempted from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency; other inspections were only to be at the times and places of Iran’s choosing — if ever. Iran then rejoined the global financial system with full legitimacy — plus billions of dollars flowing into the treasury of the IRGC and its expanding militias across the Middle East. Another concession, usually overlooked, is that Iran never even signed the JCPOA deal — what sort of deal, then, is that? Appeasement policies, secret deals and generous concessions to predatory regimes do not work, as history has repeatedly shown. They only empower and embolden leaders whose record reveals that they have no intention of honoring whatever they agreed to in the first place, and for whom commitments have been mainly a means of buying time to accomplish the goals they really want.

Congressman Banks stated: “The Biden administration has to stop stonewalling and must come clean regarding whether they facilitated sanctions relief for the thugs in Tehran. I’m glad to co-lead this letter with my colleagues Rep. Bryan Steil and Rep. Greg Steube. The RSC will continue to investigate until we get to the bottom of what is going on”. Secret talks to appease the Iranian regime should not come as surprise. When President Biden was vice president during the Obama administration, the administration was all too eager to grant concessions to the Iranian regime and, it turns out, made multiple secret deals with the mullahs. One of the secret deals consisted of allowing the Iranian regime to have access to US dollars by sidestepping sanctions. “The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran”, said Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), who chaired the Senate panel conducting the investigation at the time. The Obama administration also secretly agreed to remove sanctions on several Iranian banks, including Bank Sepah and Sepah International. These banks had long been sanctioned by the United Nations due to their illegal activities in financing missile development and skirting UN Security Council resolutions regarding the arms embargo. These secret deals meant that when sanctions against Iranian banks were lifted and permission given to the leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to resume conducting business, there was no longer any mechanism to check or stop Iran’s illegal activities such as advancing its ballistic missile program. When, in return for Iran releasing hostages, the Obama administration released Iranian-born prisoners, some of whom were threats to the US national security, it shocked many and infuriated some of the officials at the Justice Department — as did shipping $400 million in cash to Tehran as ostensibly a “not quid-pro-quo” ransom for the hostages. In addition, according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, the Obama administration agreed “‘in secret’ to allow Iran to evade some restrictions” in the last year of the nuclear agreement. David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector, stated that “The exemptions or loopholes are happening in secret, and it appears that they favor Iran.” These are only few examples of the secret deals conducted with the Iranian regime to appease it. In addition to the secret deals, Iran also received dangerous and unprecedented concessions from the Obama administration for the Islamic Republic’s 2015 “nuclear deal,” the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The major concession was that the deal paved the way for Iran legally to become a full-blown nuclear state. The sunset clauses, which enshrined that commitment, had set a firm expiration date for restricting Iran’s nuclear program, after which the country’s leaders would be free to have, legitimately, as many nuclear weapons as they like. The Obama administration also helped swiftly to lift all four rounds of UN sanctions against Iran — sanctions it had taken decades to put in place. Iran’s military sites also were exempted from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency; other inspections were only to be at the times and places of Iran’s choosing — if ever. Iran then rejoined the global financial system with full legitimacy — plus billions of dollars flowing into the treasury of the IRGC and its expanding militias across the Middle East. Another concession, usually overlooked, is that Iran never even signed the JCPOA deal — what sort of deal, then, is that? Appeasement policies, secret deals and generous concessions to predatory regimes do not work, as history has repeatedly shown. They only empower and embolden leaders whose record reveals that they have no intention of honoring whatever they agreed to in the first place, and for whom commitments have been mainly a means of buying time to accomplish the goals they really want.

News article:
The Biden administration is moving forward on steps to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, with officials set to participate in high level discussions with signatories to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in Vienna next week. The U.S. and Iran are not expected to meet face to face, although administration officials have said they remain open to direct talks. The Vienna meeting marks the most forward movement for the Biden team, which will engage with European, Russian and Chinese counterparts over what steps the U.S. can take to achieve a “mutual return” for both America and Iran. The meeting is likely to draw intense scrutiny from Capitol Hill, where hundreds of lawmakers have signed on to a handful of letters to the president and Secretary of State Antony Blinken over their concerns of engaging with Iran. The House Foreign Affairs Committee led by Chairman Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), tweeted support for the meeting. “This is an important, though preliminary step. Tough and smart diplomacy in close coordination with our European allies and regional partners is the best way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and restore full compliance with the JCPOA,” he said. President Biden has made rejoining the deal a priority foreign policy for his administration. He appointed as U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley, a key member of the negotiating team that brokered the 2015 agreement. The deal, negotiated during the Obama administration while Biden was vice president, put significant, but temporary, limits on Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for sanctions relief from the U.S. and international community. Critics argue it did not go far enough in preventing Iran from ever attaining a nuclear weapon and did not address a range of malign activity by the Islamic Republic, including its ballistic missile programs, support for proxy fighting forces across the Middle East, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. “The United States must not once again abandon the leverage that is bringing Iran back to the negotiating table without confronting both Iran’s nuclear and non-nuclear activities that need to be stopped,” 140 House Republicans wrote in a letter to President Biden in February, opposing a return to the JCPOA. The former Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran when it withdrew from the deal in May 2018, and added an array of other punitive measures as part of a “maximum pressure campaign” aimed at forcing Tehran to the negotiating table for a stronger agreement. Tehran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful but nuclear watchers say the Islamic Republic is likely only a few months away from building a bomb. Iran began increasing its uranium enrichment in 2019, breaking the terms of the JCPOA in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by the then-Trump administration. The Biden team and Iran have been in a “who goes first” conundrum over each side’s demands. The U.S. has been worried by Iran’s enrichment of uranium up to 20 percent, far above the deal’s limit of 3.67 percent. Uranium is considered weapons grade when enriched to approximately 90 percent. The Biden team has called on Iran to reverse its uranium enrichment before sanctions are eased. Tehran calls this a nonstarter. The meeting in Vienna will seek to establish a road map of steps both sides can take to bring them back to compliance with the deal, including identifying “sanctions lifting and nuclear implementation measures,” according to a statement released Friday by the JCPOA signatories — China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and Iran. State Department Principal Deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter said in a briefing with reporters that the U.S. would not preview any specific sanctions to be lifted, but that sanctions relief steps will be discussed during the meeting. “We’re going to talk about nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA and, we won’t preview any specific sanctions, but we’ll definitely say that sanction relief steps that the U.S. would need to take in order to return to that compliance as well, we’ll be up for discussion,” she said. Naysan Rafati, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, said that both Washington and Tehran are in agreement about returning to the JCPOA, but that the path to mutual compliance is not going to be easy. “The discussions are likely to encounter challenges regarding scope and sequencing on both the nuclear and sanctions relief fronts, as well as skepticism in Washington as well as Tehran,” he said. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have sought to close the gap on their disagreements of the utility of the JCPOA as part of efforts to promote a united front in their opposition to Iran’s alleged pursuit of a nuclear weapon and destabilizing actions in the region. Last month, 40 senators from both sides of the aisle signed a letter to the president urging the use of all diplomatic and economic tools to prevent Iran from developing the ability to attain a nuclear weapon. “Iran should have no doubt about America’s policy. Democrats and Republicans may have tactical differences, but we are united on preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior. We look forward to working with you to achieve these objectives,” the senators wrote. Likewise, a bipartisan letter signed by 140 House members called for addressing the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and its other troubling actions. “As Democrats and Republicans from across the political spectrum, we are united in preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior,” they wrote. Lawmakers are also concerned over sanctions relief for Iran without meaningful verification that it has taken steps to put itself back in compliance with the JCPOA. Secretary of State Antony Blinken answered in the affirmative when questioned by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) during a hearing last month that the U.S. would not make any concessions to get a meeting with Iran nor lift sanctions until Iran is verifiably in full compliance with the JCPOA, or on a negotiated path toward full compliance. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) further pressed Blinken to commit to formally consulting with Congress before lifting any sanctions. “We’re determined to consult on the takeoff not on the landing across the board — but, yes particularly when it comes to Iran,” Blinken said.

News article:
Despite being the most powerful nation in the world, the last U.S. election exposed the fragility of American democracy. It highlighted the need to continually work toward improving and fostering our democratic institutions. While the ethos of U.S. militarism in recent decades emphasized the dangers of foreign foes, the Trump presidency and its unprecedented attacks on the most basic principles of American democracy substantiated President Abraham Lincoln's claim that true danger to the U.S. would come from within: "It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher." In order to nurture democracy, President Joe Biden should abide by its core belief to carry out the will of the people. His administration's openness to diplomacy with Iran reflects that very will. In the case of U.S. foreign policy, the American public made its position clear. Poll after poll indicate that the majority of Americans wish to end endless wars and ensure national and global security through diplomacy. The news that the U.S. and Iran agreed to indirect talks to discuss returning to the nuclear deal is a step in that direction and demonstrates welcome progress toward peace. As President Biden talks of unity, the desire to avoid military confrontation with Iran and resolve the nuclear issue with diplomacy has bipartisan support. A recent The Economist/YouGov poll showed that a majority of Americans view Iran's nuclear program as a threat, with 63 percent supporting direct negotiations with Iran to address their concern. Upon a closer look, 84 percent of Biden voters polled supported direct negotiations, along with 54 percent of Trump voters. These numbers corroborate CNN polling from May 2018, after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran deal—also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—which showed 63 percent of Americans believe the U.S. should not quit the deal. That Trump's "maximum pressure" policy on Iran was a complete failure, which brought us to the brink of war, only reaffirmed the need to return to diplomacy. As such, during his campaign, Biden remained a staunch critic of Trump's Iran policy and signaled his support for returning to the deal, along with almost every other Democratic candidate. Though Biden and key figures within his administration were outspoken in their rebuke of Trump's Iran policy, the administration was initially slow to take real steps toward returning to the deal. Polling of Americans under the Biden administration continues to demonstrate that the majority support a return to mutual compliance by the United States and Iran. From a global perspective, American allies in Europe worked to save the deal in spite of efforts by the Trump administration to completely dismantle it. They pressed the Biden administration early on to take proactive steps toward sanctions relief to restore the agreement as soon as possible. While Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu's infamous anti-Iran posturing is often presented as being representative of all Israeli society, senior ranking Israeli defense and security officials came out in favor of Biden returning to the JCPOA and acknowledged its effectiveness. Domestically, pressure is growing among Biden supporters, including progressive and faith-based groups, for him to rejoin the nuclear deal. Many of these supporters expected faster action from the new administration and fear that the window for diplomacy may be narrow with an Iranian election on the horizon in June. The current Rouhani government, which staked its administration on the success of the JCPOA and the hoped-for economic relief for millions of Iranians, repeatedly stated that Iran will swiftly return to compliance if the U.S. does the same. In addition to appeals from Biden supporters to return to the deal, there is also the pressing matter of sanctions relief due to the COVID pandemic. This has drawn criticism from U.S. civil society organizations who called on Biden to provide sanctions relief. Although the Biden administration expressed intent to review sanctions for the purposes of humanitarian assistance in the pandemic just days after taking office, more than two months later no such relief has been given as all Trump-era sanctions on Iran remain in place. Biden's unhurried approach to COVID sanctions relief is in stark contrast to his own words last year, which called on Trump to "take immediate steps to address this problem and streamline channels for banking and public health assistance from other countries in response to the health emergency in Iran." In the same statement, Biden alluded to the unique role of the U.S. in world affairs and asserted that, "In times of global crisis, America should lead." If the U.S. is to take on such leadership while preserving its own democracy, President Biden should heed the calls of the majority of Americans and the people who voted him into office. His own desire to return to diplomacy was signaled again with the U.S. decision to join indirect talks with Iran along with international intermediaries, but this decision will be met with opposition from the same people and groups that sabotaged the diplomatic gains of the Obama-Biden administration. War hawks and fringe groups determined for regime change in Iran at any cost should not be the arbiters of America's Iran policy. Instead, our policies on Iran should reflect the will of the American people, who have shown time and again their desire for diplomacy over war. If democracy should prevail, Biden will soon return to the Iran nuclear deal. The president should feel confident in doing so because it's what Americans want.

From a global perspective, American allies in Europe worked to save the deal in spite of efforts by the Trump administration to completely dismantle it. They pressed the Biden administration early on to take proactive steps toward sanctions relief to restore the agreement as soon as possible. While Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu's infamous anti-Iran posturing is often presented as being representative of all Israeli society, senior ranking Israeli defense and security officials came out in favor of Biden returning to the JCPOA and acknowledged its effectiveness. Domestically, pressure is growing among Biden supporters, including progressive and faith-based groups, for him to rejoin the nuclear deal. Many of these supporters expected faster action from the new administration and fear that the window for diplomacy may be narrow with an Iranian election on the horizon in June. The current Rouhani government, which staked its administration on the success of the JCPOA and the hoped-for economic relief for millions of Iranians, repeatedly stated that Iran will swiftly return to compliance if the U.S. does the same. In addition to appeals from Biden supporters to return to the deal, there is also the pressing matter of sanctions relief due to the COVID pandemic. This has drawn criticism from U.S. civil society organizations who called on Biden to provide sanctions relief. Although the Biden administration expressed intent to review sanctions for the purposes of humanitarian assistance in the pandemic just days after taking office, more than two months later no such relief has been given as all Trump-era sanctions on Iran remain in place. Biden's unhurried approach to COVID sanctions relief is in stark contrast to his own words last year, which called on Trump to "take immediate steps to address this problem and streamline channels for banking and public health assistance from other countries in response to the health emergency in Iran." In the same statement, Biden alluded to the unique role of the U.S. in world affairs and asserted that, "In times of global crisis, America should lead." If the U.S. is to take on such leadership while preserving its own democracy, President Biden should heed the calls of the majority of Americans and the people who voted him into office. His own desire to return to diplomacy was signaled again with the U.S. decision to join indirect talks with Iran along with international intermediaries, but this decision will be met with opposition from the same people and groups that sabotaged the diplomatic gains of the Obama-Biden administration. War hawks and fringe groups determined for regime change in Iran at any cost should not be the arbiters of America's Iran policy. Instead, our policies on Iran should reflect the will of the American people, who have shown time and again their desire for diplomacy over war. If democracy should prevail, Biden will soon return to the Iran nuclear deal. The president should feel confident in doing so because it's what Americans want.

News article:
Despite being the most powerful nation in the world, the last U.S. election exposed the fragility of American democracy. It highlighted the need to continually work toward improving and fostering our democratic institutions. While the ethos of U.S. militarism in recent decades emphasized the dangers of foreign foes, the Trump presidency and its unprecedented attacks on the most basic principles of American democracy substantiated President Abraham Lincoln's claim that true danger to the U.S. would come from within: "It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher." In order to nurture democracy, President Joe Biden should abide by its core belief to carry out the will of the people. His administration's openness to diplomacy with Iran reflects that very will. In the case of U.S. foreign policy, the American public made its position clear. Poll after poll indicate that the majority of Americans wish to end endless wars and ensure national and global security through diplomacy. The news that the U.S. and Iran agreed to indirect talks to discuss returning to the nuclear deal is a step in that direction and demonstrates welcome progress toward peace. As President Biden talks of unity, the desire to avoid military confrontation with Iran and resolve the nuclear issue with diplomacy has bipartisan support. A recent The Economist/YouGov poll showed that a majority of Americans view Iran's nuclear program as a threat, with 63 percent supporting direct negotiations with Iran to address their concern. Upon a closer look, 84 percent of Biden voters polled supported direct negotiations, along with 54 percent of Trump voters. These numbers corroborate CNN polling from May 2018, after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran deal—also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—which showed 63 percent of Americans believe the U.S. should not quit the deal. That Trump's "maximum pressure" policy on Iran was a complete failure, which brought us to the brink of war, only reaffirmed the need to return to diplomacy. As such, during his campaign, Biden remained a staunch critic of Trump's Iran policy and signaled his support for returning to the deal, along with almost every other Democratic candidate. Though Biden and key figures within his administration were outspoken in their rebuke of Trump's Iran policy, the administration was initially slow to take real steps toward returning to the deal. Polling of Americans under the Biden administration continues to demonstrate that the majority support a return to mutual compliance by the United States and Iran.

News article:
A senior Chinese diplomat endorsed Iran’s negotiating position during a high-stakes meeting about the rehabilitation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, even as President Joe Biden hopes Beijing will be a “partner” in these negotiations. “This is a question involving the fundamental principle of rights and wrongs. As a victim, Iran's legitimate requirement should, in the first place, be affirmed and catered for,” Chinese Ambassador Wang Qun, the top Chinese diplomat to the United Nations in Vienna, told state media. “In order to break the current impasse, it is imperative that the U.S. return to the JCPOA at an early date by lifting all unlawful and unilateral sanctions.” Those comments align Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping’s regime with Tehran’s hard-line posture, as Iranian officials pressure Biden to dismantle former President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” unilaterally. Biden’s team has denounced Trump’s policy but avoided lifting the sanctions, citing the need to ensure that Iran likewise returns to compliance with the deal while laying the groundwork for additional measures to restrain Iranian aggression — an initiative that U.S. officials hope will find support even among American rivals. “I think principally and strategically, this is an area where we do have aligned interests with Moscow and aligned interests with Beijing,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Tuesday. “They have sought to uphold the JCPOA, and we do see them as partners in this fairly narrow effort.” US AIR FORCE B-52 BOMBERS FLY OVER MIDDLE EAST IN SHOW OF FORCE AS TENSIONS FLARE WITH IRAN That analysis misunderstands China’s position, according to Iran hawks skeptical of Biden’s approach to managing threats posed by the Gulf regime. Iran signed up for China’s Belt and Road Initiative last month, as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced a “permanent and strategic” partnership between Beijing and Tehran. “The Chinese see this as a zero-sum game: They see American power and prestige as a threat to the expansion of their influence, [which leads Beijing to the conclusion that] anything that puts the U.S. in a stronger geopolitical position is bad for China,” the Heritage Foundation’s James Carafano argued. Some members of the Trump administration shared Price’s perception of China’s posture earlier in their tenure, but that view was shaken by Beijing’s insistence on purchasing Iranian oil despite the threat of U.S. sanctions. “We literally offered the Chinese to replace Iranian oil, barrel for barrel, with the Saudis ... and they still pursued illicit means of importing Iranian crude,” a former Trump administration official said. That experience impelled a reassessment of China’s intentions. “They clearly see [Iran] as a potential client-state in the Middle East,” the former official said. “I think, in their mind, they actually believe the JCPOA limits Iran’s nuclear advancement and therefore is the de-escalation they need to prevent any war in the Middle East ... [but] it's not just about the oil supply. There is something more about being with non-U.S.-aligned power in the region. That’s not the U.S. position, despite Blinken’s support for the nuclear deal. “Our strategy sees the mutual return to the JCPOA as necessary but insufficient,” Price told reporters Wednesday. “We seek not only a longer and stronger deal, but over the longer term, working with partners in the region, follow-on agreements to address [Iranian human rights abuses, support for terrorism, and missile development]. We don't need to arrive at those follow-on agreements for us to hold Iran to account for its behavior because we will continue to do that right now.” Blinken’s point man for the Iran talks, special representative Rob Malley, is in Vienna for a meeting of the nuclear agreement signatories — an assembly that U.S. officials regard as “a healthy step forward” toward Biden’s desired goal, as Price put it Tuesday. The talks do not involve direct conversations between Malley and Iranian officials, as such a meeting was precluded by U.S. and Iranian demands that the other side relent first. “The team on the ground in Vienna has had consultations with our European allies as well as with our Russian and Chinese partners; they, in turn, have met with the Iranian delegation,” Price told reporters Wednesday. “We have heard more about Iran's position. Our partners have, in turn, heard from us more about our position, which they have then relayed to the Iranians. And, in short, this is what we had hoped to accomplish at the outset.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hailed the gathering as “a new success” for Tehran. “A single voice is heard today, which is everyone around the nuclear deal has come to the conclusion that there is no better solution than the JCPOA and no other way but the full implementation of the JCPOA,” he said. China’s envoy in Vienna insisted that Biden “lift all ... unlawful sanctions against Iran” in order to restore the nuclear deal while tapping the brakes on Blinken’s broader ambition. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “The original intention of its negotiation is to address the Iranian nuclear issue rather than all regional security issues,” the Chinese ambassador told state media. “As for the relevant concern on regional security, it's imperative that it be separated and dealt with at a different platform vis-a-vis the JCPOA."

News article:
Delicate talks to restore constraints on Iran's nuclear program began in Vienna on Tuesday between the United States and other leading countries. Their task is to undo the damage Donald Trump caused when he left an agreement that had effectively shrunk Iran's program, frozen it for a generation and put it under lock and camera. The talks to return to the nuclear deal will be tough. Neither side wants to be seen as weak or as giving in to the other. But early signs are encouraging. It should be possible to put the deal back together, but not if President Joe Biden listens to the siren song of junking that agreement for "a better deal." Biden was part of the process that produced the historic agreement in 2015 that blocked Iran's pathways to a nuclear bomb for the next decade. That plan — known by the complicated title the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA — won nearly universal praise from experts, military leaders, diplomats and former national security officials — including some Israeli military leaders. Under the deal, it would take Iran at least a year to assemble the material for a bomb. With the cameras, electronic monitoring devices and constant inspections mandated by the agreement, as well as U.S. and allied intelligence operations, we would be able to see Iran doing it. Plenty of time to act forcefully if necessary. But not everyone liked it. Those who wanted to overthrow the government of Iran, in particular, opposed any deal that would convey legitimacy on a government they detested. They and other critics claimed the deal didn't provide for adequate inspection of Iran's nuclear facilities while simply enabling Tehran to wait out the expiration of the deal's terms before it built a bomb down the road. These opponents included hawks in Congress, the leaders of Israel and Saudi Arabia and many of the supporters of the son of the former shah of Iran, who want to restore the monarchy that the Islamic revolutionaries overthrew in 1979. As Obama administration CIA Director John Brennan wrote recently in a Chicago Tribune op-ed, the "opposition was rooted in an eclectic mix of rigid ideological fervor, partisan politics and substantive ignorance of the agreement." This coalition, and the money and influence they exerted, helped persuade Trump to go back on America's word in 2018 and violate the agreement by reinstating all the sanctions that had been lifted, as well as adding more for a total of over 1500 Trump-imposed sanctions. He said his program of maximum pressure would force Iran to agree to a "better deal" or collapse. Neither happened. We are now in worse shape, as Iran has steadily moved away from the deal, increasing its nuclear activities and its influence in the region through proxies, allies and its ability to take advantage of the chaos triggered by the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Once again, Iran could be mere weeks away from having enough uranium for a bomb. Once again, we are threatened with a stark choice. The Los Angeles Times reports that some Pentagon sources think the tensions in the region are so severe that without a deal, "the choice becomes to watch Iran march closer to the ability to build a bomb, or to go to war to stop it." Opponents of talks with Iran know that "Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Iran" is not a convincing slogan. So they have come up with a more appealing one: A Better Deal. They want to persuade Americans to abandon a deal that is working, like Aesop's greedy dog with a bone in his mouth, who, seeing his reflection in the water, drops what he has to grab what he thinks is a bigger bone. Hawkish Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., last month led a group of 41 senators proposing just such a course. They pushed for a comprehensive agreement "that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons" but also "meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program" and frees U.S. citizens held in Iranian prisons while preventing "attacks on important U.S. security partners." All laudable goals. But achieving those in one grand bargain is like hunting unicorns. Such a deal is simply impossible. It is not just the error of making the better the enemy of the good. It is cynically exploiting inherent American optimism and can-do spirit to prevent reconciliation with a government they oppose. In September 2013, I had dinner in New York with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and a small group of experts and thought leaders just before the first set of talks on the original Iran nuclear deal began. We pressed him about the idea of a grand bargain. "The history between Iran and the U.S. is long and complicated," he said. "The table will not bear the weight of all these issues at once. That is why we have decided to tackle the nuclear issue first." He saw the nuclear deal as a "gateway opportunity." So, too, did the Obama administration. Indeed, if we could resolve this most critical issue, it could provide the foundation to resolve the others. Thankfully, this is the approach favored by the White House. "The Biden-Harris administration hopes to get Iran back in compliance with the deal. Then we would be in compliance with the deal," Wendy Sherman, Biden's nominee for deputy secretary of state, told the Senate at her confirmation hearing. "We would build from that to get a longer and stronger agreement ... then address other issues of concern." This approach does not ignore the other crucial issues. It simply prioritizes them. Every other issue we have with Iran is much more difficult to resolve if Iran has nuclear weapons. While we care deeply about our regional allies, human rights in Iran and American prisoners, we must prioritize threats to the U.S. itself. A nuclear Iran is an existential danger. So is the nuclear arms race in the Middle East that Iran could trigger if Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others try to match its capabilities. The Vienna talks may be our last chance to restore the deal. The clock is ticking. Presidential elections set for June in Iran will soon make it impossible for the current government to negotiate, because hard-line opponents of Rouhani do not want him and his more pragmatic political allies to get credit for coming back to the deal. Some do not want any deal. In this way, Iranian politics mirror those in the U.S., with fierce partisan politics trumping national security interests. While we care deeply about our regional allies, human rights in Iran and American prisoners, we must prioritize threats to the United States itself. A nuclear Iran is an existential danger. The talks to return to the nuclear deal will be tough. Neither side wants to be seen as weak or as giving in to the other. But early signs are encouraging. The countries agreed Tuesday to stay through the week, establishing working groups to detail precisely how Iran and the U.S. would synchronize their return to compliance. The key will be to move quickly. Although Biden has a large, ambitious domestic agenda, this is not an issue he can put on the shelf and pick up in September. There are too many in both capitals and the Middle East who want to kill the deal and too many conflicts that could erupt into full-scale war. Biden cannot chase unicorns. He must move adroitly to resolve a foreign policy issue that could sink his presidency if it heads to a violent, unnecessary war.

Once again, Iran could be mere weeks away from having enough uranium for a bomb. Once again, we are threatened with a stark choice. The Los Angeles Times reports that some Pentagon sources think the tensions in the region are so severe that without a deal, "the choice becomes to watch Iran march closer to the ability to build a bomb, or to go to war to stop it." Opponents of talks with Iran know that "Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Iran" is not a convincing slogan. So they have come up with a more appealing one: A Better Deal. They want to persuade Americans to abandon a deal that is working, like Aesop's greedy dog with a bone in his mouth, who, seeing his reflection in the water, drops what he has to grab what he thinks is a bigger bone. Hawkish Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., last month led a group of 41 senators proposing just such a course. They pushed for a comprehensive agreement "that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons" but also "meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program" and frees U.S. citizens held in Iranian prisons while preventing "attacks on important U.S. security partners." All laudable goals. But achieving those in one grand bargain is like hunting unicorns. Such a deal is simply impossible. It is not just the error of making the better the enemy of the good. It is cynically exploiting inherent American optimism and can-do spirit to prevent reconciliation with a government they oppose. In September 2013, I had dinner in New York with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and a small group of experts and thought leaders just before the first set of talks on the original Iran nuclear deal began. We pressed him about the idea of a grand bargain. "The history between Iran and the U.S. is long and complicated," he said. "The table will not bear the weight of all these issues at once. That is why we have decided to tackle the nuclear issue first." He saw the nuclear deal as a "gateway opportunity." So, too, did the Obama administration. Indeed, if we could resolve this most critical issue, it could provide the foundation to resolve the others. Thankfully, this is the approach favored by the White House. "The Biden-Harris administration hopes to get Iran back in compliance with the deal. Then we would be in compliance with the deal," Wendy Sherman, Biden's nominee for deputy secretary of state, told the Senate at her confirmation hearing. "We would build from that to get a longer and stronger agreement ... then address other issues of concern." This approach does not ignore the other crucial issues. It simply prioritizes them. Every other issue we have with Iran is much more difficult to resolve if Iran has nuclear weapons. While we care deeply about our regional allies, human rights in Iran and American prisoners, we must prioritize threats to the U.S. itself. A nuclear Iran is an existential danger. So is the nuclear arms race in the Middle East that Iran could trigger if Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others try to match its capabilities. The Vienna talks may be our last chance to restore the deal. The clock is ticking. Presidential elections set for June in Iran will soon make it impossible for the current government to negotiate, because hard-line opponents of Rouhani do not want him and his more pragmatic political allies to get credit for coming back to the deal. Some do not want any deal. In this way, Iranian politics mirror those in the U.S., with fierce partisan politics trumping national security interests. While we care deeply about our regional allies, human rights in Iran and American prisoners, we must prioritize threats to the United States itself. A nuclear Iran is an existential danger. The talks to return to the nuclear deal will be tough. Neither side wants to be seen as weak or as giving in to the other. But early signs are encouraging. The countries agreed Tuesday to stay through the week, establishing working groups to detail precisely how Iran and the U.S. would synchronize their return to compliance. The key will be to move quickly. Although Biden has a large, ambitious domestic agenda, this is not an issue he can put on the shelf and pick up in September. There are too many in both capitals and the Middle East who want to kill the deal and too many conflicts that could erupt into full-scale war. Biden cannot chase unicorns. He must move adroitly to resolve a foreign policy issue that could sink his presidency if it heads to a violent, unnecessary war.

News article:
Delicate talks to restore constraints on Iran's nuclear program began in Vienna on Tuesday between the United States and other leading countries. Their task is to undo the damage Donald Trump caused when he left an agreement that had effectively shrunk Iran's program, frozen it for a generation and put it under lock and camera. The talks to return to the nuclear deal will be tough. Neither side wants to be seen as weak or as giving in to the other. But early signs are encouraging. It should be possible to put the deal back together, but not if President Joe Biden listens to the siren song of junking that agreement for "a better deal." Biden was part of the process that produced the historic agreement in 2015 that blocked Iran's pathways to a nuclear bomb for the next decade. That plan — known by the complicated title the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA — won nearly universal praise from experts, military leaders, diplomats and former national security officials — including some Israeli military leaders. Under the deal, it would take Iran at least a year to assemble the material for a bomb. With the cameras, electronic monitoring devices and constant inspections mandated by the agreement, as well as U.S. and allied intelligence operations, we would be able to see Iran doing it. Plenty of time to act forcefully if necessary. But not everyone liked it. Those who wanted to overthrow the government of Iran, in particular, opposed any deal that would convey legitimacy on a government they detested. They and other critics claimed the deal didn't provide for adequate inspection of Iran's nuclear facilities while simply enabling Tehran to wait out the expiration of the deal's terms before it built a bomb down the road. These opponents included hawks in Congress, the leaders of Israel and Saudi Arabia and many of the supporters of the son of the former shah of Iran, who want to restore the monarchy that the Islamic revolutionaries overthrew in 1979. As Obama administration CIA Director John Brennan wrote recently in a Chicago Tribune op-ed, the "opposition was rooted in an eclectic mix of rigid ideological fervor, partisan politics and substantive ignorance of the agreement." This coalition, and the money and influence they exerted, helped persuade Trump to go back on America's word in 2018 and violate the agreement by reinstating all the sanctions that had been lifted, as well as adding more for a total of over 1500 Trump-imposed sanctions. He said his program of maximum pressure would force Iran to agree to a "better deal" or collapse. Neither happened. We are now in worse shape, as Iran has steadily moved away from the deal, increasing its nuclear activities and its influence in the region through proxies, allies and its ability to take advantage of the chaos triggered by the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

News article:
EXCLUSIVE: More than 300 Iranian-American activists on Wednesday wrote to President Biden urging him to support a democratic and secular Iran, and not to ease sanctions until the regime in Tehran ends human rights abuses -- as negotiations on reviving the Iran deal begin. "Your administration’s impactful actions must be directed towards blocking the Iranian regime’s violation of human rights, and their export of terrorism in the region and beyond," the letter from more than 300 American-Iranians, including physicians, engineers and professors, says. "As you craft your policy, defending human rights and democracy in Iran should be the central and enduring element of your policy on Iran." US, IRAN DUE TO BEGIN INDIRECT NUCLEAR TALKS IN VIENNA The letter is part of a continued effort from pro-democracy Iranian dissidents and groups, who call for a democratic, secular and non-nuclear Iran, to urge the Biden administration to keep up the pressure on the regime, which was dialed up during the Trump administration. The Trump-era White House adopted a "maximum pressure" strategy against the regime, reimposing sanctions and withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- known as the Iran nuclear deal. POMPEO SAYS BIDEN MOVES ON IRAN, HOUTHIS PRECURSORS TO RE-ENTERING 'CRAZY, CRAPPY' NUCLEAR DEAL Biden has indicated he wishes to re-enter the U.S. into the agreement, and his administration has abandoned a push at the United Nations to "snapback" U.N. sanctions -- including an expired arms embargo -- on the country. However, Biden has also indicated that sanctions relief will not happen until Iran is also back in the nuclear agreement -- seemingly ruling out sanctions relief as a precursor to negotiations. The signers of the letter say they are "encouraged" by that pledge, but warn of what they say is a "fable" that there is a moderate faction inside the regime that can be given power. "After trying to years to find such an elusive faction, the world has realized that the Iranian regime in its totality is an unchangeable dictatorship that cannot give birth to a less repressive government," it says. The letter calls on Biden to develop a roadmap and policies that "side with the Iranian people and their legitimate desire for a free, secular and democratic Iran, and will end the Iranian regime’s malign and dangerous expansion of its terrorism in the world, and funneling Iranian people’s resources to fund extremists in the region, as Iranians chant ‘leave Syria alone, think about us.'" "Furthermore, no sanctions relief or concessions should be provided to the Iranian regime, unless that regime verifiably ends its human rights abuses in iran and terrorism abroad, and abandons its destructive support for proxies in the region," it says. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The letter comes after envoys from Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and Iran met in Vienna, and as the U.S. was due to start its own indirect talks with Iran -- as part of a global effort to bring both Iran and the U.S. back to the Iran deal. Professor Kazem Kazerounian, one of the lead organizers of the letter, noted that the talks in Iran are going on in Vienna, where a potential terrorist plot against the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) in Paris was planned. He said that many of the co-signers of the letter were also targets of the 2018 plot. "The signatories know the terrorism of the Iranian regime firsthand," he said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

News article:
Biden’s new Iran Deal must rein in Tehran’s proxies Dr. Azeem Ibrahim Joe Biden will lift sanctions on Iran that are inconsistent with the Iran deal. (Getty Images) Short Url https://arab.news/zcqy6 President Joe Biden has announced that he is preparing to lift sanctions on Iran inconsistent with the Iran deal. There is no doubt the Obama administration’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), colloquially called the “Iran Deal,” was a great achievement of diplomacy; decades after the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, Washington, London, Tehran and others managed to come together and agree to an international treaty. Nevertheless, the JCPOA was critically flawed, in a way that made it unsustainable from the outset: It may have successfully contained Iran’s nuclear capacity, but left Tehran free rein to attack other US interests and allies in the Middle East through its long-established, extensive network of proxies dedicated to that goal. Iran funds, arms, trains, and helps direct many factions, such as the Assad government in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian occupied territories, the Houthis in Yemen, and in recent years even the Afghan Taliban. On top of that, Iran has sustained a number of smaller terrorist groups and cells that have carried out attacks against US diplomatic and military assets for decades. Read the full report on Arab News Research & Studies here. A Democrat-led Washington could wear those excesses and fight that fight in isolation of the JCPOA. But any Iran hawk could later come in and use the activities of those proxies against American interests in the region as a pretext to sink the JCPOA and set the US on the path of direct military confrontation with Tehran. And Washington certainly has no shortage of figures keen to do just that. So yes, it is imperative that Biden resurrects the “Iran Deal” to make sure Tehran does not acquire nuclear weapons. The only other way to potentially stop it from achieving that goal is war, which, in the aftermath of Iraq, should obviously be avoided. Iran is a much bigger and more powerful country than Iraq was, and among the people of Iran, even those who loathe the government would hate Western intervention even more, and would rally against invading forces. That is to say nothing of the fact that Iran has close economic and strategic ties to both Russia and China, who would aid Tehran’s efforts to defend itself. Conflict is not only a morally wrong course of action: It would be ruinous for America’s interests. Washington may not lose the war, but they would likely lose the peace. But if war is to be avoided during this and subsequent administrations, treaties between the US and Iran to guarantee peace need to be politically sustainable. Future US presidents must not have easy pretexts to rescind the agreements and re-initiate hostilities. That primarily means Tehran must be constrained from continuing its proxy war against the US in the Middle East. Iran funds, arms, trains, and helps direct many factions, such as the Assad government in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian occupied territories, the Houthis in Yemen, and in recent years even the Afghan Taliban. Dr. Azeem Ibrahim Of course, this works both ways. Tehran is also replete with anti-American hawks, and their own nationalist conservatives have strong political incentives to undermine any détente with the US and instigate direct confrontation. For this reason, Washington must also make concessions. Above all, it must publicly acknowledge that it was former President Donald Trump who reneged on the JCPOA first, that Tehran complied with the agreement itself despite its malign activities in the region, and that the people of Iran perhaps deserve some compensation for the economic hardship following the reimposition of sanctions by Trump. Read the full report on Arab News Research & Studies here. All those things are true, and recognising them as such must be the foundation of any good faith effort to rebuild the nuclear agreement. But in exchange for that good faith, it should be demanded of Iran that it respond with equal good faith and stop funding every proxy and terrorist group opposed to the US in the region. An agreement must be reached, because failure is almost certain to lead to a war with no winners: Both sides will lose status, money, power and the lives of their soldiers, and millions of innocent people caught in the middle will suffer and die needlessly. That is a scenario no one can afford. Dr. Azeem Ibrahim is a director at the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington DC.

News article:
President Joe Biden’s administration is “utterly senseless” to seek any new restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program or military apparatus, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “The way we see it, it is utterly senseless to demand Iran should accept new conditions within the framework of the nuclear deal or assume new obligations apart from the JCPOA,” Lavrov said, using the acronym for the 2015 nuclear deal, according to state media. Those remarks were just one in a series of comments aligning Russia with Tehran’s negotiating position, with the opening round of talks over the U.S. and Iranian return to compliance underway in Vienna. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s team assesses that Russia and China share the Western interest in constraining Iran’s nuclear program, but U.S. intelligence officials also perceive Russian officials as eager to damage most U.S. policy initiatives. “Moscow will continue to employ a variety of tactics this year meant to undermine US influence, develop new international norms and partnerships, divide Western countries and weaken Western alliances, and demonstrate Russia’s ability to shape global events as a major player in a new multipolar international order,” a new report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence states. IRAN TO ENRICH URANIUM AT HIGHEST-EVER LEVELS AFTER NATANZ ATTACK Lavrov portrayed Biden’s current maintenance of the sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump as a self-serving policy by the U.S. government. “The main problem, as we see it, is Washington's persistent unwillingness to abandon its flawed course towards upholding the U.S.'s global dominance,” he told Iranian media, claiming the United States and European government had embarked upon a “neocolonial” foreign policy. “This is, of course, unacceptable for both Russia and Iran, as well as most countries of the world.” Iranian officials want Biden to lift all sanctions imposed by Trump — not only the nuclear sanctions renewed when he exited the 2015 deal but also the terrorism-related sanctions. U.S. officials so far have signaled they will refuse to do so. Russia’s position is “clear and consistent with our Iranian friends’ approach,” Lavrov stated. “All unilateral sanctions imposed by Washington in direct violation of the JCPOA must, of course, be lifted,” he said. “This topic is being discussed in Vienna.” American negotiators in Vienna, however, have emphasized that Iran’s demand is too expansive because Tehran is trying to pressure Biden to lift terrorism sanctions, in addition to the nuclear-related measures. “Under the deal, the U.S. retains the right to impose sanctions for nonnuclear reasons, whether it’s terrorism or human rights violations or interference with our elections, etc.,” a senior State Department official told reporters on Friday. “Our view is that all sanctions that are inconsistent with the JCPOA and inconsistent with the benefits that Iran expects from the JCPOA, we are prepared to lift those if Iran comes back into compliance with its obligations.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Lavrov condemned the European Union’s decision this week to sanction Iranian security officials involved in a violent crackdown on protests that took place in 2019. “If the decision was made deliberately, in the midst of the ongoing talks in Vienna on ways to rescue the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, then this is not a disaster,” he said. "It is the kind of mistake that, as you know, is worse than a crime.”

President Joe Biden’s administration is “utterly senseless” to seek any new restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program or military apparatus, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “The way we see it, it is utterly senseless to demand Iran should accept new conditions within the framework of the nuclear deal or assume new obligations apart from the JCPOA,” Lavrov said, using the acronym for the 2015 nuclear deal, according to state media. Those remarks were just one in a series of comments aligning Russia with Tehran’s negotiating position, with the opening round of talks over the U.S. and Iranian return to compliance underway in Vienna. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s team assesses that Russia and China share the Western interest in constraining Iran’s nuclear program, but U.S. intelligence officials also perceive Russian officials as eager to damage most U.S. policy initiatives. “Moscow will continue to employ a variety of tactics this year meant to undermine US influence, develop new international norms and partnerships, divide Western countries and weaken Western alliances, and demonstrate Russia’s ability to shape global events as a major player in a new multipolar international order,” a new report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence states. IRAN TO ENRICH URANIUM AT HIGHEST-EVER LEVELS AFTER NATANZ ATTACK Lavrov portrayed Biden’s current maintenance of the sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump as a self-serving policy by the U.S. government. “The main problem, as we see it, is Washington's persistent unwillingness to abandon its flawed course towards upholding the U.S.'s global dominance,” he told Iranian media, claiming the United States and European government had embarked upon a “neocolonial” foreign policy. “This is, of course, unacceptable for both Russia and Iran, as well as most countries of the world.” Iranian officials want Biden to lift all sanctions imposed by Trump — not only the nuclear sanctions renewed when he exited the 2015 deal but also the terrorism-related sanctions. U.S. officials so far have signaled they will refuse to do so. Russia’s position is “clear and consistent with our Iranian friends’ approach,” Lavrov stated. “All unilateral sanctions imposed by Washington in direct violation of the JCPOA must, of course, be lifted,” he said. “This topic is being discussed in Vienna.” American negotiators in Vienna, however, have emphasized that Iran’s demand is too expansive because Tehran is trying to pressure Biden to lift terrorism sanctions, in addition to the nuclear-related measures. “Under the deal, the U.S. retains the right to impose sanctions for nonnuclear reasons, whether it’s terrorism or human rights violations or interference with our elections, etc.,” a senior State Department official told reporters on Friday. “Our view is that all sanctions that are inconsistent with the JCPOA and inconsistent with the benefits that Iran expects from the JCPOA, we are prepared to lift those if Iran comes back into compliance with its obligations.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Lavrov condemned the European Union’s decision this week to sanction Iranian security officials involved in a violent crackdown on protests that took place in 2019. “If the decision was made deliberately, in the midst of the ongoing talks in Vienna on ways to rescue the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, then this is not a disaster,” he said. "It is the kind of mistake that, as you know, is worse than a crime.”

News article:
The Biden administration is appeasing Iran with words and deeds. It's a serious error of judgment. The Trump administration’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran was effective in denying the regime the funds it needs to support its proxies, including Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Those sanctions have also put Iran's economy on the brink of collapse. Unfortunately, instead of using this leverage, the Biden administration has squandered it. In February, President Joe Biden removed the Houthis from the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. The administration cited humanitarian assistance reasons for doing so, but the decision just doesn't add up. The Houthis conduct terrorism in Yemen and attempt to export terrorism with ballistic missile attacks on population centers in Saudi Arabia. But the nuclear deal issue is the big concern. On the campaign trail, Biden pledged that the United States would not return to the nuclear deal unless Iran first returned to compliance with it. Biden added that he would also seek to address nonnuclear issues, including the regime’s malign regional activities, ballistic missile program, and human rights violations. Instead, the Biden administration and Iran have agreed to establish two working groups on how both parties can reenter the deal. This clearly breaks Biden’s pledge from the campaign trail. Instead of waiting for Iran to return to the deal, Biden is showing himself desperate to return to a policy of dangerous failure. How else can we consider the 2015 arrangement that gave the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism $150 billion in sanctions relief while failing to address the regime’s regional aggression, ballistic missile program, human rights violations, and covert nuclear weapons research? If the U.S. returns to the nuclear deal and lifts sanctions on Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei won't exactly be ready to reconsider his other destabilizing activities. On the contrary, he'll have the political rationale and treasury investments to double down on those activities. Jackson Richman was most recently the Washington correspondent for JNS.org.

News article:
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei strongly criticized efforts of President Joe Biden's administration and European leaders to return the Persian Gulf nation to its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal, slamming the "false words" of the United States. The 2015 agreement—officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—is a treaty that promises Iran sanctions relief and international investment in exchange for the nation curbing its nuclear program. Former President Barack Obama's administration pushed through the accord alongside leaders from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia and China, but former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimplemented harsh sanctions against Iran. Biden's administration is now working to restore the international pact and bring Iran back into compliance. But Khamenei signaled Wednesday that Iran was not willing to compromise its position. "The US is not after accepting the truth through #negotiations. Rather, it seeks to impose its false words. The Europeans have also confessed in some private meetings with our officials that #Iran is in the right, & they acknowledge our policy that sanctions must be removed first," Khamenei wrote in a series of Twitter posts. The US is not after accepting the truth through #negotiations. Rather, it seeks to impose its false words. The Europeans have also confessed in some private meetings with our officials that #Iran is in the right, & they acknowledge our policy that sanctions must be removed first. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 Taking aim at Europe and the U.S., he said the "suggestions they make are often arrogant and degrading, thus they aren't even worth looking at." Khamenei called the U.S. an "aggressor" and said Europeans "follow the U.S. because they don't have any true independence." Nevertheless, when it comes to making decisions, the same Europeans follow the U.S. Because they don’t have any true independence and the U.S. is an aggressor too. The suggestions they make are often arrogant and degrading, thus they aren’t even worth looking at. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 At the same time, Khamenei suggested Iran would be willing to return to the agreement if its demands are met. He expressed a desire for Iran's negotiators to "enjoy divine success." "We have already declared #Iran's policy. #Sanctions must be removed first. Once we are certain that has been done, we will carry out our commitments. This is because they have broken their promises tens of times, and it is the same now," the Iranian leader wrote. We have already declared #Iran's policy. #Sanctions must be removed first. Once we are certain that has been done, we will carry out our commitments. This is because they have broken their promises tens of times, and it is the same now. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 A State Department spokesperson told Newsweek in an email that Iran and the U.S. share "a common objective" to restore the JCPOA. "The United States and Iran have stated a common objective of returning to mutual compliance with the JCPOA. We have been engaged constructively in a diplomatic process to achieve that goal," the spokesperson said. "In Vienna last week, we explored concrete approaches concerning the steps both Iran and the U.S. would need to take to return to compliance. The U.S. delegation is in Vienna this week for the resumption of talks and the working groups in order to discuss a possible mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA." After Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimplemented harsh sanctions, Iranian leaders repeatedly negotiated with European leaders, as well as Russia and China, to preserve the JCPOA. A year after the Trump administration walked away from U.S. commitments, Iran announced that it would begin enriching uranium and stop abiding by its commitments under the international agreement. Meanwhile, European leaders, Russia and China repeatedly expressed their displeasure with the Trump administration's policy toward Iran. During his campaign, Biden—who served as vice president when Obama signed the agreement—said he would work on returning to the international accord and indirect talks have moved forward with European leaders. Although Iranian officials have shown a willingness to talk, one of the negotiators said this week that Iran would begin enriching uranium up to 60 percent purity, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. The country had already been enriching uranium up to 20 percent. Updated 10:57 AM ET, with comment from the State Department.

News article:
In early April, Iran celebrated its 15th annual “National Nuclear Technology Day” and used the occasion to demonstrate new IR-9 centrifuges. These new centrifuges are 50 times more efficient enriching uranium than the previous model. This achievement is a thumb-in-the-eye to America proving Iran’s “peaceful nuclear program” is anything but…and that they will continue their deceptive march to become a nuclear power. Consider how the confluence of three developments forms a “perfect storm” endangering Israel, the United States and world peace. First, how can it be that America is now an impotent paper tiger in spite of fielding a world class military, controlling powerful financial networks and being the dominant world economic force? The answer to this absurdity has to lie with President Biden’s early messaging to Iran. He appears willing to forego leverage of crippling sanctions, to subtly undermine support for Sunni nations and to re-enter the flawed 2015 JCPOA. Joe Biden has chosen senior leaders who have demonstrated anti-Israel bias. In addition to the JCPOA facilitators like John Kerry, Wendy Sherman and Tony Blinken, consider the damage done by selection of Rob Malley, Maher Bitar, Kristen Clarke and Matt Duss. What does this tell Iran? Biden’s first three months in office have witnessed Georgia voting law “outrage” earning from the Washington Post four Pinocchios, a border “crisis” coverup, the sleight-of-hand Covid Relief Bill targeted expenditures, an Infrastructure Bill with its loosey-goosey definitions, and whitewashing strung-out Hunter’s mischief. While all this hypocrisy should horrify Americans, it also conveys to our enemies a willful, foolish disrespect for the truth…and it undermines Biden’s credibility among sovereign leaders. “False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil,” warned Plato. From the warp-speed Covid vaccine development to border security to the progress in the Middle East, Biden has petulantly pursued an anti-Trump doctrine. He wants to erase the very real progress made by his predecessor. Joe Biden’s missing-in-action presidency highlighted with a bunkered public schedule and opaque, teleprompter “transparency” telegraphs to our adversaries that either others are in charge or that he lacks the energy to lead our country. Second, Iran has to feel empowered. While there is a proxy-cold war fought with Israel…witness the attacks in Syria, Natanz sabotage, and against shipping vessels…their $400 billion trade deal with China and outreach by the EU have to inspire Iranian resolve. Biden’s prolific use of Executive Orders suggests a strategy to short circuit legislative processes, including Congressional approval. Secretary of Defense Austin recently pledged America’s commitment to Israel’s security. Great, but we all recall President Obama’s breathless pledge to “…have Israel back” and we witnessed his UN Resolution 2334 treachery. Advertisement Recent reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) detailing new Iranian nuclear breaches and the Mossad’s 2018 lift of half a ton of archived documents from a Teheran warehouse substantiated the reality of their decades’ long pursuit of a nuclear weapon. To treat the Iranians and their negotiators as anything but untrustworthy adversaries is a fool’s mission. Iran is a determined foe bent on another Holocaust. Third, will the broader Jewish community pressure the Biden Administration to support Israel against the Iranian menace? The highly partisan, spiteful never-Trump obsession of the Jewish voting public is backstopped with compliant politicized “Jewish” organizations. The tilt of major American Jewish organizations like ADL, HIAS, National Council of Jewish Women and even the JCPA away from their roots is a crystal-clear signal something is VERY wrong. It would seem our Jewish leadership has forgotten our vulnerability, and hyper partisanship distracts them from lessons of the past. The infection of false words has proven fatal for the Jews, and these organizations now cave to “feelings” of the woke-cancel-intersectional narratives that convert Israel into the aggressor, colonialist and racist. The hard work to teach, understand and advocate for the truthful “facts” is inconvenient and not fashionable. If Iran succeeds in manufacturing a nuclear weapon it won’t simply end there. It will be like the spoiled child who had to have a toy or a candy — something else will be demanded. Their malign behavior will continue and their desire for a Shia hegemony will remain front and center. Other Sunni nations will then seek similar armaments. And Israel’s Begin Doctrine of not permitting a weapon of mass destruction will be tested. Advertisement Consistent with their shrill proclamations, a nuclear Iran will try to destroy Israel, and destabilize the region. Biden’s rush to reset Obama’s appeasement will make the Middle East exponentially more volatile and have a draconian economic effect on a Covid recovering world. Some American Jewish leaders already demonstrate preference for appeasement, and the recent Georgia Congressional elections have removed important counterbalances. Are leaders of Jewish organizations aware of the existential threat and do they have the courage and foresight to stand tall to apply their voice and influence? Mitigating this “perfect storm” must transcend all other mandates and missions.

News article:
https://www.frontpagemag.com/point/2021/04/dem-senator-who-secretly-met-iran-minister-demands-daniel-greenfield/ Iran Firsters are a problem. They’re an even bigger problem when they’re running the government. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), hoping to quell speculation of wrongdoing, has formally responded to reports that he held a secret meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif last week. But his explanation may raise more questions than it answers. The Federalist first reported Monday that Murphy and other Democratic senators held a “secret” meeting with Zarif last week at the annual Munich Security Conference. The news immediately began to circulate in the media and led to speculation as to whether Murphy had undermined U.S. foreign policy or even potentially violated the Logan Act by holding the meeting. Tuesday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commented on the reports, seeming to scold Murphy and his Democratic colleagues for meeting with Zarif, who, Pompeo noted, is “the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27” and “is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world’s largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.” Pompeo also noted Zarif’s status. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to the news of the meeting. “This guy [Zarif] is designated by the United States of America,” Pompeo said at a press conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. “He’s the foreign minister for a country that shot down a commercial airliner and has yet to turn over the black boxes. This is the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27. And it’s the foreign minister of a country who is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world’s largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.” Pompeo referred to the US treasury decision in July 2019 to designate Zarif for acting for the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei. In April 2019, US President Donald Trump designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and its Quds Force, as a foreign terrorist organization. After an alleged Israeli attack crippled thousands of centrifuges at Iran’s Natanz plant, Iran Firsters have been fuming. The alleged Israeli attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility targeted an electrical substation located 40 to 50 meters underground and damaged “thousands of centrifuges,” Iranian officials revealed in recent days. Fereydoon Abbasi-Davani, former head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, told Iranian media on Monday that the attack hit an electrical substation located deep underground and managed to damage both the power distribution system and the cable leading to the centrifuges in order to cut power to them. The Iranian official stressed that such an operation takes years, saying “the design of the enemy was very beautiful.” Now, Senator Murphy is demanding a “classified briefing on the Natanz incident” while ranting that, “there is no viable military path to divorcing Iran from a nuclear weapon.” This was also Murphy’s response to the assassination of Iran’s nuclear chief Fakhrizadeh. Senator Murphy has been backed by the Iran Lobby and appeared at its events. I would say that he’s the last person who should have a classified briefing about actions against Iran.

https://www.frontpagemag.com/point/2021/04/dem-senator-who-secretly-met-iran-minister-demands-daniel-greenfield/ Iran Firsters are a problem. They’re an even bigger problem when they’re running the government. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), hoping to quell speculation of wrongdoing, has formally responded to reports that he held a secret meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif last week. But his explanation may raise more questions than it answers. The Federalist first reported Monday that Murphy and other Democratic senators held a “secret” meeting with Zarif last week at the annual Munich Security Conference. The news immediately began to circulate in the media and led to speculation as to whether Murphy had undermined U.S. foreign policy or even potentially violated the Logan Act by holding the meeting. Tuesday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commented on the reports, seeming to scold Murphy and his Democratic colleagues for meeting with Zarif, who, Pompeo noted, is “the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27” and “is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world’s largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.” Pompeo also noted Zarif’s status. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to the news of the meeting. “This guy [Zarif] is designated by the United States of America,” Pompeo said at a press conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. “He’s the foreign minister for a country that shot down a commercial airliner and has yet to turn over the black boxes. This is the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27. And it’s the foreign minister of a country who is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world’s largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.” Pompeo referred to the US treasury decision in July 2019 to designate Zarif for acting for the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei. In April 2019, US President Donald Trump designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and its Quds Force, as a foreign terrorist organization. After an alleged Israeli attack crippled thousands of centrifuges at Iran’s Natanz plant, Iran Firsters have been fuming. The alleged Israeli attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility targeted an electrical substation located 40 to 50 meters underground and damaged “thousands of centrifuges,” Iranian officials revealed in recent days. Fereydoon Abbasi-Davani, former head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, told Iranian media on Monday that the attack hit an electrical substation located deep underground and managed to damage both the power distribution system and the cable leading to the centrifuges in order to cut power to them. The Iranian official stressed that such an operation takes years, saying “the design of the enemy was very beautiful.” Now, Senator Murphy is demanding a “classified briefing on the Natanz incident” while ranting that, “there is no viable military path to divorcing Iran from a nuclear weapon.” This was also Murphy’s response to the assassination of Iran’s nuclear chief Fakhrizadeh. Senator Murphy has been backed by the Iran Lobby and appeared at its events. I would say that he’s the last person who should have a classified briefing about actions against Iran. But he’s actually the next to last after Iran’s biggest ally in the Senate. That would be Joe Biden.

[1/3] Head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization Ali-Akbar Salehi wears a mask as he speaks during a meeting with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi, in Tehran, Iran February 21, 2021. Hadi Zand/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday called Iran's enrichment of uranium to 60% purity unhelpful but said he is pleased Tehran is still in indirect talks with Washington about both countries resuming compliance with the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. Iran on Friday said it had begun enriching uranium to 60%, its highest level ever and a step closer to the 90% that is weapons grade, at its Natanz plant, where an explosion occurred earlier this week that Tehran blamed on Israel. "We do not support and do not think it's at all helpful that Iran is saying it's going to move to enrich to 60 percent," Biden told reporters in Washington during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. "We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions - indirect discussions - with us and with our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the (nuclear deal) ... without us making concessions that we are just not willing to make," Biden added. Iran had in recent months already raised enrichment to 20% purity, a level at which uranium is considered to be highly enriched and a significant step toward weapons-grade. A 2015 deal with world powers to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for the lifting of sanctions had capped the level of purity at 3.67%. Iran denies seeking a nuclear weapon. "We are producing about 9 grams of 60% enriched uranium an hour," Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told state television. "But we have to work on arrangements ... to drop it to 5 grams per hour. But then we will simultaneously produce 20% (uranium)," Salehi said. Earlier, Iran's parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said Iranian scientists had successfully started enriching 60% uranium at 40 minutes past midnight. "The will of the Iranian nation makes miracles that thwart any conspiracy," Qalibaf wrote on Twitter. In Vienna, a spokesman for the United Nations nuclear watchdog IAEA declined to comment on the Iranian statements about 60% enrichment. Asked if Iran's move was a sign that Tehran is not serious about returning to the nuclear deal, Biden replied: "The discussions are under way. I think it's premature to make a judgment as to what the outcome will be. But we are still talking." Iran and global powers are meeting in Vienna to try to rescue the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump three years ago - an effort potentially complicated by Tehran's decision to ramp up uranium enrichment. The talks will carry on for several days before breaking so that Iranian and U.S. officials can return home for consultations, a European Union official said on Friday. read more "We have this (Iranian) decision to go for 60% enrichment. Obviously this is not making the negotiation easier," the EU official told reporters, calling what happened at Natanz "deliberate sabotage". Abbas Araqchi, Iran's chief negotiator at the talks, said on Tuesday that Iran would activate 1,000 advanced centrifuge machines at Natanz. Multiple Israeli media outlets have quoted unnamed intelligence sources as saying the country's Mossad spy service carried out the sabotage operation at the Natanz complex. Israel - widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear arsenal - has not formally commented on the incident. Israel will do "whatever it takes" to ensure that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said on Friday. read more dubai.newsroom@thomsonreuters.com Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Washington - Ali Barada US President Joe Biden has stressed that “it’s premature” to know whether the indirect talks between the US and Iran will result in mutual compliance with the nuclear deal. However, he stressed that he has no intention of “making concessions.” “We do not support and do not think it’s at all helpful that Iran is saying it’s going to move to enrich to 60 percent,” Biden said during a joint press conference with Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihide Suga in Washington. He added, “it is contrary to the agreement.” “We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions — in direct discussions with us and with our — our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the JOPCA, and so that we are a part of it again — that we should have never gotten out of, in my view — without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” “And so the discussions are underway. I think it’s premature to make a judgement as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking,” he stressed. American officials hinted that the new US Envoy to Iran, Robert Malley, expressed readiness to lift 700 sanctions of 1,500 sanctions imposed by the former US administration. However, these leaks weren’t confirmed by officials responsible for negotiations with Iran. Biden sees that Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign has failed. “We take seriously Iran’s provocative announcement of its intention to begin enriching uranium to 60 percent, which the P5+1 should be unified in rejecting,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. She added that “this step both calls into question Iran’s seriousness with regard to the nuclear talks and underscores the imperative of returning to mutual compliance.” Commenting on the Vienna Talks, Psaki reiterated that they are going “to be difficult, to be long, we still feel that they are a step forward in moving towards — you know, leading with diplomacy to find a path forward."

News article:
Washington - Ali Barada US President Joe Biden has stressed that “it’s premature” to know whether the indirect talks between the US and Iran will result in mutual compliance with the nuclear deal. However, he stressed that he has no intention of “making concessions.” “We do not support and do not think it’s at all helpful that Iran is saying it’s going to move to enrich to 60 percent,” Biden said during a joint press conference with Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihide Suga in Washington. He added, “it is contrary to the agreement.” “We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions — in direct discussions with us and with our — our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the JOPCA, and so that we are a part of it again — that we should have never gotten out of, in my view — without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” “And so the discussions are underway. I think it’s premature to make a judgement as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking,” he stressed. American officials hinted that the new US Envoy to Iran, Robert Malley, expressed readiness to lift 700 sanctions of 1,500 sanctions imposed by the former US administration. However, these leaks weren’t confirmed by officials responsible for negotiations with Iran. Biden sees that Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign has failed. “We take seriously Iran’s provocative announcement of its intention to begin enriching uranium to 60 percent, which the P5+1 should be unified in rejecting,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. She added that “this step both calls into question Iran’s seriousness with regard to the nuclear talks and underscores the imperative of returning to mutual compliance.” Commenting on the Vienna Talks, Psaki reiterated that they are going “to be difficult, to be long, we still feel that they are a step forward in moving towards — you know, leading with diplomacy to find a path forward."

News article:
Vienna is bustling with another round of diplomacy on the Iran nuclear file. Unlike the direct talks that resulted in the flawed 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), this time the American and Iranian sides are not engaging directly. No matter the format, the end result is hard to escape: another bad deal. A diplomatic collapse is coming, based on a familiar but wrongheaded negotiating approach by American diplomats. This coming collapse is not hard to understand. The Biden administration is imploring the Islamic Republic of Iran to return to compliance with the JCPOA—and the regime's talented negotiating team is playing hard to get. The talks revolve primarily around what the West should pay the world's most prolific state sponsor of terrorism for the privilege of re-entering a faulty nuclear agreement that in 2015 granted Iran everything it wanted—namely, a patient pathway to atomic weapons and massive economic relief. Nuclear diplomacy is fine, but it must be shaped by American leverage. That leverage is strong right now, with Iran's accessible foreign exchange reserves down from over $120 billion in 2018 to just $4 billion. The Iranian government is running on fumes and facing an economic crisis. To make matters worse for the clerical regime, the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was reportedly set back by around nine months because of an explosion earlier this month. Its nuclear weaponization ambitions were also delayed significantly by the assassination last November of the longtime head of its military-nuclear program, Mohsen Fahkrizadeh. Finally, the regime is still struggling to regain its footing regionally after the Trump administration in January 2020 took out the Islamic Republic's most talented battlefield commander, Qassem Suleimani. All of this is leverage for Washington. And that leverage can be further enhanced by building a credible military threat to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities if the mullahs move to a bomb. The Biden team says it seeks a "longer, stronger, broader" deal. But this is not possible unless the White House sets forth a new Iran policy that is not held hostage by the JCPOA. A rapid return to the old agreement—or even worse, an incremental return—cedes crucial leverage to Tehran. Such an approach gives the regime zero incentive to negotiate another deal. The Iranian strategy is clear: wield the threat of nuclear escalation to extort massive economic concessions in the form of American sanction relief and a return to the JCPOA. This will give the regime tens of billions of dollars and allow it to forge ahead on nuclear R&D (sadly, the regime's advances are based on knowledge and production capabilities they gained by violating the 2015 agreement). By returning to the JCPOA, the regime can legally install advanced centrifuges, build up their enrichment capabilities and wait for key restrictions to sunset over the next two to nine years. After 2030, there will be no prohibitions on the Islamic Republic's ability to enrich massive uranium quantities to weapon-grade. The regime is currently enriching uranium at 60 percent and threatening to go up to 90 percent and quickly moving toward industrial-scale production capabilities—including second- and third-generation centrifuges that are more efficient in uranium enrichment. Some of these machines were already installed underground at Natanz. The explosion at Natanz and the July 2020 destruction of an advanced centrifuge assembly facility did significant damage. But these actions will only temporarily set back Tehran's nuclear ambitions. The Islamic Republic can now produce advanced centrifuges in large quantities. Overall, the regime can enrich uranium three to ten times faster, to all levels, and in clandestine facilities. It's game, set, match unless the Biden administration pushes for a new deal that requires Tehran to fully account for its military-nuclear activities—now known to the world because of the Iran Nuclear Archive that Israel's Mossad spirited out of Iran in 2018. The Iranian violations are even worse in light of the recent and detailed findings of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the clerical regime has been hiding undisclosed nuclear materials. In short, the IAEA's 2015 decision—pushed by then-Secretary of State John Kerry—to close its investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program was a serious mistake. The Archive findings and the IAEA's discoveries from its visits of Iranian nuclear sites demonstrated that the Islamic Republic was much closer to weaponization than was previously believed. The IAEA's failure to submit the reports outlining those findings represented one of the JCPOA's biggest flaws. What is the point of "unprecedented" monitoring of these sites if the IAEA never established a baseline of Iran's weaponization efforts? "Fixing" the old deal by addressing sunsets, monitoring and missiles doesn't address today's problems: Nuclear weaponization, including Tehran's past activities and current violations, Iranian enrichment in underground facilities and its advanced centrifuge R&D. Even with the recent setbacks, the Islamic Republic is still hard at work on the weaponization of its nuclear program as it develops advanced centrifuges that give Tehran an easier clandestine "sneak out." These most powerful centrifuges—with fewer machines required to weaponize uranium—are easier to hide and more difficult to detect. Gone are the days of keeping Iran at "one year" from producing a sufficient quantity of weapon-grade uranium for a first bomb. Returning to the JCPOA allows Iran to build on its advances and to continue installing advanced enrichment and infrastructure in undisclosed new facilities. The JCPOA all but gives a green light to the regime to clandestinely accumulate the enriched uranium it needs for a bomb, or several bombs. There are new concerns, too. The regime's advances in critical weaponization activities, like metal uranium processing, hot cells and irradiation of 20 percent-enriched materials, also must be addressed. All of this can help the regime build a nuclear weapon. A "longer, stronger" deal must prevent Iran from being a "nuclear threshold country." The clerical regime cannot maintain a "civilian nuclear program" in underground facilities, and it must come clean about the past. A new deal must address all three elements of Tehran's illicit nuclear program: fissile materials, weaponization and the means of delivery. There may be time for a broader agreement that covers the regime's support for terrorism, as well as other regional concerns. But the nuclear problem must be solved first, or we run the risk of American diplomats giving concrete nuclear concessions for unenforceable Iranian commitments to limit their other nefarious regional activities. The U.S. can permanently cut off Iran's pathways to nuclear weapons or collapse at the negotiating table. It's now time for the Biden administration to choose. Jacob Nagel is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and a visiting professor at the Technion Aerospace faculty. He previously served as acting national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and as head of the National Security Council. Mark Dubowitz is FDD's chief executive. An expert on Iran's nuclear program and sanctions, he was sanctioned by Iran in 2019. The views expressed in this article are the writers' own.

News article:
WASHINGTON (JTA) — Joe Biden’s Iran deal inbox has been quite full lately. On March 10, 70 Democrats and 70 Republicans in the House sent the president a letter in the hopes that “any agreement or set of agreements with Iran must be comprehensive in nature” — meaning any reentry into the 2015 nuclear agreement should also curb Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior. Two weeks later, a bipartisan group of 43 senators sent something similar. Two weeks after that, 27 Senate Democrats sent one urging the president to return to the deal right away. It’s clear that America’s pro-Israel community, along with foreign policy wonks in Congress, wants to influence Biden’s decision-making on Iran. There is bipartisan agreement that something must be done to counter Iran’s ever-growing nuclear weapons program and its promotion of terrorism in the Middle East. But the invested parties are far from consensus on what that something is. Underlying the unease are big questions: How does one project “toughness” on Iran? Is there any way for moderate liberals and conservatives to do so in reentering a deal that the American right — and much of the American Jewish community — has tarnished as capitulation to an evil enemy? Add a major wrinkle: The Biden administration has yet to issue a coherent policy. U.S. officials are negotiating with other countries about rejoining the ’15 deal, but they have yet to outline what if anything they want to see changed in the pact, or what concessions, if any, the United States may offer. That hasn’t stopped groups on the right from opposing a reentry and those on the left from pressing for an accelerated reupping. AIPAC, the powerhouse centrist pro-Israel lobby, is playing a wait-and-see game. For now, the lobby’s main Iran-related vehicle is a bipartisan Senate letter that is an unobjectionable wish list, although as more details of the Biden Iran policy emerge, AIPAC may become more confrontational. Biden has said he wants the United States and Iran back in compliance with the nuclear deal as soon as possible, but how that happens is stuck in a who-blinks-first standoff: Does Biden roll back sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, who left the deal in 2018, or does Iran roll back the uranium enrichment it has accelerated since Trump quit the deal? And what happens after that: Does the agreement remain intact or is it amended? The parties to the original deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, have spent two weeks in Vienna to work out a sequence, and Biden administration officials are telling Democrats in Congress that it’s going well without offering details. The lack of details creates a dilemma for Middle East policy influencers who are eager for a say in how U.S.-Iran relations take shape. A bipartisan Senate letter to Biden before the current talks started, backed by AIPAC, was emblematic of the dilemma: In the absence of particulars about the negotiations, the letter was unobjectionable, a summary of what everyone wants, except for Iran. “We strongly believe that you should use the full force of our diplomatic and economic tools in concert with our allies on the United Nations Security Council and in the region to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,” the letter sent March 25 said. Biden has committed to each of the letter’s demands: no nukes for Iran, and an expanded deal that would encompass what the JCPOA omitted, including stemming Iran’s malign actions in the region and its missile program. But Biden will not yet say what kind of sequence he wants, except to make clear to Iran that the United States would not make concessions before the sides are recommitted to the deal. At a news conference Friday, the president said he was “pleased” with the discussions underway and was ready to “move forward … without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” He said it was “premature” to make “a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking.” Quoting anonymous sources, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the U.S. team had indicated it was ready to ease some sanctions in the finance and oil sectors. While AIPAC is hanging back for now, a red line for the lobby would be sanctions relief before Iran commits to making the nuclear restrictions permanent. The lobby is telling Congress that lifting sanctions in exchange for just a partial rollback of Iran’s nuclear activities is not enough. If that’s the path Biden takes, AIPAC likely will be more outspoken and will endeavor to rally friendly Democrats to pressure Biden to roll back any concessions. Other actors are less patient and want to see action soon. The loudest voice for action belongs to whoever sabotaged Iran’s nuclear facility at Natanz earlier this month, reportedly crippling the site’s uranium enrichment capability. Iran has blamed Israel, and Israel is not commenting. Whether or not Israel is behind the sabotage, its officials are leaking furiously that Biden’s plans terrify them. An Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Sunday night unleashed a flurry of leaks. “The Iranians smell that the Americans want an agreement at any price,” Channel 12 News quoted an official as saying, according to The Times of Israel. Republicans are vowing to use whatever powers they have in the minority to block a return to the deal. James Risch, an Idaho senator and the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is backing a bill that would block sanctions relief. There is a companion bill in the House. Sanctions relief would allow Iran to rebuild its economy and weapons program to irreversible levels, said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It doesn’t matter what you do on the enrichment side, you’re going to allow these guys to develop all the infrastructure they need to ultimately attach a warhead to a ballistic missile. And then it’s game over,” said Dubowitz, whose organization was influential with the Trump administration in how it applied sanctions. There is pressure on the other side as well: dovish actors who believe the Biden administration is taking too long to come to an agreement, cognizant of Iranian elections in June that could return hard-liners to government. “We have a partner in Tehran that is clearly interested in rejoining the JCPOA, has political will to do it, has the diplomatic and technocratic expertise, and has a track record of living up to the terms of the agreement,” Eldar Mamedov, the political adviser to the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the European Parliament, said earlier this month in a conference organized by the Arms Control Association. “The whole idea that dragging out the U.S. return to JCPOA would somehow increase the leverage on Iran is a completely mistaken view. The attitudes are hardening in Tehran.” Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, said a key message of the group’s annual conference earlier this week was the urgency of returning to the deal. “Iran, without question, is of burning urgency,” Ben-Ami said Monday. “The talks are happening right now; the Iranian elections are in a couple of months. The agreement hangs by a thread.” Ben-Ami said J Street would oppose bringing the Iran deal before Congress for further congressional review, noting that it passed congressional muster in 2015. If Republicans do manage to raise the issue, he said, J Street would lobby Congress with polls showing that the vast majority of Jewish Americans opposed Trump’s pullout from the deal. Both congressional chambers are led by Democrats, but by tiny margins, so Republicans would have only to peel off a handful of Democrats to frustrate a return to the deal. A number of Democrats opposed the deal in 2015, and many of them are still in Congress. These days, however, even Democrats who opposed the deal six years ago fret that Trump’s pullout has heightened the risk to Israel. Iran retaliated against Trump for restoring and adding sanctions by increasing enrichment of fissile materials to 20% instead of the under 4% that was required under the deal. This week, retaliating for the attack on Natanz, Iran reportedly was reaching 60% uranium enrichment — much closer to the 90% or higher level required for weaponization. “I think most lawmakers, at least on the Democratic side, understand that what matters is what will be most effective in terms of keeping a nuclear weapon out of Iranian hands,” said Dylan Williams, J Street’s senior vice president for policy. “It’s menacing of Israel would turn from threats to nightmares were Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.” Last week, a J Street-backed Senate letter said that “there is no question that one of your early pressing national security priorities should be to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to address the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program.” That letter was signed by 27 Democrats, including moderates who are seen as close to AIPAC like Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. AIPAC’s letter, with its avoidance of commitment to any specific action, drew the support of 15 Democrats. (Casey signed both letters.) So far, the Biden administration’s plan for Iran doesn’t go much beyond getting the band back together. Top Biden administration officials are telling Congress that one of the purposes of the talks now underway in Vienna is to rally the same countries that forced Iran to the table nearly a decade ago to unite again and get the Islamic Republic to negotiate a better deal. A senior Democratic congressional staffer who is regularly briefed by the negotiators described a plan to have the same countries that suspended oil purchases from Iran ahead of the launch of the 2013 talks that led to the 2015 deal to do so again. “You have to cut out all the oil deals until there is Iranian compliance, until they agree to sit down and extend these deadlines,” the staffer said, referring to the “sunset” provisions in the original deal that allow Iran to end restrictions on enrichment of nuclear fissile material. U.S. negotiators are sending those countries the message that Biden, unlike Trump, is ready to work with them and not go it alone, the staffer said. The original parties to the deal were the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany, France and Iran. Those countries successfully pressured other major Iran oil consumers like South Korea, India and Japan to join sanctions. Now, according to a Biden staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, the United States must convince those countries to collaborate anew. “You need to have U.N. buy-in,” the staffer said. “You have to go to Europe, Russia, Indonesia, South Korea, India, Japan and China and tell them a new sheriff is back in town.”

WASHINGTON (JTA) — Joe Biden’s Iran deal inbox has been quite full lately. On March 10, 70 Democrats and 70 Republicans in the House sent the president a letter in the hopes that “any agreement or set of agreements with Iran must be comprehensive in nature” — meaning any reentry into the 2015 nuclear agreement should also curb Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior. Two weeks later, a bipartisan group of 43 senators sent something similar. Two weeks after that, 27 Senate Democrats sent one urging the president to return to the deal right away. It’s clear that America’s pro-Israel community, along with foreign policy wonks in Congress, wants to influence Biden’s decision-making on Iran. There is bipartisan agreement that something must be done to counter Iran’s ever-growing nuclear weapons program and its promotion of terrorism in the Middle East. But the invested parties are far from consensus on what that something is. Underlying the unease are big questions: How does one project “toughness” on Iran? Is there any way for moderate liberals and conservatives to do so in reentering a deal that the American right — and much of the American Jewish community — has tarnished as capitulation to an evil enemy? Add a major wrinkle: The Biden administration has yet to issue a coherent policy. U.S. officials are negotiating with other countries about rejoining the ’15 deal, but they have yet to outline what if anything they want to see changed in the pact, or what concessions, if any, the United States may offer. That hasn’t stopped groups on the right from opposing a reentry and those on the left from pressing for an accelerated reupping. AIPAC, the powerhouse centrist pro-Israel lobby, is playing a wait-and-see game. For now, the lobby’s main Iran-related vehicle is a bipartisan Senate letter that is an unobjectionable wish list, although as more details of the Biden Iran policy emerge, AIPAC may become more confrontational. Biden has said he wants the United States and Iran back in compliance with the nuclear deal as soon as possible, but how that happens is stuck in a who-blinks-first standoff: Does Biden roll back sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, who left the deal in 2018, or does Iran roll back the uranium enrichment it has accelerated since Trump quit the deal? And what happens after that: Does the agreement remain intact or is it amended? The parties to the original deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, have spent two weeks in Vienna to work out a sequence, and Biden administration officials are telling Democrats in Congress that it’s going well without offering details. The lack of details creates a dilemma for Middle East policy influencers who are eager for a say in how U.S.-Iran relations take shape. A bipartisan Senate letter to Biden before the current talks started, backed by AIPAC, was emblematic of the dilemma: In the absence of particulars about the negotiations, the letter was unobjectionable, a summary of what everyone wants, except for Iran. “We strongly believe that you should use the full force of our diplomatic and economic tools in concert with our allies on the United Nations Security Council and in the region to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,” the letter sent March 25 said. Biden has committed to each of the letter’s demands: no nukes for Iran, and an expanded deal that would encompass what the JCPOA omitted, including stemming Iran’s malign actions in the region and its missile program. But Biden will not yet say what kind of sequence he wants, except to make clear to Iran that the United States would not make concessions before the sides are recommitted to the deal. At a news conference Friday, the president said he was “pleased” with the discussions underway and was ready to “move forward … without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” He said it was “premature” to make “a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking.” Quoting anonymous sources, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the U.S. team had indicated it was ready to ease some sanctions in the finance and oil sectors. While AIPAC is hanging back for now, a red line for the lobby would be sanctions relief before Iran commits to making the nuclear restrictions permanent. The lobby is telling Congress that lifting sanctions in exchange for just a partial rollback of Iran’s nuclear activities is not enough. If that’s the path Biden takes, AIPAC likely will be more outspoken and will endeavor to rally friendly Democrats to pressure Biden to roll back any concessions. Other actors are less patient and want to see action soon. The loudest voice for action belongs to whoever sabotaged Iran’s nuclear facility at Natanz earlier this month, reportedly crippling the site’s uranium enrichment capability. Iran has blamed Israel, and Israel is not commenting. Whether or not Israel is behind the sabotage, its officials are leaking furiously that Biden’s plans terrify them. An Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Sunday night unleashed a flurry of leaks. “The Iranians smell that the Americans want an agreement at any price,” Channel 12 News quoted an official as saying, according to The Times of Israel. Republicans are vowing to use whatever powers they have in the minority to block a return to the deal. James Risch, an Idaho senator and the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is backing a bill that would block sanctions relief. There is a companion bill in the House. Sanctions relief would allow Iran to rebuild its economy and weapons program to irreversible levels, said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It doesn’t matter what you do on the enrichment side, you’re going to allow these guys to develop all the infrastructure they need to ultimately attach a warhead to a ballistic missile. And then it’s game over,” said Dubowitz, whose organization was influential with the Trump administration in how it applied sanctions. There is pressure on the other side as well: dovish actors who believe the Biden administration is taking too long to come to an agreement, cognizant of Iranian elections in June that could return hard-liners to government. “We have a partner in Tehran that is clearly interested in rejoining the JCPOA, has political will to do it, has the diplomatic and technocratic expertise, and has a track record of living up to the terms of the agreement,” Eldar Mamedov, the political adviser to the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the European Parliament, said earlier this month in a conference organized by the Arms Control Association. “The whole idea that dragging out the U.S. return to JCPOA would somehow increase the leverage on Iran is a completely mistaken view. The attitudes are hardening in Tehran.” Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, said a key message of the group’s annual conference earlier this week was the urgency of returning to the deal. “Iran, without question, is of burning urgency,” Ben-Ami said Monday. “The talks are happening right now; the Iranian elections are in a couple of months. The agreement hangs by a thread.” Ben-Ami said J Street would oppose bringing the Iran deal before Congress for further congressional review, noting that it passed congressional muster in 2015. If Republicans do manage to raise the issue, he said, J Street would lobby Congress with polls showing that the vast majority of Jewish Americans opposed Trump’s pullout from the deal. Both congressional chambers are led by Democrats, but by tiny margins, so Republicans would have only to peel off a handful of Democrats to frustrate a return to the deal. A number of Democrats opposed the deal in 2015, and many of them are still in Congress. These days, however, even Democrats who opposed the deal six years ago fret that Trump’s pullout has heightened the risk to Israel.

Advertisement These days, however, even Democrats who opposed the deal six years ago fret that Trump’s pullout has heightened the risk to Israel. Iran retaliated against Trump for restoring and adding sanctions by increasing enrichment of fissile materials to 20% instead of the under 4% that was required under the deal. This week, retaliating for the attack on Natanz, Iran reportedly was reaching 60% uranium enrichment — much closer to the 90% or higher level required for weaponization. “I think most lawmakers, at least on the Democratic side, understand that what matters is what will be most effective in terms of keeping a nuclear weapon out of Iranian hands,” said Dylan Williams, J Street’s senior vice president for policy. “It’s menacing of Israel would turn from threats to nightmares were Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.” Last week, a J Street-backed Senate letter said that “there is no question that one of your early pressing national security priorities should be to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to address the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program.” That letter was signed by 27 Democrats, including moderates who are seen as close to AIPAC like Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. AIPAC’s letter, with its avoidance of commitment to any specific action, drew the support of 15 Democrats. (Casey signed both letters.) So far, the Biden administration’s plan for Iran doesn’t go much beyond getting the band back together. Top Biden administration officials are telling Congress that one of the purposes of the talks now underway in Vienna is to rally the same countries that forced Iran to the table nearly a decade ago to unite again and get the Islamic Republic to negotiate a better deal. A senior Democratic congressional staffer who is regularly briefed by the negotiators described a plan to have the same countries that suspended oil purchases from Iran ahead of the launch of the 2013 talks that led to the 2015 deal to do so again. “You have to cut out all the oil deals until there is Iranian compliance, until they agree to sit down and extend these deadlines,” the staffer said, referring to the “sunset” provisions in the original deal that allow Iran to end restrictions on enrichment of nuclear fissile material. US negotiators are sending those countries the message that Biden, unlike Trump, is ready to work with them and not go it alone, the staffer said. The original parties to the deal were the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany, France and Iran. Those countries successfully pressured other major Iran oil consumers like South Korea, India and Japan to join sanctions. Now, according to a Biden staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, the United States must convince those countries to collaborate anew. “You need to have UN buy-in,” the staffer said. “You have to go to Europe, Russia, Indonesia, South Korea, India, Japan and China and tell them a new sheriff is back in town.”

WASHINGTON (JTA) — Joe Biden’s Iran deal inbox has been quite full lately. On March 10, 70 Democrats and 70 Republicans in the House sent the president a letter in the hopes that “any agreement or set of agreements with Iran must be comprehensive in nature” — meaning any reentry into the 2015 nuclear agreement should also curb Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior. Two weeks later, a bipartisan group of 43 senators sent something similar. Two weeks after that, 27 Senate Democrats sent one urging the president to return to the deal right away. It’s clear that America’s pro-Israel community, along with foreign policy wonks in Congress, wants to influence Biden’s decision-making on Iran. There is bipartisan agreement that something must be done to counter Iran’s ever-growing nuclear weapons program and its promotion of terrorism in the Middle East. But the invested parties are far from consensus on what that something is. Underlying the unease are big questions: How does one project “toughness” on Iran? Is there any way for moderate liberals and conservatives to do so in reentering a deal that the American right — and much of the American Jewish community — has tarnished as capitulation to an evil enemy? Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Add a major wrinkle: The Biden administration has yet to issue a coherent policy. US officials are negotiating with other countries about rejoining the 2015 deal, but they have yet to outline what if anything they want to see changed in the pact, or what concessions, if any, the United States may offer. That hasn’t stopped groups on the right from opposing a reentry and those on the left from pressing for an accelerated reupping. AIPAC, the powerhouse centrist pro-Israel lobby, is playing a wait-and-see game. For now, the lobby’s main Iran-related vehicle is a bipartisan Senate letter that is an unobjectionable wish list, although as more details of the Biden Iran policy emerge, AIPAC may become more confrontational. Biden has said he wants the United States and Iran back in compliance with the nuclear deal as soon as possible, but how that happens is stuck in a who-blinks-first standoff: Does Biden roll back sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, who left the deal in 2018, or does Iran roll back the uranium enrichment it has accelerated since Trump quit the deal? And what happens after that: Does the agreement remain intact or is it amended? Advertisement The parties to the original deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, have spent two weeks in Vienna to work out a sequence, and Biden administration officials are telling Democrats in Congress that it’s going well without offering details. The lack of details creates a dilemma for Middle East policy influencers who are eager for a say in how US-Iran relations take shape. A bipartisan Senate letter to Biden before the current talks started, backed by AIPAC, was emblematic of the dilemma: In the absence of particulars about the negotiations, the letter was unobjectionable, a summary of what everyone wants, except for Iran. “We strongly believe that you should use the full force of our diplomatic and economic tools in concert with our allies on the United Nations Security Council and in the region to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,” the letter sent March 25 said. Biden has committed to each of the letter’s demands: no nukes for Iran, and an expanded deal that would encompass what the JCPOA omitted, including stemming Iran’s malign actions in the region and its missile program. But Biden will not yet say what kind of sequence he wants, except to make clear to Iran that the United States would not make concessions before the sides are recommitted to the deal. At a news conference Friday, the president said he was “pleased” with the discussions underway and was ready to “move forward… without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” Advertisement He said it was “premature” to make “a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking.” Quoting anonymous sources, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the US team had indicated it was ready to ease some sanctions in the finance and oil sectors. While AIPAC is hanging back for now, a red line for the lobby would be sanctions relief before Iran commits to making the nuclear restrictions permanent. The lobby is telling Congress that lifting sanctions in exchange for just a partial rollback of Iran’s nuclear activities is not enough. If that’s the path Biden takes, AIPAC likely will be more outspoken and will endeavor to rally friendly Democrats to pressure Biden to roll back any concessions. Other actors are less patient and want to see action soon. The loudest voice for action belongs to whoever sabotaged Iran’s nuclear facility at Natanz earlier this month, reportedly crippling the site’s uranium enrichment capability. Iran has blamed Israel, and Israel is not commenting. Whether or not Israel is behind the sabotage, its officials are leaking furiously that Biden’s plans terrify them. An Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Sunday night unleashed a flurry of leaks. “The Iranians smell that the Americans want an agreement at any price,” Channel 12 news quoted an official as saying. Republicans are vowing to use whatever powers they have in the minority to block a return to the deal. James Risch, an Idaho senator and the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is backing a bill that would block sanctions relief. There is a companion bill in the House. Sanctions relief would allow Iran to rebuild its economy and weapons program to irreversible levels, said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Advertisement “It doesn’t matter what you do on the enrichment side, you’re going to allow these guys to develop all the infrastructure they need to ultimately attach a warhead to a ballistic missile. And then it’s game over,” said Dubowitz, whose organization was influential with the Trump administration in how it applied sanctions. There is pressure on the other side as well: dovish actors who believe the Biden administration is taking too long to come to an agreement, cognizant of Iranian elections in June that could return hard-liners to government. “We have a partner in Tehran that is clearly interested in rejoining the JCPOA, has political will to do it, has the diplomatic and technocratic expertise, and has a track record of living up to the terms of the agreement,” Eldar Mamedov, the political adviser to the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the European Parliament, said earlier this month in a conference organized by the Arms Control Association. “The whole idea that dragging out the US return to JCPOA would somehow increase the leverage on Iran is a completely mistaken view. The attitudes are hardening in Tehran.” Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, said a key message of the group’s annual conference earlier this week was the urgency of returning to the deal. “Iran, without question, is of burning urgency,” Ben-Ami said Monday. “The talks are happening right now; the Iranian elections are in a couple of months. The agreement hangs by a thread.” Ben-Ami said J Street would oppose bringing the Iran deal before Congress for further congressional review, noting that it passed congressional muster in 2015. If Republicans do manage to raise the issue, he said, J Street would lobby Congress with polls showing that the vast majority of Jewish Americans opposed Trump’s pullout from the deal. Both congressional chambers are led by Democrats, but by tiny margins, so Republicans would have only to peel off a handful of Democrats to frustrate a return to the deal.

News article:
If President Joe Biden changes or adjusts the Iran nuclear deal—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA—then he is obligated to bring it to Congress. This is not the wishful thinking of critics of the agreement; it is according to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) of 2015. In May of 2015, Congress passed INARA, giving itself the right to review any future agreements or modifications reached regarding the Iran nuclear deal, in essence reserving the right to assess any changes made. Since it’s almost impossible to restore the deal intact since six years have passed since it was written, a return to the JCPOA promised by Biden means a new agreement. The administration’s strategy will be to ignore Congress, claiming that any changes will not be substantive, so INARA does not apply. According to former Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Rademaker, writing in RealClearWorld, “The Act mandates congressional review—and provides for potential disapproval—of not just the JCPOA, but any “agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran … regardless of the form it takes … the Act (also) prohibits the extension of sanctions relief during the 30 days the law sets aside for congressional review of any nuclear agreement with Iran.” Biden promised to rejoin the JCPOA, and lengthen and strengthen the unsigned agreement. Unfortunately, his Iran envoy Robert Malley has said that if Iran returns to full compliance, then they will immediately get sanctions relief. Does that mean removing all sanctions, including those for their egregious human-rights abuses, missile proliferation and counterterrorism? U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that no significant amendments will be added before rejoining the agreement. I don’t follow the administration’s logic—beginning negotiations with the wily Iranian regime by giving away all its leverage. In response this month, Sens. James Risch (-Wis.) and Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced legislation called the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act of 2021 (S. 488) to address the administration’s contradictory approach and messaging. Risch said, “It’s increasingly clear that the Biden administration’s promises to ‘lengthen and strengthen’ the Iran nuclear deal are instead an attempt to re-enter the flawed 2015 JCPOA at any cost. … This bill would require Congress to approve any Biden administration effort to lift sanctions against the Iranian regime. The United States currently maintains a position of significant leverage with Iran because our sanctions are working. Given that reality, the administration should keep its promises to address the JCPOA’s looming sunsets, as well as Iran’s regional terrorism, ballistic-missile activity and wrongful imprisonment of Americans.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories And that is where INARA comes in. If Biden keeps his promise to be the anti-Trump, following the law he needs to go back to Congress before obligating America to trust the theocratic Islamic regime, which hid and lied about its nuclear program for decades. Like all recent executives of both parties, Biden will claim that foreign policy is the exclusive purview of the president. That is because the Senate has allowed presidents to run roughshod over its constitutional duties for decades. The Senate should speak up now—that includes members on both sides of the aisle. Will Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who voted against the deal the first time, speak up again and act? The JCPOA in 2015 should have been submitted to the Senate as a treaty, being the most consequential American foreign-policy agreement of the 21st century. According to an article in Foreign Policy by Daniel Kutzer, Aaron Miller and Steven Simon, “Little constituency exists in Washington for returning to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran on precisely the same terms as before. Republicans and even some crucial Democrats oppose it.” If that is true, then the president is bound by law to send any updates or changes to Congress for review. I received a request from a reader about what voters should “ask for” from Congress. First, don’t be fooled by rhetoric that claims we are all on the same page, agreeing that Iran should never get a nuclear weapon. That does not mean and is not the same as improving the JCPOA now. When Brett McGurk, Biden’s national security council coordinator for the Middle East, said this week concerning the United States and Israel’s goals regarding Iran, “there is no disagreement. … Iran can never get a nuclear weapon, period,” that is political doublespeak. It does not address that the JCPOA, which the administration has vowed to return to, still allows Iran to develop an industrial-size nuclear program in less than 10 years when its sunset provisions fully kick in. The answer for pro-Israel Americans is to let the Democratic Majority for Israel, the Jewish Democratic Council and their state legislators know the JCPOA’s weaknesses are your No. 1 foreign-policy concern. Let them know you expect Biden to keep his word to strengthen and lengthen the deal, but to do it before rejoining a flawed JCPOA. And you want the Senate to be able to weigh in and review the modifications. Let them know that rhetoric alone without a fundamental change of the sunset provisions is not enough. The handwriting is already on the wall for a return to the old JCPOA. Now is the time to speak up. Dr. Eric R. Mandel is the director of MEPIN, the Middle East Political Information Network.

News article:
If President Joe Biden changes or adjusts the Iran nuclear deal—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA—then he is obligated to bring it to Congress. This is not the wishful thinking of critics of the agreement; it is according to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) of 2015. In May of 2015, Congress passed INARA, giving itself the right to review any future agreements or modifications reached regarding the Iran nuclear deal, in essence reserving the right to assess any changes made. Since it’s almost impossible to restore the deal intact since six years have passed since it was written, a return to the JCPOA promised by Biden means a new agreement. The administration’s strategy will be to ignore Congress, claiming that any changes will not be substantive, so INARA does not apply. According to former Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Rademaker, writing in RealClearWorld, “The Act mandates congressional review—and provides for potential disapproval—of not just the JCPOA, but any “agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran … regardless of the form it takes … the Act (also) prohibits the extension of sanctions relief during the 30 days the law sets aside for congressional review of any nuclear agreement with Iran.” Biden promised to rejoin the JCPOA, and lengthen and strengthen the unsigned agreement. Unfortunately, his Iran envoy Robert Malley has said that if Iran returns to full compliance, then they will immediately get sanctions relief. Does that mean removing all sanctions, including those for their egregious human-rights abuses, missile proliferation and counterterrorism? U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that no significant amendments will be added before rejoining the agreement. I don’t follow the administration’s logic—beginning negotiations with the wily Iranian regime by giving away all its leverage. In response this month, Sens. James Risch (-Wis.) and Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced legislation called the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act of 2021 (S. 488) to address the administration’s contradictory approach and messaging. Risch said, “It’s increasingly clear that the Biden administration’s promises to ‘lengthen and strengthen’ the Iran nuclear deal are instead an attempt to re-enter the flawed 2015 JCPOA at any cost. … This bill would require Congress to approve any Biden administration effort to lift sanctions against the Iranian regime. The United States currently maintains a position of significant leverage with Iran because our sanctions are working. Given that reality, the administration should keep its promises to address the JCPOA’s looming sunsets, as well as Iran’s regional terrorism, ballistic-missile activity and wrongful imprisonment of Americans.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories And that is where INARA comes in. If Biden keeps his promise to be the anti-Trump, following the law he needs to go back to Congress before obligating America to trust the theocratic Islamic regime, which hid and lied about its nuclear program for decades. Like all recent executives of both parties, Biden will claim that foreign policy is the exclusive purview of the president. That is because the Senate has allowed presidents to run roughshod over its constitutional duties for decades. The Senate should speak up now—that includes members on both sides of the aisle. Will Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who voted against the deal the first time, speak up again and act? The JCPOA in 2015 should have been submitted to the Senate as a treaty, being the most consequential American foreign-policy agreement of the 21st century. According to an article in Foreign Policy by Daniel Kutzer, Aaron Miller and Steven Simon, “Little constituency exists in Washington for returning to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran on precisely the same terms as before. Republicans and even some crucial Democrats oppose it.” If that is true, then the president is bound by law to send any updates or changes to Congress for review. I received a request from a reader about what voters should “ask for” from Congress. First, don’t be fooled by rhetoric that claims we are all on the same page, agreeing that Iran should never get a nuclear weapon. That does not mean and is not the same as improving the JCPOA now. When Brett McGurk, Biden’s national security council coordinator for the Middle East, said this week concerning the United States and Israel’s goals regarding Iran, “there is no disagreement. … Iran can never get a nuclear weapon, period,” that is political doublespeak. It does not address that the JCPOA, which the administration has vowed to return to, still allows Iran to develop an industrial-size nuclear program in less than 10 years when its sunset provisions fully kick in. The answer for pro-Israel Americans is to let the Democratic Majority for Israel, the Jewish Democratic Council and their state legislators know the JCPOA’s weaknesses are your No. 1 foreign-policy concern. Let them know you expect Biden to keep his word to strengthen and lengthen the deal, but to do it before rejoining a flawed JCPOA. And you want the Senate to be able to weigh in and review the modifications. Let them know that rhetoric alone without a fundamental change of the sunset provisions is not enough. The handwriting is already on the wall for a return to the old JCPOA. Now is the time to speak up. Dr. Eric R. Mandel is the director of MEPIN, the Middle East Political Information Network. He regularly briefs members of the U.S. Senate, House and their foreign-policy advisers. He is a columnist for “The Jerusalem Post” and a contributor to i24TV, “The Hill,” JTA and “The Forward.”

News article:
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/17320/biden-administration-iran-talks The Biden administration seems more determined than ever, however, to “reward” Iran’s dangerous and predatory regime by returning to a deal that has sunset clauses, as well as an expiration date after which the mullahs can enrich uranium, spin centrifuges at any level they desire, and make as many nuclear weapons as they like. A return to the 2025 deal would help to lift all major sanctions against Iran — sanctions it took years to put in place. The deal would enable Iran’s military sites to be exempt from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The deal would allow Iran to rejoin the global financial system with full legitimacy, so that billions of dollars could begin flowing into the treasury of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its expanding militias across the Middle East. Finally, amid the talks to revive the “nuclear deal,” Iran’s leaders signed a 25-year strategic deal with China. In addition, the Iranian authorities are also engaged in high-level talks with Russia, “in order to help establish stability and combat American interventions.” The Biden administration’s silence in the wake of Iran’s increasing threats and nuclear defiance will only embolden and empower this predatory regime. The Iranian regime clearly believes it can get away with its violations. Instead of “rewarding” this dangerous Islamist regime, the Biden administration needs to take a firm stance and hold the ruling mullahs accountable. Amid talks — between the Iranian regime and France, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, plus Germany as well as indirect talks between the US and Iran — the ruling mullahs of Iran continue to ratchet up their threats and nuclear defiance. Last week, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, announced that Iran would be enriching uranium to 60 percent — a level of enrichment that has no civilian purpose. Now the Iranian regime has begun enriching uranium to its highest level ever, 60 percent, close to weapons-grade level. Iranian leaders also began boasting about this development. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, the speaker of the Iranian parliament wrote: “The young and God-believing Iranian scientists managed to achieve a 60% enriched uranium product… I congratulate the brave nation of Islamic Iran on this success. The Iranian nation’s willpower is miraculous and can defuse any conspiracy.” The Iranian regime also announced that it will be activating more centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear site. Abbas Araqchi, Iran’s chief negotiator at the talks, said that Iran would activate 1,000 advanced centrifuge machines. Now, instead of halting talks amid Iran’s defiance, the Biden administration appears happy that Iran is engaged in discussions. President Joe Biden told reporters in Washington during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga: “We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions — indirect discussions — with us and with our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the [nuclear deal]…”. The Biden administration seems more determined than ever, however, to “reward” Iran’s dangerous and predatory regime by returning to a deal that has sunset clauses, as well as an expiration date after which the mullahs can enrich uranium, spin centrifuges at any level they desire, and make as many nuclear weapons as they like. A return to the 2025 deal would help to lift all major sanctions against Iran — sanctions it took years to put in place. The deal would enable Iran’s military sites to be exempt from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The deal would allow Iran to rejoin the global financial system with full legitimacy, so that billions of dollars could begin flowing into the treasury of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its expanding militias across the Middle East. The deal also disregards that the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) has placed the Iranian regime on the terrorism financing blacklist. The FATF pointed out in its report: “[G]iven Iran’s failure to enact the Palermo and Terrorist Financing Conventions in line with the FATF Standards, the FATF fully lifts the suspension of counter-measures and calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply effective counter-measures…” Ever since President Biden declared that he wanted to resurrect the nuclear deal — which, incidentally, Iran never signed — the Iranian regime has been ratcheting up its threats and nuclear defiance in order to get more “rewards” — evidently for non-compliance — from the Biden administration. First, Iran began increasing uranium enrichment to 20% in January 2021. Then on January 4, in a move that apparently alarmed the US State Department, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seized a South Korean-flagged ship carrying thousands of tons of ethanol in the Persian Gulf, according to Fars News. A US State Department spokesperson noted at the time: “The (Iranian) regime continues to threaten navigational rights and freedoms in the Persian Gulf as part of a clear attempt to extort the international community into relieving the pressure of sanctions. We join the Republic of Korea’s call for Iran to immediately release the tanker.” Later, on January 9, the Iranian parliament passed a law requiring the government to expel the International Atomic Energy Agency’s nuclear inspectors. This week, according to the US Navy, “Revolutionary Guard fast-boats swarmed U.S. Coast Guard vessels in [the] Persian Gulf.” Last September, Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told a forum organized by New York’s Council on Foreign Relations that Iran wants more money. “A sign of good faith is not to try to renegotiate what has already been negotiated,” he said, adding in the same speech that the US must “compensate us for our losses.” Iran’s top judicial body had already demanded that the US pay $130 billion in “damages.” And now the regime is enriching uranium at its highest level ever. The Biden administration has reportedly agreed in principle to the Iranian regime’s demand for compensation over the “economic damage”. Unnamed Israeli diplomats unofficially expressed disappointment over the nuclear negotiations and characterized the talks as “complete American capitulation” to Iran’s leaders. Israeli leaders are apparently seriously concerned that the Biden administration wants to revive the Iran nuclear deal “at all costs”. Finally, amid the talks to revive the “nuclear deal,” Iran’s leaders signed a 25-year strategic deal with China. In addition, the Iranian authorities are also engaged in high-level talks with Russia, “in order to help establish stability and combat American interventions.” The Biden administration’s silence in the wake of Iran’s increasing threats and nuclear defiance will only embolden and empower this predatory regime.

In addition, the Iranian authorities are also engaged in high-level talks with Russia, “in order to help establish stability and combat American interventions.” The Biden administration’s silence in the wake of Iran’s increasing threats and nuclear defiance will only embolden and empower this predatory regime. The Iranian regime clearly believes it can get away with its violations. Instead of “rewarding” this dangerous Islamist regime, the Biden administration needs to take a firm stance and hold the ruling mullahs accountable.

News article:
Florida Senator Marco Rubio is leading a group of 43 Republican senators demanding that President Joe Biden call off nuclear talks with Iran over the country funding Hamas amid the ongoing conflict in Israel. The senators made their demand in a letter sent to Biden on Wednesday. U.S. and Iranian officials have been meeting with the help of European intermediaries in Vienna, Austria to discuss resuming the 2015 nuclear deal that was cancelled by former President Donald Trump, which both the Biden administration and the government of Iran hope to renew. "Over the past couple days, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, who are funded by Iran, have launched a series of rocket attacks into Israel," the senators wrote in the letter. "They are targeting Israeli civilians and cities, including Israel's capital Jerusalem. This is troubling as members of your administration are currently in Vienna negotiating with Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." "The United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran's support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies," they continued. "We call on you to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided." The senators went on to note that the U.S. government has considered Hamas a terrorist organization since the 1990s, while the Iranian government "resoundingly supports" rocket attacks from the group during the current conflict with Israel. They demanded that Biden "unequivocally support Israel's right to defend itself against any and all terrorist attacks." The president "conveyed his unwavering support for Israel's security and for Israel's legitimate right to defend itself and its people" during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, according to a White House readout of the call. The letter to Biden came on the same day that Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, said that any renewal of the deal was dependent on the U.S. "verifiably" lifting sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018. Araghchi said that the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, would "return to full implementation" after the condition was met. Hamas and other militant groups have fired over 1,000 rockets at Israel during three days of conflict. The attacks have killed at least 7 people, including one child. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes aimed at the Palestinian Gaza Strip have killed at least 67 people, including 16 children, according to the Associated Press. Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.

WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 12: US Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) (L) leaves after a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee at Hart Senate Office Building on May 12, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Alex Wong/Getty Images/AFP Washington - Rana Abtar US Republicans on Thursday stepped up calls on President Joe Biden to end talks to return to a nuclear agreement with Iran. In a letter to Biden, Republican senators said that any sanctions relief would let Iran step up funding for Hamas. "We call on you to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided," said the letter led by Senator Marco Rubio and signed by all but six Senate Republicans. "Doing so would demonstrate a firm commitment to our closest ally in the region and to our own security interests." They also pointed to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who “controls” Iran’s negotiating team in Vienna, while Tehran supports terrorism in the world. Republican senators detailed the attacks by Palestinian terrorist groups – more than 1,000 missiles fired at Israel in the past few days. “This includes the first missiles aimed at Jerusalem since 2014,” they reminded the president. “The United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran’s support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies,” the Senators wrote. “In the wake of Hamas’ recent attacks on Israel, the United States should take all necessary measures to hold Tehran accountable and not ease sanctions on Iran under any circumstances,” they wrote. In the same context, a group of US senators sent a letter to the international business community, warning companies against resuming trade with Iran if the Biden administration removes sanctions on Tehran to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal. “Your member companies may see this potential removal of US sanctions on Iran as a lucrative opportunity. Trust us, they should not,” the letter read. “If US sanctions on Iran were temporarily lifted and these firms decided to re-enter the Iranian market, they would be investing in ventures doomed to fail. Any agreement that does not receive the broad and bipartisan support of Congress will not survive if a Republican is elected president in 2024. "Any sanctions relief will also be severely limited if Republicans win back majorities in Congress in 2022,” the group stressed.

News article:
Topic: Biden's Iran Policy Region: Middle East Tags: IranNuclear WeaponsMilitaryFDDIran Nuclear Deal The United States is at an inflection point. Now is the time to reverse course. Iran’s Supreme Leader must be pleased another American president is desperate for a nuclear deal. The United States has all the leverage, yet President Joe Biden is rushing back to the flawed 2015 nuclear agreement, even though Iran cheated from the outset. Instead, Biden should use America’s leverage to secure a deal that puts a permanent end to Tehran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons by dismantling its enrichment program. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan explained earlier this month that the purpose of the ongoing negotiations in Vienna is to determine which “nuclear restrictions Iran will accept on its program to ensure that they can never get a nuclear weapon.” Therein lies the core problem with the accord: it will never prevent an Iranian nuke because instead of prohibiting Iran from enriching uranium and plutonium, it relies on a maze of unenforceable and eventually expiring restrictions to prevent the regime from weaponizing its enrichment program. In light of the numerous concessions Tehran secured as part of the 2015 agreement, zero enrichment may seem like an extraordinary demand. Yet not long ago, zero enrichment was the accepted policy. In 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1696, demanding that the Islamic Republic “suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development.” Despite abandoning that position, former President Barack Obama sold the 2015 nuclear deal as ensuring “that all pathways to a bomb are cut off.” Yet enrichment itself is the pathway to a bomb. Obama touted the constraints the deal imposed on Iran’s nuclear program, yet restrictions on the production of enriched uranium end completely in 2031, less than ten years from now. To ensure Iranian compliance, Obama said, the accord has “the most comprehensive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.” He added, “The bottom line is, if Iran cheats, we can catch them—and we will.” We now know that is not true. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)—the nuclear watchdog responsible for inspections—did not know about Iran’s undeclared nuclear activities until it examined the nuclear archive Israeli agents smuggled out of Iran in 2018. Last month, Tehran began enriching uranium to 60 percent purity, a significant step toward the 90 percent+ level needed for an atomic bomb. There is no legitimate, civilian use for this activity. Also, this level of purity is well above the 3.67 percent envisioned in the 2015 deal. The Vienna negotiations reportedly have not led to an agreement on how Tehran will reverse these nuclear gains, especially whether the advanced centrifuges integral to this level of enrichment will be destroyed, removed from the country, or stored locally. And there is another serious problem. The United States has a policy where it asks its allies to forgo the development of enrichment and reprocessing capabilities before they can receive any support for peaceful nuclear energy programs. This is known as the gold standard and its rationale is simple: these techniques can be used to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. America’s Gulf allies are starting to notice the hypocrisy of the United States asking them to adopt the gold standard while Iran keeps its enrichment program. Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, noted that the UAE agreed to the gold standard in 2008, hoping it would be a model for when the U.S. negotiates with the Islamic Republic. Otaiba explained that the “problem was [U.S.] partners became . . . committed and assured to a gold standard that is safe and secure for nuclear power and [U.S.] adversaries got a better deal.” Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, said in 2018 that if Iran develops nuclear weapons the kingdom would “follow suit as soon as possible.” The most likely path would require Riyadh to develop enrichment or reprocessing technologies. If the UAE and Saudi Arabia pursue uranium enrichment programs, then that could set off an arms race in the Middle East. It is not too late for Biden to reverse course. Tehran’s negotiators have pushed a maximalist position requesting the removal of nearly all sanctions. The Biden administration should walk away and use its significant leverage to push for the “longer and stronger” deal Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised. The best way to make a deal longer and stronger is for it to mandate the elimination of Iran’s enrichment program. That accord could secure the bipartisan support necessary to be ratified as a treaty by the U.S. Senate. That way, it would remain intact during the next Republican administration. Tehran will balk, of course. It will try to convince our European allies to blame the United States for walking away. The Islamic Republic could also respond with military strikes against U.S. troops or allies in the region, but the U.S. has the upper hand militarily and can restore deterrence. Another response would be for Tehran to ramp up its enrichment program. But Iran’s nuclear extortion has an expiration date. The explosions at the Natanz enrichment site show the fragility of the clerical regime’s prized, supposedly secure, asset. The United Kingdom, and perhaps France and Germany, will join a pressure campaign if Iran overplays its hand. A unified or U.S.-UK sanctions campaign will send the Islamic Republic a strong message that it cannot divide America and its allies. Iran will not be able to withstand another unified pressure campaign. Just because it will be difficult to return to a zero enrichment policy doesn’t mean the United States should pursue a limited, flawed agreement instead. The United States is at an inflection point.

The best way to make a deal longer and stronger is for it to mandate the elimination of Iran’s enrichment program. That accord could secure the bipartisan support necessary to be ratified as a treaty by the U.S. Senate. That way, it would remain intact during the next Republican administration. Tehran will balk, of course. It will try to convince our European allies to blame the United States for walking away. The Islamic Republic could also respond with military strikes against U.S. troops or allies in the region, but the U.S. has the upper hand militarily and can restore deterrence. Another response would be for Tehran to ramp up its enrichment program. But Iran’s nuclear extortion has an expiration date. The explosions at the Natanz enrichment site show the fragility of the clerical regime’s prized, supposedly secure, asset. The United Kingdom, and perhaps France and Germany, will join a pressure campaign if Iran overplays its hand. A unified or U.S.-UK sanctions campaign will send the Islamic Republic a strong message that it cannot divide America and its allies. Iran will not be able to withstand another unified pressure campaign. Just because it will be difficult to return to a zero enrichment policy doesn’t mean the United States should pursue a limited, flawed agreement instead. The United States is at an inflection point. Now is the time to reverse course.

News article:
Topic: Biden's Iran Policy Region: Middle East Tags: IranNuclear WeaponsMilitaryFDDIran Nuclear Deal The United States is at an inflection point. Now is the time to reverse course. Iran’s Supreme Leader must be pleased another American president is desperate for a nuclear deal. The United States has all the leverage, yet President Joe Biden is rushing back to the flawed 2015 nuclear agreement, even though Iran cheated from the outset. Instead, Biden should use America’s leverage to secure a deal that puts a permanent end to Tehran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons by dismantling its enrichment program. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan explained earlier this month that the purpose of the ongoing negotiations in Vienna is to determine which “nuclear restrictions Iran will accept on its program to ensure that they can never get a nuclear weapon.” Therein lies the core problem with the accord: it will never prevent an Iranian nuke because instead of prohibiting Iran from enriching uranium and plutonium, it relies on a maze of unenforceable and eventually expiring restrictions to prevent the regime from weaponizing its enrichment program. In light of the numerous concessions Tehran secured as part of the 2015 agreement, zero enrichment may seem like an extraordinary demand. Yet not long ago, zero enrichment was the accepted policy. In 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1696, demanding that the Islamic Republic “suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development.” Despite abandoning that position, former President Barack Obama sold the 2015 nuclear deal as ensuring “that all pathways to a bomb are cut off.” Yet enrichment itself is the pathway to a bomb. Obama touted the constraints the deal imposed on Iran’s nuclear program, yet restrictions on the production of enriched uranium end completely in 2031, less than ten years from now. To ensure Iranian compliance, Obama said, the accord has “the most comprehensive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.” He added, “The bottom line is, if Iran cheats, we can catch them—and we will.” We now know that is not true. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)—the nuclear watchdog responsible for inspections—did not know about Iran’s undeclared nuclear activities until it examined the nuclear archive Israeli agents smuggled out of Iran in 2018. Last month, Tehran began enriching uranium to 60 percent purity, a significant step toward the 90 percent+ level needed for an atomic bomb. There is no legitimate, civilian use for this activity. Also, this level of purity is well above the 3.67 percent envisioned in the 2015 deal. The Vienna negotiations reportedly have not led to an agreement on how Tehran will reverse these nuclear gains, especially whether the advanced centrifuges integral to this level of enrichment will be destroyed, removed from the country, or stored locally. And there is another serious problem. The United States has a policy where it asks its allies to forgo the development of enrichment and reprocessing capabilities before they can receive any support for peaceful nuclear energy programs. This is known as the gold standard and its rationale is simple: these techniques can be used to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. America’s Gulf allies are starting to notice the hypocrisy of the United States asking them to adopt the gold standard while Iran keeps its enrichment program. Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, noted that the UAE agreed to the gold standard in 2008, hoping it would be a model for when the U.S. negotiates with the Islamic Republic. Otaiba explained that the “problem was [U.S.] partners became . . . committed and assured to a gold standard that is safe and secure for nuclear power and [U.S.] adversaries got a better deal.” Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, said in 2018 that if Iran develops nuclear weapons the kingdom would “follow suit as soon as possible.” The most likely path would require Riyadh to develop enrichment or reprocessing technologies. If the UAE and Saudi Arabia pursue uranium enrichment programs, then that could set off an arms race in the Middle East. It is not too late for Biden to reverse course. Tehran’s negotiators have pushed a maximalist position requesting the removal of nearly all sanctions. The Biden administration should walk away and use its significant leverage to push for the “longer and stronger” deal Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised. The best way to make a deal longer and stronger is for it to mandate the elimination of Iran’s enrichment program. That accord could secure the bipartisan support necessary to be ratified as a treaty by the U.S. Senate. That way, it would remain intact during the next Republican administration.

News article:
Iranians will go to the polls to pick a new president on 18 June. Registration will formally start next week, with nearly two dozen individuals already declaring their intention to run, and over a dozen more expressing interest or being deemed potential candidates. Among the possible contenders is Brig. Gen (ret.) Hossein Dehghan, the former defence minister-turned advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Dehghan served as defence minister between 2013 and 2017 during President Hassan Rouhani’s first term. In recent media interviews, the retired commander has warned about the risks of a tactical conflict with the US escalating into a full-scale war, and stressed that Tehran was “not after negotiations for the sake of negotiations”. He added that Tehran would not rest until all forces from the US “terror state” were expelled from the Middle East in retaliation for the 3 January 2020 drone strike assassination of IRGC commander Qasem Soleimani. Saeed Mohammad, a second brigadier general in the IRGC and former head of the IRGC-controlled Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarter engineering firm, has also announced his intention to run. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the populist conservative who served as president of Iran between 2005 and 2013, has yet to formally express plans to run in the 2021 elections, but has consistently ranked number one among prospective voters in a range of informal polling, pulling in up to 47 percent support in polls carried out between October 2020 and April 2021, far above the 6-11 percent support for Ebrahim Raisi, a conservative Muslim cleric who presently serves as Iran’s chief justice.

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani takes part in a news conference near the United Nations General Assembly in the Manhattan borough of New York, US, September 22, 2016. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/Files London, Tehran - Asharq Al-Awsat Iran opened on Tuesday the door for candidacies for the upcoming presidential vote, amid differences between President Hassan Rouhani on one hand, and the Guardian Council on the other over the conditions for running for the elections. On Monday, Rouhani rejected the decision of the Guardian Council to study the candidates’ applications and ordered Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli to work in accordance with the current laws. “The requirements of the Ministry of Interior must be implemented within the framework of the law and the instructions of the Presidency of the Republic,” the president said in a letter addressed to Fazli. The Guardian Council has specified, however, that “all nominees must be between 40 and 70 years of age, hold at least a master’s degree or its equivalent, have experience of at least four years in managerial posts... and have no criminal record”, according to Iran’s state-run Press TV, as reported by AFP. The new terms come in implementation of a 2016 directive from Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei for the council to clarify and “determine” the requirements. According to the council, the amendment has been passed on to the interior ministry, which will receive nominations from May 11-15 before submitting them to the vetting body. The updated requirements are likely to exclude some well-known figures, such as Rouhani’s telecom minister, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, who is 39, or the elite Revolutionary Guards’ Saeed Mohammad, whose rank is below major general. Former candidate Mohammad Gharazi, a 79-year-old ex-minister, would also be ruled out, as well as senior reformist figure Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was jailed during Iran’s 2009 protests, because of a conviction the following year. The increasing number of Revolutionary Guard generals who have announced their candidacy or are likely to be intending to compete in the presidential race, have raised fears of the “militarization” of the political circle within the Iranian regime, according to AFP.

News article:
Conservative hardliner Ebrahim Raisi has registered as a candidate in Iran's presidential elections which he is favored to win, potentially complicating talks between President Joe Biden and the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program. Biden wants to restore the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) struck between Tehran and Washington, DC in 2015 which promised Tehran economic incentives for curbing its nuclear program. Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump scuppered the deal, reimposing heavy sanctions to try to strongarm Tehran into new talks. Ongoing talks in Vienna between Tehran and the P4 + 1 group of countries has revived hopes of both a new nuclear deal as well as a rapprochement between Iran and the United States. However, Raisi, who currently heads the judiciary, had previously taken aim at the terms of the nuclear deal struck by incumbent Hassan Rouhani, who is constitutionally barred from running for president again. During the 2017 presidential campaign he lost, Raisi criticized Rouhani's "weak efforts" in negotiating the JCPOA, according to the Arab Weekly. The publication also reported that Raisi has the support of a wide range of conservatives and hardliners, who want to expand Iran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, Raisi's background as a hardline judge has raised concerns among reformists and rights groups. In the 1980s, he was among judges who imposed death penalties on thousands of political prisoners, Reuters reported. Raisi is a former attorney general and custodian of the Astan Quds Razavi which manages the Imam Reza shrine and was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2019 for human rights violations. Moves to broker an agreement on Iran's nuclear program comes amid a more positive attitude towards the U.S. in Iran since Biden took office. A survey by IranPoll in conjunction with the University of Maryland CISSM in February found a majority (51 percent) of Iranians approved of the JCPOA, compared with only 44 percent in October 2020. However, a clear majority (69 percent) said that Iran should not get involved in nuclear talks until the U.S. returns to the JCPOA and fulfills its obligations. Only 28 percent agreed that Tehran should immediately pursue a new nuclear agreement in talks with the United States. Raisi promoted his domestic policy credentials in his statement on Saturday, saying that focus of his candidacy would be to "fight poverty, corruption, humiliation and discrimination." "I have come as an independent to the stage to make changes in the executive management of the country," he added, according to Reuters. On Saturday, Ali Larijani, a former adviser to the supreme leader also signed up for the election on June 18 in which over 59 million people are eligible to vote. But there is expected to be a low turnout due to economic problems, international isolation, and a lack of basic freedoms, the Atlantic Council said this month. Analysis for the think tank by Shahin Milani said that it was uncertain whether the president would even have a "material impact" on Iran's domestic of foreign policy. "The presidency of the Islamic Republic is not as important or politically relevant as foreign observers might believe it to be," the piece said.

News article:
Khamenei’s hidden hand in Iran’s presidential vote Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei holds a remote meeting with students in Tehran. (File/AFP) Short Url https://arab.news/8zrn6 Iran’s election in June will determine not only the next president, but possibly also who will succeed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Khamenei, who came to power in 1989, is the second-longest serving ruler in Iran in the past century, behind only Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who was in power from 1941 until the revolution of 1979. He is the longest-serving head of government in the Middle East. Given that he is 81 years old and suffers from several health problems, it is realistic to argue that he is considering who his successor will be. Grooming a political or religious figure to become the next supreme leader will ensure a smooth transition of power when Khamenei dies. The position of supreme leader is critical for the survival of the Islamic Republic and the continuation of the revolutionary concept of Ayatollah Khomeini — Velayat-e Faqih, or “guardianship of the Islamic jurist.” Whoever holds the position has the final say on Iran’s domestic and foreign policy and has significant control over the legislative, executive and judicial systems. In addition, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and intelligence service — the most powerful political and economic apparatuses in the country — report only to the supreme leader, who also has the authority to hand-pick military commanders as the chief of Iran’s military institutions. The supreme leader controls the bonyad charitable trusts (which control a significant part of Iran’s gross domestic product) and the Setad organization (the headquarters for executing the orders of the imam, which is worth more than $90 billion). The supreme leader dictates how the nation’s resources are spent, with a focus on exporting Iran’s revolutionary ideals and support for proxies and militia groups across the Middle East. Although Khamenei, high-level clerics from the Guardian Council and the Assembly of Experts, and the senior cadre of the IRGC are probably already secretly discussing who will be the next supreme leader, discussing it publicly is considered taboo. Tradition reveals that the position of president can be a crucial stepping stone when it comes to succeeding the supreme leader. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh The position of president can be a crucial stepping stone to succeeding the supreme leader. When Khomeini died in 1989, Khamenei was Iran’s sitting president. Even though the constitution states that the supreme leader should be elected by the Assembly of Experts, the former incumbent most probably selects his successor. For example, according to the late former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Khomeini chose Khamenei to be his successor. The regime even changed the constitution so that Khamenei qualified and Khomeini’s wish could be fulfilled. This partially explains why Khamenei has increased his interventions in the presidential election. He has even told the grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Hassan Khomeini, not to run. The reformist political camp in Iran was reportedly intending to introduce Hassan Khomeini as its candidate. But Yasser Khomeini, brother of Hassan, declared: “The revolution’s supreme leader considered that Hassan Khomeini’s candidacy in the election was not appropriate. He expressed that he counts Hassan as his son, asking him not to enter this field in such circumstances.” The Guardian Council, which has the ultimate power over who runs for the presidency, has also significantly narrowed its terms for qualification. It has barred anyone older than 75 and younger than 40 from running. Even President Hassan Rouhani criticized the Guardian Council for introducing such restrictive rules, and said it had no legal right to do so. The new age restrictions prevent potential candidates such as 39-year-old Mohammed-Javad Azari Jahromi, the minister of information and communications technology, and 80-year-old Mohammed Gharazi, the former minister of petroleum, from standing in the election. To fulfill Khamenei’s demands, the Guardian Council will also probably disqualify figures such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president from 2005 to 2013, or anyone else the supreme leader disapproves of. The council also imposed new rules barring anyone with a criminal conviction or a lack of managerial experience from running in the election. As a result, people such as the reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was jailed in 2009, cannot be a presidential candidate. It is worth noting that, when Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he might run for president, the Guardian Council would have had difficulty disqualifying him because of his current position. However, the leaking of a controversial audio tape of Zarif resolved that issue as Khamenei publicly criticized him. Zarif subsequently announced that he would not be running. It is because the position of president can be seen as a stepping stone to succeeding the supreme leader that Khamenei and his inner circle are escalating their interventions in the election.

News article:
Khamenei’s hidden hand in Iran’s presidential vote Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei holds a remote meeting with students in Tehran. (File/AFP) Short Url https://arab.news/8zrn6 Iran’s election in June will determine not only the next president, but possibly also who will succeed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Khamenei, who came to power in 1989, is the second-longest serving ruler in Iran in the past century, behind only Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who was in power from 1941 until the revolution of 1979. He is the longest-serving head of government in the Middle East. Given that he is 81 years old and suffers from several health problems, it is realistic to argue that he is considering who his successor will be. Grooming a political or religious figure to become the next supreme leader will ensure a smooth transition of power when Khamenei dies. The position of supreme leader is critical for the survival of the Islamic Republic and the continuation of the revolutionary concept of Ayatollah Khomeini — Velayat-e Faqih, or “guardianship of the Islamic jurist.” Whoever holds the position has the final say on Iran’s domestic and foreign policy and has significant control over the legislative, executive and judicial systems. In addition, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and intelligence service — the most powerful political and economic apparatuses in the country — report only to the supreme leader, who also has the authority to hand-pick military commanders as the chief of Iran’s military institutions. The supreme leader controls the bonyad charitable trusts (which control a significant part of Iran’s gross domestic product) and the Setad organization (the headquarters for executing the orders of the imam, which is worth more than $90 billion). The supreme leader dictates how the nation’s resources are spent, with a focus on exporting Iran’s revolutionary ideals and support for proxies and militia groups across the Middle East. Although Khamenei, high-level clerics from the Guardian Council and the Assembly of Experts, and the senior cadre of the IRGC are probably already secretly discussing who will be the next supreme leader, discussing it publicly is considered taboo. Tradition reveals that the position of president can be a crucial stepping stone when it comes to succeeding the supreme leader. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh The position of president can be a crucial stepping stone to succeeding the supreme leader. When Khomeini died in 1989, Khamenei was Iran’s sitting president. Even though the constitution states that the supreme leader should be elected by the Assembly of Experts, the former incumbent most probably selects his successor. For example, according to the late former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Khomeini chose Khamenei to be his successor. The regime even changed the constitution so that Khamenei qualified and Khomeini’s wish could be fulfilled. This partially explains why Khamenei has increased his interventions in the presidential election. He has even told the grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Hassan Khomeini, not to run. The reformist political camp in Iran was reportedly intending to introduce Hassan Khomeini as its candidate.

News article:
London, Tehran - Asharq Al-Awsat Reformists in Iran are at a critical crossroads of either backing the country’s First-Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri or former Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani in upcoming presidential elections. Larijani had distanced himself from conservatives after supporting the cleric-led country’s nuclear deal with world powers. On Monday, Iran’s Guardian Council, which is charged with interpreting the constitution and supervising elections, kicked off intensified meetings to review the applications of those willing to run in the presidential race slated for June 18. Guardian Council Spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei said that the Council would examine 40 out of about 600 applications submitted to the Iranian Interior Ministry in the last five days. A few hours after the candidates’ requests were studied, Islah-Press reported on Telegram that the Council refused to approve Expediency Council secretary and ex-commander of Revolutionary Guards General Mohsen Rezai. According to Islah-Press, another presidential hopeful refused by the Council was Gen. Saeed Muhammad, who is the executive director and second brigadier general in the Revolutionary Guard and commander of its economic branch, “Khatam-al Anbiya Construction.” Kadkhodaei rushed to deny the rumors in a statement published on the Council’s official website. In the statement, Kadkhodaei urged Iranians to ignore unverified news circulated by the media and hinted that those leaking information about candidacies before their official approval would be pursued by the judiciary. Iranian reformist Mohammed Ali Abtahi told the Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) that the “tsunami” of filed presidential bids last Saturday confused all equations, especially conservatives backing Ebrahim Raisi before Saeed Jalili entered the election scene. It is worth noting that Jalili is an advisor to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Abtahi called for “upholding the constitution” in approving the candidacy of presidential runners from both political currents. “Participation is at risk,” Abtahi warned, explaining that voter turnout affects both reformists and conservatives.

News article:
TEHRAN: Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday urged Iranians to ignore calls to boycott next month’s presidential election, after several hopefuls were barred from running against ultraconservative candidates. Iranians are set to elect a successor to President Hassan Rouhani on June 18 amid widespread discontent over a deep economic and social crisis. The exiled opposition has for months run a campaign on social media networks calling on Iranians to stay away from the polls, using hashtags in Persian such as #NototheIslamicRepublic. “Do not pay attention to those who are campaigning and saying it is useless to go to the polls and that one should not go to the polls,” Khamenei told lawmakers in a speech via videoconference, according to his official Instagram account. His declaration comes a day after Rouhani said he had asked the supreme leader to intervene to ensure greater “competition” in the presidential election. Iran’s candidate-vetting Guardian Council on Tuesday approved seven mainly ultraconservative hopefuls to run in the election and disqualified moderate conservative Ali Larijani. The council — a conservative-dominated, unelected body — also barred firebrand former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Its decision appears to clear the way for a strong run by ultraconservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi. Rouhani is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term. A record 57 percent of Iranians stayed away from legislative elections in February last year after thousands of candidates, many of them moderates and reformists, were disqualified. The poll comes at a critical time for Iran amid talks with world powers aimed at reviving a nuclear deal that has been on life support since former US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018.

During a virtual session with Iranian MPs on Thursday, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei defended the Guardian Council decision to exclude a spate of moderates — including Ali Larijani — from the presidential election on June 18. The Guardian Council has the prerogative to vet all candidates based on their ideological stance and loyalty to Iran's political order. Council members not only excluded former parliamentary speaker Larijani, but also acting Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri. The decision sparked fierce criticism, especially on social media. Ali Larijani has been squeezed out of the presidential race Image: picture-alliance/AP Photo/V. Salemi In a letter to Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday urged a rethink on the mater. According to news agency AFP, Rouhani stressed that "at its heart, elections are about competition; if you take that away, they are like a corpse." Sadiq Larijani defends brother The radical move was also condemned by Ali Larijani's brother Sadiq Larijani, who has served on the Guardian Council since 2001, and headed Iran's judicial system between 2009 and 2019. Ali Larijani was the moderate candidate thought to have the best chances of succeeding President Rouhani. Sadiq Larijani took to Twitter to complain that his brother had been disqualified "based on false information from the secret service." Indeed, rumors have circulated that Ali Larijani's daughter Fatemeh has emigrated to the US. Apparently she does not, however, possess US citizenship, which would have disqualified her father from the presidential race. Sadiq Larijani, meanwhile, asserts "falsehoods" had been deliberately spread among the Guardian Council to discredit his brother. Reformists squeezed out of race Iran's Guardian Council is comprised of twelve members. Six members ― all Islamic clerics ― are appointed by supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The remaining six are lawyers, suggested by the head of Iran's judiciary and approved by parliament. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei can appoint and dismiss six members of the powerful Guardian Council Image: Irna One of the candidates running for the presidency is Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi. With Larijani gone, his chances have risen substantially. "Larijani's surprising disqualification will have far-reaching consequences," Iran analysist Ali Afshari told DW's Farsi service. Afshari, who lives in US exile, was a supporter of Iran's more reform-oriented forces. He was arrested on several occasions and sentenced to jailtime, most recently in 2005, when he called for an election boycott after the Guardian Council disqualified moderates from running. Afshari said Larijani's disqualification dashes all hope that elections will help reform Iran's political system. It showed, he told DW, that "the heart of Iran's political system, overseen by its religious leader, expects complete loyalty and does not tolerate criticism." Too outspoken? Ali Larijani's rejection illustrates just how intolerant the Guardian Council is of dissenting views. It's all the more surprising in light of Larijani's background. His father is late Grand Ayatollah Haj Mirza Hashem Amoli, after all. Moreover, Larijani is married to the daughter of influential Shia scholar Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari. He is also an aide to Khamenei, albeit not a member of his close circle. "This is primarily because he never spoke out against opposition figures Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi, who were placed under house arrest in 2010," Afshari told DW. Larijani also "openly criticized Ebrahim Raisi and members of the Revolutionary Guard."

Ali Fathollah-Nedschad, a political scientist and Iran expert, told DW that by excluding moderate candidates like Larijani, Iran is headed for a sham election that is even less believable than previous polls. With a hardline president in office, he said, Iran's hardline Revolutionary Guards would gain yet more influence in the country. This, by extension, would also enhance their impact on the economy. Iran's hardliners are looking to take over all power in Iran — regardless of how disappointed the electorate is, or how low voter turnout will be, for that matter.

Embed from Getty Images The decision by Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, not to interfere with the “Guardian Council” decision and to keep the list of the presidential candidates intact, guarantees the election of a conservative candidate for president of Iran. Hassan Rouhani’s presidency seems to have sharpened the understanding of how well a president who is familiar with Iran’s political system – especially one supported by Rouhani such as Ali Larigny – can be a “bone in the throat” that could impede significant moves the leader is seeking to promote, especially preparing the ground for selecting his successor. The role of president in Iran is not symbolic or negligible in Iranian politics. Although it is Iran’s leader who makes the vast majority of strategic decisions in the country, the president who heads the government, thus allowing the supreme leader to address the more significant issues (in his view) and especially the spiritual guidance of his Shi’ite loyalists. Sometimes the fact that the president did not come from classical conservative circles (such as Khatami, Ahmadinejad, and certainly Rouhani) enabled Khamenei to roll the blame on the president regarding Iran’s problems. However, the upcoming Iranian presidential elections to be held on June 18th are unusual. Although Iran’s supreme leader could overturn the decisions of the Guardian Council (which aims to “screen” disloyal candidates ), he preferred not to intervene in this decision. Thus, the fact that there are only conservative candidate will significantly increase the alienation between the Iranian regime and the population. In addition, the Iranian leader will find it difficult to find a non-conservative “scapegoat” to pin the blame on the state of the Iranian economy, for example. However, Khamenei seems willing to take the risk because of the fact that these elections are crucial for the question of Khamenei’s successor. Khamenei is 81, has been suffering from cancer for years and talk of possible candidates to replace him has begun to proliferate in recent years. Khamenei assume that In order to ensure an inheritance process in which his candidate is elected, he must place conservative candidates at the main decision points in Iran. Thus, it seems that in the upcoming presidential elections, Ibrahim Raisi, head of Iran’s judiciary, who is supposed to be the next leader or at the very least promote the candidacy of Khamenei’s candidacy (his son MUjtaba, or another conservative candidate) will probably win. One main reason behind the regime’s decision to prevent a “moderate conservative” candidate from being presented is related to the concerns that another loss by Raisi (like in the 2017 elections) would cause him to lose all public legitimacy to replace Khamenei, severely undermining the legitimacy of the conservatives and even Khamenei himself, who did not hide his support for him. Advertisement In addition, Khamenei may be concerned that as he gets older, his abilities to withstand the surge of attempts by Rouhani and his men to get closer to the West are weakening, so he must make sure that, in the long term, the Islamic revolution will not change its nature. As for Israel, this is supposedly excellent news, Raisi’s election prevents any thoughts in the West about a possible change taking place in Iran, determines the regime’s dogmatic view, and strengthens those who oppose any contact with Tehran. In addition, it is important to note that Khamenei’s conduct increases dissatisfaction among the population in Iran, and along with the dire economic situation, the chances of renewed demonstrations in the country increase. On the other hand, it is important to note that Raisi’s expected election and the expected weakening of the moderate camp ensures that Iran will continue its dogmatic policy vis-à-vis Israel, And even escalating its actions in a way that could lead the two countries into an inevitable confrontation.the fact that there will be no one in the Iranian leadership who can stand against the IRGC deeply troubling and could lead Iran to make more “courageous” decisions. Bottom line, Khamenei’s desire to dominate Iran’s political system before the twilight of his rule has pushed him not to interfere in the Guardian Council’s decision, and to leave the presidential elections to conservative candidates only. This decision will help Israel in its massaging campaign against Iran, but without proper Checks and balances in the Iranian leadership, the chances of direct confrontation between Israel and Iran are increasing.

Iran regime doing all it can to ensure Raisi becomes president Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Iranian Presidential candidate Ebrahim Raisi speaks during a campaign meeting at the Mosalla mosque in Tehran, Iran, May 16, 2017. (Reuters) Short Url https://arab.news/mvdsr In spite of the Iranian regime’s claims that it holds democratic presidential elections, the system is fundamentally an authoritarian one disguised as a democracy. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in February boasted about the regime’s political system and the people’s important role in influencing and shaping the political establishment. He said: “The Islamic revolution transformed the rule of a country from a despotic monarchy into a popular, democratic republic run by the people. Today, the nation of Iran rules over its own destiny. It is the people who choose. They may make a right choice or a wrong choice, but it is they who choose. This is very important.” But the reality is that ordinary people do not run the system in Iran and they have little to no influence in choosing who runs the country. To make it clear, the supreme leader is not an elected individual. How can a country be democratic, as Khamenei claims, when people cannot choose the overall leader, who enjoys the final say over the nation’s domestic and foreign policy issues and who is the chief of Iran’s military institutions, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), its elite branch the Quds Force, and the paramilitary group the Basij? Since the unelected supreme leader appoints the IRGC’s senior generals and the head of the judiciary, the regime’s military and judicial apparatuses also have a distinctly undemocratic character. What remains to be examined in the system are the positions of the president and the parliamentarians. Article 6 of Iran’s constitution stipulates: “In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the country’s affairs must be administered by reliance on the public vote, and through elections. These will include the election of the president, the deputies of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the members of the councils, and other such institutions, or through a referendum in such instances as are determined in other articles of this document.” But the Iranian regime has a solution to circumvent this: By presenting a facade of democratic elections while effectively eliminating people’s influence in choosing their president and members of the parliament. This is carried out by the regime’s clerical body, the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council is an unelected body of 12 officials, six of whom are appointed directly by the supreme leader and six indirectly. The latter six are nominated by the head of the judiciary, who is himself appointed by the supreme leader. The Guardian Council has a history of arbitrarily disqualifying reform-minded candidates, women and those who are perceived as disloyal to the principles of the state and the Islamic revolution from running for office. The authority to do so is granted by the constitution, which states: “The qualifications of the candidates for presidency, with respect to the conditions set forth by the constitution, must be confirmed by the Guardian Council prior to the general elections and approved by the leader for the first term.” As a result, people only get to choose between a few individuals selected by the regime. Despite this, Khamenei last month insisted that Iran’s elections are flawless, saying: “All elections held by the Islamic Republic have been totally flawless. There might have been certain issues and offenses, but none of them had a significant impact on the result of elections. Those who raise fraud claims do so because of being defeated.” Of course, it should not come as a surprise that, from the perspective of Iran’s supreme leader, the elections are flawless, as he can pick the candidates he wants to be president. Anyone who might have had a chance of defeating Khamenei’s pick for president has been disqualified. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh For this year’s presidential election, which will take place on June 18, the regime has disqualified anyone who might have had a chance of defeating Ebrahim Raisi, who is Khamenei’s pick for president. The Guardian Council has even disqualified top regime insiders such as Ali Larijani, not because it questions their loyalty to the supreme leader and the revolutionary ideals of the Islamic Republic, but simply because Khamenei seems to want someone else to be president of Iran this time. The regime is cognizant of the fact that Raisi is extremely unpopular in Iran — he lost the previous election to the so-called moderate Hassan Rouhani by a landslide. Rouhani received about 23.5 million of the 41 million votes cast, while Raisi received 15.7 million. This time around, the regime does not want to risk Raisi suffering another defeat. For one thing, Khamenei is 82 years old and it is believed that he sees Raisi as the perfect cleric to succeed him. In addition, at these critical times, when people’s frustration toward the regime has reached its peak, the hard-liners not only want to control the judicial and legislative branches, but also the presidential office. Khamenei and the senior cadre of the IRGC believe they can suppress opposition more effectively and end the growing power struggle between the moderates and the hard-liners by having control of all branches of the Islamic Republic. In a nutshell, the Iranian regime is paving the way for Khamenei’s pick, Raisi, to become the next president. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is a Harvard-educated Iranian-American political scientist.

News article:
Saeed Mohammad, a former Revolutionary Guards general, registers as a candidate for the presidential election at the Interior Ministry, in Tehran, Iran May 11, 2021. WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS Asharq Al-Awsat Iran's supreme leader urged voters on Wednesday to turn out in large numbers for the June 18 presidential election, saying such a show of strength would reduce foreign pressure on the country. Two hardliners and one moderate quit the field of seven officially permitted candidates on Wednesday, leaving what is shaping into a straightforward contest between the hardline head of the judiciary and a moderate former head of the central bank. Judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, 60, an ally of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, is widely tipped as the favorite to succeed Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist stepping down after two terms. "In less than 48 hours, a crucial event will take place in the country... By your presence and vote, you actually determine the fate of the country, in all major issues," Khamenei said in a televised speech. Under Iran's ruling system, the supreme leader has the final say over state affairs, while the elected president governs the country day-to-day. Last month, the hardline Guardian Council disqualified several prominent moderate and conservative candidates, leaving a field dominated by hardliners, with Abdolnasser Hemmati, who stood down as central bank chief to run, as Raisi's main moderate challenger. Wednesday's announcement that former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and hardline lawmaker Alireza Zakani had dropped out will help consolidate the hardline vote behind Raisi. Moderate Mohsen Mehralizadeh also stood aside in a boost for Hemmati. Two other hardline candidates remain on the ballot, though they could step aside or back Raisi before Friday's vote. The restricted field may further dim the clerical establishment's hopes of a high turnout amid growing popular frustration over economic hardship and political restrictions. Some prominent pro-reform politicians in Iran and activists abroad have called for an election boycott, and the hashtag #NoToIslamicRepublic has been widely tweeted by Iranians inside and outside the country in the past weeks. Official opinion polls suggest turnout could be as low as 41%, significantly lower than in past elections. The election comes as Iran is negotiating in Vienna with world powers to revive a 2015 deal under which it agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions. US President Joe Biden hopes to revive the agreement, which his predecessor Donald Trump abandoned. Although the agreement was a signature achievement of outgoing president Rouhani, the election is not expected to have a major impact on Iran's negotiating position, which is set by Khamenei. But a strong mandate for Raisi could strengthen Khamenei's hand at home, and affect the search for an eventual successor to the 82-year-old supreme leader, in power for 32 years. "If the new president is elected by a significant majority of the votes, he will be a powerful president and can carry out great tasks," Khamenei said. "If we have a fall in the election turnout, we will have an increase of pressure from our enemies."

He then served as deputy chief justice and as attorney general before he assumed his current post as Chief Justice of Iran, a position he was slammed for primarily because of the multiple allegations of human rights abuses and the repression of dissidents. Now, many are worried that if he ends up winning the race, the repression will only get worse. Change Is Nowhere Near In Israel, authorities are also watching the developments in Iran with great interest. For them, whoever comes to power in Tehran is an indication of the route the Islamic Republic will be taking on matters pertaining to its nuclear programme, which the Jewish state views as the prime threat to its security. But Dr. Raz Zimmt, a research fellow at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies and one of the leading experts on Iran, says the election of Raisi will not change much for Iran, the Jewish state, the region or the world. "Most responsibilities in Iran belong to the Supreme Leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - ed.], so the President, even if a more pragmatic one is elected, will not be able to change much". Iran has witnessed that in the past eight years, during the tenure of current President Hassan Rouhani, believed to be a rather reformist politician. Internationally, his name has been associated with attempts to solve Tehran's nuclear issue and rescue the economy from the suffocating impact of Western sanctions. In domestic affairs, he has been linked to the attempts to allow civilian freedoms. But those efforts have been largely unfruitful due to the fierce opposition of the conservative establishment. And with Raisi in power, that hardline approach is only expected to grow. "Domestically, we might see even more repression. Raisi's approach is similar to that of Khamenei and that means that we will not see a change in the status quo when it comes to social media or civil society." Nor will there be a change in Iran's foreign policy, especially vis-a-vis the attitude towards the US and the West or around its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile system, believes the expert. And this means that Tehran's atomic programme will go on, despite the various reservations of the international community. In the West, Israel and the Gulf, some are concerned that Iran is developing weapons of mass destruction under the pretext of a civilian nuclear programme, allegations that Iran has repeatedly denied. Western powers, including the US, are currently leading a series of negotiations with Iran in Vienna, with the aim to resume the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that Washington left unilaterally in 2018 and that would allow the West to supervise Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. An Opportunity for Israel? If Raisi comes to power, Zimmt warns that those negotiations could become even more challenging, given his hardline approach on the issue. "For Raisi, the top priority is to steer the country through its economic crisis. But his approach is different than that of Rouhani. Whereas the current President wanted to remove Western sanctions through expanding Iran's relations with Europe, Russia and China, Raisi will avoid pushing the country towards the West and is likely to encourage domestic industry instead." For the West, such an Iranian approach could mean that its relations with the Islamic Republic could go back to square one. But for Israel, says Zimmt, that stance of Raisi could present an opportunity. "If Raisi comes to power, it might be easier for Israel to mobilise the international community against Iran, just as it was during the tenure of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But if the nuclear deal is reached, the amount of pressure applied will be significantly lower than what we saw back then."

News article:
Topic: Iran Region: Middle East Tags: IranIran ElectionsAli KhameneiIRGCEbrahim RaisiJCPOA Rushing to rejoin the JCPOA won’t change the forces that drive Iran’s nuclear program and underpin the totality of its malign behavior. But increasing economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and attention to its direct responsibility for immeasurable suffering can. Iranian elections routinely prompt politicians and the media to speculate over whether “moderates” or “hardliners” will win control, as if the Iranian people have real choices. Anti-regime Iranians need not apply. At the end of the day, Iran’s presidents have limited ability to enact their own agendas. After all, it is the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei who sets the tone and direction of foreign and domestic policy. While he has not always been impervious to public demands for reform, Ayatollah Khamenei strongly favors a trajectory based on increasing domestic repression and confrontation with the United States, and his vision has consistently won out. This year, 592 Iranians registered to run for the presidency, but when the polls open this week, there will be just seven pre-screened and hand-selected pro-regime candidates on the ballot, including no moderates or reformists of significant national stature. Regardless of who wins, they will maintain Iran’s state sponsorship of terrorism, domestic repression, and nuclear program, as the ostensible “moderate” Hassan Rouhani did for eight years. This year, the regime has gone a step further by working to all but guarantee victory for the Supreme Leader’s preferred candidate, Ebrahim Raisi. Ayatollah Khamenei is backing Raisi—often described as a potential successor to the supreme leader—because he must preserve the regime and secure the tools for a smooth transition of power. Nothing is being left to chance, especially after Raisi’s first bid ended in a humiliating defeat in 2017, failing to garner 40 percent of the vote. The Guardian Council, a regime-aligned body that can approve or exclude candidates for office, even disqualified top regime insiders like Ali Larijani from running. In past years, Larijani’s resume of more than a decade in public life as speaker of parliament and advisor to Khamenei would have made him a formidable candidate. But he’s not a future supreme leader, and nothing is being left to chance. The regime has rigged the outcome by purging all viable rivals to Raisi, and the ultraconservative cleric will most assuredly take office. If polling is accurate, most eligible Iranians are signaling their disgust with the nakedly transparent power grab by boycotting the proceedings altogether. Raisi’s coronation is bad news for Iranians and the international community. Raisi will undoubtedly continue Khamenei’s domestic brutality, as he has been at the forefront of meting out Islamic Republic-style “justice” during his decades of service in the judiciary. Raisi ran for president—and lost—during the last round of elections in 2017 because of his involvement in the extrajudicial executions of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. And since his installment as chief justice of Iran’s judiciary, human rights violations; extensive prison terms; and torture against dissidents, political prisoners, and religious minorities have increased. What was disqualifying for Raisi at the polls just four years ago is today seen as an asset. A Raisi presidency will also mean continued support for terrorist organizations and proxy wars in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. It will mean that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, will continue to consolidate its grip on power. The IRGC already controls large swaths of the Iranian economy through front companies, benefits financially from the sale of petroleum and petrochemicals abroad, leads Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria, trains Hamas terrorists, and controls a growing share of the Iranian nuclear program. Iran’s hardline clergy has formed an unholy alliance with the IRGC in recent years to ensure its primacy within the Iranian system, and the IRGC knows it can count on Raisi to protect its economic empire. To be clear, the rise of Raisi’s political stock has nothing to do with U.S. or European policies and everything to do with the regime’s need to sustain its grip on power. We are simply not that influential so as to determine the ebbs and flows of regime politics. But that doesn’t mean we are powerless to stymie the Khamenei-Raisi alliance. It is not hyperbole to assert that the negotiators representing Tehran in talks with the United States, Europe, China, and Russia do not have control or clear authority over the scope of Iran’s nuclear program, its pace, or how transparent the regime will be with international nuclear inspectors. The Biden administration and its European allies should be preparing to defend against a strong, deep bench of Khamenei-esque hardliners eager to undermine any accord that restores the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) inked before the next Iranian administration takes office. If a deal is not reached ahead of time, the incoming administration will be more hostile to compromise and will continue the regime’s steady march toward ever-more extreme manifestations of violence and intimidation. U.S. and European preparations should start with closing ranks to insist on clear red lines in nuclear negotiations and to maintain robust economic pressure, which is the only thing that can extract concessions from Iranian interlocutors. We must return to the principle of zero enrichment or reprocessing in light of the regime’s flagrant decision to enrich uranium beyond the needs of any civilian nuclear program, insist on full inspections and verification, resolve Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) and undeclared nuclear activity, and address Iran’s unacceptable non-nuclear behavior, including its ballistic missile program and continued facilitation of terrorism. A strategy that relies on these principles isn’t just good for U.S. national security vis-à-vis Iran; it’s good for U.S. interests globally. It will signal to rogue regimes and authoritarian leaders from Pyongyang to Beijing to Ankara and Caracas that America is going to force a hard choice: continue their malign behaviors or risk ever-deeper economic and diplomatic isolation. Many millions of Iranians in Iran and within the Iranian diaspora community would like to see the weakened regime stripped of power—Raisi’s installation into the presidency entrenches hardline control of yet another Iranian power center and moves that goal further from reality. More extreme aggression and intransigence can be expected, particularly as Raisi angles to demonstrate his bona fides as the heir apparent to Khamenei. We must be ready to provide even greater pressure on a theocratic regime built on anti-Americanism and repression. Khamenei’s ideological successors are poised to control the Islamic Republic well after Khamenei departs from the scene, whether the cynical coronation of Raisi succeeds or not. Rushing to rejoin the JCPOA won’t change the forces that drive Iran’s nuclear program and underpin the totality of its malign behavior. But increasing economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and attention to its direct responsibility for immeasurable suffering can. Most importantly, it sends a message to the millions of Iranians who have concluded that the only way to have a voice is to boycott this illegitimate election that the United States stands with their hopes for a less repressive, less confrontational government.

But increasing economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and attention to its direct responsibility for immeasurable suffering can. Iranian elections routinely prompt politicians and the media to speculate over whether “moderates” or “hardliners” will win control, as if the Iranian people have real choices. Anti-regime Iranians need not apply. At the end of the day, Iran’s presidents have limited ability to enact their own agendas. After all, it is the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei who sets the tone and direction of foreign and domestic policy. While he has not always been impervious to public demands for reform, Ayatollah Khamenei strongly favors a trajectory based on increasing domestic repression and confrontation with the United States, and his vision has consistently won out. This year, 592 Iranians registered to run for the presidency, but when the polls open this week, there will be just seven pre-screened and hand-selected pro-regime candidates on the ballot, including no moderates or reformists of significant national stature. Regardless of who wins, they will maintain Iran’s state sponsorship of terrorism, domestic repression, and nuclear program, as the ostensible “moderate” Hassan Rouhani did for eight years. This year, the regime has gone a step further by working to all but guarantee victory for the Supreme Leader’s preferred candidate, Ebrahim Raisi. Ayatollah Khamenei is backing Raisi—often described as a potential successor to the supreme leader—because he must preserve the regime and secure the tools for a smooth transition of power. Nothing is being left to chance, especially after Raisi’s first bid ended in a humiliating defeat in 2017, failing to garner 40 percent of the vote. The Guardian Council, a regime-aligned body that can approve or exclude candidates for office, even disqualified top regime insiders like Ali Larijani from running. In past years, Larijani’s resume of more than a decade in public life as speaker of parliament and advisor to Khamenei would have made him a formidable candidate. But he’s not a future supreme leader, and nothing is being left to chance. The regime has rigged the outcome by purging all viable rivals to Raisi, and the ultraconservative cleric will most assuredly take office. If polling is accurate, most eligible Iranians are signaling their disgust with the nakedly transparent power grab by boycotting the proceedings altogether. Raisi’s coronation is bad news for Iranians and the international community. Raisi will undoubtedly continue Khamenei’s domestic brutality, as he has been at the forefront of meting out Islamic Republic-style “justice” during his decades of service in the judiciary. Raisi ran for president—and lost—during the last round of elections in 2017 because of his involvement in the extrajudicial executions of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. And since his installment as chief justice of Iran’s judiciary, human rights violations; extensive prison terms; and torture against dissidents, political prisoners, and religious minorities have increased. What was disqualifying for Raisi at the polls just four years ago is today seen as an asset. A Raisi presidency will also mean continued support for terrorist organizations and proxy wars in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. It will mean that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, will continue to consolidate its grip on power. The IRGC already controls large swaths of the Iranian economy through front companies, benefits financially from the sale of petroleum and petrochemicals abroad, leads Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria, trains Hamas terrorists, and controls a growing share of the Iranian nuclear program. Iran’s hardline clergy has formed an unholy alliance with the IRGC in recent years to ensure its primacy within the Iranian system, and the IRGC knows it can count on Raisi to protect its economic empire. To be clear, the rise of Raisi’s political stock has nothing to do with U.S. or European policies and everything to do with the regime’s need to sustain its grip on power. We are simply not that influential so as to determine the ebbs and flows of regime politics. But that doesn’t mean we are powerless to stymie the Khamenei-Raisi alliance. It is not hyperbole to assert that the negotiators representing Tehran in talks with the United States, Europe, China, and Russia do not have control or clear authority over the scope of Iran’s nuclear program, its pace, or how transparent the regime will be with international nuclear inspectors. The Biden administration and its European allies should be preparing to defend against a strong, deep bench of Khamenei-esque hardliners eager to undermine any accord that restores the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) inked before the next Iranian administration takes office. If a deal is not reached ahead of time, the incoming administration will be more hostile to compromise and will continue the regime’s steady march toward ever-more extreme manifestations of violence and intimidation. U.S. and European preparations should start with closing ranks to insist on clear red lines in nuclear negotiations and to maintain robust economic pressure, which is the only thing that can extract concessions from Iranian interlocutors. We must return to the principle of zero enrichment or reprocessing in light of the regime’s flagrant decision to enrich uranium beyond the needs of any civilian nuclear program, insist on full inspections and verification, resolve Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) and undeclared nuclear activity, and address Iran’s unacceptable non-nuclear behavior, including its ballistic missile program and continued facilitation of terrorism. A strategy that relies on these principles isn’t just good for U.S. national security vis-à-vis Iran; it’s good for U.S. interests globally. It will signal to rogue regimes and authoritarian leaders from Pyongyang to Beijing to Ankara and Caracas that America is going to force a hard choice: continue their malign behaviors or risk ever-deeper economic and diplomatic isolation. Many millions of Iranians in Iran and within the Iranian diaspora community would like to see the weakened regime stripped of power—Raisi’s installation into the presidency entrenches hardline control of yet another Iranian power center and moves that goal further from reality. More extreme aggression and intransigence can be expected, particularly as Raisi angles to demonstrate his bona fides as the heir apparent to Khamenei. We must be ready to provide even greater pressure on a theocratic regime built on anti-Americanism and repression. Khamenei’s ideological successors are poised to control the Islamic Republic well after Khamenei departs from the scene, whether the cynical coronation of Raisi succeeds or not. Rushing to rejoin the JCPOA won’t change the forces that drive Iran’s nuclear program and underpin the totality of its malign behavior. But increasing economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and attention to its direct responsibility for immeasurable suffering can. Most importantly, it sends a message to the millions of Iranians who have concluded that the only way to have a voice is to boycott this illegitimate election that the United States stands with their hopes for a less repressive, less confrontational government.

News article:
Iranians are heading to the polls to pick the next president of the country. Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s judiciary chief, is expected to secure a comfortable win, with most political heavyweights barred from running. Polling stations opened across Iran on Friday, with around 60 million people eligible to vote. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was the first to cast a ballot, as he urged everyone to vote. “Each vote counts… come and vote and choose your president… this is important for the future of your country,” Khamenei said. The outgoing president, Hassan Rouhani, called on citizens to “make our friends… all Iranians happy and our enemies disappointed,” by showing a high turnout. The election is not expected to hold much intrigue, with Iran’s judiciary chief and close ally of Khamenei, Ebrahim Raisi, projected to secure a solid win. Hardliner Raisi also ran in 2017, losing by a wide margin of almost 20% to the incumbent president, Rouhani, who is barred from running again due to legal limitations allowing two consecutive four-year terms, which he has already served. Raisi is already the subject of sanctions imposed on Iran by Washington. The high-profile official was targeted by the US after he was appointed as judiciary chief in 2019, with Washington accusing him of involvement in the execution of political prisoners in the 1980s and the suppression of unrest in the late 2000s. While more than 600 people submitted bids to the Guardian Council, a 12-member panel directly under Khamenei, only seven candidates made through it. The panel disqualified political heavyweights such as hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who served as president from 2005 to 2013, as well as former parliamentary speaker, conservative Ali Larijani. Also on rt.com Iran announces 7 approved candidates for upcoming elections, ex-president Ahmadihejad barred from running The decisions of the council against some of the presidential hopefuls were criticized by Khamenei himself. The supreme leader said some of the disqualifications were unjust, urging the panel to reverse some of the decisions. “Some candidates were wronged. They were accused of untrue things that were unfortunately spread throughout the internet too. Protecting people’s honor is one of the most important issues. I call on the responsible bodies to restore their honor,” Khamenei said earlier this month. The Guardian Council, however, said its rulings were final and did not reverse any of the bans.

News article:
A woman holds a poster of Iran’s newly-elected president Ebrahim Raisi, with text in Persian reading ‘Government of the people, strong Iran’, as supporters celebrate his victory in Imam Hussein square in the capital Tehran, on Saturday (AFP photo) TEHRAN — Iran’s ultraconservatives on Sunday hailed the election victory of their candidate Ebrahim Raisi, after Washington charged the vote was unfair and Tehran’s arch-foe Israel labelled him the “most extremist” president yet. Raisi, 60, won Friday’s election in which more than half the voters stayed away after many political heavyweights had been barred from running and as an economic crisis driven by US sanctions has battered the country. An austere figure from the Shiite Muslim clerical establishment, Raisi takes over from the moderate incumbent Hassan Rouhani, who must leave office in August after eight years in power. Raisi, whose black turban signifies direct descent from Islam’s Prophet Mohammad, is seen as close to the 81-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate political power in Iran. “The Dawn of a New Era,” read the jubilant front-page headline of the conservative Resalat daily, welcoming the 62 percent win by Raisi, the head of Iran’s judiciary. Raisi was congratulated by Russia, Turkey and several Gulf states, and by Iran’s regional allies including Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon’s Hizbollah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Raisi’s victory had been widely anticipated after the Guardian Council, made up of 12 clerics and jurists, had approved just seven candidates, all men, out of a field of almost 600 hopefuls. Three of those vetted candidates dropped out two days before the vote. Iran’s moderate Jomhouri-e Eslami daily highlighted that conservatives had now cemented their hold on power, from parliament and the Guardian Council to the court system and armed forces. Using a touch of irony, its editorial said that “we, the people of Iran, owed the conservative faction a homogeneous government” and “the people have delivered”. ‘Epic’ turnout Turnout reached 48.8 per cent, a record low for a presidential poll since Iran’s 1979 revolution ousted the US-backed monarchy. The ultraconservative Kayhan daily argued that voter participation was “epic” considering the economic crisis, COVID pandemic and the “enemy’s propaganda”, referring to boycott calls from Iranian opposition groups abroad. The Resalat daily welcomed the change from the Rouhani administration which it said has been dogged by political infighting and occupied with “fruitless domestic and foreign challenges”. Rouhani’s landmark achievement was the 2015 deal with world powers under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. That deal has however been hanging by a thread since then-US president Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018 and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign to diplomatically and economically isolate Tehran. While Iran has always denied seeking a nuclear weapon, Trump charged it was still planning to build the bomb and was destabilising the Middle East through armed proxy groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Since Trump’s successor Joe Biden took office this year, talks involving Iran and the remaining parties to the accord — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — have resumed in Vienna, with the US taking part indirectly. ‘Anti-Western views’ Iran’s ultraconservatives — who deeply distrust the United States, labelled the “Great Satan” in the Islamic republic — bitterly attacked Rouhani over the failing deal and for having trusted the West. But Raisi has nonetheless said Iran should keep negotiating with the aim of ending the punishing sanctions that have largely cut the country of 83 million off from global markets and financial systems. The US State Department said after Raisi’s election win that Washington would continue talks over Iran’s nuclear programme, working with its allies and partners. A spokesperson charged however that “Iranians were denied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process”. In Israel, which has engaged in a shadow conflict with Iran for years, foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the Islamic republic had “elected its most extremist president to date”. Raisi was “committed to Iran’s rapidly advancing military nuclear programme”, Haiat wrote on Twitter. “His election makes clear Iran’s true malign intentions, and should prompt grave concern among the international community.” Israel’s new Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that Raisi’s election is “the last chance for the world powers to wake up before returning to the nuclear agreement and to understand who they are doing business with”. Analysts for think thank the Eurasia Group said Raisi’s election win would likely not derail the ongoing Vienna talks to salvage the nuclear deal. But they warned that “his hardline, anti-Western views are a sharp break from the more moderate stances of Rouhani and will have a significant impact on Tehran’s relationship with the outside world”. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, speaking about the Vienna talks, said: “We are very close... So I hope that the result of the election is not going to be the last obstacle that will ruin the negotiation process. “As far as I know... this is not going to be the case. It is not a matter of this president or another, it is the understanding of what is at stake.”

Iran Sends a Message to Biden The new president shows who really runs the Islamic Republic. https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-sends-a-message-to-biden-11624130662?mod=opinion_lead_pos1 The Islamic Republic of Iran isn’t a real democracy. But the result of Friday’s presidential election still reveals important truths about the government that the U.S. and Europe are trying to appease on nuclear weapons. Ebrahim Raisi, the country’s chief justice, won the presidency with about 62% of the vote, according to preliminary results published Saturday. Sometimes discussed as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei —who wields the real power in Iran, particularly over foreign affairs—Mr. Raisi had the race wrapped up before the polls opened. The Guardian Council, Iran’s election watchdog, has long barred candidates not to the Supreme Leader’s liking. But past races have been competitive and even unpredictable, giving Iranians a small voice in deciding their future. Approved candidates are always loyal to the Islamic Republic and its revolutionary ideology. But some, like lame-duck President Hassan Rouhani, spoke the language of moderation and reform even as they followed the Khamenei line. Iranians understand they live in a dictatorship but have often voted in high numbers to choose their least bad option. Initial results suggest this year’s race had turnout around 50%—down from more than 70% four years ago and the lowest of any vote since 1979. Millions decided to boycott this year’s election as the country’s already small spectrum of permissible views grew even smaller. Last month the Guardian Council culled dozens of candidates, including many ostensible centrists or reformers. Of the seven candidates approved to run, three dropped out shortly before the contest—paving the way for Mr. Raisi, who is typically described as a hard-liner or ultraconservative cleric. In 1988 Mr. Raisi facilitated the extrajudicial execution of thousands of dissidents. He later called the killings “one of the proud achievements of the system.” In 2009, during the Green Revolution after a stolen election, he served as deputy chief justice when peaceful protestors were prosecuted and sometimes given death sentences. In 2019 the Trump Administration imposed sanctions on Mr. Raisi over the myriad human-rights violations committed during his rise through the Iranian legal system. Will the Biden Administration, which has been negotiating a return to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, lift sanctions on the president-elect? Defenders of the nuclear accord argue that by leaving the deal Donald Trump weakened reformers and empowered men like Mr. Raisi. But conservative clerics have had ultimate power in Iran since the 1979 revolution. Mr. Khamenei supported the accord because it is favorable to the regime. It offers tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and trade revenue while merely delaying the day it can build a bomb. “We will be committed to the JCPOA as an agreement that was approved by the Supreme Leader,” Mr. Raisi said this month, referring to the nuclear deal’s official name. The folly of the Obama and now Biden administrations is believing that the leaders in Tehran want Iran to be a normal country. They don’t. They run a government that wants to spread its religious revolution to the rest of the world by whatever means possible. Mr. Raisi’s ascension shouts that reality from the minaret, not that the Biden Administration wants to hear it. Comments are closed.

News article:
DUBAI, June 21 (Reuters) - The election of a hardline Iranian president has so far been met with silence from Saudi Arabia, but commentators in state-controlled Saudi newspapers forecast little change in Iran's foreign policy as security hawks tighten their grip on power. Most Gulf states, including the United Arab Emirates which is also at odds with Iran, offered congratulations after judge Ebrahim Raisi, an ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who wields ultimate power, emerged the winner in Friday's presidential election. "After Ebrahim Raisi's win we do not expect any important changes in foreign policy since it falls under the supreme leader, and the (nuclear) deal being negotiated by (incumbent President Hassan) Rouhani's team in Vienna will go through," wrote Abdulrahman Rashed in Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat daily. Riyadh and its allies are eyeing the talks between global powers and Iran to revive a 2015 nuclear pact that Washington quit in 2018 and which Gulf states opposed for not addressing Tehran's missile programme and support for regional proxies.

DUBAI, June 21 (Reuters) - The election of a hardline Iranian president has so far been met with silence from Saudi Arabia, but commentators in state-controlled Saudi newspapers forecast little change in Iran's foreign policy as security hawks tighten their grip on power. Most Gulf states, including the United Arab Emirates which is also at odds with Iran, offered congratulations after judge Ebrahim Raisi, an ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who wields ultimate power, emerged the winner in Friday's presidential election. "After Ebrahim Raisi's win we do not expect any important changes in foreign policy since it falls under the supreme leader, and the (nuclear) deal being negotiated by (incumbent President Hassan) Rouhani's team in Vienna will go through," wrote Abdulrahman Rashed in Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat daily. Riyadh and its allies are eyeing the talks between global powers and Iran to revive a 2015 nuclear pact that Washington quit in 2018 and which Gulf states opposed for not addressing Tehran's missile programme and support for regional proxies.

Alas, Iranian regime will shape a junta under the cover of mullah’s tyranny! surely, American diplomacy with this mullah’s regime and new president is an absurd approach. all of the political observers know pretty well that polling stations of Iran’s clerical rulers were empty and turnout in Iran sham election was microscopic. moreover, the Iranians boycotted the Islamic fascist republic! because Iranians do not want Raisi, a hard line judiciary chief with a brutal record on human rights. consequently, the West should learn that, there is no real reformist inside Iran. additionally, reformists and hardliners are two sides of the same coin. they are very closely related to the tyranny of mullah’s unreformable regime in Iran, although they seem different because of the fake propaganda of the western media! however, Iran hardliner wins rigged election. Surely, Raisi was appointed not elected! the so-called reformists endorsed him shamelessly! almost everyone knew the results long time ago! preposterously, Khamenei engineered to facilitate Raisi’s elevation. Raisi, whose career in Iran’s judiciary has intersected with the bloodiest episodes of domestic repression. the main question is this :but the main question which raise in mind is about Raisi’s brutal record, is it important for the US and the West? certainly, the civilized world do not want to negotiate with a criminal killer. By clearing the way for Raisi to win, Khameenei and mullahs endorsed their man to took control of the presidency; and they sent a clear message to the the world for shaping the new era of tyranny in Iran which is mix with Junta. remarkably, there’s much to be scared about Raisi. he is a ruthless slayer. in a recent news conference, he ridiculed while condemning opponents to death. Raisi truly does represent the Islamic republic and Islamic Caliphate in many ways. once more, all US agencies should consider this point that : American diplomacy with the illegitimate outlaw regime of mullahs is pointless! If president Biden accelerate his diplomacy in order to strike a deal with this notorious criminal Mullah, it will only confirm naivete to the reality of the Islamic “republic” or caliphate of a Shia’ mullah. from realistic point of view, as a routine, Raisi will endorse the terrorist operations of IRGC and its main branch which Quds force and the internal suppression by IRGC. the malign activities of IRGC will be in borders of the USA and at the backyard of US in the western hemisphere. now, directors of intelligence in CIA and FBI will monitoring new stream of events in Raisi’s Government and their inactive cells inside the soil of the USA. even though, the FBI “works closely with its partners to neutralize terrorist cells and operatives here in the United States, to help dismantle extremist networks worldwide, and to cut off financing and other forms of support provided to foreign terrorist organizations”. acceptably, “The FBI is committed to remaining agile in its approach to the terrorism threat, which has continued to evolve since the September 11, 2001 terror attacks”.but, the threat of terrorist groups affiliated to Iranian regime also remains persistent overall, with a verity of actors which committing crimes in furtherance of violent agendas”.

Raisi has already made it very clear that this will not be on the table of negotiation in the future. this important point should be emphasized, he does not like to solve any problem in the US-Iran conflicts. therefore, he will reject any diplomacy. he rejected to talk about Terrorism, Ballistic Missiles program and nuclear proliferation with the West.

News article:
Why does Iran insist on holding presidential elections while the world watches these elections being rigged on a daily basis during the weeks that precede the day of the vote? The elections’ results were determined weeks before they were held, not because of overwhelming popular support for then-candidate Ebrahim Raisi, who was elected in the elections that saw the lowest voter turnout four decades (48 percent), but because the Supreme Leader had worked systematically to predetermine their results. At the start, Ali Khamenei oversaw the “sanitization” of the list of candidates to avert surprises and paved the way to a Raisi victory with many candidates’ withdrawal from the race, and eventually, Raisi was made president based on an almost explicit view for the next phase in the Iranian revolutionary regime’s life. This vision encompasses the formation of an Islamist government composed of indoctrinated Supreme Leader loyalists who are closer to the regime’s Islamist factions than its Republican factions. The vision also includes a road map for Iran post-Khamenei. What occurred, then, was an appointment disguised as an election, a personalized regime disguised as a state of institutions, and a closed regime disguised as a democracy. With that, Iran was keen on convincing, through the means available to it, the Iranians- the Arab world and the world at large, that it had held presidential elections. Commentators exaggerated in praising it and emphasizing its superiority to the American electoral process. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad could have continued to impose the status quo he wants, but he insisted on holding presidential elections whose legitimacy is not recognized by most of the world. As those in Iran and those writing about it had done, commentators showered “democratic wedding” with praise in the press and on screens. The day of the election was covered by all the tools available to the regime, as though it had been a genuine competition. Why didn’t the Supreme Leader appoint Raisi- though it is exactly what he did- and why didn’t Bashar al-Assad extend his term by force so long as no one seriously recognized his election legitimacy? We could say that Khamenei and Assad are, to some extent, mocking the concept of democracy by presenting a highly tattered version of it, telling the world and their people before it: this is the democracy that the West is invoking to interfere with our affairs, and you can see how easy it is to rig and falsify to achieve particular ends. Thus, we are facing the desecration of the concept of democracy using the tools of democracy itself. Elsewhere, Western writers and intellectuals can ride the wave of political self-aggrandizement in the West, claiming that tyrants’ invocation of democracy is a victory for democracy and an affirmation that it is the only source of political legitimacy today, even if it is applied through sham elections… This idea is rooted in a more profound concept adopted by Francis Fukuyama, who declared that the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union’s collapse had heralded the end of history, that is, that democracy is the final stage of humanity’s political evolution and the final form that managing public affairs and executive authority would take. The irony is that Khamenei and Assad held elections at a time this is distinguished in two ways: firstly, both their regimes are suffering from a serious internal legitimacy crisis that the elections themselves exposed far more than they papered over. Secondly, the reputation of the concept of democracy itself is suffering from a severe hemorrhage. It starts with its primary fortress in Washington and doesn’t stop at the Post-Soviet Republics in Eastern Europe or Israel, passing through India, the world’s largest democracy. We could talk endlessly about “democracy’s” horrendous consequence for the region, at the developmental level, its implications for economic infrastructure and its prolongment of institutions’ paralysis, as is happening in Lebanon and, to a large extent, in the Palestinian territories since 2007. As for Egypt, the country’s 2020 elections were distinguished by the strong competitiveness of joining the regime’s electoral list and the fact that run-off elections encompassed 87 percent of electoral seats, an indication of their competitiveness… They were elections, in contrast to the electoral process in Iran, in which the enthusiasm of participation clearly indicates the entrenchment of the January 30 Revolution regime’s solidity and its popular legitimacy, which are coupled with a broad, multidimensional development project. On the other hand, democracy wasn’t and won’t be other Middle Eastern states’ course, especially not the Gulf states’ course, for entrenching the legitimacy of their political regimes, which have every right to talk about potent social and political particularities linked to their societies’ composition and the conceptual roots of their systems of governance and the broad consensus on the kinship-based and tribal sources of legitimacy. We are, then, facing several proposals for managing public affairs, achieving development and optimizing systems of governance, which shouldn’t be reduced to democratization and a mechanical push in a single direction. The truth is the West’s reputation, especially that of Washington, is generally poor, particularly its ardent push for liberal democracy. Let’s take an example; the contradictory behavior of former US President Barack Obama’s administration. It rushed, through the president himself, to publicly ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, which gave the Egyptian mass movement an extremely strong push before its real intentions became clear, and it became apparent the Muslim Brotherhood had been extremely effectively “leading from behind.” That brought them to power and almost turned Egypt into a Sunni Iran!! On the other hand, when the Green Revolution erupted in the wake of Khamenei’s direct supervision of the elections rigged in favor of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Washington chose to distance itself, under the pretext of not contaminating the Iranian popular movement and facilitating the subsequent labeling of the movement as pro-American in preparation for its liquidation!! Why wasn’t Obama concerned that the Egyptians who were revolting would be accused of being American stooges but was worried about the same insults being hurled at the Iranians? The simple and straightforward answer is that this was a false pretense in the first place. What Obama really wanted to achieve by distancing himself was safeguarding the secret nuclear program negotiations between his administration that had been ongoing at the time! Obama’s position contributed to the annihilation of the most honorable intifada Iran had seen in 4 decades, and his position in Egypt precipitated a series of events that almost left the Arab world’s largest state toppled by political Islam. Democracy isn’t the gateway for making political and social assessments in the Middle East… it is at least not the only one. Iranian “democracy,” a cheap replica that went as far as predetermining the results, does not cover the Iranian regime’s legitimacy crisis, while the lack of democracy, does not do away with the prestige of the wise governance presented by major Gulf capitals and does not undermine the legitimacy of their systems of governance. This is what the West does not understand, and unless it does, it cannot build fruitful relations that pave the way to good governance and sustainable development in the region. Elections are not a necessary gateway, nor conceptions of bubbles of freedom based on the story of a person here and another there or the orientalist delusion that political Islam is at the heart of countries and societies’ identities in this part of the world.

News article:
Why does Iran insist on holding presidential elections while the world watches these elections being rigged on a daily basis during the weeks that precede the day of the vote? The elections’ results were determined weeks before they were held, not because of overwhelming popular support for then-candidate Ebrahim Raisi, who was elected in the elections that saw the lowest voter turnout four decades (48 percent), but because the Supreme Leader had worked systematically to predetermine their results. At the start, Ali Khamenei oversaw the “sanitization” of the list of candidates to avert surprises and paved the way to a Raisi victory with many candidates’ withdrawal from the race, and eventually, Raisi was made president based on an almost explicit view for the next phase in the Iranian revolutionary regime’s life. This vision encompasses the formation of an Islamist government composed of indoctrinated Supreme Leader loyalists who are closer to the regime’s Islamist factions than its Republican factions. The vision also includes a road map for Iran post-Khamenei. What occurred, then, was an appointment disguised as an election, a personalized regime disguised as a state of institutions, and a closed regime disguised as a democracy. With that, Iran was keen on convincing, through the means available to it, the Iranians- the Arab world and the world at large, that it had held presidential elections. Commentators exaggerated in praising it and emphasizing its superiority to the American electoral process. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad could have continued to impose the status quo he wants, but he insisted on holding presidential elections whose legitimacy is not recognized by most of the world. As those in Iran and those writing about it had done, commentators showered “democratic wedding” with praise in the press and on screens. The day of the election was covered by all the tools available to the regime, as though it had been a genuine competition. Why didn’t the Supreme Leader appoint Raisi- though it is exactly what he did- and why didn’t Bashar al-Assad extend his term by force so long as no one seriously recognized his election legitimacy? We could say that Khamenei and Assad are, to some extent, mocking the concept of democracy by presenting a highly tattered version of it, telling the world and their people before it: this is the democracy that the West is invoking to interfere with our affairs, and you can see how easy it is to rig and falsify to achieve particular ends. Thus, we are facing the desecration of the concept of democracy using the tools of democracy itself. Elsewhere, Western writers and intellectuals can ride the wave of political self-aggrandizement in the West, claiming that tyrants’ invocation of democracy is a victory for democracy and an affirmation that it is the only source of political legitimacy today, even if it is applied through sham elections… This idea is rooted in a more profound concept adopted by Francis Fukuyama, who declared that the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union’s collapse had heralded the end of history, that is, that democracy is the final stage of humanity’s political evolution and the final form that managing public affairs and executive authority would take. The irony is that Khamenei and Assad held elections at a time this is distinguished in two ways: firstly, both their regimes are suffering from a serious internal legitimacy crisis that the elections themselves exposed far more than they papered over. Secondly, the reputation of the concept of democracy itself is suffering from a severe hemorrhage. It starts with its primary fortress in Washington and doesn’t stop at the Post-Soviet Republics in Eastern Europe or Israel, passing through India, the world’s largest democracy. We could talk endlessly about “democracy’s” horrendous consequence for the region, at the developmental level, its implications for economic infrastructure and its prolongment of institutions’ paralysis, as is happening in Lebanon and, to a large extent, in the Palestinian territories since 2007. As for Egypt, the country’s 2020 elections were distinguished by the strong competitiveness of joining the regime’s electoral list and the fact that run-off elections encompassed 87 percent of electoral seats, an indication of their competitiveness… They were elections, in contrast to the electoral process in Iran, in which the enthusiasm of participation clearly indicates the entrenchment of the January 30 Revolution regime’s solidity and its popular legitimacy, which are coupled with a broad, multidimensional development project. On the other hand, democracy wasn’t and won’t be other Middle Eastern states’ course, especially not the Gulf states’ course, for entrenching the legitimacy of their political regimes, which have every right to talk about potent social and political particularities linked to their societies’ composition and the conceptual roots of their systems of governance and the broad consensus on the kinship-based and tribal sources of legitimacy. We are, then, facing several proposals for managing public affairs, achieving development and optimizing systems of governance, which shouldn’t be reduced to democratization and a mechanical push in a single direction. The truth is the West’s reputation, especially that of Washington, is generally poor, particularly its ardent push for liberal democracy. Let’s take an example; the contradictory behavior of former US President Barack Obama’s administration. It rushed, through the president himself, to publicly ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, which gave the Egyptian mass movement an extremely strong push before its real intentions became clear, and it became apparent the Muslim Brotherhood had been extremely effectively “leading from behind.” That brought them to power and almost turned Egypt into a Sunni Iran!! On the other hand, when the Green Revolution erupted in the wake of Khamenei’s direct supervision of the elections rigged in favor of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Washington chose to distance itself, under the pretext of not contaminating the Iranian popular movement and facilitating the subsequent labeling of the movement as pro-American in preparation for its liquidation!! Why wasn’t Obama concerned that the Egyptians who were revolting would be accused of being American stooges but was worried about the same insults being hurled at the Iranians? The simple and straightforward answer is that this was a false pretense in the first place. What Obama really wanted to achieve by distancing himself was safeguarding the secret nuclear program negotiations between his administration that had been ongoing at the time!

News article:
The vaccinated can now go maskless. (Mostly.) Some people are looking with horror at this new recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control, while others are reacting with relief. The scientific evidence is pretty clear: There’s powerful data showing that vaccines prevent not just symptomatic Covid-19, but also curb the spread of the virus. Some of the fearful reactions might be driven by people getting stuck on earlier reports that the clinical trials didn’t do enough to test whether the vaccines cut down on transmission. But a lot has changed since then. Pfizer gathered all kinds of real-world data from much larger groups than they studied in the clinical trials, including US healthcare workers and the country of Israel. Those data show that the Pfizer vaccine is preventing transmission. Israel’s infection wave — with thousands of cases a day — has now been reduced to a trickle, even though children and some fraction of adults remain unvaccinated. It’s reasonable to assume that the nearly identical Moderna vaccine will perform as well. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which hasn’t been used as extensively in the US, wasn’t demonstrated to reduce asymptomatic cases the same way, and scientists are still trying to understand the implications of an outbreak among the New York Yankees after most of the players got the single-dose vaccine. So far, there was one mild case and seven without symptoms. The bottom line: the evidence that vaccines protect others is of a stronger and more direct kind than the evidence that masks do. So if you want to protect others, getting vaccinated is more likely to help than wearing a mask — and of course people are still welcome to do both. The burden of proof is higher with vaccines than with masks. With masks, there was an abrupt turnaround last spring when experts began recommending masking without any new, definitive study. Experts I interviewed back then cited the recognition that masks were relatively safe, cheap and harmless, and therefore, if there’s some chance they might help, they should be adopted. There were studies that offered indirect evidence, including ones done in medical facilities with health care workers adopting high quality, tight-fitting N95 masks. And there were simulations showing that cloth masks blocked some of the particles that carry the virus. Last fall the press touted a paper that projected 130,000 lives would be saved by universal masking — but the math was based on the assumption that medical masks and cloth ones would work equally well, preventing about 40% of cases. Another assumption — one that was probably wrong — concerned the half of Americans surveyed at the time who said they didn’t wear a mask every time they left the house. The assumption was that these people were failing to wear them in situations where transmission was possible. But it’s a lot more likely that many such people were just walking their dogs, jogging or hiking, and still masking in stores or taxis or at the doctor’s office. Scientists have been saying for months that masking alone outdoors is not likely to save anyone — something mainstream media outlets like New York Times took much longer to admit to. Vaccines have faced a much more stringent level of scrutiny. As FDA requires for any new drug or vaccine, the burden of proof is on the vaccine makers to demonstrate they work and won’t cause harm. The clinical data that Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have gathered are high quality studies that show vaccines protect against symptomatic disease. There was also limited data from the Moderna and Pfizer clinical trials showing a drop in transmission, and, later, better real-world data showing the same thing in a study of US health care workers. Even stronger data out of Israel has shown that the Pfizer vaccines cut down on both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases by more than 89%. This may not sound like a good enough number to take off your mask, but experts say that these few breakthrough cases are also much less likely to transmit to others since the vaccines cuts down on the virus particles that people harbor in their noses. Importantly, this also doesn’t mean that you have an 11% chance of getting Covid if you’re vaccinated; that’s not how the math works. That’s one reason that in the US, where the 95% effective Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are widely used, the real-world “breakthrough” infection rate has been a fraction of a percent. Sure, the new recommendations are hard to enforce since unvaccinated people might “cheat” — but worries about this are based on an overestimate of the risks unmasked people pose to others, and an underestimate of the benefits of the vaccine. The big risk unmasked, unvaccinated people are posing is to themselves. The cautious are welcome to keep wearing masks to add an additional safety net, but given the choice, getting vaccinated offers much better protection — for others as well as yourself. Bloomberg

 Theme/Focus:
The theme of the image is the relative safety of different activities for unvaccinated and vaccinated people.

Key Information/Sub-event:
The image shows a table with three categories of activities: safest, less safe, and least safe. For each category, there are three subcategories: unvaccinated people, vaccinated people, and fully vaccinated people. The safest activities for unvaccinated people are walking, running, or biking outdoors with members of their household. The least safe activities for unvaccinated people are attending a crowded outdoor event, like a live performance, parade, or sports event. The safest activities for vaccinated people are the same as for unvaccinated people. The least safe activities for vaccinated people are also the same as for unvaccinated people. However, the image indicates that fully vaccinated people have more leeway to engage in activities without masks, such as dining at an outdoor restaurant with friends from multiple households.

News Event Perspective:
The image helps to illustrate the new CDC guidelines for mask-wearing. The guidelines state that fully vaccinated people can safely participate in most activities without wearing a mask. However, unvaccinated people should still wear masks in most settings. The image provides a visual representation of the relative safety of different activities for unvaccinated and vaccinated people.

That’s one reason that in the US, where the 95% effective Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are widely used, the real-world “breakthrough” infection rate has been a fraction of a percent. Sure, the new recommendations are hard to enforce since unvaccinated people might “cheat” — but worries about this are based on an overestimate of the risks unmasked people pose to others, and an underestimate of the benefits of the vaccine. The big risk unmasked, unvaccinated people are posing is to themselves. The cautious are welcome to keep wearing masks to add an additional safety net, but given the choice, getting vaccinated offers much better protection — for others as well as yourself. Bloomberg

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced they are investigating reports of heart issues in young patients who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. There have been “relatively few” cases of young people developing heart symptoms following their inoculations, but the CDC is requesting that “information about this potential adverse event” be provided to clinicians to “enhance early recognition and appropriate management of persons who develop myocarditis symptoms.” Myocarditis is an inflammation in the heart muscle. The few dozen cases so far have involved teenagers and young adults, mostly males, who have received either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Also on rt.com Fauci faces drop in confidence from 40% of Americans over past year – poll The CDC’s vaccine safety group has not determined whether the condition is directly related to the vaccinations, and said the cases have been “mild” thus far. Patients have reported their symptoms within four days of receiving a vaccine dose. Follow-up cases are currently ongoing. The agency has not specified the exact ages of the patients reporting symptoms, but the Pfizer-BioNTech has been approved for people 16 years or older since December, and to people between the ages of 12 and 15 since last month. In April, Israel’s Health Ministry also announced it was looking into a handful of cases of heart inflammation, possibly linked to the Pfizer vaccine. The cases reported had been from people aged 30 or below. “Adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established,” Pfizer said at the time in a statement. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

News article:
The White House unveiled its plans for sharing unused COVID-19 vaccines with the world, freeing up 25 million shots in the first tranche for countries badly hit by the pandemic such as India and for neighbors Canada and Mexico. The U.S. has said it will share 80 million doses by the end of June and on Thursday officials said they would retain control of where they go. The new plan allocates three quarters of unused vaccines for the U.N.-backed COVAX global distribution system, sending some some 6 million to Latin America and the Caribbean, about 7 million to Asia and roughly 5 million to Africa. President Joe Biden said the U.S. was not sharing vaccinations to 'secure favors or extract concessions' as his administration announced where the first 25 million unused doses would be sent. The president has committed to sending 80 million doses overseas by the end of June The plan delivers six million doses to South and Central America, five million to Africa and seven million to Asia, along with another six million that the Biden administration is sending to regional priorities and partners, including United Nations frontline staff An elderly man with breathing difficulty due to coronavirus takes oxygen with the help of an oxygen mask at a COVID-19 care facility, inside Gurudwara Rakab Ganj (Sikh temple), in New Delhi, India. The country is one of the places singled out for vaccine doses by the White House Where the first 25 million vaccine doses will be going Nearly 19 million will be shared through the global vaccine distribution system COVAX, with the following allocations: Approximately 6 million for South and Central America to the following countries: Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Haiti, and other Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, as well as the Dominican Republic. Approximately 7 million for Asia to the following countries: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and the Pacific Islands. Approximately 5 million for Africa to be shared with countries that will be selected in coordination with the African Union. Another 6 million will be targeted toward regional priorities and partner recipients, including Mexico, Canada, and the Republic of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Haiti, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen, as well as for United Nations frontline workers. Advertisement As he made the announcement President Joe Biden said he would not be using the life-saving doses for diplomatic gain. 'We are sharing these doses not to secure favors or extract concessions,' he said. 'We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic, with the power of our example and with our values.' Critics said it was too little, too late and called on the administration to invest in manufacturing sites around the world. Developed nations have been accused of monopolizing vaccine production, protecting their own populations at the expense of poorer countries. The U.S. ranks second only to China for vaccine production but was singled out for keeping almost its entire supply at home. The result was a world waiting to see how the Biden administration would decide to share its doses. The vast majority will be distributed by COVAX, a World Health Organization-backed program. Another six million will go to what the White House described as 'regional priorities' and 'partner recipients' including Mexico, Canada, and the Republic of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Haiti, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen, as well as for United Nations frontline workers. The Biden administration has said 25% of spare doses will be kept in reserve for emergencies. 'As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,' said Biden said. 'And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.' In a briefing, said National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S would retain control of where the vaccines went. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. would stay in control of where the doses distributed through COVAX ultimately go 'We're not seeking to extract concessions, we're not extorting, we're not imposing conditions the way that other countries who are providing doses are doing; we're doing none of those things,' he said. He added that Gaza had been picked out because of the recent crisis there. 'We're not asking anything of the people of Gaza and West Bank, but we feel that given what they are dealing with, in the situation on the ground there, it is only right and proper and good for the United States to actually allocate some doses to that country,' he said. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said via Twitter that he had offered his thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris in a phone call when he was informed that doses were on their way. 'I expressed our appreciation on behalf of the people of Mexico,' he said on Twitter. Campaigners demanding more help for poor nations said the announcement was a good step but should be followed with a deeper commitment. 'The donation of these few doses is welcome but deeply insufficient, and no substitute for a plan of scale and urgency to end the pandemic,' Peter Maybarduk, director of Public Citizen’s Access to Medicines program. 'The U.S. needs to do more, much more.' Tom Hart, of the One Campaign, also welcomed the news but said the U.S. should accelerate plans to distribute AstraZeneca doses that have not yet been licensed by Washington. 'However, it’s disappointing to see delays in donating the 60 million AstraZeneca doses – which have been approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization and will go unused otherwise,' he said. Biden announced in April that the U.S. would send the AstraZeneca vaccines overseas by July 4. However, problems at a manufacturing plant have delayed production.

News article:
Some 600,000 Israelis aged 12-15 are eligible to receive a vaccine against the coronavirus from Sunday. Thousands have already booked appointments through the country’s health maintenance organizations (HMOs), according to Saturday reports. The move comes six months after Israel began its vaccination drive for adults, and after the US Food and Drug Administration okayed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the age group. Some HMOs have already vaccinated children under 16 in at-risk groups and have seen no significant side effects from the shot. According to the plan, children in that age group who are at greater risk of suffering severe symptoms from coronavirus infection will be the first advised to get the shots, along with those living with family members who are likewise at risk of serious illness. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Families that are expecting to travel abroad will also be included in the first round of vaccinations, the ministry said. The ministry stressed to The Times of Israel that vaccination will not be compulsory for adolescents, only advised, and parents will be able to decide if they want their children to get the shots. On Tuesday it was reported that a member of the Health Ministry panel that has been advising on COVID-19 vaccinations received death threats during the process of approval for the inoculation of children. Advertisement Prof. Galia Rahav of Sheba Medical Center received threatening messages from anti-vaxxers online, including images of tombstones with her name and a “pulsa dinura,” a Jewish death curse that literally translates as “lashes of fire,” Kan news reported. The hospital said it was coordinating with police over the threats and will provide Rahav with security at all times. Israel’s mass vaccination drive, which has already given both shots to over half the population, along with lockdown measures, brought down the number of new daily cases (based on a weekly average), from 8,600 at the peak of the health crisis to just 19 on Sunday. On Tuesday, the last of a series of restrictions in place for over a year lapsed as case numbers continued to fall. The only major restrictions remaining are the mandate requiring masks to be worn indoors, expected to be lifted soon as well, and quarantine requirements for those entering the country. At the height of the pandemic, there were 88,000 active cases in the country and 1,228 serious cases; as of Friday, there were 199 active infections and 39 people in serious condition. Since the beginning of the outbreak early last year, 839,539 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Israel and there have been 6,417 deaths from the disease.

By Yisrael Price YERUSHALAYIM — The Israeli health ministry said on Sunday that not a single new native case of covid was detected over the past twenty four hours, the first time that could be said since the outbreak over a year ago. The ministry noted that four cases were recorded over Shabbos, but all of those originated abroad. Health minister Yuli Edelstein said on Sunday, that providing the situation remains stable, all mask-wearing regulations can be cancelled in nine days, on June 15. As of now, masks are still required in indoor public places. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Edelstein attended an appreciation ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater for health system personnel and partner agencies for their contribution to the fight against the coronavirus. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla addressed the gathering by videoconference. Netanyahu said that “Israel’s victory was achieved thanks to two basic elements: The millions of vaccines that we brought to the country and their rapid distribution to the citizens of Israel. This morning we also began vaccinating young people aged 12-16. This is huge news; it promises us herd immunity.” Kurz said: “I would like to thank you, Bibi, for our good cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It was you who first alerted me about the massive danger of the coronavirus at the beginning of last year. Following your warnings, we took hard measures very early in Austria last year, which helped us to get through the first wave quite effectively… “With a view to the future waves, I would like to enhance the cooperation on research and development and vaccine production with Israel and Denmark.” Pfizer’s Bourla similarly commended the Israeli effort and Netanyahu in particular. “As many life science companies in the world, Pfizer has collaborated with many governments around the world to fight this pandemic, but nowhere has this collaboration been more effective than in Israel. “Israel has done the most amazing job in mobilizing their healthcare system and delivering the most successful vaccination campaign in the world. “During my discussions with the Israeli government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convinced me that Israel would be the ideal place to demonstrate to the world what a fast vaccination campaign can achieve. “But what Israel was able to eventually achieve exceeded all my expectations. To date, 57% of the Israeli population has been fully vaccinated. And recently published real-world data from Israel suggests that in its first 120 days, the country’s vaccination program with our vaccine prevented approximately 159,000 infections, 25,000 hospitalizations and 5,500 deaths,” Bourla said.

News article:
ANKARA: Turkish citizens aged between 40 and 50 will begin getting COVID-19 jabs as part of the country’s vaccination campaign, launched in mid-January. The move comes as the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Turkey. Those aged 45 to 50 will begin receiving their first dose on June 10, whereas citizens in the 40 to 45 group will get their jabs by June 14. The authorities also began vaccinating musicians, film and TV series staff as well as university employees without an age limit in a bid to re-energize the country’s cultural activities and prepare for face-to-face education in September. Tens of thousands of music industry workers have lost their jobs since March 2020, and concerts are still banned under social distancing measures. From next week, the country will also inoculate volunteers for the phase 3 human trials of a locally developed COVID-19 vaccine candidate. According to a survey conducted by Infakto Research Workshop and Habitat Association, one-third of Turkish youth are against vaccination. Turkish authorities are considering special restrictions for those refusing to get vaccinated. “Vaccine skepticism is relatively low in Turkey and is getting lesser with the public awareness campaigns. It recently appeared that Russia-sponsored misinformation campaigns on social media have been fuelling this trend all around the world,” Prof. Guner Sonmez, a radiologist from Uskudar University in Istanbul, told Arab News. Several social media influencers recently confessed that they received payment from a Russian-linked company to discredit the Pfizer vaccine in favor of its own Sputnik V jab. Several anti-vaccine hashtags have become trending topics on Turkish Twitter in recent weeks. The number of single-day COVID-19 deaths recently fell below 100. On June 9, the country confirmed 6,454 new coronavirus cases and 87 deaths from COVID-19. So far, Turkey has administered over 31.75 million vaccines, with about 18.5 million people getting their first jab and 13.5 million receiving both doses. Germany on Friday removed Turkey from the list of high-risk countries. But the country remains listed in the orange category on the EU’s risk scale. Travelers from Turkey will be allowed to enter European countries if they can prove their COVID-19 immunity either through vaccination documents or recovery from the disease starting by July 1. As there is a shortage of Chinese Sinovac vaccines, citizens are mainly getting the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Ugur Sahin, the co-founder and CEO of Germany-based BioNTech, is expected to visit Turkey, his home country, at the end of June. If the country receives 30 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech jabs at the end of the month, people as young as 20 can be vaccinated as well. Meanwhile, a Turkish citizen recently attracted fame after his thank-you letter to Sinovac and the accompanying 50 Turkish liras ($6) he sent to the company to show his gratitude for the vaccine was revealed by the international media. The accelerated vaccination program will also help the country to prevent another lost tourism season, with the Turkish economy relying heavily on tourists to bring in foreign currency revenue that helps to recover its current account deficit. Last month, two big events that were key to attracting tourists’ cash were lost due to the high rate of daily infections. Formula One canceled the Turkish Grand Prix scheduled for June and the UEFA Champions League final was relocated from Turkey to Portugal. Russia and Turkey continue diplomatic meetings to consider resuming full-scale air traffic between the two countries. A lost season would cost Turkey 500,000 Russian tourists in the summer. Tourism workers have also been prioritized to receive vaccinations, while thousands of accommodation sites, restaurants, cafes, boats and tour vehicles have been granted “Safe Tourism Certificates” to instill trust in the incoming tourists. However, Moscow recently extended its flight ban to Turkey until June 21, which is expected to cost the tourism industry $500 million in June alone, according to Turkish tourism operators. “Israel reached herd immunity threshold when 62 percent of its citizens were fully vaccinated. If we receive the promised batch of vaccines by the end of this month, it can also help the tourism season to recover and life will return to normal by September,” Sonmez said. He added: “A higher percentage of vaccinations will also help us against mutated virus strains. The authorities recently allowed Family Health Centres that are set up in each district to administer the vaccines. That will help people who have concerns or accessibility problems to go to the hospitals.”

Police are reportedly probing whether coronavirus infections among 11 kids at a school in Modiin in central Israel were caused by a man who violated quarantine after returning from overseas. The Health Ministry filed a complaint with police against the man after the infections were detected among the 6th graders, Channel 12 news reports. The network quotes an investigation by the Health Ministry district branch as saying the suspect “did not fulfill the quarantine requirement in full upon his return from overseas and did not perform a [coronavirus] test on the ninth day, allowing him to shorten the quarantine from 14 days.” After the outbreak was detected, the rest of the students were sent to quarantine and the IDF’s Home Front Command was testing children in all grades for other potential infections.

The Palestinian Authority did not immediately comment on the deal Israel is to provide around one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the Palestinian Authority in a swap as their expiry date looms, the Israeli prime minister's office said Israel is to provide around one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the Palestinian Authority in a swap as their expiry date looms, the Israeli prime minister's office said Friday. "Israel has signed an agreement with the Palestinian Authority, and will supply approximately one million doses of Pfizer vaccine that is about to expire," Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said, in a joint statement with the defence and health ministries. Israel "will receive in return the doses that Pfizer is to send to the Palestinian Authority," the statement added. The Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank, did not immediately comment on the deal. "Israel will receive the same amount of doses of Pfizer in September/October 2021, on behalf of what is destined for the Palestinian Authority," the Israeli statement added. "This agreement was made possible after noting that the stock of vaccines that Israel has in its possession meets its current needs." Israel launched a sweeping vaccination campaign after obtaining millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. More than 55 percent of Israel's population -- some 5.1 million people -- have received both doses of the vaccine. On the Palestinian side, just over 260,000 people have received their two doses in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian health ministry. From Wednesday to Thursday, 170 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the West Bank and Gaza, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to more than 312,000, 3,540 of them. In Israel, 25 new cases were recorded from Thursday to Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 840,000, with more than 6,420 deaths. The deal comes amid high tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, with violations of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers that went into effect on May 21, ending 11 days of Israeli assault. Late Thursday, Israeli fighter jets carried out air strikes on Gaza for a second time since the ceasefire. The military said they were in retaliation for three days of incendiary ballons launched from the Palestinian enclave. In Gaza, the coronavirus response has been hobbled by last month's fighting, which devastated infrastructure and reduced entire tower blocks to piles of smoking rubble. Search Keywords: Short link:

Israel launched a sweeping vaccination campaign after obtaining millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. More than 55 percent of Israel's population -- some 5.1 million people -- have received both doses of the vaccine. On the Palestinian side, just over 260,000 people have received their two doses in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian health ministry. From Wednesday to Thursday, 170 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the West Bank and Gaza, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to more than 312,000, 3,540 of them. In Israel, 25 new cases were recorded from Thursday to Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 840,000, with more than 6,420 deaths. The deal comes amid high tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, with violations of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers that went into effect on May 21, ending 11 days of Israeli assault. Late Thursday, Israeli fighter jets carried out air strikes on Gaza for a second time since the ceasefire. The military said they were in retaliation for three days of incendiary ballons launched from the Palestinian enclave. In Gaza, the coronavirus response has been hobbled by last month's fighting, which devastated infrastructure and reduced entire tower blocks to piles of smoking rubble. Search Keywords: Short link:

The Palestinian Authority did not immediately comment on the deal Israel is to provide around one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the Palestinian Authority in a swap as their expiry date looms, the Israeli prime minister's office said Israel is to provide around one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the Palestinian Authority in a swap as their expiry date looms, the Israeli prime minister's office said Friday. "Israel has signed an agreement with the Palestinian Authority, and will supply approximately one million doses of Pfizer vaccine that is about to expire," Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said, in a joint statement with the defence and health ministries. Israel "will receive in return the doses that Pfizer is to send to the Palestinian Authority," the statement added. The Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank, did not immediately comment on the deal.

News article:
By Hamodia Staff YERUSHALAYIM — Palestinian groups on Sunday demanded the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into Israel’s transfer of Pfizer covid vaccines to the Palestinian Authority. This comes in the wake of a blowup over the fact that the doses in the million vaccine shipment were soon to expire. After initially accepting the delivery, they decided to refuse it. Israeli officials insisted that the PA knew of the expiration date beforehand, and that the vaccines were perfectly safe to use. The Palestinian Coalition for Accountability and Integrity (AMAN) faulted the PA for its handling of the matter: “It is the responsibility of the Palestinian government, represented by the Ministry of Health, to announce the details of the deal before concluding it, in order to enhance the principle of transparency.” “Accordingly, AMAN demands the formation of an independent investigation committee, with the participation of representatives of civil society organizations, to investigate the merits of this deal.” The Palestinian Health Professions Syndicate and the Palestinian National Democratic Forum also demanded an investigation. Meanwhile, three countries have contacted Israel to inquire about the possibility of obtaining the vaccines, if Ramallah doesn’t want them, according to Haaretz. Citing an unnamed diplomatic source, the paper says Israel is in touch with the countries about doses set to expire in July. The Palestinian Authority rejected the transfer of more than a million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Israel after its health authorities determined that they “fall short of meeting the technical criteria,” PA Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said in a press conference late Friday, following Palestinian public criticism. The announcement came after Israel delivered a first shipment of 100,000 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the PA, within hours of the Israeli government’s announcement of the vaccine exchange agreement. Israel said it would supply up to 1.4 million doses of the vaccine immediately to the PA, and in September or October, when the doses purchased from Pfizer by the PA are due to arrive, the same number of doses would be returned to Israel. The exchange deal would allow a large number of Palestinians to be vaccinated months earlier than planned. However, after some of the vaccines had already been transferred to Palestinian possession, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced late Friday that he was canceling the shipment because they are expiring soon. Israel, however, said it had given the Palestinians that information. The PA’s reversal was taken after many Palestinians criticized the PA government over the deal with Israel, largely because the doses were about to expire. They called on the government to cancel the agreement. The Israeli Health Ministry said on Motzoei Shabbos that “the COVID-19 vaccines we gave the Palestinian Authority were perfectly valid. The expiration dates were known to the PA and everything was agreed upon in advance. The Palestinians received the same vaccines that are currently given to Israelis.” The PA government purchased four million vaccines from Pfizer and is hoping to receive them as soon as possible, she said, noting that it would continue to exert pressure on the company to provide the Palestinians with the vaccines they had purchased as soon as possible. Already on Thursday, before any formal announcement was made, the PA reportedly held issue with two conditions surrounding the transfer of the vaccines, one of which was that the agreement would not be signed under the “State of Palestine” and the second was that the vaccines would not be transferred to the Gaza Strip. “Yesterday, we informed the Israelis that we were giving up all vaccines because they had agreed not to supply some of them to Gaza,” the Palestinian health minister said Friday. “Today, they came back to us and agreed.”

By Aryeh Stern YERUSHALAYIM — Israel is set to drop a number of restrictions on air travel starting next month, including a ban on the entry of most individual tourists. The Interior Ministry announced on Sunday that beginning on next Thursday, July 1, all vaccinated tourists, whether they are arriving as individuals or as part of group tours, will be granted automatic entry into Israel, without the need for prior approval. From now until July 1, the Ministry said, tourists will still need to apply for approval prior to entering Israel, adding that approval will be granted based on a number of criteria. Chief among the deciding factors, the Ministry said, will be the tourist’s COVID-19 vaccination status. Unvaccinated tourists who are permitted to enter the country prior to July 1 will be required to remain in isolation 10 to 14 days, based on Health Ministry guidelines. Children under six who have not been vaccinated will be granted entry if their parents are approved based on the criteria. During the interim period, tourists will not be permitted into the country from nations with high COVID-19 infection rates, including India, Russia, Mexico, Braizl, South Africa, and Argentina. Exceptions to this ban will be made by a special committee. Israelis will be permitted to travel abroad freely, with the exception of countries on the black list with high infection rates. The exceptions committee will also evaluate requests for travel to the countries on the list. Foreign nationals will be permitted to leave Israel with no restrictions. Entry to foreign nationals will be open without prior approval for residents of most countries, though the Ministry said Sunday it is still drawing up a list of countries whose citizens will be required to seek permission to enter Israel. Automatic entry to Israel will be dependent on travelers having been vaccinated, and the Ministry said it will release details in the coming days regarding which COVID vaccines it will accept for the purposes of entering the country.

News article:
The Palestinian Authority (PA) plans to renew a deal to receive 1.4 million Pfizer vaccines from Israel, after rejecting the original supply due to the vaccines being too close to their expiration date. According to Wafa news agency, PA Health Minister Mai Alkaila confirmed yesterday that her office would renegotiate with Pfizer and the Israeli Ministry of Health on how to complete the implementation of the agreement in a way that would ensure the safety of the doses. "We will resume discussions with Pfizer to obtain the vaccines that expire at the end of the month of July as soon as possible, so that we have sufficient time to vaccinate all groups established according to the national vaccination plan," through which the PA hopes to achieve a 70 per cent rate of immunity, Alkaila said. The initial delivery of Pfizer-BioNtech doses failed to conform "to the specifications contained in the agreement, and accordingly, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh instructed the minister of health to cancel the agreement," PA spokesman, Ibrahim Melhem, said. "The government refuses to receive vaccines that are about to expire," he added. READ: A new mental health crisis is raging in Gaza Among the issues was Israel's objection to signing the agreement with the "State of Palestine", as well as an attempt to prevent the vaccines from going to the Gaza Strip, which was categorically rejected by the Ministry of Health, explained Alkaila. She stated that the ministry's responsibility includes all Palestinians. "We confirmed that we will send the doses anywhere, and no one imposes his will on this issue," she said. Israel, which has fully reopened after vaccinating some 85 per cent of its adult population, has faced criticism for medical apartheid and not sharing its vaccines with the 4.5 million Palestinians living under its occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. Rights groups have said that Israel, as an occupying power, is obliged to provide vaccines to the Palestinians. Israel denies having such an obligation, pointing to interim peace agreements reached with the Palestinians in the 1990s.

"We will resume discussions with Pfizer to obtain the vaccines that expire at the end of the month of July as soon as possible, so that we have sufficient time to vaccinate all groups established according to the national vaccination plan," through which the PA hopes to achieve a 70 per cent rate of immunity, Alkaila said. The initial delivery of Pfizer-BioNtech doses failed to conform "to the specifications contained in the agreement, and accordingly, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh instructed the minister of health to cancel the agreement," PA spokesman, Ibrahim Melhem, said. "The government refuses to receive vaccines that are about to expire," he added. READ: A new mental health crisis is raging in Gaza Among the issues was Israel's objection to signing the agreement with the "State of Palestine", as well as an attempt to prevent the vaccines from going to the Gaza Strip, which was categorically rejected by the Ministry of Health, explained Alkaila. She stated that the ministry's responsibility includes all Palestinians. "We confirmed that we will send the doses anywhere, and no one imposes his will on this issue," she said. Israel, which has fully reopened after vaccinating some 85 per cent of its adult population, has faced criticism for medical apartheid and not sharing its vaccines with the 4.5 million Palestinians living under its occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. Rights groups have said that Israel, as an occupying power, is obliged to provide vaccines to the Palestinians. Israel denies having such an obligation, pointing to interim peace agreements reached with the Palestinians in the 1990s.

Travelers leaving Israel are required starting Tuesday to declare they aren’t heading to high-risk countries with widespread COVID-19 that have been blacklisted by the Health Ministry. The directive, announced by the ministry on Monday, will apply to Israeli citizens and residents 16 and older. The form, which must be signed 24 hours prior to leaving the country, can be accessed here. The measure comes as the government has ramped up restrictions on entry to the country in light of the renewed outbreak of the Delta variant in the country, primarily due to arrivals from abroad. The countries where Israelis are currently banned from traveling, per a Health Ministry order, are Argentina, Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico and Russia. On Sunday, ministers in the cabinet decided that anyone who travels to those six countries will be fined NIS 5,000 ($1,500). The Health Ministry on Sunday added Belarus and Kyrgyzstan to the list of nations with a “critical travel warning,” joining Uganda, Uruguay, the United Arab Emirates, Seychelles, Ethiopia, Bolivia, Namibia, Paraguay, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Tunisia.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Sunday appointed Roni Numa to oversee COVID-19 screening at Ben Gurion Airport and other international crossings — widely seen as one of the country’s weak points in curbing the spread of the virus. “The responsibility will be to deal with this now as well as look toward the future,” Bennett said. “Vaccinations do not always work. There can be variants, next month, next year or in four years, for which there is no vaccine. Therefore, in Israel, which does not have very many crossings — in effect it is a kind of island — there is no reason why we cannot protect ourselves even if there is no vaccine.” Advertisement Bennett has encouraged Israelis to avoid nonessential travel. There are currently 1,254 active COVID-19 cases in Israel, with 145 new infections diagnosed on Sunday after weeks in which the daily caseload remained in the low dozens. There are 22 people in serious condition from the disease.

News article:
Israel is holding negotiations with the United Kingdom to broker a COVID-19 vaccine swap deal, according to an Israeli television report Wednesday. Under the exchange, Israel, which currently has an excess of doses, would ship around 1 million of its Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that are due to expire on July 30 to the UK, Channel 12 news reported. In exchange, the Health Ministry would receive an equivalent number of vaccines that the UK is slated to receive from Pfizer in September. The network described the talks on the proposed deal as “advanced” and said the shipments could begin as soon as next week. Israel is said to have around 1.4 million doses set to expire at the end of next month. Israel is also reportedly seeking answers from Pfizer on whether it can use the vaccines it already has past their declared expiration date. But without a clear answer, the network said Israel was warning it will not offer the first COVID shot to Israelis after July 9, since there will not be unexpired vaccines for their second dose three weeks later. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Government officials have been encouraging Israelis — adolescents in particular — to get a first shot before the July 9 deadline so they can get their second dose before the expiration date. On Monday, Kan news reported that the Health Ministry would destroy at least 800,000 expiring coronavirus vaccine doses if no buyers are found for them in the next two weeks. The vaccine doses are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the broadcaster. Earlier this month, Israel attempted a similar vaccine deal with the Palestinian Authority, but it fell through after the PA backtracked from receiving soon-to-be-expired doses, claiming they were not up to snuff. The PA later said it would seek to renegotiate the deal. Advertisement Israel said the vaccines were fine and that it was using them itself as part of its drive to vaccinate children aged 12 to 15. The push to get young Israelis vaccinated comes as Israel deals with a renewed rise in coronavirus cases, with much of the jump linked to schools and the spread of the more contagious Delta variant from abroad. As of Wednesday evening, Health Ministry figures showed 5,587,320 people out of Israel’s population of some 9.3 million have gotten their first vaccine shot. Of those, 5,167,674 received their second dose. The ministry also reported 224 new cases since midnight, bringing the number of active infections to 1,882. The positivity rate on the close to 41,000 tests performed Wednesday was 0.5 percent, similar to the past few days. The number of serious cases, which have remained stable since daily cases began increasing again, ticked up slightly to 26. The death toll remained at 6,429, with only one fatality in over two weeks, indicating the success of Israel’s mass national vaccination campaign in protecting against serious morbidity and mortality.

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Asia Tags: ChinaIranXi JinpingDefenseForeign Policy Ahead of Xi’s visit to Tehran, Sino-Iranian military cooperation looks to expand. China is often regarded as one of the prime beneficiaries of the Iran nuclear deal, signed in July 2015 with the P5+1 countries. Under the deal, Iran will limit its uranium enrichment and make other changes to its nuclear program in exchange for the termination of sanctions. This potential opening could provide Chinese state-owned energy companies a chance to increase their involvement with Iran’s oil and natural gas industries, and Iran could become a more important export market for a range of Chinese products. Beijing may also assist Tehran in building infrastructure as part of the massive Eurasian development project known as “One Belt, One Road,” as well as offer financing through the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Many agreements are likely to be announced during Chinese president Xi Jinping’s inaugural visit to Iran, planned for late January. A more worrisome, but overlooked, aspect of China’s growing ties with Iran could occur in the arms sector. A bit of historical context is needed here. In the 1980s and early 1990s, China was a major supplier of advanced weapons to Iran in areas ranging from tanks and fighter jets to fast-attack patrol craft and anti-ship missiles. Beijing was driven not only by profit motivations, but also, it seems, by a strategic desire to strengthen Iran as a bulwark against excessive U.S. influence in the Middle East. Chinese arms sales to Iran gradually declined in the late 1990s and 2000s, due to pressure from the United States and the imposition of UN sanctions against Iran. Those sanctions initially prohibited involvement with Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile industries, and were later expanded to cover major conventional weapons, such as combat aircraft and warships. Iran was also increasingly seen as a ‘pariah state,’ a status symbolized by the UN embargo, which discouraged China from maintaining overly close security ties with Tehran. Consequently, China’s arms relationship with Iran has been left largely moribund in the past decade. The Iran nuclear deal could spawn a resurgence of Chinese arms exports to Iran by lifting UN sanctions and helping diminish Iran’s ‘pariah state’ status. China, and other states, would be allowed to export major conventional weapons to Iran in the next eight years with UN Security Council approval. After eight years, even those restrictions would be lifted, assuming Iran complies with the agreement. In addition, certain types of weapons could be sold to Iran without a waiver. For instance, Russia has argued that its sale of S-300 missile defenses to Iran are permissible because this system is not specifically prohibited under the nuclear deal. China could make a similar argument regarding small arms, short-range missiles and other systems. In the coming years, China might attempt to sell a wide variety of advanced arms to Iran. These could include J-10 fighters, the possible sale of which has been reported in Chinese media. Another system would be the Houbei-class high-speed missile boat, which China is also poised to sell to Pakistan. This would be a logical choice given the expanding navy-to-navy relationship between China and Iran. China might also transfer advanced cruise missiles and technical know-how, allowing Iran to improve its domestic cruise missile program. Other systems could include UAVs, space and counter-space weapons, missile defense components and electronic warfare systems. Sales of most of these items would likely require UN approval, which China might attempt to secure as a permanent member of the Security Council. The implications of enhanced Sino-Iranian arms cooperation for the United States and regional security could be significant. Provision of high-speed missile boats, anti-ship missiles, and other systems would allow Iran to strengthen its “anti-access/area-denial” (A2/AD) capabilities—referring to the ability to hold U.S. forces at bay in the event of a crisis. Indeed, China would be in an excellent position to assist Iran in enhancing its A2/AD capabilities since Beijing has been developing weapons of just this sort to counter U.S. intervention—notably in the context of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. For instance, Iran could use Chinese-supplied arms to increase the threat to U.S. naval ships in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategically vital channel for Gulf state oil exports to world markets. Iran might also use these weapons to conduct additional provocative exercises explicitly targeting U.S. forces in the region. In February 2015, Iranian forces destroyed a mock U.S. aircraft carrier using high-speed boats, shoulder-launched rockets, and cruise missiles. In December, Iran test-fired a missile within 1500 yards of the U.S. carrier Harry S. Truman, which was transiting the Strait of Hormuz. Chinese support could lead to a continuation or expansion of such destabilizing activities. Chinese military assistance could also enable Iran to improve its long-range missile capabilities, which could endanger more distant U.S. military targets, such as U.S. facilities on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. China has pledged to adhere to Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines limiting transfer of components and technologies that can be used in long-range ballistic and cruise missiles, but its compliance with its commitments has sometimes been problematic. Chinese arms exports to Iran could also pose proliferation concerns. For instance, as part of its effort to expand influence in the region, Iran could elect to re-export weapons to states such as Syria, where Tehran is militarily supporting the Assad regime. Iran may also transfer Chinese-made arms to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as to Shi’a militias in Iraq. These groups could in turn use Iran-supplied arms to strike military and civilian targets. Of course, Chinese foreign ministry officials would likely push against a significant resumption of arms sales to Iran. Doing so would pose a challenge to China’s desire for positive relations with the United States. Major arms sales would also needlessly disrupt China’s relations with a variety of other states in the region that are on poor terms with Tehran, such as Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Turkey. Some Chinese firms may also be cautious about running afoul of U.S. sanctions, which will continue to target Iran on human rights and counter-terrorism grounds. However, the People’s Liberation Army and Chinese arms manufacturers may lobby in favor of renewed arms exports to Iran. As in the past, some Chinese military strategists could portray arms sales as a way to counter U.S. ‘hegemony’ in the Middle East and build a more multi-polar world order. For their part, Chinese arms traders could seek to retain their competitive advantage by exploiting an important new market. Ultimately, it would be up to China’s top leaders, including President Xi Jinping, to arbitrate between these different perspectives and decide whether and how to re-engage Iran in the arms sector. The United States can take steps to mitigate the risks of a resurgence of Sino-Iranian arms cooperation. Washington should work with Britain, France, and other partners in the UN Security Council to deny waivers for sales of major conventional weapons to Iran. Continuing U.S. sanctions on Iran should also be vigorously enforced, as should potential new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile program. U.S. officials should also press their Chinese counterparts to avoid selling the most advanced systems to Iran and to adhere strictly to MTCR limits on missile technology exports. The argument should be that greatly improved military capabilities could allow Tehran to conduct a more brazen and bellicose foreign policy. This would undermine China’s enduring need for stability in a region from which it continues to receive over half of its oil supply. Thus, Beijing’s restraint on arms sales would not only avoid tensions with Washington and many others, including Riyadh and Tel Aviv, but would also fundamentally support China’s own strategic interests.

News article:
(Recasts, adds details, context, changes slug) BEIJING, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an unusual visit next week to Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a bitter dispute, in what could be a bid by Beijing to act as an “honest broker” as it seeks a greater regional diplomatic role. While relying on the region for oil supplies, China has tended to leave Middle Eastern diplomacy to the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - the United States, Britain, France and Russia. But China has been trying to get more involved, especially in Syria, recently hosting both its foreign minister and opposition officials. In a brief statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said Xi would visit Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt on his Jan. 19-23 visit. It provided no other details. A Chinese president has not visited Saudi Arabia since 2009 when Hu Jintao went, and Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit Iran, going in 2002. Tensions between the Sunni Muslim kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim Iran have escalated since Saudi authorities executed Shi’ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr on Jan. 2, triggering outrage among Shi’ites across the Middle East. In response, Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran and its consulate in Mashhad, prompting Riyadh to sever relations. Tehran then cut all commercial ties with Riyadh, and banned pilgrims from travelling to Mecca. Last week, a Chinese envoy visited Saudi Arabia and Iran, where he called for both countries to exercise calm and restraint amid their on-going feud. “China is trying to present itself as an honest broker between Saudi and Iran, much as it has done between the Syrian government and opposition,” said one Beijing-based diplomat, who is familiar with China’s Middle East policy. Li Shaoxian, vice president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government think-tank, said China had to step up to the plate in the Middle East, but stressed China’s role would be different from other superpowers. “The Middle East is a touchstone for major powers,” Li said. “Whether it is a graveyard depends on whether a country seeks hegemony,” Li said, adding that was not China’s intention. The Middle East, however, is fraught with risk for China, a country that has little experience navigating the religious and political tensions that frequently wrack the region. Diplomatic sources said the Iran and Saudi trips had originally been mooted for last year. But it was cancelled after a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies began air strikes in Yemen against the Iran-allied Shi’ite Houthi movement, as China apparently did not want to be seen to be taking sides in the Yemen civil war. China also has its own worries about radicalisation of the Muslim Uighur people who live in China’s far western region of Xinjiang, which has been beset by violence in recent years, blamed by Beijing on Islamist militants. This week, China said it wanted to develop deeper defence and anti-terrorism ties with the Arab world, including joint exercises, intelligence sharing and training. China says some Uighurs have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with militant groups there. In November, Islamic State said it had killed a Chinese citizen it had taken hostage in the Middle East.

News article:
(Recasts, adds details, context, changes slug) BEIJING, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an unusual visit next week to Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a bitter dispute, in what could be a bid by Beijing to act as an “honest broker” as it seeks a greater regional diplomatic role. While relying on the region for oil supplies, China has tended to leave Middle Eastern diplomacy to the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - the United States, Britain, France and Russia. But China has been trying to get more involved, especially in Syria, recently hosting both its foreign minister and opposition officials. In a brief statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said Xi would visit Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt on his Jan. 19-23 visit. It provided no other details. A Chinese president has not visited Saudi Arabia since 2009 when Hu Jintao went, and Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit Iran, going in 2002. Tensions between the Sunni Muslim kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim Iran have escalated since Saudi authorities executed Shi’ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr on Jan. 2, triggering outrage among Shi’ites across the Middle East. In response, Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran and its consulate in Mashhad, prompting Riyadh to sever relations. Tehran then cut all commercial ties with Riyadh, and banned pilgrims from travelling to Mecca. Last week, a Chinese envoy visited Saudi Arabia and Iran, where he called for both countries to exercise calm and restraint amid their on-going feud. “China is trying to present itself as an honest broker between Saudi and Iran, much as it has done between the Syrian government and opposition,” said one Beijing-based diplomat, who is familiar with China’s Middle East policy. Li Shaoxian, vice president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government think-tank, said China had to step up to the plate in the Middle East, but stressed China’s role would be different from other superpowers. “The Middle East is a touchstone for major powers,” Li said. “Whether it is a graveyard depends on whether a country seeks hegemony,” Li said, adding that was not China’s intention.

News article:
China Gears Up to Play Bigger Role in Middle East Politics by Saibal Dasgupta January 14, 2016 Chinese President Xi Jinping's first official visit to the Middle East next week is a signal of Beijing's intention to be a major player in Mideast affairs, analysts say. The Chinese government has not yet announced specifics of Xi's Mideast tour. But official agencies in Iran and Egypt say he will visit the region beginning January 20. This would be the first time in 12 years a Chinese president will visit the two countries. Xi is also expected to visit Saudi Arabia. China, has been signaling its growing interest in dealing with thorny issues in the Middle East. Beijing issued its first ever policy paper on the Arab world on Wednesday, promising to support Arab governments in their fight against terrorism through long-term security cooperation, intelligence sharing and technical cooperation. In December it hosted Syrian Deputy Prime Minister Walid al-Moallem, and also representatives of the Syrian opposition. Beijing recently sent Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming to Saudi Arabia and Iran to help lower tension caused by the execution of a controversial Shi'ite cleric and the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran. The recent moves sparked speculation that China might send its troops to Syria to fight alongside Russian soldiers. Analysts are asking why China wants to step into a diplomatic mine field that poses serious risks. "If you are able to make a difference in the Middle East, you will be regarded as a major country. China faces restrictions in the Middle East, but it is ready to play its role," said Li Shaoxian, vice president of Institute of Contemporary International Relations, a government-run think tank. But Li says, 'Unlike Russia, China has no need or aspirations for a military role. We can accept anything that is in line with the desires of local people in another country.' China is worried that disruptive events in the Middle East may impact the thinking in its vast Muslim population. It is possible that thousands of Chinese Muslims have migrated to fight for different forces in Syria, he said. Managing contradictions Analysts say there are signs Chinese leaders are determined to get a taste of managing disputes in the Middle East, which it has avoided for decades. One in particular is its effort to be friendly with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. "China is trying to strike a delicate balance. It wants to support the Palestinian cause because this will earn it respect and sympathy in the Middle East. But it cannot turn its back on the useful technologies that Israel can supply," Daud Abdullah, director of the London-based Middle East Monitor told VOA. "We know, for instance, that Israel has been covertly supplying to China the arms know-how it acquired from the U.S." Most analysts believe China will tread carefully, because taking sides in the tumultuous Mideast can have negative repercussions in its own region of Xinjiang, which is a hotbed of Islamic terrorism. For example, it is careful not to take a stance that would displease Turkey because Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang are Turkic speaking people. "I think China is trying to find a political role for itself in the Middle East. It is difficult for China to stay neutral, but it is going to give it a try," Francesco Sisci, professor at the Renmin University in Beijing, said. Economic motives The Middle East is important because the region is one of the three routes chosen for China's Silk Road program, which is expected to boost the Chinese economy in a big way, Sisci said. "Beijing will try to be neutral with regard to tensions among Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria. But they want China to take a more clear cut stance," Hichem Karoui, political adviser at the Diplomatic Institute at Qatar, said. Li cited three other reasons why China wants to play a major role in the Middle East. More than half of China's energy imports come from the region. It is an important aspect of the Silk Road program, which involves building infrastructure projects across several countries. And it is essential to play an important role in the Middle East to be taken seriously as a major power, he said. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) China will continue to adopt a balanced approach to its engagement with the Middle East, according to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming Monday. The announcement comes days before a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Iran and Saudi Arabia, a visit that is thought to signal a change in the Chinese government's policy in the region. Diplomatic tension between the region's two competing powers was ignited anew when Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shi'a cleric Nimr Al-Nimr. This was followed by attacks on Saudi diplomatic buildings in Iran by angry protestors. Saudi Arabia responded to the attacks on its diplomatic mission by severing all diplomatic ties with Iran. Zhang confirmed that China is a disinterested party in the conflict. "Regarding some of the region's problems, China has always taken a balanced and just position," he said. "The world won't be calm unless the Middle East is stable. No country can achieve development without being stable," Zhang continued. China depends on the Middle East to provide oil to its growing economy; however, it has never interfered with Middle Eastern politics, allowing other permanent UN Security Council members to address issues that have arisen. The Chinese vice foreign minister confirmed that his country will cooperate with Iran in energy production, after sanctions were lifted from the country last year. The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, reported that China plans for Iran to be a part of the New Silk Road initiative to develop trade routes across Asia. "After the sanctions lift, Iran's economy can develop faster, but it needs the technological support to update its infrastructure," the report read. Iran experienced its first day without sanctions Sunday, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Iran's commitment to its deal with the West. Last week, Zhang Ming visited both Riyadh and Tehran and urged both countries to ease the hostilities. Zhang addressed possible methods to resolve the current tensions and repeated his message in Tehran, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. In the past month, China hosted members from both the Syrian regime and the opposition to urge both sides to find a solution to the Syrian civil war. China is considered to be a safeguarding force of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad. It voted against UN resolutions aimed at addressing the Syrian crisis four times. China published its first official Arab policy paper, claiming to "support Arab countries" struggling to uphold sovereignty and territorial integrity, pursue and safeguard national interests, and combat external interference and aggression. Within this framework, it emphasised its support for the Arab league in its effort to establish an independent Palestinian state. The Chinese president will also visit Egypt during his trip to the Middle East. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi highlighted the importance of the Chinese president's visit to Cairo. In a meeting with Prime Minister Sherif Ismail and the ministers of trade, transportation and housing, President Al-Sisi discussed the projects to be established in cooperation with China. Conversation also addressed the manner in which Egypt can participate in China's New Silk Road initiative. Emanuele Scimia, a foreign affairs analyst at the South China Morning Post believes that China is trying to moderately change its non-interference policy in the Middle East and North Africa and shift to a more assertive engagement in the region. According to Scimia, soft-power diplomacy alone will not be enough for China to realise its aims. "The problem for Beijing is that diplomacy can hinge on trade and investment, but it must also be supported by military presence: something that China lacks at the moment," Scimia told the Daily News Egypt.

News article:
With relations between Beijing and Riyadh anchored by Saudi Arabia's extensive oil exports to China (totaling 1/6 of China's overall imports), it is Xi's visit to Tehran, scheduled for the end of his trip, which has analysts worried. This will be the first visit by a Chinese leader to Iran in nearly a decade and a half, and comes right on time for Beijing, the newspaper suggests. "The trip comes just days after the lifting of international sanctions on Iran under the Obama administration-backed nuclear accord that went into effect over the weekend, and analysts say Beijing is eager to get in on the ground floor as the Iranian government scrambles to end its diplomatic isolation and ink deals with foreign investors," The Washington Times writes. Furthermore, with tensions between Riyadh and Tehran on the rise, "some believe Mr. Xi's goal is to promote a message that both Riyadh and Tehran would be wise to embrace China – not Washington – as the partner of the future."

News article:
Xi Jinping's Charm Offensive: China Extends a Helping Hand to the Mideast Sputnik News 13:04 22.01.2016(updated 13:36 22.01.2016) Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran as part of a five-day trip, which has seen Beijing ink billion-dollar deals and boost ties in the Middle East at a time when Washington's presence in the oil-rich region is becoming less pronounced. Xi's tour is largely focused on economic and energy cooperation with the Arab world, the South China Morning Post noted. But 'it is also a mission to forge closer political, diplomatic and military ties with countries and to promote China's image and influence as a global power, resembling what the Middle Kingdom was 2,000 years ago,' the newspaper asserted. Xi's tour first brought him to Saudi Arabia, China's largest oil supplier, earlier this week. The Chinese president and King Salman agreed to foster energy cooperation between the two countries and oversaw the opening of a major Yanbu oil refinery, a joint Saudi Aramco and Sinopec venture. In addition, China announced that it plans to finalize 'a comprehensive free trade agreement' with the Gulf Cooperation Council later this year. The talks on the issue were launched in 2004, but the process was suspended in 2009. Xi later traveled to Egypt. China's state-run news agency Xinhua described the ties between the two countries as a 'comprehensive strategic partnership.' Incidentally, the same formula was applied with regard to China's relations with the oil kingdom and Iran. The two-day visit of the Chinese president to the North African nation produced more than 20 agreements covering civil aviation, electricity, higher education, science, media, banking and trade. The Chinese president also said that Beijing plans to invest as much as $15 billion in Egypt's economy as both countries agreed to promote cooperation under Xi's signature foreign policy initiative, known as the One Belt, One Road. Ahead of his visit to the Islamic Republic, Xi noted that Beijing wants 'to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran.' He also announced plans to provide humanitarian aid to Syria, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon and Jordan amounting to almost $35 million in 2016. Xi's tour comes a week after Beijing unveiled its first official strategy towards the Middle East. Known as the Arab Policy Paper, the document called for greater political, economic, energy and security cooperation with the region. Relations between China and the Arab world, according to the brief, should be based on the One Belt, One Road development strategy. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Dubai: Australia is putting trade relations with the Middle East in focus as the government tries to manage a widening budget deficit and a slowdown in its largest trading partner, China. This week, Australian Minister for Tourism and International Education, Senator Richard Colbeck, will visit Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia to drum up interest in Australia’s health, education and tourism sectors. The visit, part of the country’s annual regional trade campaign, comes as Australia faces concerns a recession may be nearing, which could bring 24 years of consecutive economic growth to an end. After a decade long resource export boom, Australia’s economy is having to rebalance itself to weaker demand in China and falling commodity prices globally. Senator Colbeck, who is also Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade, told Gulf News in an interview in Dubai on Sunday that the slowdown in China is one reason Australia is looking to boost the presence of its services industry in the Middle East. On Sunday, Senator Colbeck oversaw the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and a Dubai governmental department, Dubai Exports, to facilitate trade for manufacturers, exports, traders and service providers. Generating new demand of its services sector would be of significant benefit to Australia’s economy. The services sector accounts for 70 per cent of the Australian economy and even more for employment, but contracted in the last quarter of 2015. The contraction came as the government said last month that the deficit in 2015-2016 will reach 37.4 billion Australian dollars (Dh96 billion), up from a previous forecast of A$35.1 billion. In fact, its deficit will widen every year on previous estimates to at least 2018-2019 when it’s now projected to reach A$14.2 billion, up from A$6.9 billion. But while Australia is looking for Middle East trade to boost its economy, that currently accounts for just A$16 billion in bilateral trade a year compared to $213 billion with China. Meanwhile, the Australian economy is now expected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2015-2016, not 2.75 per cent as previously thought. For 2018-2019, it has been revised to 3 per cent, down from 3.5 per cent. Free trade negotiations In ministerial meetings this week, Senator Colbeck will push to restart Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The GCC, which is Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, froze all FTA negotiations in 2009. “We’re very, very keen to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the GCC countries … we think that’s a big opportunity for us,” he said, adding that Australia is “anxious to start negotiating.” Senator Colbeck’s agenda includes meeting with UAE Minister of Economy Sultan Bin Saeed Al Mansouri and Chief Executive and Executive Director of Dubai-sovereign wealth fund Investment Corporation of Dubai Mohammad Al Shaibani. He is also believed to be meeting with Qatar’s Ministry of Economy in Doha. Australia is keen on sealing an FTA with the GCC following similar agreements with China, Japan and South Korea in 2014. Australia’s government hopes an FTA will increase trade and investment, particularly in Australian infrastructure, agriculture and tourism projects. “It’s very important for our country that we do have a strong flow of investment from outside Australia. There isn’t enough capital within our country to do a lot of the development we need to do.” Senator Colbeck said. Senior negotiator Gulf countries are already major foreign investors in Australia. The UAE is Australia’s 15th largest trading partner and 10th biggest foreign investor, including in ports, airports and electricity networks. But while Australia may be pushing this week for GCC-FTA talks, its senior negotiator Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who spearheaded the agreements with China, Japan and South Korea, is missing from the delegation. Senator Colbeck dismissed suggestions the absence of Minister Robb, a senior minister compared to Senator Colbeck, is a sign that Australia is waning interest in GCC negotiations. Australia is also negotiating an FTA with India. “I’ve been appointed as the minister assisting Andrew [Robb] in those trade negotiations so I don’t necessarily see that it sends any particular signal at all. We have a minister here, we have 80-odd businesses and institutions with us. We’re very, very keen and I’ll be conducting those discussions and negotiations with all the vigour I can muster,” he said. Next week, an Australian delegation of 25 companies led by a Saudi-based official will visit Egypt as part of the trade campaign. Facbox: Australian Middle East trade won’t pivot to Iran Australia’s trade and investment priorities in the Middle East are unlikely to change following the lifting of sanctions against Iran earlier this month, a government minister told Gulf News Sunday. “I don’t think we forget our good friends ... We have very good relationships here. We know the business community. We have good relationships with government. I don’t think that in any sense there is any thought or value in forgetting those that have been our friends for a long period of time. That just doesn’t make sense to me,” Australia’s Minister for Tourism and International Education and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade Senator Richard Colbeck said in Dubai. Australia has close political and economic relations with many Arab Middle East states, including the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members.

News article:
With the lifting of economic sanctions against Iran already in place, Tehran and Beijing have started to revive bilateral trade and economic ties, the Chinese newspaper Renmin Ribao (People's Daily) reported. The newspaper quoted Hua Liming, former Chinese Ambassador to Iran, the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands, as saying that Sino-Iranian economic and trade ties, which have suffered severe setbacks over the past 30-plus years, are set to enter a new phase in the coming years. "As the sanctions have been lifted, Iran's oil exports are back on track," Hua said, adding that the Iranian economy is most likely to benefit not only from oil exports to China, but also from Chinese investment and technology.

© Unknown Iran is the new China? That may be the case - from Tehran clinching a deal to buy 114 planes from Airbus to Iranian oil soon hitting Western markets. But the key question is actually how, at what pace, and with what partners Tehran plans to rejoin global markets.All the commotion, at the moment, predictably revolves around oil. Iran's Deputy Oil Minister for Commerce and International Affairs, Amir Hossein Zamaninia, said the new oil export target is an extra 500,000 barrels a day within a few months. Tehran may indeed boost production by 600,000 barrels a day in six months, and add up to 800,000 barrels a day in output before the end of 2016.Not even the sharper oil analysts really know what this will mean in terms of an all-out, open market-share battle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. What even some sections of Western corporate media are not buying anymore are Saudi diversionist tactics about their cheap oil strategy - which has been essentially designed to hurt Iran, and Russia.Over 1,000 lines of credit have been opened for banks, according to President Hassan Rouhani. Energy-hungry Europeans are predictably going nuts. Even with non-denial denials, the fact is Shell executives, for instance, are already in Tehran, talking about Iran's "energy potential" and solidifying their positioning as Iran's "prime partner" in energy. Meanwhile, Iran's oil tankers are already sailing under Lloyd's insurance.Into this frenzy steps in none other than the aspiring 'New Master of the Universe'; Chinese President Xi Jinping, currently on a ultra high-profile Middle East tour of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and, of course, Iran.Take the strategic cooperation agreement signed this Tuesday in Riyadh between Aramco and China's Sinopec. It may be worth no more than $1.5 billion, but there will be others in its wake; after all Saudi Arabia, on and off, remains the biggest supplier of crude oil to China.Yet the really crucial strategic partnership here is Beijing-Tehran.China has been Iran's biggest trade partner since 2010, as well as the top buyer of Iranian crude and non-petroleum products (ore, agriculture) even under UN, US and EU sanctions.And in a graphic demonstration for the entire world to see, Xi is the first head of state to visit Iran since nuclear-related sanctions were lifted this past weekend.All this leads to a long-term question: is Iran the new China, in terms of a capitalist development bonanza, and will Iran follow a Chinese-style, centrally controlled, development project from now on?What's certain is that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei stressed over and over again that the renewal of negotiations with the US touched only the nuclear issue. And he repeatedly warned about the cultural, political and security consequences of an economic opening that could eventually weaken the Islamic Republic.So forget about Iran as a US partner. That won't happen. In the West, the privileged partner will be the EU, especially concerning investment in energy and in the sprawling, young, educated, virtually "virgin" Iranian market. And then, there's Eurasia integration.Relations with Russia will remain solid - from the need to secure Iran's northern frontier to a counterbalance to the American encirclement (which remains in place). Tehran and Moscow still need to solve the status of the Caspian Sea. But both share serious strategic interests in the Caucasus-Caspian-Central Asia arc - from fighting Salafi-jihadism (whose ideological matrix is, who else, Saudi Arabia) to the most crucial categorical imperative; the drive by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) for a Central Asian security mechanism limiting all Washington's options.It certainly does not hurt that militarily Iran finally received Russia's S-300 missiles, and their political-military coordination is in full effect; see for instance those Russian cruise missiles launched from the Caspian last October against ISIS/ISIL/Daesh traversing Iranian airspace.The same applies to Afghanistan; Iran - and the SCO - will do what it takes to prevent Afghanistan from being a perennial jihadist platform.And in the 'Pipelineistan' domain, Iran's relations with Pakistan tend to stabilize; after all Islamabad badly needs the Iran-Pakistan (IP) pipeline, which will eventually become IPI (reaching India, with which Iran has excellent relations).And that brings us back once again to the ultimate confrontation; the vicious proxy war between Tehran and the (collapsing) House of Saud on multiple theaters, from "Syraq", Bahrain and Yemen to the oil market.Xi Jinping's Middle East trip cannot possibly work as a messianic cure. The strategic relationship that matters is Beijing-Tehran - from the energy sphere to Eurasia integration via One Belt, One Road. But Beijing also needs Saudi oil.Warrior prince Mohammed bin Sultan - who's actually running the show in Riyadh - is thinking of selling Aramco. Why not offer it to Beijing? But be prepared to be paid in yuan. And all the oil goes to China. Talk about a New Silk Road offer one can't refuse.
