News article:
Just as is anticipated of Rouhani’s visits to Italy and France, the Chinese visit to Tehran focused on trade deals in the wake of the lifting of US-led sanctions. But President Xi’s discussions with the Iranian leadership reportedly also touched upon political issues to such an extent that the two countries were able to announce the formulation of a “comprehensive strategic partnership.” In part, this entails an arrangement for annual visits between the foreign ministers of China and Iran, as Beijing seeks long-term benefits from the Iranian oil economy and Tehran seeks strong Eastern backers. The Diplomat indicates that the Iranians specifically view their burgeoning relationship with Beijing as a means of challenging the established partnership between the US and Iran’s main regional rival, Saudi Arabia. This perceived potential has given Xi incentive to privilege his visit to Iran, even though Beijing is ostensibly trying to balance its interests in Iran and Saudi Arabia. In light of Tehran’s eagerness, the visit reportedly resulted in the conclusion of 17 trade agreements, aimed at building the economic exchanges between the two countries to a value of 600 billion dollars over the next 10 years. These developments once again focus attention upon some international analysts’ longstanding concerns about the possible development of an “Eastern bloc” that could present a serious challenge to Western global interests and even the international oil market’s current dependence upon US currency. On Monday, Quadrangle further highlighted this threat by pointing out that at the same time China depends upon Iranian oil for its economic interests, Russia depends upon Iran for the sake of its new approach to national security. That approach specifically entails greater confrontation with the West, as evidenced by contrary Russian and US positions on the ongoing conflict in Syria. Iran’s economic agreements with China and its security collaborations with Russia raise questions about Western efforts to normalize relations with Iran. On Monday, an editorial in the Los Angeles Times emphasized that the Iranian regime has been resistant to these efforts and has maintained a strong trend of anti-Western propaganda. Indeed, SB News reported that Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had welcomed the Chinese visit by saying that Tehran never trusted the West and was prepared to reward China for the help that they had offered while sanctions were still in effect.

News article:
By James M. Dorsey President Xi Jinping went from Riyadh to Iran this month to become the first foreign leader to do so following the lifting of international sanctions against the Islamic republic. Saudi leaders could not have been pleased. To be sure, China and Saudi Arabia (and Egypt) signed US$55 billion worth of cooperation agreements during Xi’s visit, including a nuclear cooperation pact. Yet Xi’s determination to gain a first mover advantage in Iran at a time that Saudi Arabia is seeking to increase rather than reduce the Islamic Republic’s international isolation suggests that more than commerce is at play here. Xi’s visit to the kingdom was accompanied by talk of brotherly relations and strategic cooperation. The rhetoric however did little to mask serious differences on issues ranging from Syria to Saudi propagation of Wahhabism, a puritan interpretation of Islam that many fear breeds jihadism, and a relative decline in Chinese reliance on Saudi oil. At odds over Syria Chinese officials worry that alleged Saudi funding of Islamic schools or madrasahs in Xinjiang may be encouraging Uighur militants who have staged several attacks in a low intensity campaign for equal rights and autonomy, if not independence. Saudi officials have assured their Chinese counterparts that they do not support the violence despite the fact that the Uighurs, some of whom have joined Islamic State (IS), are Turkic-speaking Sunni Muslims. Those assurances appear to have done little to put Chinese concerns to rest. “Our biggest worry in the Middle East isn’t oil – it’s Saudi Arabia,” a Chinese analyst told the Asia Times. Religious affinity is however not something China has to worry about with Shiite-majority Iran, which has long projected itself as a revolutionary rather than a sectarian power. China supports the Iranian-backed regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and favours Russian intervention in Syria to prop up the Assad regime – a position that puts it at odds with Saudi Arabia that backs the rebels and has hinted at intervening militarily on their behalf. Russian and US airstrikes against Saudi-backed Islamist rebels have allowed Syrian and Kurdish forces to gain increasing control of much of Syria’s borders, making it more difficult for Uighurs to find their way to Syria. Several hundred Uighurs are believed to have joined IS, which recently released its first Chinese-language recruitment video. This adds to China’s concerns about Xinjiang. Redressing balances In anticipation of the lifting of the sanctions, China has furthermore stepped up naval cooperation with Iran. A visit to Iran last October by Chinese Admiral Sun Jianguo, who is widely seen as the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) next naval commander, produced a draft memorandum of understanding for closer cooperation in counterterrorism, cyberwarfare, and intelligence sharing. Sun’s visit followed joint Chinese-Iranian search-and-rescue naval exercises and training exercises in 2014 in the Gulf. The exercises, involving two Chinese warships were held close to the base of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain at a time of tension between the United States and Iran over the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme. The visit built on a long-standing security and military relationship that China was forced to temporarily curtail as a result of the sanctions. Nonetheless, China sold Iran anti-riot gear and tracking technology in 2009 which were used to counter anti-government protests against the allegedly fraudulent election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The protests coincided with riots in Xinjiang. Chinese-Iranian military relations date back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s when China was the Islamic republic’s main military hardware supplier. Those supplies caused tension with the United States when in 1987 Iran fired Chinese-made Silkworm missiles at Kuwaiti vessels in the Gulf. Forced to halt the supply of sophisticated weaponry, China helped Iran kick start the development of an indigenous military-industrial sector evident in the design and technology of Iranian-made missiles. Shifting oil relationships Similarly with regard to Chinese oil purchasing, Iran is determined to win back Chinese market share with the lifting of the sanctions. Iran expects to boost oil exports by 500,000 barrels a day, much of which it hopes will go to China. Iran’s oil plans put it in direct competition with Saudi Arabia, which had long been one of China’s largest suppliers. That picture has however begun to change with China apparently shifting its reliance on oil away from Saudi Arabia. Chinese oil imports from the kingdom rose a mere two percent last year while its purchase of Russian oil jumped almost 30 percent. The shift is likely to create an opening for Iran at Saudi Arabia’s expense. The shift could not come at a worse moment with Saudi Arabia being forced to tighten its belt as a result of low commodity prices and high expenditure on wars in Yemen and Syria and the propping up of autocratic regimes like that of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. All in all, President Xi returned to Beijing from his trip to the Middle East maintaining his emphasis on non-interference and harmony, with commerce, trade and infrastructure investment as part of his One Road, One Belt initiative. Reading the tea leaves however tells a different story. China has increasingly significant interests in the Middle East that impact not only its energy security but also its efforts to pacify Xinjiang and patch together a Eurasian land mass that is linked through infrastructure. Iran’s geography bordering on the Caucasus, Central Asia, Turkey, and the Middle East makes it a far more important link than Saudi Arabia in China’s Silk Road plans. As a result, Chinese interests are gradually forcing it to realign its policies and relationships in the region. To do so, China will ultimately realise that it no longer can remain aloof and will have to become a player in the Middle East and North Africa. This article was published at RSIS

News article:
As the regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran reached ever new heights with a potential escalation following Riyadh's execution of prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the entrance of a new major actor to the troubled waters of Middle Eastern politics was taking place. So far, President of China Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have visited almost every region in the world in the context of their multidimensional foreign policy approach, but not the conflict-ridden Middle East. Therefore, when Xi embarked on a major diplomatic tour into the region comprising Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt there were plenty of remarks in global media outlets concerning the critical decision of the "Middle Kingdom" to finally come out from the sidelines and take a step forward to become a global player.Not least because the Middle East represents the most difficult regional geopolitical realm in which China's non-interference into other countries' domestic affairs policy and staunch neutrality could be maintained due to endless conflicts among regional neighbors. As a pretext to the historic visit, Xi was trying to gradually inject China into the complicated Middle Eastern political seen by inviting representatives of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime and the opposition in Syria to Beijing to promote a peaceful resolution. He also dispatched his deputy foreign minister to Riyadh and Tehran at the peak of the crisis to mediate between the sides and to recommend calm. More importantly, Xi made a last minute alteration in his long-planned visit itinerary and decided to visit Tehran instead of the previously planned United Arab Emirates (UAE). This significantly raised the profile of his historic tour at a time when the spotlights of global investors are all focused on Iran, striving for economic opportunities in the post-sanctions era. As one of the major global importers of energy, China's main interest in Saudi Arabia and Iran is expectedly economic, based on the maintenance of cheap and reliable supply of oil. Currently, Saudi Arabia is China's biggest supplier of crude oil and bilateral trade stands around $69 billion. During Xi's visit, he and King Salman inaugurated an energy research center and opened the Yasref Oil Refinery, a major joint venture between Saudi Aramco and China's Sinopec. They also signed a memorandum of understanding for the construction of a high-energy nuclear reactor. But China's diplomatic hyperactivity in the Middle East cannot be confined to pure economic opportunism based on maintaining cordial relations with all economic partners. On the contrary, Beijing seems to have realized a diplomatic opportunity space created by the lack of interest in Middle Eastern politics on the part of U.S. President Barack Obama's administration and the fully fledged engagement of Russia in the Syrian civil war, allying itself clearly with the Shiite camp. Therefore, neither Washington nor Moscow are in a position to act as an honest broker in the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which presented a perfect moment for China's entry onto the Middle Eastern stage as a global power. Therefore, Xi wanted to become the first global leader to visit Tehran following the lifting of international sanctions to which China has contributed. Commercially, Iran is the favorite trading partner and logistical hub for China in the region, a status that was confirmed with 17 new agreements of cooperation in the areas of energy, trade and industry and a comprehensive strategic partnership document. The plan is to raise bilateral trade to $600 billion in 10 years, and the key to that vision is China's One Belt One Road initiative, which includes ambitious rail, road and port projects, including a high-speed rail network connecting Xinjiang in western China with Tehran via Almaty, Bishkek and Ashkhabad. Iran is geo-strategically important in this vision as it stands at a crossroads at the edge of Asia before the route of the ancient Silk Road reaches Turkey and Europe. Given the deeply skeptical approach of Iran's Shiite establishment toward the U.S. and Europe despite the recent rapprochement, China's autonomous stance in the world system provides comfort for long-term collaboration. While China has long maintained a policy of non-interference in other countries' domestic politics, harmony and economic cooperation, this might be just about to go through a radical change as far as the Middle East is concerned. China is becoming a superpower and will act like one. shortlink copied

© AP Photo/ Ebrahim Noroozi Developing the economic fibers Iran's extraordinary resources Iran as NATO pawn? SCO membership Sometimes profound tectonic shifts in the global politics arise from least noticed events. Such is the situation with Iran and the recent visit to Teheran of China's President Xi Jinping.Consider some aspects of recent events since lifting of economic sanctions on Teheran only days ago.What emerges in the public announcements following talks between China's President and all top Iranian leaders from Prime Minister Rouhani to Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, merely hints at what is clearly a profound shift in the relations between China and Iran. On January 23, an official Chinese Xinhua news agency statement on Xi's Iran trip, the first by any Chinese leader in fourteen years, declared the visit will, "lift their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership." In Teheran the Chinese President noted, "China stands ready to work with Iran to seize the momentum and further elevate our relationship and practical cooperation, so as to usher in a new chapter for our ties featuring comprehensive, long-term and stable development ."The content of that cooperation is of a major geopolitical and geo-economical importance for not merely Eurasia, but for the world. Iran has just formally requested to join the world's most important infrastructure project, China's One Belt, One Road initiative, often called the New Silk Road Economic Initiative. The New Silk Road initiative was first proposed during a September 2013 meeting in Astana between Xi and Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan today is also a member with Russia of the Eurasian Economic Union and also of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Keep these various threads of an evolving economic fiber in mind as we proceed.Since that initial 2013 discussion in Astana, the One Belt, One Road has begun to transform the political and economic map of all Eurasia. Last year in talks in Moscow just prior to the May 9 Russian Victory Day celebrations, where Xi was a specially honored guest, Vladimir Putin announced that the Eurasian Economic Union - Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan - will formally integrate its own infrastructure development with China's New Economic Silk Road Now the formal addition of Iran to the expanding Eurasian Silk Road is a giant positive step. It will allow Iran to break years of economic isolation and Western sanctions, and to do so over land where NATO color revolutions and other shenanigans are rendered largely impotent. It will open for the rest of Eurasia, especially China, but also Russia, vast new economic potentials.Iran has a young, educated population of more than 80 million, more than half under 35 years old, and a strategic land expanse twice the size of the state of Texas. It has the ninth highest literacy rate in the world - 82% of the adult population, and 97% among young adults between 15 and 24 without gender discrepancy. Iran has 92 universities, 512 online University branches, and 56 research and technology institutes around the country with almost four million university students, one million of them medical students. One third or 31% are studying in Engineering and construction programs, one of the highest rates in the world I've witnessed that first hand.The country has also been blessed with vast undeveloped economic resources, not only its huge reserves of oil and natural gas. It is situated adjacent to Armenia and Azerbaijan on the north, Afghanistan and Pakistan on the east, and Iraq and Turkey on the west. The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman lie south, and the Caspian Sea—the largest inland body of water in the world—lies to the north, giving Iran most of the water needed for its agriculture.In terms of other natural resources it has one of the world's largest copper reserves, as well as bauxite, coal, iron ore, lead, and zinc. Iran also has valuable deposits of aluminum, chromite, gold, manganese, silver, tin, and tungsten, as well as various gemstones, such as amber, agate, lapis lazuli, and turquoise. It's a beautiful, rich country, as I can personally attest Notably, the peaceful economic relations between Iran and China go back some 2,000 years, when Persia was a key part of the ancient Silk Road trade route from China to the west. That fact was underscored by President XI. For the past six years, China has been Iran's largest trading partner, which, despite western sanctions, reached $52 billion in 2014. That is now set to vastly increase, as Western sanctions are gone.There are some who have speculated in recent months that, with US sanctions now lifted, Iran will become a pawn of Washington geopolitical games. While the Obama Administration clearly would relish the prospect, it will not happen. A recent event that has been covered up in Western, especially USA media coverage, illustrates Iran's clear intent to defend its autonomy and sovereignty, much as her allies China and Russia do, all to the chagrin of NATO and the Pentagon.In early January Iran seized two US Navy small ships that had violated its territorial waters in the Persian Gulf. They were captured and boarded and the 10 sailors on board taken into custody before being released, unharmed, allowed to continue their journey in their own boats. Their boats had "wandered" into Iranian territorial waters around Farsi Island.US Defense Secretary Ash Carter claimed it was "apparently" because of mechanical and navigational failure. Farsi is the home base for the naval wing of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, in the center of the Gulf. Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi, the commander of the naval branch of the Revolutionary Guard, publicly agreed with Carter, stating to press, "They were positioned in that area due to the failure of their navigation systems and they were not aware of being close to Farsi Island ."Admiral Ali Fadavi was being diplomatic and more than a bit coy. Farsi Island is one of the most strategic bases in Iran, home to Iran's maritime unconventional warfare force. The US claims that their two boats "lost" their GPS satellite abilities at precisely the same time, and the Secretary of Defense claims that he isn't sure what happened? That the two boats also lost radio communication and all other communication during the incident, is a huge embarrassment for the US Navy, who only recently described Iran as an "ox-cart technology culture ."The recent incident recalls the event on December 4, 2011 when a US a Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel spy drone, the premier spy drone in the US fleet, crashed into the Iranian countryside. Iran claimed its electronic warfare unit brought the plane down. Washington laughed. Iran was right. They didn't just down the aircraft, they took control of it mid-flight: "Using its knowledge of the frequency Iran initiated its 'electronic ambush' by jamming the bird's communications frequencies, forcing it into auto-pilot. By putting noise [jamming] on the communications, you force the bird into autopilot. This is where the bird loses its brain .'" Iran managed to guide the drone to a peaceful landing inside Iran with the drone "believing" it was Afghanistan.Now, with Iran a formal partner in the Eurasian New Silk Road infrastructure development, and with US sanctions finally lifted, Iran will certainly be formally admitted as a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization at their next annual meeting this summer. Iran currently has SCO Observer status.Presently SCO members include China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and most recently, India and Pakistan.In coming months the SCO, if present dynamics continue, will form the seed crystal of an emerging unified Eurasia, cooperating economically, politically, and importantly, militarily, as well as in counter-terrorism. It will tend to become the forum where vital issues among all SCO member nations will be worked out, as the Chinese are fond of saying, on a "win-win" manner.

SCO membership Sometimes profound tectonic shifts in the global politics arise from least noticed events. Such is the situation with Iran and the recent visit to Teheran of China's President Xi Jinping.Consider some aspects of recent events since lifting of economic sanctions on Teheran only days ago.What emerges in the public announcements following talks between China's President and all top Iranian leaders from Prime Minister Rouhani to Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, merely hints at what is clearly a profound shift in the relations between China and Iran. On January 23, an official Chinese Xinhua news agency statement on Xi's Iran trip, the first by any Chinese leader in fourteen years, declared the visit will, "lift their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership." In Teheran the Chinese President noted, "China stands ready to work with Iran to seize the momentum and further elevate our relationship and practical cooperation, so as to usher in a new chapter for our ties featuring comprehensive, long-term and stable development ."The content of that cooperation is of a major geopolitical and geo-economical importance for not merely Eurasia, but for the world. Iran has just formally requested to join the world's most important infrastructure project, China's One Belt, One Road initiative, often called the New Silk Road Economic Initiative. The New Silk Road initiative was first proposed during a September 2013 meeting in Astana between Xi and Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan today is also a member with Russia of the Eurasian Economic Union and also of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Keep these various threads of an evolving economic fiber in mind as we proceed.Since that initial 2013 discussion in Astana, the One Belt, One Road has begun to transform the political and economic map of all Eurasia. Last year in talks in Moscow just prior to the May 9 Russian Victory Day celebrations, where Xi was a specially honored guest, Vladimir Putin announced that the Eurasian Economic Union - Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan - will formally integrate its own infrastructure development with China's New Economic Silk Road Now the formal addition of Iran to the expanding Eurasian Silk Road is a giant positive step. It will allow Iran to break years of economic isolation and Western sanctions, and to do so over land where NATO color revolutions and other shenanigans are rendered largely impotent. It will open for the rest of Eurasia, especially China, but also Russia, vast new economic potentials.Iran has a young, educated population of more than 80 million, more than half under 35 years old, and a strategic land expanse twice the size of the state of Texas. It has the ninth highest literacy rate in the world - 82% of the adult population, and 97% among young adults between 15 and 24 without gender discrepancy. Iran has 92 universities, 512 online University branches, and 56 research and technology institutes around the country with almost four million university students, one million of them medical students. One third or 31% are studying in Engineering and construction programs, one of the highest rates in the world I've witnessed that first hand.The country has also been blessed with vast undeveloped economic resources, not only its huge reserves of oil and natural gas.

News article:
BEIRUT: Lebanese political leaders on Thursday warned of dire consequences for the country should Iran make good its supposed promise to deliver oil. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah earlier in the day said the group had asked for help from Iran and an oil tanker was set to sail “within hours” on Thursday. Nasrallah cautioned the US and Israel against making any attempts to halt a delivery he said is intended to ease an acute fuel crisis. If it goes ahead, the delivery would be a violation of US sanctions imposed on Tehran. But Nasrallah said the tanker, carrying diesel, will be followed by others and accused US authorities of “waging an economic war on Lebanon.” Saad Hariri, Lebanon's former prime minister, said “the Iranian ships will expose the Lebanese to more risks and sanctions.” He criticized Nasrallah for declaring the ships to be Lebanese territory and rejected what he described as Lebanon being treated as an Iranian province. He warned that the country could suffer a fate similar to that of heavily sanctioned Venezuela. A Coral petrol station in Beirut lays idle on August 19, 2021 amid severe fuel shortages that have brought the crisis-hit country to a halt. (AFP) Hariri also accused Iran of “obstructing the formation of a government in Lebanon,” saying “otherwise, how does it allow itself to violate the international laws by sending ships to Lebanon without the approval of the Lebanese government?” Mark Ayoub, an expert on energy affairs in Lebanon and the Middle East, told Arab News: “We still don’t know the process that is going to be adopted to get the Iranian ships to Lebanon; will the Lebanese state be a part of it and choose international sanctions, or will Hezbollah assume responsibility?” Leaked information, said to be from sources at the Energy Ministry, indicates that “no official request has been made to the ministry to obtain permission to import Iranian oil to Lebanon, by land or by sea, or for its discharge, storage and distribution.” In comments directed at Lebanese president Michel Aoun, who is an ally of Hezbollah, Samir Geagea, president of the Lebanese Forces party, asked: “Will you leave Hezbollah, which has already usurped government authorities in security, military and strategy affairs, to take over the economic decision making as well?” Samy Gemayel, the president of the Kataeb party, said: “There is no siege on Lebanon, as Nasrallah claims — but there will be soon, because of him, and he will also bring us sanctions.” Meanwhile Aoun received a phone call from Dorothy Shea, the US ambassador to Lebanon, on Thursday informing him of Washington’s decision to support Lebanon by providing Egyptian natural gas to Jordan. It will be used to generate additional electricity that can be distributed to Lebanon via Syria. Shea said her country is making “tremendous efforts” to achieve this and added that negotiations with the World Bank are continuing in an effort “to secure financing for the cost of the gas, as well as repairing, reinforcing and maintaining power lines and gas pipes.” Najat Rushdie, the UN’s deputy special coordinator for Lebanon, spoke of her “deep concern over the potential impacts of the fuel crisis on access to healthcare and water supplies for millions of people in Lebanon.” She warned: “The bad situation will only get worse unless an immediate solution is reached.” Hamad Hassan, Lebanon’s health minister and a representative of Hezbollah in the caretaker government, announced the “granting of four emergency permissions to licensed pharmaceutical companies to import medicine, to compensate for shortages.” Recent developments in Lebanon have slowed the latest attempts to form a new government. Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati said his efforts to achieve this will continue. This came after Aoun complained that unnamed parties were seeking to delay the process and force Mikati to resign.

News article:
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech that the tanker, carrying diesel fuel, will be followed by others to help ease Lebanon's crippling fuel shortage that has paralyzed the country for weeks The leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group said Thursday that an Iranian fuel tanker will sail toward Lebanon ``within hours,'' warning Israel and the United States not to intercept it. The delivery organized by Lebanon-based Hezbollah, would be an apparent violation of U.S. sanctions imposed on Tehran after former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled his country out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers three years ago. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech that the tanker, carrying diesel fuel, will be followed by others to help ease Lebanon's crippling fuel shortage that has paralyzed the country for weeks. Nasrallah did not say how Lebanon will pay for the fuel but in a previous speech he said Tehran could be paid in Lebanese pounds. The currency has lost more than 90% of its value since the country's economic crisis began in October 2019. ``I would like to say that at the moment the tanker sails _ within hours _ and moves in the sea, it will be considered in Lebanese territory,'' Nasrallah said. He said the West was imposing an undeclared siege on Lebanon, causing the current crisis. Hezbollah and its allies accuse the U.S. and some Arab gulf nations of punishing Lebanon because of Hezbollah's military activities in other countries, including Syria and Iraq. ``I tell the Americans and the Israelis that this is Lebanese territory,'' Nasrallah said about the tanker, without elaborating on what his group will do if it is intercepted. Neighboring Syria has blamed Israel for mysterious attacks that have targeted oil tankers heading from Iran to Syria this past year. For weeks, Lebanese have been waiting in long lines at petrol stations to fill their car tanks. Diesel shortages amid severe power cuts have shut down thousands of private generators, leading to shortages of bread. Some hospitals have warned that patients could die because of the diesel shortage. The shortages are blamed on smuggling, hoarding and the cash-strapped government's inability to secure deliveries of imported fuel. Lebanon has for decades suffered electricity cuts, partly because of widespread corruption and mismanagement. The Mediterranean nation of 6 million _ including 1 million Syrian refugees _ is near bankruptcy. The situation deteriorated dramatically last week after the central bank decided to end subsidies for fuel products. The decision will likely lead to a hike in the prices of almost all commodities in Lebanon. Nasrallah said his group does not aim to ``defy anyone,'' by arranging the fuel shipment from Iran, but added that ``we cannot stand idle amid the humiliation of our people whether in front of bakeries, hospitals, gas stations and darkness at night.'' The move is likely to anger Hezbollah's opponents at home, who have warned that such a move could end up putting Lebanon under American sanctions. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech that the tanker, carrying diesel fuel, will be followed by others to help ease Lebanon's crippling fuel shortage that has paralyzed the country for weeks The leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group said Thursday that an Iranian fuel tanker will sail toward Lebanon ``within hours,'' warning Israel and the United States not to intercept it. The delivery organized by Lebanon-based Hezbollah, would be an apparent violation of U.S. sanctions imposed on Tehran after former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled his country out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers three years ago. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech that the tanker, carrying diesel fuel, will be followed by others to help ease Lebanon's crippling fuel shortage that has paralyzed the country for weeks. Nasrallah did not say how Lebanon will pay for the fuel but in a previous speech he said Tehran could be paid in Lebanese pounds. The currency has lost more than 90% of its value since the country's economic crisis began in October 2019. ``I would like to say that at the moment the tanker sails _ within hours _ and moves in the sea, it will be considered in Lebanese territory,'' Nasrallah said. He said the West was imposing an undeclared siege on Lebanon, causing the current crisis. Hezbollah and its allies accuse the U.S. and some Arab gulf nations of punishing Lebanon because of Hezbollah's military activities in other countries, including Syria and Iraq. ``I tell the Americans and the Israelis that this is Lebanese territory,'' Nasrallah said about the tanker, without elaborating on what his group will do if it is intercepted. Neighboring Syria has blamed Israel for mysterious attacks that have targeted oil tankers heading from Iran to Syria this past year. For weeks, Lebanese have been waiting in long lines at petrol stations to fill their car tanks. Diesel shortages amid severe power cuts have shut down thousands of private generators, leading to shortages of bread. Some hospitals have warned that patients could die because of the diesel shortage. The shortages are blamed on smuggling, hoarding and the cash-strapped government's inability to secure deliveries of imported fuel. Lebanon has for decades suffered electricity cuts, partly because of widespread corruption and mismanagement. The Mediterranean nation of 6 million _ including 1 million Syrian refugees _ is near bankruptcy. The situation deteriorated dramatically last week after the central bank decided to end subsidies for fuel products. The decision will likely lead to a hike in the prices of almost all commodities in Lebanon. Nasrallah said his group does not aim to ``defy anyone,'' by arranging the fuel shipment from Iran, but added that ``we cannot stand idle amid the humiliation of our people whether in front of bakeries, hospitals, gas stations and darkness at night.'' The move is likely to anger Hezbollah's opponents at home, who have warned that such a move could end up putting Lebanon under American sanctions. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah said Thursday a tanker would set off from Iran "within hours" to bring desperately needed fuel supplies to Lebanon, in defiance of US sanctions. Many questions remain about how the shipment would reach its stated destination, where acute and growing fuel shortages have forced hospitals, businesses and government offices shut amid a crippling economic crisis. But the move, prohibited by US sanctions on Iran's oil industry, could drag Lebanon into the covert naval war between Tehran and Israel. Nasrallah dared Iran's foes to stop the shipment. "The vessel, from the moment it sails in the coming hours until it enters (Mediterranean) waters, will be considered Lebanese territory," he said during a televised speech to mark the Shiite Muslim commemoration of Ashura. "To the Americans and Israelis, I say: it's Lebanese territory." He said a first ship would bring fuel for "hospitals, manufacturers of medicine and food, as well as bakeries and private generators." He said more vessels would follow to address shortages that have ground Lebanon to a halt. Neither the Iranian nor the Lebanese governments have confirmed the paramilitary organisation's claim. Nasrallah did not specify where or how the shipment would reach Lebanon and be offloaded. Lebanese energy expert Laury Haytayan said major questions hung over the shipment, including the amount to be delivered, who would pay, where the boat would dock and whether the details of the transaction had been disclosed to the Lebanese government. "It is a possibility that these tankers will go to Syria and shipments will be refined there," Haytayan said. "But this is all prohibited by sanctions, its not that easy, and since Hezbollah is doing it in public, there is a lot of danger on Lebanon, we are in danger of being sanctioned, or being attacked." Since February this year, Iran and Israel have been engaged in a "shadow war" in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges. Hezbollah, designated as a terrorist group by much of the West, is a major political force in Lebanon and is the only group to have kept its arsenal of weapons following the end of the country's 1975-1990 civil war. Hezbollah now has a more powerful arsenal than the Lebanese national army. Former prime minister Saad Hariri warned Thursday that Nasrallah's remarks could be "dangerous." "Iranian vessels will carry additional dangers and sanctions for the Lebanese," he said in a statement released by his office. Lebanon is grappling with an economic crisis branded by the World Bank as one of the planet's worse since the mid-19th century. The bankrupt state can no longer afford key imports nor subsidise essential goods, leading to crippling and sometimes deadly shortages of electricity, petrol and medicines among other things. International donors have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance but have conditioned it on the creation of a cabinet capable of spearheading reforms. But Lebanon's bitterly divided political leaders have repeatedly failed to agree on a new government a year after the previous one resigned in the wake of a monster blast in August at Beirut port. Hariri on Thursday accused Iran of blocking the formation of a government, something Nasrallah dismissed.

News article:
BEIRUT: An Iranian fuel shipment arranged by Hezbollah for Lebanon was to set sail on Thursday, the militant group said, cautioning its US and Israeli foes against any moves to halt the consignment that it said aimed to ease an acute fuel crisis. Hezbollah’s opponents in Lebanon warned the move could have dire consequences. Sunni politician Saad Hariri, a former prime minister, said it risked sanctions being imposed on a country whose economy has been in meltdown for nearly two years. Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Amnon Shefler declined to comment on whether Israel would take any military action to stop the shipment, but called it part of an Iranian scheme to export its revolution and promote its proxies. The arrival of the Iranian fuel oil would mark a new phase in the financial crisis which the Lebanese state and its ruling factions, including Hezbollah, have failed to tackle even as fuel has run dry and shortages have triggered deadly violence. There was no comment from the Lebanese government on the announcement made by Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, whose heavily armed group is Lebanon’s most powerful faction. The US ambassador to Lebanon, Dorothy Shea, told Al Arabiya English that Lebanon didn’t need Iranian tankers, citing “a whole bunch” of fuel ships off the coast waiting to unload. The United States was in talks with Egypt and Jordan to help find solutions to Lebanon’s fuel and energy needs, she said, speaking hours after Hezbollah’s announcement. Marking the biggest threat to Lebanon’s stability since the 1975-90 civil war, the financial crisis has hit a crunch point, with hospitals and other essential services being forced to shut or scale back due to power cuts and the acute scarcity of fuel. Fuel shortages have worsened since the central bank said last week it would no longer finance the imports at heavily susbidised exchange rates. The government has yet to raise official prices, however, leaving shipments in limbo. Nasrallah, whose organisation is designated as a terrorist group by the United States, said further Iranian shipments would follow to help the people of Lebanon. “I say to the Americans and the Israelis that the boat that will sail within hours from Iran is Lebanese territory,” Nasrallah said, suggesting that any action to stop it would be met with a response. “We don’t want to get... into a problem with anyone. We want to help our people,” he said in a televised address. SHIITE BUSINESSMEN Iran’s semi-official Nournews said the fuel was all purchased by a group of Lebanese Shiite businessmen. “The shipments are considered their property from the moment of loading,” said the news website, which is close to Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. In June, Nasrallah said Iran was prepared to accept payment in the Lebanese currency, which has lost more than 90% of its value in two years. US sanctions on Iran, reimposed in 2018 when then-President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, aimed to cut its oil sales to zero. Hezbollah, founded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982, is also targeted by US sanctions. Nasrallah did not say when or where the shipment would dock. One possibility is in neighbouring Syria, where Reuters reported in April the group was readying fuel storage capacity as part of plans to respond to the crisis. Hariri criticised Nasrallah for declaring the ships Lebanese territory, rejected what he described as Lebanon being treated as an Iranian province, and said the country could suffer the fate of Venezuela, which is under heavy sanctions.

News article:
BEIRUT — The head of Hizbollah in Lebanon on Sunday promised that deliveries of Iranian fuel would arrive "in the days to come" to help solve the beleaguered country's dire shortages. For the second time in four days, Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address that fuel shipments would leave the Islamic republic for Lebanon. Nasrallah also dismissed as "illusions" a reported US-backed initiative to ease Lebanon's energy crisis. On Sunday alone, fuel prices soared by up to 70 per cent after yet another subsidy cut, piling more pressure on people struggling to make ends meet. The cost of hydrocarbons in Lebanon has now roughly tripled in the two months since the central bank started cutting its support for imports. The latest cut, which is expected to cause knock-on price hikes on other key commodities, adds to the Mediterranean country's economic crisis, one of the world's worst since the 1850s. Fuel shortages have forced businesses and government offices to close, even threatening blackouts at hospitals. In his first televised address on Thursday, Nasrallah announced the departure "in the coming hours" of a shipload of fuel for Lebanon in defiance of US sanctions on Iran. On Sunday, Nasrallah said the first Iranian ship loaded with fuel was "at sea". "A second ship will set sail in the next few days, and it will be followed by others," he said. Hizbollah, a close ally of Iran designated as a terrorist group by much of the West, is a major political force in Lebanon but its leaders are under US sanctions. "We will continue this process as long as Lebanon needs it," Nasrallah said. "The aim is to help all Lebanese, [not just] Hizbollah supporters or the Shiites." Questions remain over how Iranian shipments of fuel could reach their destination.

Nasrallah assured that Hezbollah is not trying to meddle in the country's domestic affairs this way.Nasrallah first announced the start of Iranian fuel shipments to Lebanon on 19 August, justifying it by the need to deal with gasoline shortages that had already caused deadly infighting within the country. The announcement, however, sparked concerns among Hezbollah's domestic political opponents, who alleged that it could bring down American sanctions onto Lebanon's already devastated economy due to Washington imposing such measures on Iranian oil trade.Lebanon's economy has been in shambles for the last two years, sparking a political crisis that remains unresolved to this day, as well as the resignation of several governments and widespread shortages and unrest. The situation worsened last year with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and a devastating blast in one of the few remaining functioning economic centres of the country, Beirut's port.The country has still not recovered from the multitude of woes it has faced over the last two years, and there has so far been no indication of an upcoming change for the better. https://sputniknews.com/20210819/iranian-fuel-arranged-by-hezbollah--purchased-by-shia-businessmen-heads-to-crisis-hit-lebanon-1083664055.html lebanon iran Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 2021 Tim Korso https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/07e6/03/0d/1093831826_0:0:216:216_100x100_80_0_0_e3f43a960af0c6c99f7eb8ccbf5f812c.jpg Tim Korso https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/07e6/03/0d/1093831826_0:0:216:216_100x100_80_0_0_e3f43a960af0c6c99f7eb8ccbf5f812c.jpg News en_EN Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 1920 1080 true 1920 1440 true 1920 1920 true Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 Tim Korso https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/07e6/03/0d/1093831826_0:0:216:216_100x100_80_0_0_e3f43a960af0c6c99f7eb8ccbf5f812c.jpg middle east, newsfeed, lebanon, hezbollah, iran, fuel

BEIRUT, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, Hassan Nasrallah, said on Sunday that vessels carrying Iranian fuel will be setting sail soon followed by others to ease fuel shortages in Lebanon. Nasrallah insisted that the group was not trying to step in and replace the state by purchasing the fuel. The first vessel which last Thursday the group announced was about to leave Iran, had already sailed, he said. "We are not taking the place of the state, nor are we an alternative to companies that import fuel," he said in a speech to supporters without elaborating on how the shipments would enter the country. Hezbollah's foes in Lebanon have warned of dire consequences from the move, saying it risked sanctions being imposed on a country whose economy has been in meltdown for nearly two years. read more [1/2] A woman sits near a poster of Lebanon's Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, during an event marking Resistance and Liberation Day, in Khiam, near the border with Israel, southern Lebanon, May 25, 2021.

News article:
Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea on Monday ridiculed Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s declared plans for bringing fuel ships from Iran. “As for Sayyed Hassan’s promised ship, it is nothing but a silly little joke amid the tragedy that we are living,” Geagea said in a statement. “Why hasn’t the Iranian oil solved Assad’s problem? It is noteworthy in this regard to mention that Syria’s fuel crisis is what amplified Lebanon’s fuel crisis due to the ongoing systematic smuggling,” the LF leader noted. “My suggestion to Sayyed Hassan is for Iran to solve Syria’s fuel problem, which would instantly resolve half of Lebanon’s problem,” Geagea went on to say. Moreover, the LF leader stressed that the only solution to Lebanon’s fuel crisis would be to “liberalize the market” and that the only solution to Lebanon’s problem would be to “liberate the state from those who are currently in power.” Nasrallah had on Sunday promised that deliveries of Iranian fuel would arrive "in the days to come" to help solve the beleaguered country's dire shortages. For the second time in four days, Nasrallah said in a televised address that fuel shipments would leave the Islamic republic for Lebanon. On Sunday alone, fuel prices soared by up to 70 percent after yet another subsidy cut, piling more pressure on people struggling to make ends meet. The cost of hydrocarbons in Lebanon has now roughly tripled in the two months since the central bank started cutting its support for imports. The latest cut, which is expected to cause knock-on price hikes on other key commodities, adds to the Mediterranean country's economic crisis, one of the world's worst since the 1850s. Fuel shortages have forced businesses and government offices to close, even threatening blackouts at hospitals. In his first televised address on Thursday, Nasrallah announced the departure "in the coming hours" of a shipload of fuel for Lebanon in defiance of U.S. sanctions on Iran. On Sunday, Nasrallah said the first Iranian ship loaded with fuel was "at sea." "A second ship will set sail in the next few days, and it will be followed by others," he said. Hizbullah, a close ally of Iran designated as a "terrorist" group by much of the West, is a major political force in Lebanon but its leaders are under U.S. sanctions. "We will continue this process as long as Lebanon needs it," Nasrallah said. "The aim is to help all Lebanese, (not just) Hizbullah supporters or the Shiites," he added. Questions remain over how Iranian shipments of fuel could reach their destination. Since February this year, Iran and its arch-enemy Israel have been engaged in a "shadow war" in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges.

News article:
Secretary-General of the Lebanese Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah revealed on Friday an agreement with Iran to start loading a third ship of oil derivatives to sail to Lebanon. This came in a televised speech delivered by Nasrallah on the fourth anniversary of the Second Liberation, which was broadcast by some Lebanese channels, including pro-Hezbollah Al-Manar TV channel. Nasrallah stated: We agreed with the Iranians to start loading a third ship of oil derivatives to head towards Lebanon. We need more than three ships to face the next stage. On 19 August, Nasrallah confirmed that an Iranian fuel ship was on its way to his country, and then on 22 August, he announced that a second oil vessel would sail to Lebanon within days, and other ships would follow. Read: Lebanon heading towards collapse, Sunni sheikh warns So far, the Lebanese side did not announce the arrival of any ship coming from Iran, and the government has issued no official comment about the Iranian oil shipments, the location to unload the cargo or who would benefit from it. Lebanon has been suffering a severe fuel shortage for more than two months due to the lack of sufficient foreign exchange to import it. In his speech, Nasrallah stressed the importance of: "Forming a government as soon as possible in order to start reaching solutions to the ongoing crises." On 26 July, President Michel Aoun commissioned Najib Mikati to form a new government to succeed the caretaker government, which resigned six days after the explosion of the Beirut Port on 4 August, 2020. Consultations are still ongoing between the concerned parties to agree on a government formation. Read: Lebanon water supply cuts as fuel shortage continues

(@TankerTrackers) August 29, 2021 Citing informed sources, Lebanon’s al-Manar television network also confirmed the report. Meanwhile, Hebrew sources said that Lebanon’s resistance movement Hezbollah is at a state of alert in case the Israeli regime makes a miscalculation with regard to the ship. On August 19, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned the US and Israel that the vessels carrying Iranian fuel would be regarded as “Lebanese territory,” as he announced the departure of the first ship from Iran. Earlier today, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh cautioned against any move targeting the tankers, saying that neither the US nor any other country is in a position to stop legitimate trade between Iran and Lebanon. “We are very serious about exercising our sovereignty and everyone should know that legitimate trade in this sphere is one of the basic principles of international law,” Khatibzadeh said during a virtual press conference. Fuel shortages in Lebanon have forced businesses and government offices to close, threatening to cause blackouts at hospitals and halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country. The plan to send Iranian fuel to Lebanon is seen as a watershed in breaking US sanctions, which have targeted both countries. Just a few hours after Nasrallah’s August 19 announcement, US Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea claimed that Washington would help Lebanon implement a plan to transfer Egyptian gas to Lebanon for power generation. The Hezbollah leader later derided Shea’s plan as an act of “selling illusions to the Lebanese,” saying even if implemented, it could take a year to import gas from Egypt to Lebanon. In remarks on Friday, Nasrallah announced that a deal was reached with Tehran to import a third fuel-loaded tanker to ease crippling shortages in the country. “The coming days will prove those doubtful about the shipments arriving with fuel wrong ... and our words will be clear when the first vessel reaches Lebanon,” he said in a televised speech. He also said the country’s economic crisis was the result of an economic siege imposed by the US, stressing that the so-called Caesar sanctions by Washington on Syria had also harmed Lebanon. “Go ahead and give Lebanon an exemption for Iranian gasoline and diesel ... go ahead and give Lebanon an exemption from Caesar,” Nasrallah said, addressing Washington in his speech.

An Iranian fuel tanker is about to reach Lebanon and has become near the entrance of the Suez Canal, the Iranian Mehr news agency has reported. And while neither Iran nor Hizbullah have officially confirmed the news, Hizbullah’s al-Manar TV quoted sources as saying that the tanker has become in the Mediterranean. TankerTrackers, a global tanker tracking website, meanwhile showed that a second fuel tanker had left an Iranian port on Sunday for a yet to be identified destination while noting that a third tanker is being loaded with gasoline. Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had warned Israel and the U.S. against targeting the ships while noting that the vessels are not enough to resolve Lebanon’s fuel shortage problem. Fuel shortages have forced businesses and government offices to close, even threatening blackouts at hospitals. "We will continue this process as long as Lebanon needs it," Nasrallah said. "The aim is to help all Lebanese, (not just) Hizbullah supporters or the Shiites." Questions remain over how Iranian shipments of fuel could reach their destination.

News article:
The US is in no position to block Iran’s legitimate trade with other countries, says Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh, referring to Iranian fuel shipments to Lebanon as the Mediterranean country suffers from ongoing shortages amid American sanctions. “The US is not in a position to block legitimate trade. We are very serious about exercising our sovereignty and everyone should know that legitimate trade in this sphere is one of the basic principles of international law,” Khatibzadeh said during a virtual press conference on Monday. Two weeks ago, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Lebanon’s Hezbollah resistance, announced that a ship carrying Iranian fuel was about to set sail for Lebanon, warning that the vessel and the tankers subsequently carrying Iranian fuel would be regarded as “Lebanese territory”. Just a few hours after Nasrallah’s announcement, US Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea claimed that the Biden administration would help Lebanon get Egyptian gas. The Hezbollah leader later said the first tanker was already on its way to Lebanon, promising that more ships would follow despite US opposition, and deriding Shea’s plan as an act of “selling illusions to the Lebanese.” During his press conference last week, Khatibzadeh voiced Iran’s readiness to sell fuel to the Lebanese government in addition to the country's businessmen. The sales will continue as long as Iran has a customer in Lebanon and there is demand for fuel there, he said. Making a reference to plans to provide Lebanon with fuel from other countries, the Iranian spokesman said other producers should not hesitate if they can alleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people. “Neither the US nor any other country is above law to stop the legitimate trade” between Iran and Lebanon, he reiterated, adding that the sale is a decision made by the Iranian establishment. Fuel shortages have hit factories and businesses across Lebanon, threatening to halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country, which is already struggling with its worst economic crisis. The plan to send Iranian fuel to Lebanon is seen as a watershed in breaking US sanctions, which have targeted both countries. Khatibzadeh said the Lebanese are an affluent people and do not need donations from others, adding "some countries should stop politicizing the issues and allow the Lebanese people to meet their needs". ‘Tehran never withheld friendly hand from Riyadh’ Elsewhere during his presser, Khatibzadeh was asked whether negotiations between Tehran and Riyadh held in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, had reached an impasse, to which he responded in the negative and explained that “there is no deadlock that cannot be broken between the two great countries.” “It only requires political will and action in both capitals,” he said. “Saudi Arabia is our neighbor in this region. [Iran] and Saudi Arabia have a lot in common for [achieving] peace and stability in the region. Iran has never withheld its friendly hand from Riyadh,” he added. The spokesman further said whenever Riyadh showed a willingness to act on the basis of the established regional mechanism, Iran welcomed it. Baghdad has been hosting talks between the two regional heavyweights in recent months on mending ties severed in 2016. Late in April, Tehran welcomed “a change in Saudi Arabia’s tone” towards the Islamic Republic, as observed in Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s earlier interview, during which he said he wanted to have a “good and distinguished relationship” with Iran, striking a different note from Riyadh’s usual demonization of Tehran. Iran’s new President Ebrahim Raeisi has made dialogue with neighbors one of his administration’s priorities and said Tehran believes that there is no obstacle to reopening embassies in Tehran and Riyadh. On Saturday, Iraq hosted the Baghdad International Conference “For Cooperation and Participation” with the objective of easing tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Khatibzadeh thanked Iraq’s constructive role, noting that three rounds of talks have been held between Riyadh and Tehran, which could continue if needed. He also said no new talks were held between Iran and Saudi Arabia on the sidelines of the Saturday conference attended by both sides’ foreign ministers.

News article:
The first Iranian fuel shipment will arrive in Lebanon by trucks through Syria “to avoid the sanctions-related complications,” media reports said. Informed sources said that choosing Syria for the ship docking “has nothing to do with fears of an attack from Israel or the U.S.” but rather for internal considerations and “the unwillingness to implicate any allies.” On the other hand, the sources indicated that “the shipment will reach a Syrian port and the fuel will be transported by trucks to Lebanon,” stressing that “the priority of distribution will be to hospitals.” On a separate note, Arab Tawhid Party leader Wiam Wahhab told al-Jadeed TV that the Iranian ship is soon to arrive to Banias – a Syrian city in Tartous Governorate. He said that “in a few days, the fuel will start arriving in Lebanon,” adding that “the warehouses have been chosen.” “The market will soon be relieved,” Wahhab assured.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says Tehran is ready to sell more fuel to the Lebanese government and businessmen if need be, as an Iranian ship transporting fuel for the crisis-hit country has entered Syria’s territorial waters. In a Friday phone call with Gebran Bassil, the former Lebanese minister of foreign affairs and leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, Amir-Abdollahian said Iran sets no limitation to the expansion of mutual relations with Lebanon and is ready to sell more fuel production to “new customers.” “The strategy adopted by the esteemed leader of Hezbollah to end this Zionist-made crisis against the Lebanese people confirms the fact that the path to Lebanon's honor depends only on self-reliance and the use of its assets and resources,” he said. The top diplomat emphasized Iran's unwavering support for Lebanon's government, army and the resistance movement. The first ship containing Iranian fuel reportedly entered Syria’s territorial waters on Thursday to unload its cargo, which will be then transferred to Lebanon via tankers. Informed sources said that two other Iranian ships will also deliver their cargo to Lebanon through the same mechanism. Fuel shortages in Lebanon have forced businesses and government offices to close, threatening to cause blackouts at hospitals and halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country. The plan to buy Iranian fuel, announced by Secretary General of Lebanon’s Hezbollah resistance movement Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on August 19, is seen as a watershed in the US sanctions, which have severely affected Lebanon and Iran alike. In his announcement, the Hezbollah chief warned the US and Israel that Hezbollah would consider the tanker and next Iranian ships as “Lebanese territory” from the moment they sail. He later stressed that the Lebanese resistance group did not have any political aspirations by importing fuel from Iran. The former Lebanese foreign minister, for his part, thanked Iran for selling and shipping fuel to Lebanon. Bassil criticized those who want to starve the Lebanese people in order to achieve their political ambitions and called for the improvement of all-out ties with Iran. He also delivered to Amir-Abdollahian a message from Lebanese President Michel Aoun to his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raeisi.

News article:
A Lebanese parliamentary bloc says Iran's fuel shipments to Lebanon exposed the true faces of all those who counted on benefiting from the US economic siege against Lebanon. “The news of Iranian fuel tankers sailing toward Lebanon exposed the true faces of all those who counted on benefiting from the US economic siege against Lebanon, its people and its government, with the aim of subjugating and dominating the management of the country’s affairs and control of its policies,” the Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc said in a statement. Fuel shortages in Lebanon have forced businesses and government offices to close, threatening to cause blackouts at hospitals and halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country. The plan to buy Iranian fuel, announced by Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on August 19, marked a watershed in foiling the US sanctions, which have severely affected both countries. Nasrallah warned the US and Israel that Hezbollah would consider the tanker and next Iranian ships as “Lebanese territory” from the moment they sail. He later stressed that the Lebanese resistance group did not have any political aspirations by importing fuel from Iran. The first ship containing Iranian fuel entered Syria’s territorial waters last week to unload its cargo, expected to be then transferred to Lebanon via tankers. Informed sources said that two other Iranian ships will also deliver their cargo to Lebanon through the same mechanism. The Lebanese bloc said the insistence of Nasrallah on helping the Lebanese people forced the Americans to rush through measures to maintain a say in the country’s affairs. It noted that the resistance has clearly revealed to the Lebanese people the fragility of the American siege against the Mediterranean country and the so-called “Caesar Act” sanctions imposed by the US against Syria. “It has also become clear that the stifling economic crisis that the Lebanese have suffered from would not have been exacerbated had it not been for the American policy of blackmail to exploit the pain and anguish of the Lebanese in order to make them surrender and dictate its policies to them,” the bloc added. ‘Credit largely goes to Nasrallah’ Syria agreed to transport Jordan’s electricity and Egypt’s gas to Lebanon on September 4, two days after the first tanker containing Iranian fuel entered Syria’s territorial waters. According to the editor-in-chief of London-based online newspaper Rai al-Youm, by approving the request, Damascus has shown once again that it can rise above the wounded pride and petty considerations. In an editorial published on Tuesday, Abdel Bari Atwan wrote that the agreement should help alleviate Lebanon’s crippling energy crisis. “The credit is largely due to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah,” he noted. “By turning to Iran to supply oil and gas to Lebanon in defiance of the US and Israel, and pledging to protect incoming Iranian tankers from any attempted attack, he forced the US’ hand.” He argued that Iran's fuel shipment forced the United States’ “hitherto imperious” ambassador, Dorothy Shea, to back down and turn to Jordan and Egypt for alternative solutions. Just a few hours after Nasrallah’s August 19 announcement, Shea claimed that Lebanon did not need Iranian tankers, citing what she called “a whole bunch” of fuel ships off the coast waiting to unload. She also said Washington would help Lebanon implement a plan to transfer Egyptian gas to Lebanon for power generation.

News article:
Hezbollah’s secretary-general says a third and a fourth fuel-laden vessel is expected to head out of Iran towards Lebanon in the future, saying his group seeks for a part of Lebanon’s fuel needs to be met using Iranian imports. “Paperwork has been done for the dispatch of the third gasoline-laden ship from Iran. The fourth ship will bear diesel and will be sent over subsequently,” Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said during a speech on Monday. Referring to Lebanon’s new government that was formed recently at the direction of President Michel Aoun following endless indecision, he said the government would decide on any fuel shipments that could follow that. Nasrallah, however, asserted, “We want part of Lebanon’s fuel to be provided from Iranian imports.” The movement announced a decision to start importing fuel from the Islamic Republic last month amid crippling economic conditions, caused partly by the United States’ sanctions that have been targeting Lebanon over Hezbollah’s legitimate involvement in the country’s political and military sectors. ‘Some hoped Israel would target the ships’ He said some used to speculate that the promise for shipment of fuel from Iran simply served propagandist media purposes. “It, however, became finally clear that such remarks are false,” he said. Those same people were hopeful for the Israeli regime to target the vessels, the Hezbollah chief said. “[Their speculations] were proven wrong. Israel is in a tight spot and the deterrence equation is there” to dissuade it from taking any such action. By deterrence power, Nasrallah was referring to his movement’s vast arsenal of missiles, including precision ones, that the group has vowed not to hesitate to deploy to defend the country against the regime. Meanwhile, Nasrallah said the fact that the movement was distributing the fuel at a lower price that its purchase and imports have cost proved that it has not been cooperating with the fuel shipment “for commercial purposes.” “We’re not after conducting business here,” he noted. Thanking Leader, Iranian authorities The fuel deliveries were going to help Lebanon lower fuel prices countrywide, Nasrallah noted, saying the country was soon to announce a moderate prices. The Hezbollah chief expressed his and his movement’s gratitude towards Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei and other senior Iranian authorities for helping the shipments become a reality. Separately, Nasrallah thanked Lebanese authorities for helping get the country a government after successive interim ruling patterns did not last out to resolve the country’s woes. The current administration’s priority has to lie in preventing the country from disintegrating, enabling deployment of reforms, and fixing the problems that have come in the way of the people’s livelihood. Finally, the Hezbollah official addressed the daring escape of six Palestinian prisoners from an Israeli maximum-security jail. The development testified to the “Palestinian heroes’ bravery, resolve, and ingenuity,” he asserted. It was important in many aspects, the most significant among which was “a Palestinian’s insistence on freedom.”

News article:
BEIRUT (AP) — The leader of the Hezbollah terror group said Monday the first tanker carrying Iranian fuel to Lebanon has arrived in a Syrian port and the diesel will be shipped to Lebanon by tanker trucks later this week. The arrival of the tanker comes nearly a month after Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the group will start bringing fuel from Iran in an attempt to ease a crippling fuel crisis that Lebanon has been experiencing for months. The delivery, organised by the Iran-backed group, violates U.S. sanctions imposed on Tehran after former President Donald Trump pulled America out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers three years ago. The arrival of the Iranian tanker carrying fuel destined for Lebanon comes days after a new government was formed ending a 13-month deadlock. Lebanon’s new Prime Minister Najib Mikati has not commented on the deal to import fuel from Iran. Nasrallah said in a televised speech Monday night the group chose to have the tanker dock in a Syrian port to avoid embarrassing the Lebanese state and risking sanctions on Lebanon. Syria, also under U.S. sanctions, has been mostly relying on oil supplies from its strong ally Iran, which sent thousands of Iran-backed fighters, including Hezbollah members, to back President Bashar Assad’s forces in the 10-year conflict there. Nasrallah said the tanker arrived in the Syrian port of Banias early Sunday and the process of unloading the fuel began the same day. He added that the Syrian government has mobilized dozens of tanker trucks to transport the diesel to the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbek by Thursday. Nasrallah said three other tankers carrying diesel and one carrying gasoline will arrive in the coming weeks. He said diesel will be donated for a period of one month to institutions including public hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, water stations and the Lebanese Red Cross. Nasrallah added that others who will get fuel at low prices are private hospitals, medicine and serum factories, bakeries and cooperatives that sell food products. Nasrallah said Hezbollah will be supplying gas stations linked to the group around the country. “We are not competing (with the state) but we want to add the flow of fuel to the market,” he said.

People push their cars due to a lack of fuel, near a gas station in Dora, Lebanon, August 17, 2021. (Reuters) Damascus, London - Asharq Al-Awsat Iranian oil and its derivatives began to pour into Syria by land, through the Iraqi border in the east, and by sea, from the Mediterranean in the west, amid a strong demand by pro-Iranian militias for real estate in various regions, especially in Ghouta. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a crude oil tanker docked at the port of Baniyas in Tartus, coming from Iran. It added that Lebanon’s share of hydrocarbons had arrived days before in Syria through three other Iranian tankers. According to the war monitor, the fuel tankers had arrived on Sept. 6 and were destined for Lebanon. “On Monday, three tankers carrying diesel and gasoline docked at Baniyas port. Their cargo is being unloaded to be transported by land to Lebanon… under the supervision of the Lebanese Hezbollah party,” the Observatory stated. It added that crossings used for smuggling between Syria and Lebanon in Homs and Tartus are being heavily monitored by members of the regime’s Fourth Division in order to secure the transfer to Lebanon. In a report on Sept. 5, the Observatory said that a new convoy of tankers loaded with fuel entered Syrian territory, coming from Iraq. Some 39 tanks crossed the borders under the control of pro-Iranian militias in Al-Mayadeen and Albukamal in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor. The tankers passed through Deir Ezzor, heading towards Homs on their way to Lebanon. Separately, the Observatory said people from Deir Ezzor, who work for Iranian militias in Syria, were increasingly purchasing real estate in various cities and towns of Eastern Ghouta. According to civil sources from inside Eastern Ghouta, brokers from the region were recruited by a group of people affiliated with the local Al-Abbas Brigade militia, which operates under the Iranian forces. Real estate recently purchased by the brigade amounted to more than 300 properties, with a value ranging between 25 and 125 million Syrian pounds, depending on the area and location.

(MENAFN- IANS) Beirut, Sep 17 (IANS) Lebanon has received tanker trucks carrying Iranian oil in a move aimed at easing energy shortages in the crisis-hit country. A vessel carrying Iranian oil docked in Syria on Sunday, and the oil was unloaded in trucks and sent by land to the Bekaa Valley on Thursday, reports Xinhua news agency. Lebanon has been suffering from shortage of US currency reserves, which deprives the country from importing its oil needs. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah announced on Monday that a second ship with fuel oil would arrive in the Syrian port of Baniyas in a few days, and Lebanon is expected to receive two more ships carrying gasoline and fuel oil.

News article:
A senior US Senate member has acknowledged that America’s tough sanctions against Lebanon have been largely ineffective as the Arab country has been receiving desperately-needed fuel from Iran, which is itself under severe sanctions imposed by Washington. In a Twitter post on Friday, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Jim Risch said, “Lebanon’s receipt of US-sanctioned Iranian fuel, trucked-in by Hezbollah through Syria, is a disappointing sign for the future of Lebanon’s accountability and democracy.” “US sanctions must mean something. It’s unnerving to see this admin. Not make that clear,” the American senator added, implying that Iran’s fuel export to Lebanon demonstrates US failure in its sanctions policy against both countries. #Lebanon’s receipt of U.S.-sanctioned #Iranian fuel, trucked-in by #Hezbollah through #Syria, is a disappointing sign for the future of Lebanon’s accountability and democracy. U.S. sanctions must mean something. It’s unnerving to see this admin. not make that clear. https://t.co/XUlDLrGCZF — Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member (@SenateForeign) September 16, 2021 Lebanon is facing a crippling economic crisis due to fuel shortages that have forced businesses and government offices to close while threatening vital sectors of the country. The plan to buy Iranian fuel, first announced by Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on August 19, marked a watershed in foiling the US sanctions, which have severely affected the two countries. The first ship containing Iranian fuel entered Syria’s territorial waters early September. On Thursday, a convoy of tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel, arranged by Hezbollah, arrived in Lebanon, with Lebanese media reporting that the tankers loaded with Iranian mazut entered the village of Hawsh al-Sayyed Ali in Lebanon’s northeastern Baalbek-Hermel province. As tanker trucks entered from Syria in the eastern region of Hermel, they were greeted by large crowds of people waving Hezbollah's yellow flag and women tossing rice and rose petals. Hezbollah declared that it had broken an "American siege." The next Iranian ships are also expected to deliver their cargo to Lebanon through the same pathway. Earlier this week, Nasrallah said the Iranian fuel shipments would be distributed free of charge to institutions, including state hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, and the Red Cross. In announcing the plan, Hezbollah’s chief warned the US and Israel that the resistance movement would consider the tanker trucks and next Iranian ships “Lebanese territory” from the moment they sail.

News article:
Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat on Friday commented sarcastically on the entry of Hizbullah-imported Iranian diesel from Syria into Lebanon. “We no longer know from where the diesel, gasoline and oil convoys are coming,” Jumblat said in a tweet. “Those who care for us have become numerous to an extent that we might become an oil exporting country without border demarcation and without excavation -- neither in the north nor in the south nor at sea nor on land,” the PSP leader added. Jumblat is believed to be a co-owner of at least one Lebanese oil and gas company. Dozens of tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel arranged by Hizbullah arrived in shortage-hit Lebanon Thursday. As they entered from Syria through an illegal crossing in the eastern region of Hermel, the trucks were greeted by Hizbullah supporters waving the group's yellow flag and ululating women tossing rice and rose petals. Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had promised in August he would bring fuel from Iran to alleviate the rationing that is sowing chaos across the country. A first Iranian ship reached the Syrian port of Baniyas earlier this week. The cargo was offloaded there and trucked to Lebanon, the first of several planned deliveries. A total of 80 trucks carrying four million liters (more than one million gallons) of petrol entered Lebanon on Thursday and were expected to fill the tanks of Al-Amana, a fuel distribution company which is owned by Hizbullah and has been under U.S. sanctions since February 2020. "This is humanitarian aid that will meet the needs of the population," said Jawad, a 50-year-old Hermel resident who was among the crowd gathered to welcome the convoy. Hizbullah "is not replacing the state, it's a temporary measure until the state can deliver its duties," he said. For critics, however, the convoy is a symbol of the dissolution of the Lebanese state. "Don't forget this day," tweeted Laury Haytayan, a Lebanese oil and gas expert and activist, describing it as the day Hizbullah won over the Lebanese state. Hizbullah is often accused by its opponents of operating a state-within-a-state and has been taking part in Syria's civil war alongside government forces. Nasrallah's announcement last month was a boon for the Tehran-backed movement and prompted the announcement of several other fuel supply schemes via other regional powers. The amount of Iranian petrol being delivered can only meet a small part of the demand in Lebanon, where motorists spend hours -- sometimes days -- in queues to fill up. Under another initiative to bring some power to the country, energy ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon earlier this month agreed a plan to bring Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity to Lebanon via Syria. The United States has backed the plan and given rare approval for the Arab neighbors to escape punishment under sanctions targeting the Syrian regime.

News article:
By Denijal Jegić Amidst Lebanon’s grave crisis, the resistance movement Hezbollah has facilitated the import of tons of fuel from Iran. Confronting the increasing isolation of Lebanon, the cooperation between Iran and Hezbollah indicates a break of US sanctions and further disrupts Washington’s hegemony in Western Asia. Iranian fuel arrives in Lebanon. The first convoys of trucks carrying oil from Iran arrived in Lebanon via Syria this week, welcomed by cheering Lebanese citizens. A banner declared "Thank you Iran. Thank you Assad's Syria.” The import from Iran comes at a crucial time. Lebanon has been collapsing due to an economic and political crisis. Most of the population now lives below the poverty line. The already fragile electricity supply has further diminished due to a severe fuel shortage. Much of the population is left without proper electricity. Hezbollah will donate the first fuel delivery to institutions in need, including hospitals, nursing homes, the Red Cross, and orphanages. When Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah announced the fuel import last month, he spoke of an economic war against Lebanon that is led by the United States and is benefitting the Israeli regime. Hezbollah’s requests to purchase fuel from Iran at a lower price in Lebanese currency were rejected by the Lebanese government out of concern over further US sanctions. While Western powers deny that there is a blockade against Lebanon, they have tied prospective aid to Lebanon to the enactment of political reforms. Breaking the sanctions The successful delivery of fuel from Iran through Syria to Lebanon is a significant achievement, given that all three countries are faced, directly and indirectly, with international sanctions as part of the US maximum pressure campaign. Lebanon is being punished in the foreign efforts against Hezbollah, primarily because of the resistance movement’s deterrence against the Israeli regime. Indeed, a major goal behind the pressure waged against Lebanon by both external forces and local proxies is to weaken and potentially coerce the resistance movement into surrender. Hezbollah is not only a major political party in the country and an indigenous resistance movement, but also a representative of a large part of the Lebanese population and a regional military power. Israel faced major defeats by Hezbollah which remains the colony’s most imminent threat. The continuous Israeli attempts to confront Hezbollah have failed. And so have the US sanctions While the sanctions are a major obstacle to cooperation within the region, the legal or moral legitimacy of these sanctions is rarely questioned by US allies. To some extent, the brutal sanctions have been accepted as a natural circumstance, although, as a means of economic warfare, they effectively lead to the death of ordinary people. The fear of provoking further US actions has shaped the political situation in Lebanon. Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, an ally of the US, previously rejected the Iranian fuel shipment, claiming that Hezbollah’s announcement to import fuel was a threat and a violation of Lebanese sovereignty. He feared sanctions. On the same day of Hariri’s comments, Israel invaded Lebanese airspace to carry out airstrikes against Syria, using civilian airplanes over Beirut as human shields. The US allies remained largely silent on these violations of Lebanese sovereignty. Sanctions are not working The effects of the isolation of Lebanon are directly felt by its population, including those who support the United States, while Washington has not reached its political goals. In fact, the recent developments emphasize that the maximum pressure campaign waged by Trump and now Biden is failing. In a surprising move, Cesar Maalouf, an MP of the right-wing pro-US party “Lebanese Forces” that is known for its anti-Iranian stance, fierce opposition to Hezbollah, and previous collaboration with the Israeli regime, recently came out in support of Iranian aid. He asked why Lebanon should not be allowed to receive aid from an ally, when the West and Arab regimes have failed the country. Earlier this month, the outgoing Lebanese caretaker government met with Syrian government representatives in Damascus in the first official visit in a decade. Syria agreed to transit gas and electricity from Egypt and Jordan to Lebanon. The United States approved of these plans, effectively agreeing to waive its sanctions on transactions with the Syrian government. This came after Sayyed Nasrallah’s initial announcement of the oil delivery in August. It seems that the United States is confronted with a lack of options, as its maximum pressure from the outside has resulted in increased cooperation between those who are marginalized and sanctioned by US imperial policies. Disrupting the power of the US in Western Asia Neither the US nor Israel prevented the Iranian fuel from reaching Lebanon. Besides new sanctions against individuals affiliated with Hezbollah, the US response was rather muted. Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared a year ago that the US would do everything possible “to make sure that Iran cannot continue to sell crude oil anywhere, including to Hezbollah in the region.” In fact, a US senator now acknowledged that sanctions against Lebanon have been ineffective. Despite the stubborn imperialist efforts, Iran and Hezbollah have been able to defy the sanctions and strengthen their cooperation, which is, after all, based on shared solidarity - a concept that seems to pose a significant threat to the US role in the region.

News article:
Lebanon’s media outlets have reported entrance into the United States-sanctioned country of a fifth shipment carrying Iranian fuel as announced earlier by the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah. Reporting on Wednesday, the al-Mayadeen television network said the shipment was passing through the Syrian border into Lebanon carrying fuel residue. According to Lebanese sources, the consignments were passing into Lebanon through the Hermel-al-Qasir border area. The shipments have been reaching Lebanon in the face of the US’s sanctions targeting both the Islamic Republic and the country. The US re-imposed its sanctions on Iran in 2018 after illegally leaving a historic nuclear accord between the Islamic Republic and world countries. It has been enforcing similar measures against Lebanon for more than a year to pressure the country over influence wielded in its political and military sectors by Hezbollah. In the 2000s, the movement fought off two major wars on Lebanon that had been waged by the Israeli regime, Washington’s most treasured ally in the region. The sanctions have taken huge toll on the Lebanese economy, leading to acute shortage of staples, including gasoline and diesel. Hezbollah has, however, vowed that the country would keep importing Iranian fuel, pledging not to allow Washington to further interfere with the Lebanese people’s livelihoods. During his speeches, Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has identified the American Embassy in Beirut as the “operation room” devising sabotage plots against the country’s economy. Announcing pending arrival of the third and fourth consignments on September 12, Nasrallah said some had hoped and speculated that the Israeli regime would intervene and target the shipments. The speculations, however, simply served propagandist media purposes, he said, adding, “It became finally clear that such remarks are false.”

BEIRUT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The Lebanese government has received no request for fuel to be imported from Iran, the caretaker energy minister said on Wednesday, appearing to confirm that the Shi'ite group Hezbollah has bypassed the state with a move to import Iranian fuel. Hezbollah, a heavily armed group founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, announced last month thata shipment of Iranian fuel oil was on its way to help ease crippling shortages. read more The group is by far the most powerful faction in Lebanon, where it has been part of the ruling system for years. The fuel crisis, caused by a broader meltdown of Lebanon's economy and plunge in the value of its currency, has forced even essential services to shut down or scale back operations. Hezbollah's opponents say the declaration, followed by announcements of two further Iranian fuel shipments for Lebanon, has further undermined the authority of the state and exposed Lebanon to the risk of U.S. sanctions. Asked about the Iranian shipment, the caretaker energy minister Raymond Ghajar told journalists "our role is restricted to import permits, we did not receive a request for permission". Asked if this meant the ship was coming without permits, Ghajar said: "No. We do not have information. Permission was not requested from us. This is all I am saying." The first shipment has yet to arrive, and Hezbollah has not announced details of where it will dock. Tanker Trackers, which monitors shipments and oil storage, said satellite imagery showed that the second and third tankers had yet to depart. "The first tanker should be in the southern section of the Red Sea by now," it added. "Awaiting visual confirmation." Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Shi'ite Muslim ally of Hezbollah and one of the most powerful figures in the state, said on Tuesday he welcomed any support, including from Iran, to help Lebanon through its crisis.

News article:
DUBAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday it is ready to ship more fuel to Lebanon if needed, a day after the leader of Lebanon's Iran-aligned Hezbollah group said more vessels carrying Iranian fuel would sail soon to help ease the country's fuel shortage. "We sell our oil and its products based on our own decisions and the needs of our friend. Iran is ready to send fuel again to Lebanon if needed," Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said in an online weekly news conference. "Certainly we cannot see the suffering of the Lebanese people." On Sunday Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah said the first vessel shipping Iranian fuel to Lebanon, which last Thursday the group announced was about to leave Iran, had already sailed. Last week Iran's semi-official Nournews news website reported that the fuel shipments to Lebanon were all purchased by a group of Lebanese Shi'ite businessmen. "We announce our readiness to sell fuel to the Lebanese government in addition to the fuel purchased by the Lebanese Shi'ite businessmen, if the Lebanese government is willing," said Khatibzadeh. Hezbollah's foes in Lebanon have warned of dire consequences from the purchase, saying it risked sanctions being imposed on a country whose economy has been in meltdown for nearly two years. U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports, reimposed in 2018 when then-President Donald Trump exited Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers, aim to cut its crude sales to zero. Hezbollah, founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, has also been targeted by U.S. sanctions.

DUBAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday it is ready to ship more fuel to Lebanon if needed, a day after the leader of Lebanon's Iran-aligned Hezbollah group said more vessels carrying Iranian fuel would sail soon to help ease the country's fuel shortage. "We sell our oil and its products based on our own decisions and the needs of our friend. Iran is ready to send fuel again to Lebanon if needed," Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said in an online weekly news conference. "Certainly we cannot see the suffering of the Lebanese people." On Sunday Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah said the first vessel shipping Iranian fuel to Lebanon, which last Thursday the group announced was about to leave Iran, had already sailed. Last week Iran's semi-official Nournews news website reported that the fuel shipments to Lebanon were all purchased by a group of Lebanese Shi'ite businessmen. "We announce our readiness to sell fuel to the Lebanese government in addition to the fuel purchased by the Lebanese Shi'ite businessmen, if the Lebanese government is willing," said Khatibzadeh. Hezbollah's foes in Lebanon have warned of dire consequences from the purchase, saying it risked sanctions being imposed on a country whose economy has been in meltdown for nearly two years. U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports, reimposed in 2018 when then-President Donald Trump exited Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers, aim to cut its crude sales to zero. Hezbollah, founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, has also been targeted by U.S. sanctions.

News article:
A high-ranking Hezbollah official says Iran's fuel shipments to Lebanon dealt a heavy blow to sanctions imposed by the US and its allies on the Arab country, but the resistance movement will double down with other measures. “Fuel imports from Iran will not be the last step, as we have many other measures to take,” Hashim Safi al-Din, the head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah, said at a ceremony in the southern Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil on Sunday night. He said Lebanon is currently facing numerous crises and challenges, because it is now an integral part of the regional equations, but it needs to emerge victorious and dignified out of them and to move towards a new phase. “We know that some Lebanese citizens are afraid of the word 'challenge'. Nevertheless, Hezbollah will stand committed to the protection of our country, our nation, and our future,” Safi al-Din said. "There is no way to strengthen Lebanon other than performing a leading role in regional equations. Any other initiative is worthless, and falls within the framework of capitulation and surrender to Israel’s interests," he added. Safi al-Din said not only did the arrival of Iranian fuel shipments into Lebanon help solve the country's dire shortages, but it also showed Israel’s inability in maritime terms to stop Lebanon-bound oil tankers sent by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Israeli enemy, he said, is not seeking a naval confrontation with Hezbollah, which would expose the weakness of the regime. "They know very well that our missiles can strike the farthest point deep inside the occupied territories. Israel is also aware of the fact that we can prevent any ship from docking in the port cities of Acre, Haifa and Tel Aviv or any other region in the occupied lands." Tanker Trackers said on Friday that the third ship carrying Iranian gasoil or gasoline for distribution in Lebanon had entered the Gulf of Suez from the Red Sea. It identified the vessel as Fortune. The third tanker carrying Iranian gasoil or gasoline for Hezb'Allah's distribution in #Lebanon (via Baniyas, Syria) has now re-appeared on AIS. Her name is FORTUNE (9283746) and has entered the Gulf of Suez from the Red Sea. FAXON, FOREST and FORTUNE visited Venezuela in 2020. pic.twitter.com/17fD0VqjZP — TankerTrackers.com, Inc. (@TankerTrackers) October 1, 2021 Last month, the first tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel arranged by Hezbollah arrived in Lebanon, with the resistance group declaring that it had broken the "American siege." Lebanon has been mired in a deep economic and financial crisis since late 2019. The crisis is the gravest threat to the country’s stability since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990. The economic and financial crisis is mostly linked to the sanctions that the United States and its allies have imposed on Lebanon as well as foreign intervention in the Arab nation’s domestic affairs. Last month, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Iranian fuel shipments would be distributed free of charge to institutions, including state hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages and the Red Cross. “[Hezbollah] is not looking to make a business out of this but wants to help ease the people’s hardships,” he said, adding that the rest of the Iranian fuel would be sold “below cost” to bakeries, private hospitals or companies that run private generators.

News article:
A Palestinian woman charged with an attempted stabbing attack against Israeli settlers is set to give birth in prison while awaiting trial, in reportedly the first such incident in nearly a decade and a half. Anhar Al-Deek, 25, was arrested on March 8 at the illegal Israeli farming outpost of Sdeh Ephraim, which lies outside the Palestinian town of Ras Karkar in the central West Bank. In April, an Israeli military judge ordered her to remain in jail until the end of the proceedings against her. Al-Deek was already pregnant at the time of her arrest. As she has neared her due date in Israeli prison, her story has swamped Palestinian social media. The hashtag “Save Anhar al-Deek” trended in Arabic multiple times, and articles about her have been disseminated widely in Arabic-language media. The last Palestinian woman to give birth while in Israeli prison was Gaza resident Fatima al-Ziq in 2008, according to a report by the official Palestinian WAFA news agency. Palestinian security prisoners are treated like any other detainee when it comes to giving birth behind bars, said Israel Prison Services spokesperson Hanna Herbst-Shechter.

A security official familiar with the regulations, however, explained that al-Deek would be taken to an Israeli hospital while under guard. The security official denied claims circulating in some Palestinian media that al-Deek would be forced to give birth chained to her hospital bed. “[Her guards] will stand outside the door, of course. She will give birth in a hospital, in the conditions one expects from a hospital, but they won’t just put her in a taxi and send her off,” the official said. According to Israeli military prosecutors, Al-Deek broke into Sdeh Ephraim’s farmhouse, grabbed a knife from the kitchen, and sought to attack one of the farm’s owners, Leah Ze’ev, who called her husband on the phone for help. Ze’ev’s two daughters, aged eight and one years old, were present in the house at the time. The eight-year-old daughter fled the scene as al-Deek picked up a ten-centimeter-long knife, according to the indictment. Al-Deek “waved [the knife] as she approached the victim, who had backed away and called for help,” the indictment said. Advertisement Ze’ev fled the house with her one-year-old daughter and slammed the door on al-Deek, who continued to wave the knife at her from inside. Around then, Ze’ev’s husband Eitan arrived with his brother and subdued al-Deek at gunpoint, according to the indictment. As soon as al-Deek saw their weapons, she threw down the knife, and they held her until Israeli forces arrived on the scene, prosecutors said. The incident was not the first violent encounter between the Ze’ev family and local Palestinians. The establishment of the Sdeh Ephraim outpost near Ras Karkar in 2017 occasioned protests — some of them violent — by Palestinian residents. Sdeh Eprahim’s owner Eitan Ze’ev has also been on trial over the past year and a half for alleged wrongful shooting of multiple Palestinians on a farm near Nablus in July 2020. Ze’ev’s gun was confiscated from him as part of the proceedings against him. Another alleged terror attack took place at the farm in February 2021, when a young Palestinan accountant Khalid Maher Nofal was shot and killed by Ze’ev in murky circumstances in the dead of night. According to the Israeli military, Nofal sought to break into the farmhouse, calling out “Allahu Akbar,” leading to a fatal struggle with Ze’ev that left him dead. Based on Ze’ev’s testimony, the army quickly announced that the incident was terrorism. But the army also acknowledged that Nofal had arrived at the hilltop unarmed. Al-Deek was charged with aggravated assault and possession of a knife. Her lawyer, Akram Samareh, said she had suffered from a history of mental illness. She had not been in her right mind when she committed the crime, he said. “It’s a matter of mental illness. She didn’t know how she ended up there…she says she wasn’t conscious when she was doing this thing,” Samareh said in a phone call. Advertisement Samareh said that al-Deek was not psychologically fit to stand trial and ought to be released. Prosecutors have submitted a psychiatric opinion to the court contesting his claims. The court has requested further information on the matter, according to the Israeli military. “A Palestinian says she’s mentally ill and the Israelis say she’s not. Who is an Israeli court supposed to believe? Obviously the Israeli,” Samareh said. Afterwards, it will be al-Deek’s choice whether or not to keep the child with her in prison for up to two years. Such cases are challenging, the security official acknowledged, as they mean balancing competing values: bringing an innocent person into jail, while at the same time valuing the right of the detained mother to remain with their child. “But we’re speaking of a detainee, not someone who’s been sentenced. So it could be the case that she won’t end up serving time at all, and it’s not clear where this will go,” the official said. Samareh said that his client deserved to give birth to her child “in the hospital she wishes, in the conditions she wishes.” “She wants to raise her children free. Can she really raise him between four walls?” Samareh said.

Palestinian commander of the militant Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades Zakaria Zubeid is carried on the shoulders of supporters in Jenin, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank December 30, 2004. REUTERS Six Palestinians broke out of a high-security Israeli prison on Monday in what Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called a grave incident. Israeli police and the military had started a search after the escape from Gilboa prison in northern Israel. The Prisons Service said five of the fugitives belonged to the Islamic Jihad movement and one was a former commander of an armed group affiliated with the mainstream Fatah party. Arik Yaacov, the service's northern commander, said the escapees appeared to have opened a hole from their cell toilet floor to access passages formed by the prison's construction. The facility, about four kilometres (two miles) from the boundary with the occupied West Bank, is one of the highest-security jails in Israel and houses Palestinians convicted or suspected of anti-Israeli activities, including deadly attacks. Read Israeli forces 'kill four Palestinians in West Bank' Four of the men were serving life sentences, a Palestinian prisoners organisation said. Several Palestinian factions hailed the jailbreak. "This great victory proves again that the will and determination of our brave soldiers inside the prisons of the enemy cannot be defeated," said Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas. Bennett's office said he spoke with Israel's internal security minister and "emphasised that this is a grave incident that requires an across-the-board effort by the security forces" to find the escapees. A police spokesman said security forces believed the fugitives might try to reach the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule, or the Jordanian border some 14km (nine miles) to the east. One of the escapees was identified by the Prisons Service as Zakaria Zubeidi, a former commander of Fatah's Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the West Bank city of Jenin. Israeli authorities claim the brigades carried out deadly attacks against Israelis during a 2000-2005 Palestinian uprising.

Palestinian commander of the militant Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades Zakaria Zubeid is carried on the shoulders of supporters in Jenin, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank December 30, 2004. REUTERS Six Palestinians broke out of a high-security Israeli prison on Monday in what Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called a grave incident. Israeli police and the military had started a search after the escape from Gilboa prison in northern Israel. The Prisons Service said five of the fugitives belonged to the Islamic Jihad movement and one was a former commander of an armed group affiliated with the mainstream Fatah party. Arik Yaacov, the service's northern commander, said the escapees appeared to have opened a hole from their cell toilet floor to access passages formed by the prison's construction. The facility, about four kilometres (two miles) from the boundary with the occupied West Bank, is one of the highest-security jails in Israel and houses Palestinians convicted or suspected of anti-Israeli activities, including deadly attacks.

News article:
Palestinians holds up spoons – symbolizing the basic tools used by the escapees to dig an underground tunnel – during a demonstration in solidarity with prisoners in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, on 8 September. Ashraf Amra APA images Israeli authorities have grown increasingly frustrated, embarrassed and perplexed in the days since six Palestinians escaped from one of Israel’s most fortified prisons. Amid speculation that the men might be hiding out in the West Bank, or could have crossed the border to Jordan, Palestinians are praying for their safety and hailing them as heroes. Their escape is a huge morale boost for Palestinians, as it once again shatters Israel’s image of strength and invincibility in the face of an occupied people struggling for its freedom. The seemingly impossible feat has generated comparisons to The Great Escape – the movie retelling the epic story of Allied prisoners of war who tunneled out of a heavily guarded Nazi POW camp during World War II. From the bathroom of their cell in Gilboa prison in northern Israel, the jailed Palestinians dug a 20-meter underground tunnel that emerged just outside the prison walls under a watchtower. The majority of the prisoners had been accused of involvement in planning or carrying out attacks against Israelis, and four of the six had been serving life sentences. Two had been awaiting trial. Five of the men – Ayham Kamamji, 35, Yacoub Qadri, 49, Munadel Infiat, 26, Muhammad Arda, 39, Mahmoud Arda, 46 – are affiliated with the Palestinian resistance organization Islamic Jihad. The sixth and the most well-known is Zakaria Zubeidi, 46, a former commander of al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, a militia affiliated with Fatah. The men likely spent months digging the tunnel. Israel’s domestic spying and torture agency Shin Bet, the military and the police launched a wide-scale manhunt, setting up nearly 200 checkpoints all over the occupied West Bank in search of the men. Israeli police think it likely that the men split into smaller groups and some may have reached neighboring countries. The Shin Bet speculates the escape may have involved coordination outside the prison as well. The men likely escaped around 1:30 am on Monday. Suspicions arose in the early hours when a cab driver said he saw the men at a gas station near the prison and called the police at 1:49 am. The prison was reportedly notified at 2:14 am. It was only at 3:29 in the morning that the Israel Prison Service reported three inmates missing, and it took another half hour before it became clear there were three others. Those time gaps are also being investigated as part of the probe into the breach. An official from the Israel Prison Service called it “a major security and intelligence failure.” The architectural blueprints of Gilboa prison, as well as other Israeli prisons, had reportedly been published online by an architecture firm involved in construction – though it is unclear whether the prisoners would have had any access to the plans. Retaliatory measures A wounded Goliath, Israel immediately began “a series of collective, punitive, retaliatory and arbitrary measures” against Palestinian prisoners en masse, according to prisoners rights group Addameer. Prison authorities began transferring hundreds of prisoners in Gilboa to other locations for investigation and interrogations. Prison authorities are also using a variety of tactics to retaliate, including withholding meals, denying prisoners certain rights they gained through protests and hunger strikes, conducting raids and searches of prison cells and scattering prisoners affiliated with Islamic Jihad across different rooms, sections and prisons. Such Israeli raids, which at times are conducted by special units, are “extremely violent in nature” and constitute “collective punishment, torture and ill-treatment,” Addameer said. Palestinian prisoners declared a state of “general alarm and rebellion” on Wednesday in response to Israel’s revenge measures since the escape. Israeli prison authorities dramatically escalated their violence on Wednesday, sending in special units backed up by occupation soldiers and dogs. Detainees’ hands and feet were tied, as some were thrown out of their cells and assaulted. Local media circulated photos showing ransacked cells: صور تظهر عنجهية الاحتلال في قمع الأسرى داخل قسم 6 في سجن النقب. pic.twitter.com/5FmdzVBBfh — فلسطين (@Palestine_ar) September 8, 2021 In protest of Israel’s oppressive tactics, prisoners lit fires in their cells. Katy Perry, the head of the Israel Prison Service, decided “that only one Islamic Jihad prisoner is placed in any given prison cell,” the newspaper Haaretz reported. But the movement and its detainees vowed immediate resistance. Some 150 prisoners affiliated with Islamic Jihad refused to be forcibly transferred out of Ofer military prison near Ramallah. The strength of the response forced Israel to back off. Israeli officials reversed the decision, “fearing mass disturbance,” according to Haaretz. “They’re just scared of them,” one senior Israel Prison Service official told the newspaper. Israel’s violent reaction “stems from the military failure and the security downfall of the occupation government,” the Palestinian Authority’s commission for prisoners said. The group added that Israel is “working to cover up its failure and defeat in front of the solid will of the Palestinian prisoners.” ​​Israel is also taking out its frustration against the families of the escaped prisoners. Occupation forces have arrested multiple family members of those who had escaped. Resistance The prisoners ripping their freedom from the clutches of the occupier is Israel’s latest humiliation in a series of events that Palestinians hailed as victories this year. This started with the deterrence established when Palestinian armed factions in Gaza resisted Israel’s ethnic cleansing in Jerusalem and bombing campaign in May, and extended to the incident where a Palestinian shot back at an Israeli sniper through a small opening in the barrier between Gaza and Israel in August. All Palestinians held by Israel as a consequence of resistance to Israel’s violent occupation and colonialism should be considered political prisoners – even if Israel portrays them as criminals and “terrorists.” The British government also considered those it jailed during the armed struggle in Ireland’s north to be “terrorists” and criminals, but ultimately recognized their political status when it agreed to free them as part of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Most Palestinians are tried in Israel’s military court, while Israeli settlers are subject to civilian courts – an aspect of Israel’s apartheid system. The military courts lack basic due process and have a near-100 percent conviction rate for Palestinians. Just as the men’s escape from the occupier’s prison is a form of resistance, so too are the actions that place thousands of Palestinians inside those prisons in the first place. Ali Abunimah contributed analysis.

Israeli occupation forces last night arrested several family members of the six Palestinian prisoners who escaped from the high-security Gilboa Prison in northern Israel earlier this week. According to the Palestinian Prisoners' Society, Israeli soldiers entered and ransacked Palestinian homes in Arabbuna, north of the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, where the escapees are from. They arrested four members of Mahmud Ardah's family. He has been described in Israeli media as the mastermind of the escape. Heavily-armed Israeli soldiers also arrested Yacoub Infaat, the father of another escapee, after breaking into his house in Ya'bad, to the west of Jenin. According to Wafa news agency, the detention of an official in the Palestinian Health Ministry's Complaints Unit, prompted Minister Mai Al-Kaila to condemn his detention and the interrogation of his family. "The Israeli occupation deliberately inflicts violence on the Palestinian people in violation of international norms, laws and conventions," said Al-Kaila. She called on all human rights organisations to intervene without delay to ensure the official's release.

Reports said that they used primitive kitchen tools to dig a tunnel from their cell through which they escaped. Israel has since launched a massive manhunt and reinforced its occupation forces in Jenin. The Palestinian Authority security services are reported to be cooperating in the search for the escapees. Rights groups say that there are 4,850 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including women and children. They face ill treatment and harsh conditions.

Heavily-armed Israeli soldiers also arrested Yacoub Infaat, the father of another escapee, after breaking into his house in Ya'bad, to the west of Jenin. According to Wafa news agency, the detention of an official in the Palestinian Health Ministry's Complaints Unit, prompted Minister Mai Al-Kaila to condemn his detention and the interrogation of his family. "The Israeli occupation deliberately inflicts violence on the Palestinian people in violation of international norms, laws and conventions," said Al-Kaila. She called on all human rights organisations to intervene without delay to ensure the official's release.

Reports said that they used primitive kitchen tools to dig a tunnel from their cell through which they escaped. Israel has since launched a massive manhunt and reinforced its occupation forces in Jenin. The Palestinian Authority security services are reported to be cooperating in the search for the escapees. Rights groups say that there are 4,850 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including women and children. They face ill treatment and harsh conditions.

It is an event that will have consequences, as it foretells God's near victory from where we do not know." On Monday, Israeli occupation authorities announced that six Palestinian prisoners had escaped from the high-security Israeli prison of Gilboa in the north of the country.

For the third day running, Israeli security and intelligence services are continuing their massive manhunt for the six Palestinian prisoners who escaped from the high-security Gilboa Prison overnight on Sunday. Thus far, their efforts have been unsuccessful. An Israel Prison Service official described the escape of the six Palestinian prisoners as a "major security and intelligence failure." Palestinian resistance groups hailed it as "heroic act." According to a report on Israeli Channel 13 TV, "There is no tangible intelligence information on the table for Shin Bet [internal security agency], police investigators or anyone else. This is a big problem." The journalist pointed out that the main tactic is to apply pressure on the ground. Many officers have been deployed across occupied Palestinian land and in Israel simultaneously. Police have warned members of the public to be cautious, and to report anything suspicious. They believe that the prisoners obtained arms as soon as they escaped, so any attempt to arrest them could lead to an armed confrontation. READ: Israel imposes restrictions on Palestine detainees' rights CCTV footage showed two of the prisoners heading north towards the Arab Israeli city of Tamra. Two others headed for Bisan in the east, where they took a taxi. According to several Israeli media reports, the police have reduced the number of checkpoints from 200 to 89. Most of those remaining are in the friction areas between Israel and the occupied West Bank. On Wednesday morning, Israeli occupation forces began to raid the homes of the prisoners' relatives. A number have been detained and questioned in an attempt to glean any intelligence that might lead police to the escapees' whereabouts.

News article:
Israeli forces have stormed dozens of areas across the occupied West Bank district of Jenin, where they conducted extensive searches and raids to find the six Palestinian inmates who escaped from a maximum-security Israeli jail. Media sources in Jenin said dozens of Israeli soldiers invaded the Arraba plain area and conducted searches in Palestinian communities on Tuesday evening. According to Palestinian media outlets, the Israeli forces raided the homes of the six escaped prisoners and began to arrest their relatives. They invaded Arabbuna village northeast of Jenin and stormed and ransacked dozens of homes. The following footage shows the moment Shaddad Ardah, the brother of escaped prisoner Mahmoud Ardah, is arrested. Clashes erupted between the Palestinian youth and occupation forces in Arabbuna after the Israeli invasion. Dozens of Israeli soldiers also invaded Aneen village west of Jenin and conducted massive searches of homes and lands. Similar invasions occurred in Faqqu’a village northeast of Jenin for the second day in a row. The Israeli troops searched mountains near Faqqu’a and interrogated dozens of residents. The regime’s army claims that its extensive searches are part of efforts to find the six Palestinian political prisoners who escaped from Gilboa prison. The following footage shows the Israeli military forces’ storming of Arraba town: Zakaria Zubeidi, a former commander of the Palestinian resistance group al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade in Jenin, and five members of the Islamic Jihad group managed to tunnel their way out through their cell’s drainage system to escape from the maximum-security jail in the predawn hours of Monday. It was the biggest Palestinian escape from an Israeli jail since 1987, when six members of the Islamic Jihad broke out of a heavily-guarded jail in Gaza. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh called on the Israeli regime to release all Palestinian prisoners. “Every Palestinian prisoner wants freedom, and they have the right to seek out any path to freedom,” Shtayyeh told reporters on Tuesday, without directly referring to the prison break. Prisoners threaten to burn their cells The escape, which marks a humiliating defeat for Israel, has prompted the regime to launch a massive manhunt in the occupied West Bank and to conduct airstrikes against the besieged Gaza Strip. Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett called the escape a “grave incident”, while Palestinians celebrated it on social media. Palestinian resistance groups, including Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, also hailed the jailbreak as a “heroic act” and a “powerful blow to the occupation forces.” Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad prisoners in Ktzi'ot Prison threatened to burn every cell they are expelled from in response to the continuing attacks against them by prison authorities. In a letter, they called on the Islamic Jihad to take strong acts of support for them and halt the Israeli regime’s fierce attacks against them. They warned that taking them out of their cells and scattering them will worsen the situation toward an escalation. Palestinian prisoners have been subjected to systematic torture, harassment and repression all through the years of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. The Israeli Prison Service (IPS) keeps Palestinian prisoners in deplorable conditions lacking proper hygienic standards. More than 7,000 Palestinian prisoners are currently held in some 17 Israeli jails, with dozens of them serving multiple life sentences. Israeli forces have arrested more than 17,000 minors since 2000.

News article:
A new report quoting a source close to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has released more details of the recent daring operation by six Palestinian inmates that led to their escape from Israel's maximum-security Gilboa prison last Monday. The Palestinian prisoners escaped from the Israeli prison in the early hours of Monday, with regime troops launching a manhunt to arrest them. Five of them belong to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), hailing from towns near the occupied northern West Bank city of Jenin. The inmates have been identified as Munadil Nafayat, 26, from Yaabad; Mahmoud and Mohammad al-Arida, both from Arraba; Iham Kahamji, 35, from Kufr Dan; and Yaqoub Qadiri, 49, from Deir al-Basha. The other prisoner has been identified as Zakaria Zubaidi, a former commander of Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Jenin. “The prisoners dug a tunnel under the bathroom sink – something that had been done and discovered by guards several years ago in the very same Gilboa prison. This time, however, the escape of the six captives and their intricately dug tunnel went unnoticed for at least three hours after they fled,” said privately-obtained information disclosed by an Islamic Jihad source. The source revealed that the day before the escape, Zubaidi had requested a transfer from the Fatah prisoner section in the highly-fortified Gilboa prison to the PIJ section and aware of a strong link between him and the PIJ prisoners, the prison administration approved the transfer. "55-year-old Sheikh Raed al-Saadi, incarcerated for 33 years by the Israelis and dean of PIJ detainees in Israel’s prison system, was in that room. The title “dean” is bestowed upon detainees who have spent more than 20 years in prison, while those who have spent more than 25 years are nicknamed “Generals of Patience,” the source underlined. “The other five PIJ prisoners in that section had all been sentenced to life imprisonment. They were active in the Al-Quds Brigades and had carried out a series of operations against the Israeli occupiers,” the source said. “Zubaidi has a long history of armed resistance,” the source added. “At the close of the second intifada in 2002, he and other Fatah members were given an amnesty after Operation Defensive Wall was concluded, and Zubaidi underwent a ‘rehabilitation process’ until he was re-arrested in 2019 for shooting at settlements in the West Bank,” the source added. The PIJ source also revealed that this is not the first time that Palestinian prisoners have escaped from Israel’s maximum security prisons. “Six PIJ detainees were able to break out of Gaza Central Prison in May 1987,” the privately-obtained information said. “The prisoners hid out in a house adjacent to the prison, while the Israeli army hovered above the Gaza Strip searching for them.” The source added that the most prominent of the Israeli jailbreaks was in July 1958, when violent clashes took place between the prisoners and their jailers in Shatta, near Gilboa. "Sixty-six prisoners managed to flee confinement, but 11 other Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed in the daring escapade," the source said. "Then, in 1998, 24 prisoners from various Palestinian political factions tried to break out of Shatta prison. The plan would have succeeded had it not been for the third prisoner to emerge from the tunnel which had taken weeks to dig. He was wearing his shoes, and guard dogs were alerted to the sound of his steps." Meanwhile, Muhammad Jaradat, a freed prisoner who resides in Jenin, has recounted his time in Gilboa prison in 2004. “I will never forget the day I entered the armored steel vault called Gilboa after a brutal interrogation for three months. I extended my hand from the tiny window that overlooks a sealed courtyard, hoping to touch the breeze from my city Jenin mixed with the winds of Marj Ibn Amer, but there was none. We were inside an armored box of iron and concrete, amidst a security system boasting the latest modern technology created by American and British minds – in order to break men.” Jaradat, who was a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, later published a book in Beirut entitled Ibn Taymiyyah: Between the Illusion of Reference and the Dominion of Blood. Since the latest jailbreak on September 6, Israeli forces have stormed dozens of areas across the occupied West Bank district of Jenin, where they conducted extensive searches and raids to find the six Palestinian inmates. According to Palestinian media outlets, the Israeli forces raided the homes of the six escaped prisoners and began to arrest their relatives. The regime’s army claims that its extensive searches are part of efforts to find the six Palestinian political prisoners who escaped from Gilboa prison. Palestinian prisoners have been subjected to systematic torture, harassment and repression all through the years of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. The Israeli Prison Service (IPS) keeps Palestinian prisoners in deplorable conditions lacking proper hygienic standards. More than 7,000 Palestinian prisoners are currently held in some 17 Israeli jails, with dozens of them serving multiple life sentences. Israeli forces have arrested more than 17,000 minors since 2000.

News article:
A new report quoting a source close to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has released more details of the recent daring operation by six Palestinian inmates that led to their escape from Israel's maximum-security Gilboa prison last Monday. The Palestinian prisoners escaped from the Israeli prison in the early hours of Monday, with regime troops launching a manhunt to arrest them. Five of them belong to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), hailing from towns near the occupied northern West Bank city of Jenin. The inmates have been identified as Munadil Nafayat, 26, from Yaabad; Mahmoud and Mohammad al-Arida, both from Arraba; Iham Kahamji, 35, from Kufr Dan; and Yaqoub Qadiri, 49, from Deir al-Basha. The other prisoner has been identified as Zakaria Zubaidi, a former commander of Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Jenin. “The prisoners dug a tunnel under the bathroom sink – something that had been done and discovered by guards several years ago in the very same Gilboa prison. This time, however, the escape of the six captives and their intricately dug tunnel went unnoticed for at least three hours after they fled,” said privately-obtained information disclosed by an Islamic Jihad source. The source revealed that the day before the escape, Zubaidi had requested a transfer from the Fatah prisoner section in the highly-fortified Gilboa prison to the PIJ section and aware of a strong link between him and the PIJ prisoners, the prison administration approved the transfer. "55-year-old Sheikh Raed al-Saadi, incarcerated for 33 years by the Israelis and dean of PIJ detainees in Israel’s prison system, was in that room. The title “dean” is bestowed upon detainees who have spent more than 20 years in prison, while those who have spent more than 25 years are nicknamed “Generals of Patience,” the source underlined. “The other five PIJ prisoners in that section had all been sentenced to life imprisonment. They were active in the Al-Quds Brigades and had carried out a series of operations against the Israeli occupiers,” the source said. “Zubaidi has a long history of armed resistance,” the source added. “At the close of the second intifada in 2002, he and other Fatah members were given an amnesty after Operation Defensive Wall was concluded, and Zubaidi underwent a ‘rehabilitation process’ until he was re-arrested in 2019 for shooting at settlements in the West Bank,” the source added. The PIJ source also revealed that this is not the first time that Palestinian prisoners have escaped from Israel’s maximum security prisons. “Six PIJ detainees were able to break out of Gaza Central Prison in May 1987,” the privately-obtained information said. “The prisoners hid out in a house adjacent to the prison, while the Israeli army hovered above the Gaza Strip searching for them.” The source added that the most prominent of the Israeli jailbreaks was in July 1958, when violent clashes took place between the prisoners and their jailers in Shatta, near Gilboa. "Sixty-six prisoners managed to flee confinement, but 11 other Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed in the daring escapade," the source said. "Then, in 1998, 24 prisoners from various Palestinian political factions tried to break out of Shatta prison. The plan would have succeeded had it not been for the third prisoner to emerge from the tunnel which had taken weeks to dig. He was wearing his shoes, and guard dogs were alerted to the sound of his steps." Meanwhile, Muhammad Jaradat, a freed prisoner who resides in Jenin, has recounted his time in Gilboa prison in 2004. “I will never forget the day I entered the armored steel vault called Gilboa after a brutal interrogation for three months. I extended my hand from the tiny window that overlooks a sealed courtyard, hoping to touch the breeze from my city Jenin mixed with the winds of Marj Ibn Amer, but there was none. We were inside an armored box of iron and concrete, amidst a security system boasting the latest modern technology created by American and British minds – in order to break men.” Jaradat, who was a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, later published a book in Beirut entitled Ibn Taymiyyah: Between the Illusion of Reference and the Dominion of Blood. Since the latest jailbreak on September 6, Israeli forces have stormed dozens of areas across the occupied West Bank district of Jenin, where they conducted extensive searches and raids to find the six Palestinian inmates. According to Palestinian media outlets, the Israeli forces raided the homes of the six escaped prisoners and began to arrest their relatives. The regime’s army claims that its extensive searches are part of efforts to find the six Palestinian political prisoners who escaped from Gilboa prison.

News article:
Fathiyeh Al Ardeh, mother of Mahmoud Al Ardeh, one of six Palestinian prisoners who escaped from Israel’s Gilboa Prison, holds up her hands as she prays for him at her home in the village of Arabah, south of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, on Wednesday (AFP photo) RAMALLAH, Palestinian Territories — Israeli forces have arrested at least six relatives of Palestinians who broke out of a high-security jail, a local watchdog said on Wednesday amid protests in support of the escapees. The six Palestinians staged their jailbreak on Monday through a hole they had dug under a sink in a Gilboa prison cell in northern Israel — reportedly using a spoon. Israel has deployed drones, road checkpoints and an army mission to Jenin, the home town in the occupied West Bank of many of the men locked up for their roles in attacks on Israel. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club said two brothers of Mahmoud Ardah, described in local media as the mastermind of the escape, have been arrested. The forces has also taken into custody four other people — fellow family member Dr Nidal Ardah, two brothers of Mahmoud’s cousin and fellow fugitive Mohammad Ardah and the father of Munadel Infeiat, another escapee. All three of these escapees are members of the Islamic Jihad armed group. Amani Sarahneh, a spokeswoman for the prisoners’ group, told AFP that others could also have been arrested, while some had been only briefly detained. Asked by AFP, the Israeli forces — which has occupied the West Bank since 1967 — said “several arrests were made overnight”, without elaborating. “Holding someone in order to coerce a relative to do something is a mafia-style tactic,” tweeted Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch, on Wednesday. An Israeli injunction is in effect against publishing details of the jailbreak investigation, even as local media report on the scramble to recover from the embarrassing lapse and prevent any possible attack by the fugitives. The group on the run includes Zakaria Zubeidi, a former militant leader from Jenin. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club reported “tensions” in Israeli prisons on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the Israeli prison authorities confirmed to AFP that fires had been lit in Ktziot and Ramon jails. “The situation is now under control, the fires have been extinguished,” she said as Palestinian groups called for rallies later Wednesday in Nablus, Ramallah and Jenin in support of the men on the run. Many people in the Gaza Strip and in Jenin took to the streets to celebrate when news of the escape broke on Monday. Gilboa Prison — which opened in 2004 during the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising — is a high security site where hundreds of Palestinians are detained among other inmates. The prison service said all those held at Gilboa over “security offences” were being relocated in case more escape tunnels have been dug beneath the facility. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has called the breakout “a serious event that required a comprehensive effort by all of the security services”. His Palestinian counterpart, Mohammed Shtayyeh, said on Tuesday he was “happy” about the jailbreak.

News article:
A report Friday claimed that the Palestinian Authority had agreed to cooperate with an Israeli manhunt for six inmates who escaped from prison earlier this week, some of whom are thought to be hiding out in the West Bank. If correct, the report in the Lebanese paper al-Akhbar would mark a stark shift for Ramallah, which had joined the overwhelming chorus of support for the six escapees in the Palestinian street and had been seen as unlikely to possess the political will for cooperating with Israel on bringing them in. For Israel, which has struggled to track the whereabouts of the former detainees and has contended with an upsurge of violence linked to the escape, help from the PA would provide a welcome boost to reach certain areas of the West Bank. According to the report in al-Akhbar, which was based on an unnamed source in the PA, an agreement was reached earlier this week that will see the Palestinian Authority cooperate on finding the escapees, in exchange for an Israeli commitment to capture them alive and ease conditions for the thousands of Palestinians remaining incarcerated in Israel. There was no comment from Israeli authorities on the report. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The newspaper is seen as closely linked to both Hezbollah and Hamas, which is a rival of the Palestinian Authority and often accuses it of betraying the Palestinian cause by cooperating with Israeli security agencies. The six Palestinians escaped from the high-security Gilboa Prison in northern Israel in the predawn hours of Monday morning, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system in one of the most serious prison breaks in the country’s history, and prompting a massive manhunt in northern Israel and the West Bank. Four of the six fugitives were in jail for life in connection with deadly attacks against Israelis; the sixth — a notorious commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade terror group, Zakaria Zubeidi — was in prison while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder. Another was held in administrative detention. Advertisement Police believe that some of the suspects may have fled the country for Jordan — something Jordanian officials have denied — while the Kan public broadcaster reported on Thursday that authorities believe a number of them are still in the West Bank and are being aided by local Palestinians. Tensions have escalated since the prison break as Israeli troops have carried out raids during searches for the escapees, and as authorities have taken actions to move high-value security prisoners to different facilities and separate members of the Islamic Jihad terror group. Israel has deployed drones, road checkpoints, and an army mission to Jenin, the West Bank hometown of many of the escaped prisoners. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club said two brothers of Mahmud Ardah, described in local media as the mastermind of the escape, have been arrested. The army has also taken into custody four other people — fellow family member Dr. Nidal Ardah, along with two brothers of a second fugitive and the father of Munadel Infeiat, another escapee. Palestinians from across the political spectrum have rallied around the escapees, who captured the public’s imagination with what was seen as a daring operation that exposed weaknesses in Israel’s heavily fortified prison complex. Large-scale demonstrations in support of them have occurred across the West Bank and Jerusalem, some of them violent. Advertisement Thursday night saw clashes in the flashpoint city of Hebron, where dozens of Palestinians threw rocks at Israel Defense Forces soldiers. There were no immediate reports of injuries. At least one Palestinian was arrested for allegedly throwing stones at Israeli troops. Troops and police were gearing up Friday morning for the possibility of renewed violence after Hamas called for a “day of rage” in support of the prisoners. The wide popularity enjoyed by the six has tied Ramallah’s hands, making it difficult to justify helping nab the latter-day folk heroes. “The PA won’t cooperate with Israel on the escaped prisoners via the security coordination mechanism,” former PA prisoners’ affairs minister Ashraf al-Ajami told Army Radio Thursday. But according to the al-Akhbar report, the PA was interested in putting the affair to bed amid fears that the continuing unrest could destabilize the West Bank and Gaza, and boost rivals Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Before the prison break, PA President Mahmoud Abbas had made moves to warm ties with Israel, after several years in which the sides had little meaningful contact beyond security cooperation, which was itself frozen for several months before US President Joe Biden took office. Defense Minister Benny Gantz met with Abbas late last month and said he agreed to a series of goodwill gestures. He noted that it was in Israel’s interest to bolster the PA’s hold on power.

The other one could be on either side of the Green Line,” Barlev says in an interview on Channel 12. The two prisoners still on the run are Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, who, like the four other fugitives who were captured by Israeli police last night, are from the area around the northern West Bank city of Jenin. “We will catch them,” Barlev vows. He says that a government commission of inquiry into the prison break that he has proposed will be okayed by the cabinet in the coming days. “The failure must be investigated,” he says.

Israeli police said Saturday that authorities had captured two more of the six Palestinian prisoners who had escaped from a high-security prison earlier this week, with two additional inmates still at large. Reuters reported that officials on Saturday found two of the men in a parking lot in northern Israel near the city of Nazareth, the same area where hours earlier they had located and captured two of the other escaped prisoners. Israeli police released footage purporting to show officers putting the two newly captured men, who were blindfolded and wearing handcuffs, into a vehicle, according to Reuters. The news agency noted that among those captured Saturday was Zakaria Zubeidi, an ex-commander of the Palestinian nationalist Fatah group’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the West Bank. Authorities have said that the other five inmates who participated in the escape are Islamic jihad members. Police are continuing to search for two of the escapees. All of the convicts had been held in the Gilboa prison just north of the West Bank due to convictions or ongoing investigations into attacks planned and carried out against Israeli citizens. Israeli officials first launched a manhunt for the escaped prisoners on Monday as Israel’s Army Radio reported that the men were able to make their way out of the facility through a narrow hole in their prison cell floor that led to a tunnel. Reuters noted that Mohammad al-Arda, brother of Mahmoud al-Arda, one of the prisoners who has been captured by authorities, said that the escape was executed with “no back up from the inside nor coordination with the outside.” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett condemned the prison escape earlier this week, calling it a “grave incident” that required immediate and maximum action from Israel’s national security agencies. The escape, which was praised by many Palestinians on social media, prompted Israeli officials to relocate 400 prisoners as a precaution while authorities ramped up security in the area. The escaped prisoners have also received support from Palestinian militant groups, with Islamic jihad spokesman Daoud Shehab calling the escape this week a “great heroic act [that] will cause a severe shock to the Israeli security system and will constitute a severe blow to the army and the entire system in Israel.”

The six Palestinians staged their jailbreak on Monday through a hole they had dug under a sink in a Gilboa prison cell in northern Israel — reportedly using a spoon. Israel has deployed drones, road checkpoints and an army mission to Jenin, the home town in the occupied West Bank of many of the men locked up for their roles in attacks on Israel. The Palestinian Prisoners' Club said two brothers of Mahmoud Ardah, described in local media as the mastermind of the escape, have been arrested. The forces has also taken into custody four other people — fellow family member Dr Nidal Ardah, two brothers of Mahmoud's cousin and fellow fugitive Mohammad Ardah and the father of Munadel Infeiat, another escapee. All three of these escapees are members of the Islamic Jihad armed group. Amani Sarahneh, a spokeswoman for the prisoners' group, told AFP that others could also have been arrested, while some had been only briefly detained. Asked by AFP, the Israeli forces — which has occupied the West Bank since 1967 — said“several arrests were made overnight”, without elaborating. “Holding someone in order to coerce a relative to do something is a mafia-style tactic,” tweeted Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch, on Wednesday. An Israeli injunction is in effect against publishing details of the jailbreak investigation, even as local media report on the scramble to recover from the embarrassing lapse and prevent any possible attack by the fugitives. The group on the run includes Zakaria Zubeidi, a former militant leader from Jenin. The Palestinian Prisoners' Club reported“tensions” in Israeli prisons on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the Israeli prison authorities confirmed to AFP that fires had been lit in Ktziot and Ramon jails. “The situation is now under control, the fires have been extinguished,” she said as Palestinian groups called for rallies later Wednesday in Nablus, Ramallah and Jenin in support of the men on the run. Many people in the Gaza Strip and in Jenin took to the streets to celebrate when news of the escape broke on Monday. Gilboa Prison — which opened in 2004 during the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising — is a high security site where hundreds of Palestinians are detained among other inmates. The prison service said all those held at Gilboa over“security offences” were being relocated in case more escape tunnels have been dug beneath the facility. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has called the breakout“a serious event that required a comprehensive effort by all of the security services”. His Palestinian counterpart, Mohammed Shtayyeh, said on Tuesday he was“happy” about the jailbreak.

The mother of Muhammad Arda, who had been rearrested after escaping Gilboa prison, at her Jenin home in the occupied West Bank on 11 September. APA images Israel captured this weekend four of six Palestinians who escaped from one of its most heavily fortified prisons on 6 September. Israeli authorities arrested Mahmoud Arda, 46, and Yacoub Qadri, 49, in the city of Nazareth in northern Israel on Friday night. Hours later, Muhammad Arda, 39, and Zakaria Zubeidi, 46, a former commander of al-Aqsa martyrs’ brigades, a militia affiliated with Fatah, were arrested by Israel’s domestic spying and torture agency Shin Bet and the police in Shibli Umm al-Ghanam, a Palestinian town in the north of present-day Israel. Ayham Kamamji, 35, and Munadel Infiat, 26, remain free. The jailed Palestinians dug an underground tunnel from the bathroom of their cell in Gilboa prison in northern Israel that emerged just outside the prison walls under a watchtower. The Israel Prison Service detected the prisoners’ absence only hours after they escaped. Israel’s military, police and intelligence launched a nationwide manhunt to find the men, whose escape was a major embarrassment and humiliation for Israel and its so-called security apparatus. A judge at the Nazareth court where the arrested men are being tried denied on Monday a request from a lawyer with the Palestinian Authority’s commission for prisoners to visit the four detainees. The commission said it was concerned about the “blackout” on the prisoners, warning that Israel may retaliate against them. — Abu Obeida Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman: The re-arrest of some of the Freedom Tunnel heroes does not obscure the truth of their honorable work and only increases our people's pride in the solidity and courage of their captives. https://t.co/tIrrXVQSND pic.twitter.com/VjSItFzRYz — AryJaey 🇮🇷🏴 (@AryJaey) September 11, 2021 Zubeidi’s lawyer said that guards had hidden him from the cameras during a hearing due to injuries sustained during re-arrest, Israeli news site Ynet reported. A photo of Zubeidi posted online by the Palestinian Prisoners Club appeared to back this up. The Israel Prison Service claims Zubaidi was hidden because he had planned “provocations in court,” Ynet added. The club said that Zubeidi’s hospitalization “is indicative of what they have been subjected to,” holding Israeli authorities “fully responsible for any harm suffered by the four prisoners.” After the escape, Israeli prison authorities began swiftly enacting a series of punitive, retaliatory and arbitrary measures against Palestinian prisoners in general, including mass forced transfers, interrogations and mass lockdowns of prison areas, among others. Israel’s prison authorities beat and attacked Palestinian prisoners it moved from Gilboa prison to Shita prison, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club. Around 90 detainees had been transferred. The Palestinian Human Rights Organizations Council filed an urgent appeal “expressing grave concern regarding the collective punishment of all Palestinian prisoners” with United Nations Special Procedures – independent human rights experts mandated to investigate and act on such abuses. The news of the recapture was a blow to Palestinians, who had celebrated the escape as a victory against the image of invincibility which Israel portrays. Nonetheless, morale was raised Saturday when Abu Obeida, spokesperson for Hamas’ armed wing the Qassam Brigades, vowed the prisoners would be freed in the next prisoner exchange. “We promise them and our free prisoners that they will soon be liberated,” Abu Obeida said in an address on Saturday. “That the jailers will open their doors for them and they will emerge with their heads held high.” There have been recent talks about a possible prisoner exchange between Israel and Palestinian resistance organization Hamas. It is believed that Hamas holds four Israelis in Gaza, two of them soldiers believed to be dead. Abu Obeida said the rearrest of the men “does not obscure the reality of their noble pursuit,” adding that their escape “once again demonstrated the fragility of the enemy’s security apparatus.” 🇵🇸#Palestine || The Israeli occupation forces detained the prisoners Mahmoud Arda and Yacoob Qadri, who escaped from Gilboa Prison last week, in Nazareth city. pic.twitter.com/qq4ZfrQY6h — ✌️🇵🇸✌️ Mohammed Najjar (@hamada_pal2020) September 10, 2021 Some Israeli media reports portrayed an image of the escaped men as unwelcome by their Palestinian brethren and having received little help.

Since Monday's breakout, the occupation forces have poured troops into the occupied West Bank for a massive manhunt. But the two latest fugitives to be recaptured, who include a prominent former resistance leader, were found hiding in a lorry park just outside Nazareth in northern occupied Palestine, occupation forces said. Zakaria Zubeidi, 45, is a former leader of the Fateh movement in the West Bank town of Jenin. Mohammad Ardah, 39, was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 for his role in Islamic Jihad's armed wing. "Two more prisoners who escaped were captured a short time ago... while they were hiding in a parking lot for trucks," the forces said. "The hunt for the other two fugitives continues." On Friday evening, occupation forces recaptured Yaqoub Qadri, 48, and Mahmoud Abdullah Ardah, 45, both members of Islamic Jihad. Ardah was the alleged mastermind of the escape. Huge manhunt Israeli media said occupation forces were alerted by residents who reported seeing two men searching litter bins for food. Shortly after their capture was announced on Friday, the occupation forces said that a rocket had been fired at southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, but was intercepted by air defences. Occupation forces had conducted a huge search operation for the six prisoners since they broke out of the high-security Gilboa Prison through a tunnel dug beneath a sink in a cell. The Israeli forces closed all the checkpoints connecting Israel and occupied East Jerusalem with the West Bank in a bid to prevent them escaping into Palestinian population centres. The six fugitives were all members of Palestinian resistance groups who had been convicted by Israeli courts of plotting or carrying out attacks against Israelis. Mahmoud Ardah, from Arraba near Jenin, was imprisoned in 1996 for attacks on Israel claimed by Islamic Jihad and was among four to receive a life sentence. He was held in solitary confinement in 2014 after an escape tunnel was found at Israel's Shata Prison, according to his Islamic Jihad biography. On Thursday, Israel announced a formal inquiry into lapses that allowed the six to escape. A statement from Islamic Jihad said the arrests would not erase the fact of the“heroic” escape, and said any attempt by the Israeli authorities to“take revenge” on the prisoners would be interpreted as a“declaration of war”. Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip, hailed the“heroes” of the“tunnel of freedom”, and Fatah argued that the arrests“would only increase the resolve” of Palestinians against the Israeli occupation. When news of the escape first broke on Monday, many people in the Gaza Strip and in Jenin took to the streets to celebrate. Demonstrations were also held in several West Bank towns and cities, with youths in Nablus setting tyres alight during confrontations with Israeli security forces. Palestinian resistance had called for a“Day of Rage” in support of the prisoners as the manhunt continued.

News article:
Mohammad Al-Arida, one of the escapees from Israel's Gilboa Prison last week who has since been recaptured, has been "tortured", his lawyer Khaled Mahajneh told journalists after meeting his client on Tuesday evening. Mahajneh said that Al-Arida was "very happy" with the few days that he was free. "The fruit that he had for the first time in 22 years compensated for all the time that he was behind bars," explained the lawyer. However, he pointed out that he has been "exposed to harsh torture" following his recapture. According to Mahajneh, Al-Arida has "wounds all over his body, after being interrogated by "twenty" Israeli officials. The prisoner was stripped and naked for much of the interrogation, he added. "He has slept for just ten hours since last Saturday, and faced continuous interrogation," said Mahajneh. "One of the interrogators told him: 'You do not deserve to live. You only deserve to be shot by my pistol'." According to his lawyer, Al-Arida is being held in a very small cell measuring just two metres by one metre which is monitored 24 hours a day by cameras and prison guards. "The first time he had food since his recapture was Monday. He was prevented from rest and prayers and he does not know what time of day or night it is." Moreover, revealed Mahajneh, his client was handcuffed and wore leg irons during the meeting with his lawyer. Six Israeli prison guards stood behind him throughout the meeting. The prisoner does not know who recaptured the other escapees, but said that Israeli security officers attacked Zakaria Al-Zubiedi. Al-Arida added that he was unaware of the international support for him and the other escapees. He asked his lawyer to thank all the people who supported him and are concerned about his situation. READ: Israel: security forces beat and hospitalise recaptured escapee During the meeting with his lawyer, Al-Arida was able to share some of the details of the escape. "We escapees all did our best not to enter Arab cities in Israel in order not to harm anyone by attracting security forces to the area," he told his lawyer. "We tried to get into the West Bank, but couldn't do it." He admitted that he was primarily responsible for planning and carrying out the "Freedom Tunnel Operation" which started in December last year. "There were no other prisoners helping those who escaped," he insisted. His recapture, he said, was "accidental"; nobody reported them. "We were detected accidently. A police patrol passed the area where we were hiding and a policeman saw us accidently." The escapees carried a small radio, through which they were able to follow up what was happening around them. Israel launched its largest-ever manhunt in the bid to recapture the six men, whose escape was a huge embarrassment for the occupation state.

News article:
Jerusalem: Israeli forces on Sunday arrested the last two of six Palestinian prisoners who escaped a maximum-security Israeli prison two weeks ago, closing an intense, embarrassing episode that exposed deep security flaws in Israel and turned the fugitives into Palestinian heroes. The Israeli military said the two men surrendered in Jenin, their hometown in the occupied West Bank, after they were surrounded at a hideout that had been located with the help of “accurate intelligence.” It said the men, along with two others who allegedly assisted them, were taken for questioning. Palestinian media reported that clashes erupted in Jenin when Israeli troops entered the city. But a spokesman for Israeli police, said the two escapees, Munadil Nafayat and Iham Kamamji, were arrested without resistance. The military said clashes broke out as the forces withdrew, with residents hurling rocks and explosives at troops who responded with live fire. Fouad Kamamji, Iham’s father, told The Associated Press that his son had called him when the Israeli troops surrounded the house and said he will surrender “in order not to endanger the house owners.” Dominated newscasts The prisoners all managed to tunnel out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel on September 6. The bold escape dominated newscasts for days and sparked heavy criticism of Israel’s prison service. According to various reports, the men dug a hole in the floor of their shared cell undetected over several months and managed to slip past a sleeping prison guard after emerging through a hole outside the facility. A massive pursuit operation followed, and the first four inmates, who also are from Jenin, were captured in two separate operations. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett praised the various Israeli security forces that worked to recapture the men for “an impressive, sophisticated and quick operation.” “What has broken down _ it is possible to rectify,” Bennett added. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have celebrated the escape and held demonstrations in support of the prisoners. Taking part in attacks against the Israeli military or even civilians is a source of pride for many Palestinians, who view it as legitimate resistance to military occupation. The earlier arrests of four of the men prompted Gaza militants to launch rockets into Israel. Five are from the Islamic Jihad group, with four of them serving life sentences, and the sixth, Zakaria Zubeidi, is a member of the secular Fatah group of President Mahmoud Abbas. Zubeidi was a militant leader during the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s and well known in Israel both for his militant activity and his love for giving media interviews. Lawyers for Zubeidi and Mohammed Aradeh, who was captured with him last week, have said their clients were badly beaten after their arrests.

News article:
A group advocating Palestinian prisoners’ rights says scores of Palestinians have been arrested by Israeli forces in recent days as the Tel Aviv regime is pressing ahead with its crackdown following a heroic escape of six Palestinian inmates from a high-security Israeli jail. In a report on Sunday, the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association said Israeli forces have detained more than 100 Palestinians since the daring jailbreak from the Gilboa prison located in the northern part of the occupied territories through an underground tunnel earlier this month. “We have documented an average of 14 arrests per day in the occupied West Bank since the men escaped,” Milena Ansari from Addameer told Al Jazeera. “This does not include the Palestinians arrested within Israel.” Israel launched a campaign of mass arrests and raids in the occupied cities of Ramallah, al-Khalil, Nablus and surrounding villages following the prison break. A number of Palestinian children were also swept up in the latest wave of arrests. In the predawn hours of September 6, Zakaria Zubeidi, a former commander of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade in Jenin and five Islamic Jihad members tunneled their way out through their cell’s drainage system and escaped from Gilboa prison. Four of the Islamic Jihad members were serving life sentences, while the fifth had been held without charge for two years under a so-called administrative detention order, according to Israeli media. Over 4,500 Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli prisons faced a repressive campaign by the Tel Aviv regime in the wake of the recent escape. The Israel Prison Service (IPS) sent many Palestinian prisoners into solitary confinement and restricted their access to essential services. Last Saturday, Israeli media outlets reported that four of the escapees had been arrested in the northern part of the occupied territories. Following the arrests last week, thousands of Palestinians held protests across the occupied West Bank in support of the six prisoners, particularly those who were recaptured. The protests were held amid fears of an Israeli retaliation that has already repressed hundreds of Palestinian political prisoners. The heroic jailbreak has come as a huge embarrassment to Tel Aviv and exposed fault lines in its much-hyped security and intelligence apparatus. The Gilboa prison is one of the highly-fortified detention centers in Israel. The Palestinian resistance groups and several political factions have warned Israel against causing harm and endangering the lives of prisoners. On Sunday, the Israeli ministry of military affairs said earlier in the day that the two remaining Palestinian prisoners were apprehended in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin. It said the two Palestinians “were caught alive”, surrendering without resistance after troops encircled their building. Palestinian media outlets said there were exchanges of gunfire during the pre-dawn raid by Israeli special forces. Palestine’s Wafa news agency reported on Sunday that the Israeli soldiers fired live bullets at protesters during the clashes which erupted in the neighborhood following the raid, injuring at least two of them. The two were hospitalized. Two other Palestinians, reportedly Jenin residents, were also arrested in the raid, including a man with physical disability. Prison authorities keep Palestinian inmates under deplorable conditions lacking proper hygienic standards. The prisoners have also been subjected to systematic torture, harassment and repression. Human rights organizations say Israel violates all the rights and freedoms granted to prisoners by the Fourth Geneva Convention. There are reportedly more than 7,000 Palestinians held at Israeli jails. Hundreds of the inmates have been apparently incarcerated under the practice of administrative detention.

News article:
© Ahmad Gharabli/AFP © Ashraf Amra/APA Images Police say the two men, who escaped on September 6, were found in an eastern district of Jenin city.Israel says it captured the last two Palestinian prisoners who escaped from a maximum-security prison more than 10 days ago.The jailbreak embarrassed Israel's security establishment but delighted Palestinians who see members of armed groups jailed by Israel as heroes in the struggle for Palestinian statehood.Fouad Kamamji, father of prisoner Ayham Kamamji who was rearrested on Sunday at dawn, told local TV: "He [Ayham] risked his life, got out, and managed to get to Jenin - despite all the military reinforcements, the army and all the technology that Israel owns, he managed to get to Jenin" and "hold out for two weeks."The men, the last of the six who escaped Gilboa prison on September 6, were found in the eastern district of Jenin city, the police announced on Twitter on Sunday.Israeli police identified the men as Ayham Nayef Kamamji and Munadel Yacoub Infai'at. Kamamji, 35, was arrested in 2006 and is serving a life sentence, and Infai'at, 26, was arrested in 2019, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.Fouad Kamamji said he received a phone call from his son at 1:45am informing him that he was surrounded by Israeli occupation forces in Jenin.Fouad added he believes the home that provided Ayham with shelter in represents "real patriotism" and the essence of the Palestinian people.The Israeli army said the men turned themselves in "after being surrounded by security forces" acting on intelligence.Meanwhile, family of Munadel Infai'at, from the village of Ya'bad in Jenin, said in a live TV interview that the family found out about the arrest of his son through media at 2:30am.His mother described Munadel's rearrest as a "disaster" and said the family had no prior knowledge of him being in Jenin."I hold Israel responsible - if anything happens to my son - they will be held responsible," she said.Palestinians in Jenin clashed with Israeli troops as they raided the city early on Sunday, residents said. The Israeli military said clashes broke out as the forces withdrew, with residents hurling rocks and explosives at troops who responded with live fire.Israeli authorities announced the rearrest of Mahmoud Abdullah al-Ardah, 46, and Yaqoub Mahmoud Qadri, 49, on the southern outskirts of Nazareth late on Friday. Zakaria Zubeidi, 46 and Mohammed al-Ardah, 39, were arrested nearby early on Saturday, in the Palestinian village of Shibli-Umm al-Ghanam.At a court hearing in Nazareth on Sunday, Israeli authorities once again extended their detention for another ten days to continue the interrogation process where they are being held at Jalama Detention Center near Haifa.Meanwhile, prisoners Ayham Kamamji and Munadel Infai'at are expected to appear before the court in Nazareth later on Sunday, where it is expected that their detention order will be extended.The six Palestinians broke out of the maximum-security Israeli prison by digging a tunnel under a sink in their cell, using spoons, plates and even the handle of a kettle.Their lawyers say the men began work on the tunnel last December.The bold escape dominated newscasts for days and sparked heavy criticism of Israel's prison service.Palestinians have protested in support of the men across the country, and Palestinian citizens of Israel planned protests around the court hearing on Sunday.In a short statement, the Hamas political party saluted the rearrested prisoners, and said the "leadership of the resistance is working to complete an honorable [prisoner] exchange deal for our prisoners and our people, of which the six prisoners will be among its heroes."Qaddura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Society, said the six prisoners "restored the unity of the Palestinian street".He added that Palestinian prisoners "have become more aware of their ability to influence the national situation."

News article:
© Ahmad Gharabli/AFP © Ashraf Amra/APA Images Police say the two men, who escaped on September 6, were found in an eastern district of Jenin city.Israel says it captured the last two Palestinian prisoners who escaped from a maximum-security prison more than 10 days ago.The jailbreak embarrassed Israel's security establishment but delighted Palestinians who see members of armed groups jailed by Israel as heroes in the struggle for Palestinian statehood.Fouad Kamamji, father of prisoner Ayham Kamamji who was rearrested on Sunday at dawn, told local TV: "He [Ayham] risked his life, got out, and managed to get to Jenin - despite all the military reinforcements, the army and all the technology that Israel owns, he managed to get to Jenin" and "hold out for two weeks."The men, the last of the six who escaped Gilboa prison on September 6, were found in the eastern district of Jenin city, the police announced on Twitter on Sunday.Israeli police identified the men as Ayham Nayef Kamamji and Munadel Yacoub Infai'at. Kamamji, 35, was arrested in 2006 and is serving a life sentence, and Infai'at, 26, was arrested in 2019, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.Fouad Kamamji said he received a phone call from his son at 1:45am informing him that he was surrounded by Israeli occupation forces in Jenin.Fouad added he believes the home that provided Ayham with shelter in represents "real patriotism" and the essence of the Palestinian people.The Israeli army said the men turned themselves in "after being surrounded by security forces" acting on intelligence.Meanwhile, family of Munadel Infai'at, from the village of Ya'bad in Jenin, said in a live TV interview that the family found out about the arrest of his son through media at 2:30am.His mother described Munadel's rearrest as a "disaster" and said the family had no prior knowledge of him being in Jenin."I hold Israel responsible - if anything happens to my son - they will be held responsible," she said.Palestinians in Jenin clashed with Israeli troops as they raided the city early on Sunday, residents said. The Israeli military said clashes broke out as the forces withdrew, with residents hurling rocks and explosives at troops who responded with live fire.Israeli authorities announced the rearrest of Mahmoud Abdullah al-Ardah, 46, and Yaqoub Mahmoud Qadri, 49, on the southern outskirts of Nazareth late on Friday. Zakaria Zubeidi, 46 and Mohammed al-Ardah, 39, were arrested nearby early on Saturday, in the Palestinian village of Shibli-Umm al-Ghanam.At a court hearing in Nazareth on Sunday, Israeli authorities once again extended their detention for another ten days to continue the interrogation process where they are being held at Jalama Detention Center near Haifa.Meanwhile, prisoners Ayham Kamamji and Munadel Infai'at are expected to appear before the court in Nazareth later on Sunday, where it is expected that their detention order will be extended.The six Palestinians broke out of the maximum-security Israeli prison by digging a tunnel under a sink in their cell, using spoons, plates and even the handle of a kettle.Their lawyers say the men began work on the tunnel last December.The bold escape dominated newscasts for days and sparked heavy criticism of Israel's prison service.Palestinians have protested in support of the men across the country, and Palestinian citizens of Israel planned protests around the court hearing on Sunday.In a short statement, the Hamas political party saluted the rearrested prisoners, and said the "leadership of the resistance is working to complete an honorable [prisoner] exchange deal for our prisoners and our people, of which the six prisoners will be among its heroes."Qaddura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Society, said the six prisoners "restored the unity of the Palestinian street".He added that Palestinian prisoners "have become more aware of their ability to influence the national situation."

News article:
The Palestinian jailbreak affair that rocked Israel in the past two weeks came to an end on Sunday morning after the last two fugitives were arrested in the West Bank city of Jenin. As was the case in the capture of the two previous pairs of prisoners about a week ago, the security forces operated impeccably: The fugitives were returned to prison alive and well, and no other person was harmed during the search. That is the surest way to calm the atmosphere in the territories, after there was genuine fear that the success of the escape would inspire terror attacks in the West Bank and perhaps even lead indirectly to a renewed escalation in the Gaza Strip. The realization that the fifth prisoner was in the Jenin area had already begun to dawn last week. When the prisoner crossed into the West Bank, he was caught on one of the cameras placed along the much-breached separation barrier. At a later stage, the film was cross-referenced with additional information, which determined with certainty that he was in Jenin. Later it turned out that the sixth prisoner was also there, and that the two were most likely hiding inside the refugee camp in the city. There was tight intelligence surveillance by the Shin Bet security service and the Israel Defense Forces intelligence units, in the hope that the escapees would make mistakes and reveal their precise location. The Police Special Anti-Terror Unit was placed on alert for several days, until the decision to activate it on Saturday night. That happened when it was discovered that the two had left the camp and were in a safe house in the eastern part of the city. A police anti-terror force surrounded the house towards morning, when additional forces from the unit and the military placed roadblocks on the access road from the refugee camp to the neighborhood where the prisoners were hiding, for fear that armed Palestinians would come to help them. The implementation of a "pressure cooker," the military order for surrounding wanted individuals during a standoff, lasted for about 20 minutes, until the two handed themselves over without a fight. Another two Palestinians suspected of helping them were arrested along with them. None of the four were armed. Apparently they were well aware that if they carried a weapon, they would have less of a chance to stay alive. That was the end of the affair that began almost two weeks ago, with the embarrassing escape of prisoners from a supposedly top-security facility in Gilboa Prison. And it is also the best conclusion for Israel, because the six were returned to their prison cells (hopefully separately), the intelligence and operational control by the security forces in the field was proven once again, and there was no bloodshed, which could have led to additional casualties on both sides. Even so, there has already been a series of stabbing attacks and attempted attacks in the past two weeks, at least some of which can be attributed to the tailwind caused by the escape. We can reasonably assume that the six will remain heroes in the eyes of the Palestinians, but there is no question that had they become dead heroes, martyrs, the damage that would have been done by their deeds would have been far greater. Open gallery view Palestinian prisoner Mahmoud Aradeh in court after being recaptured, earlier this month. Credit: Rami Shllush The successful captures arrived with good timing for the senior officials involved. Nadav Argaman will end his tenure as head of the Shin Bet at the beginning of next month. Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai needed an operational achievement after a period during which he was criticized for various failures in his areas of responsibility. And the IDF was also seeking a win, after the negative reverberations aroused by the death of sniper Barel Hadaria Shmueli in an incident at the Gaza Strip border. And it could perhaps be a good opportunity for a voluntary resignation by Israel Prison Service Commissioner Katy Perry. It is already clear that the escape was made possible by many serious failures that were her responsibility. A commission of inquiry, as generous and forgiving as it may be, won't absolve Perry of responsibility. This may be the time for the commissioner to take a precursory step, which will also be better received by the public. The mishap in the Israel Prison Service is not only significant – a warden who fell asleep at the watchtower, regulations that were not properly followed – but systemic. Despite the huge sums invested in the prison service over the past decade, the organization was exposed in disgrace. It would seem that someone on whose shift these things happened will no longer be able to repair defects on such a scale. In the Palestinian arena, Gaza remains the major and urgent problem, even if the manhunt after the escapees did not supply the match that was supposed to rekindle the conflagration. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett greatly enjoyed his visit with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi last week in Sharm al-Sheikh, but the summit meeting still didn't lead to a solution of the immediate problems in the Strip, first and foremost the salary crisis. As long as Hamas' most recent demand has not been met – the final third of the Qatari assistance money, worth $10 million a month – it is doubtful whether it will be possible to declare a lull. On Sunday, Arab media outlets cited vague Egyptian promises about a solution that will be formulated. Without it, there is a good chance of a renewed conflagration in the Strip, when what begins with incendiary balloons continues with the launching of rockets.

News article:
Palestinian Munadel Infeiat, 26, one of the six prisoners who had tunnelled out of Israel's high security Gilboa Prison, is surrounded by Israeli forces as he appears at the magistrates' court in the northern Israeli city of Nazareth on Sunday (AFP photo) OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — All six Palestinians who escaped an Israeli high-security jail through a tunnel dug under a sink are back in custody, after the forces said on Sunday they had recaptured the last two. The inmates, who were being held for attacks against Israel, became heroes among many Palestinians when reports emerged they had burrowed out using tools as basic as a spoon. The full weight of Israel's security apparatus was deployed to catch them, including aerial drones, road checkpoints and an army mission to Jenin in the occupied West Bank where many of the men grew up. The huge manhunt lasted almost a fortnight, with the first four fugitives recaptured last week. The Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday the remaining two had surrendered "after being surrounded by security forces" that had acted with precision on accurate intelligence. The men, 35-year-old Ayham Kamamji and 26-year-old Munadel Infeiat, are both members of Islamic Jihad, an armed Palestinian Islamist movement. Islamic Jihad hailed its "heroes" following the re-arrests, vowing the Palestinian people "will not surrender" in response to Israeli "criminality and aggression". The pair were arrested in a joint operation with counterterrorism forces in Jenin and were "currently being interrogated", the Israeli forces statement said. Two other men who had allegedly helped the fugitives were also detained, it added. 'Major mishap' Taleb Abo Jaafar, who owns the Jenin house in which the two fugitives were found, said he had been surprised to discover his home cordoned off in the middle of the night. "There was shooting around the house. I went out to see what happened, I opened the door and looked at the street, the forces were outside and they told me to go back inside," he told AFP. In a call on Sunday with Israeli security chiefs, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett branded the escape "a major mishap". “But you mobilised with joint forces until the mission was completed,” he added, vowing in a separate statement that the security establishment would “correct what needs to be corrected”. All six fugitives were members of Palestinian groups who were convicted by Israeli courts of plotting or carrying out attacks against Israelis. Kamamji, originally from Kafr Dan near Jenin, was arrested in 2006 and jailed for life for the kidnap and murder of a young Israeli settler, Eliahu Asheri. Islamic Jihad said Kamamji suffered abdominal and intestinal illness in jail and was subject to “medical negligence” by prison authorities. Infeiat, arrested last year, had been jailed multiple times previously for his role in the armed group, and was awaiting sentencing at the time of the escape. Hiding in lorry park The other four men recaptured last week included Mahmoud Abdullah Ardah, the alleged mastermind of the escape, and Zakaria Zubeidi, who headed the armed wing of the Fateh movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Zubeidi was found hiding in a lorry park just outside Nazareth in northern Israel along with one of the other men, Mohammad Ardah, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 for his role in Islamic Jihad’s armed wing. The remand of the four was extended at Nazareth’s magistrates’ court to September 29 in a Sunday hearing, police said. ‘Spoon of freedom’ Questions remain over how jailbreak could have happened, and a formal inquiry has been announced. A lawyer for Yaqub Qadri, the sixth escapee, told Palestinian television that the inmates had not planned to escape when they did on September 6. She said they rushed ahead with the plan on that day because they feared guards had become suspicious and noticed changes in their cell. The break-out had been planned for months, Ardah’s lawyer told AFP, saying that “Mahmoud told me he started digging in December”. Ardah told him he used spoons, plates and even the handle of a kettle to dig the tunnel from his jail cell. Spoons have since become a symbol of Palestinian resistance, with protesters both inside and outside the Palestinian territories carrying them at demonstrations. They have inspired political artwork as far away as Kuwait, where artist Maitham Abdal has sculpted a giant hand clasping what he labelled the “spoon of freedom”.

News article:
Israel reopened a crossing with the West Bank on Wednesday for the first time since six Palestinian security prisoners tunneled out of a nearby prison, a rare escape that triggered a massive search before they were all recaptured. COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees civilian affairs in the West Bank, said that the Jalama crossing into the northern West Bank would be open for the first time since September 6, when the prisoners escaped. Six prisoners escaped Gilboa Prison in northern Israel through a shaft in the floor of their bathroom, in the biggest jailbreak of its kind in decades. They later split up into groups of two. The final two escapees were caught in the West Bank city of Jenin in the predawn hours of Sunday morning, a week after the four other escaped prisoners were recaptured in northern Israel, bringing the massive 13-day manhunt to a close. The six prisoners escaped from the high-security facility in northern Israel in the predawn hours of September 6, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system and an empty space underneath the prison, in one of the most severe prison breaks in the country’s history, which prompted a massive manhunt in northern Israel and the West Bank.

Five of the fugitives were members of the Islamic Jihad terror group. They were charged with various terror-related crimes, from illegal weapons trade, to kidnapping and murder. The sixth was Zakaria Zubeidi, a commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade terror group, who was in prison while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder.

[1/4] A Palestinian boy walks outside the house where Israeli forces caught the last two of six Palestinian militants who had tunnelled out of a maximum security Israeli jail, in Jenin, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank September 19, 2021. REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman TEL AVIV/RAMALLAH, West Bank, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Israeli forces on Sunday caught the last two of six Palestinian militants who tunnelled out of a maximum security Israeli jail nearly two weeks ago, in an escape that embarrassed Israel's security establishment but delighted Palestinians. The two members of the Islamic Jihad militant group were apprehended before dawn from a house in the Palestinian city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, Israeli Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai said. Palestinians see members of armed groups jailed by Israel as heroes in the struggle for statehood in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel considers them terrorists. An Israeli police spokeswoman identified the men as Ayham Nayef Kamamji and Munadel Yacoub Infeiat. Kamamji, 35, was arrested in 2006 and is serving a life sentence, and Infeiat, 26, was arrested in 2019, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club. The other four were captured in pairs a week ago near the Arab city of Nazareth in northern Israel. All six have either been convicted or are suspected of planning or carrying out deadly attacks on Israelis. Palestinians in Jenin clashed with Israeli troops as they raided the city early on Sunday, residents said. Kamamji and Infeiat surrendered after being surrounded by Israeli forces, and two other Palestinians were arrested for assisting them, Israel's military said. All four were transferred for questioning, the military said in a statement. Palestinians hurled rocks and explosives towards Israeli troops and shot live fire as the troops exited the city, the military added. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank and coordinates with Israel on security in the territory. The six Palestinians who broke free on Sept. 6 had tunnelled a hole through their prison cell. Israeli officials say they will investigate any lapses that allowed their escape. Palestinians have protested in support of the men across the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Members of Israel's Arab minority, who often identify as Palestinians, have also demonstrated in support of the men, with more protests planned for later Sunday.

News article:
Tel Aviv - Nazir Magally A report on the escape of six Palestinian prisoners from the Gilboa prison in early September has indicated that they likely crumbled the concrete on the floor of the cell using acid or Coca Cola soft drink. The Israeli Army’s Combat Engineering Corps issued a report showing that the escape route of the prisoners included lifting a marble slab in the shower cubicle and digging a tunnel shaft through layers of steel and concrete to the space below. “The prisoners dug a tunnel shaft under a marble slab in the shower cubicle, passing through the top tin (5 mm of steel) and through the ground floor (20 cm of concrete) into the underground space,” the report read. It pointed to the fact that the concrete can be weakened and crumbled over time by using various acids, without the use of special means, “a cola drink can be used.” “The length of the escape tunnel is about 35 meters, 29 meters of which they dug themselves, with an average diameter of 0.5 meters, which includes around 5-6 cubic meters of soil, they gradually disposed through the sewers.” “The excavation material was used to line the excavated route inside the spaces of the link beams, saving the need to evacuate the excavation material into the prison,” it explained. Meanwhile, Israel’s Prison Service (IPS) transferred the prisoners, who will be indicted on Sunday, to solitary confinement in various prisons. According to Karim Ajwa, a lawyer in the Palestinian Authority's Prisoners and Freed Prisoners Committee, Mahmoud al-Ardah has been placed in a small and dirty cell in Ashkelon prison. He is being monitored constantly in solitary confinement, including when he uses the toilet, depriving him of privacy. He is considering a hunger strike if his prison conditions worsen in the coming days, Ajwa stressed. Zakaria Zubeidi is being held in the notorious desert prison of Eshel in the Negev, in southern Israel, Ajwa said, while Ayham Kamةji has been moved to solitary confinement in Ohli Kedar prison, also in the Negev, Yaqoub Qadri to Rimonim prison and Munadel Nfeiat and Mahmoud Abdullah Ardah to Ayalon prison in Ramla.

News article:
By Yoni Weiss YERUSHALAYIM — The Northern District Attorney’s Office filed an indictment with the Nazareth Magistrate’s Court on Sunday against the six prisoners who broke out of the Gilboa Prison on Sept. 6. The failure of the Israel Prisons Service to prevent the breakout overshadowed the Shin Bet’s and IDF’s success at recapturing them within about two weeks and has led to an impending state commission of inquiry. Already there is a high likelihood that the head of Gilboa Prison will be fired, and some have called for the firing of the IPS Chief Katy Perry. The State Attorney’s Office on Wednesday filed a statement of prosecution against the prisoners who escaped, as well as against five additional inmates who aided them. One surprise was that the final filed charges did not contain some of the new terror-related charges which had been leaked to the media by police and security forces but focused solely on the actions of illegal fleeing confinement. Of the six escapees, the most prominent was Zakaria Zubeidi, a Fatah commander who was responsible for multiple terrorist attacks and for killing many Israelis. Munadil Nafayat, Iham Kahamji, Yaquob Qadiri, and brothers Mahmoud and Mohammed al-Arida were the other escapees – all of them members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad and from towns near Jenin. The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison, including that the IPS didn’t learn lessons from a previous escape attempt at the prison, as well as several other major issues. These include sleeping guards, unmanned watchtowers due to a shortage of staff and the sense of boldness security prisoners feel vis-à-vis the guards. The investigation of the incident – the worst jailbreak in Israel’s history – is headed by the Lahav 433 Major Crimes Unit.

Elderly Palestinian demonstrators chant slogans in front of Israeli soldiers during a demonstration against Israeli land confiscation and the cutting of water supply for Palestinian villages, in the southern area of the West bank town of Hebron, on Saturday (AFP photo) OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — Six Palestinian prisoners who made a daring escaping from an Israeli prison in September were formally indicted on Sunday, Israel's justice ministry said. The men were charged with escaping from the high-security Gilboa Prison in northern Israel while five others were accused of assisting them, a statement said. The inmates, five from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group and one belonging to the armed branch of the Palestinian Authority's Fateh faction, had been held for attacks against Israel. According to the charge sheet, at the end of 2020 they began digging a tunnel under the sink of their cell's bathroom. “The defendants carried out the digging work daily in shifts, accommodated to their routine to prevent them from being caught, while using improvised digging tools,” the indictment said. One of them, Mahmud Abdullah Ardah, said after he was recaptured that he had used spoons, plates and even the handle of a kettle to dig the tunnel. By September 5, the 30 metre-long tunnel, ending beyond the prison’s wall, was complete, the indictment said, with the convicts escaping that night. The six, hailed as heroes by Palestinians, were recaptured in batches during a major Israeli manhunt in September. In addition to Ardah, an Islamic Jihad member and the alleged mastermind of the escape, they include Zakaria Zubeidi who headed the Fateh armed wing in northern West Bank city Jenin. The other four are Ayham Kamamji, Munadel Infeiat, Yaqub Qadri and Mohammad Ardah. Israel has launched an investigation into how they pulled off their daring escaping.

News article:
CHICAGO: Iran’s aggressive and expanding unmanned aerial vehicles program is a growing threat not only to countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, but also the West, according to officials from the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the NCRI’s Washington office, said the program includes eight production and assembly sites across Iran that receive parts and materials from foreign countries. During a briefing on Wednesday, attended by Arab News, he said UAVs, or drones, have been used to attack many Western targets in conflict zones such as Syria and Iraq, as well as targets in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. Tehran supplies the Houthi militia in Yemen with the drones that are the primary weapons used in its terror campaign against targets in Saudi Arabia, Jafarzadeh said. They are “assembled in Yemen” and many essential components come from sources outside of Iran, he added. “The UAV program has only one purpose and that is destabilizing the region and creating chaos,” Jafarzadeh said. He added that eight industries in Iran are involved in “disguising” the production of the weaponized drones. “The Iranian regime has really stepped up its efforts and money and resources to its UAV program, to destabilize the region. Billions of dollars have been spent on UAVs and missiles, and under (Iranian President Ebrahim) Raisi this program will gain more prominence. The question is, what is to be done?” Jafarzadeh said that Iran’s multibillion-dollar UAV program, which he described as “the regime’s primary weapon for terrorism,” is directed by Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. He continued: “Iran is expanding its terror and destabilizing efforts in the region, and the oppression of people in Iran. We must hold Iran responsible and make them pay the price. … We need to see firmness, decisiveness and stepped-up pressure against the Iranian regime.” Iran’s UAV program is a direct result of “counterproductive” negotiations with Western nations about the lifting sanctions, Jafarzadeh said, during which Tehran bolstered and expanded the program. “Obviously, sanctions by themselves will not solve all of this problem,” he added. “But sanctions are a tool, making (Iran) pay the price. “If the regime is allowed to carry out an extensive operation (like) that we showed today without any consequences, then they are encouraged and will do more. You want to hold the regime itself accountable.” To support his arguments, Jafarzadeh presented detailed satellite images, graphs and charts he said reveal the complexity and “alarming new details” of Iran’s UAV terror program. The information was gathered inside Iran for the NCRI by opposition group the Mujahedin-e Khalq. Over the past two decades, the NCRI has exposed dozens of what it says are key sites that form parts of Tehran’s nuclear weapons program, missile program and growing terrorism network in the region.

News article:
Iranian dissidents are warning of the hard-line regime’s use of drones to cause instability in the region, saying it is using the technology – materials for which are being imported from China – to make up for the weaknesses of its air force. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an umbrella group of Iranian resistance groups that oppose the regime, released evidence in a press conference it says shows the production and utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UACs) for terrorist operations and for assisting its proxies in the Middle East – including aerial photographs of the alleged sites and details that have emerged from inside the country. STATE DEPARTMENT FRUSTRATED BY IRAN STONEWALLING ON NUCLEAR TALKS "Our revelation today is significant because it shows that the Qods Force of the IRGC has in recent years expanded its arsenal to step up terrorism and warmongering to destabilize the region by arming its proxies with UAVs," Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the Washington office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, told Fox News. "This is in line with the regime’s nuclear defiance and its repression at home." The group alleges that the regime, which has been rocked by a slew of economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration as well as protests at home and challenges related to its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, has used a web of industries to spend billions of dollars to produce components or smuggle them in from foreign countries. The NCRI report alleges that at least one of the operations, Ghazanfar Roknabadi Industries, provides support and training for International Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) factories and uses raw materials that are imported from the Chinese communist regime. The findings by the group also show that a new drone complex, with a specialized drone unit, has been set up in Semnan since 2019 -- which includes work on reproduction of light and quiet drones. The drones are then transported in pieces and moved as part of an effort to control the country’s borders. Those are two of the factories the NCRI claims is being used as part of the drone project and a project that also includes the regime’s UAV Command -- which is one of the branches of the regime’s air force. AS IRANIAN LEADER RAISI ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY, DISSIDENTS CALL FOR PRESSURE ON REGIME All in all, it identifies eight alleged UAV manufacturing bases and seven more for maintenance and other services -- while the Quds forces is working to make sure that the drone program equips proxies in the region, including in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon, with the advanced technology. Those drones have been used in a variety of ways, including to identify and attack Syrian opposition forces and to help Houthis in Yemen use drones in their attacks against Saudi-backed forces. The group also says that the IRGC has made "extensive use of drones inside Iraq" to militant groups, such as the Al-Nujaba group -- which have reportedly displayed its UAV capabilities during parades. The NCRI, which has long called for a democratic and secular Iran, calls on countries not to lift any further sanctions on the regime until it stops its aggressive behavior. "It is time for the U.S., Europe, and the countries of the region to adopt a firm policy by expanding sanctions, and holding [President Ebrahim] Raisi and [Ayatollah] Khamenei to account until Tehran abandons its rogue behavior and ends human rights violations," Jafarzadeh said. The Biden administration has indicated it wishes to rejoin the controversial 2015 Iran nuclear deal, from which the U.S. departed in 2018, and talks have been ongoing in Vienna to bring both sides back into the international agreement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, since the talks ended in June, a new hard-line president -- Ebraham Raisi -- has been inaugurated and has since stalled on talks with the U.S. amid calls from Iran for sanctions relief. "We know they are going through a transition, but it's been three months," a State Department official told Fox last month, adding that the United States "may reach a point where we may have to conclude [the Iran deal] is no longer viable" and whether it is even "still relevant."

News article:
The commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) says the Guards’ naval forces have reached the “quick reaction” capability in the face of any threat, stressing that the enemies have to come to terms with the reality of Iran’s offensive and defensive power. “Using modern electronic warfare systems, the IRGC Navy has been able to gain complete control over the geography of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, which is one of the honors of our Navy today,” Major General Hossein Salami said on Friday. He made the remarks during a visit to the IRGC’s naval units on the Persian Gulf islands and the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Gen. Salami said the IRGC Navy has managed to achieve remarkable progress, particularly in producing state-of-the-art vessels, long-range drones and sea-based guided missiles, in the last three years. “Our enemies must come to terms with the reality of the offensive and defensive power of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IRGC,” he said. Iranian armed forces have frequently warned hostile countries against any threatening the Islamic Republic and its interests, in particular extra-regional forces. Tehran insists that the security of the region cannot be provided by Western powers, calling on the regional countries to join hands to expel foreign forces and establish collective security through intra-regional cooperation. The commander of the IRGC Navy said in August that Iran fully monitors the movements of every vessel that enters or exits the strategic Strait of Hormuz, warning the enemies against the slightest act of violation. “The Persian Gulf is our home and not a place for foreigners,” Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri said. In his Friday remarks, Gen. Salami asserted that there is no single action that would be tolerated under Iran’s defense policies and strategies. He emphasized that all the hardware employed by the IRGC Navy are fully produced domestically, including missiles, defense systems, electronic warfare systems, drones and subsurface missiles. According to Gen. Salami, different units of the IRGC Navy are at their maximum readiness and are able to respond quickly and decisively to any threat. “We are ready for each and every scenario, and today, some of such readiness can be seen on the shores of the blue Gulf of forever Persian,” the IRGC commander stated. Salami’s remarks came a week after the IRGC published a video of an encounter between its speedboats and two US vessels in the Persian Gulf. During the video, the speedboats are seen chasing the American vessels until they leave the area.

News article:
WASHINGTON, D.C.: In recent months multiple waves of attacks by so-called loitering munitions, a type of unmanned aerial vehicle designed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have been launched against civilian facilities in various parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Iran’s political pawn in Yemen, the Houthis, has been given the know-how and components to use the technology as part of a regional strategy that has led to a spike in drone attacks throughout the Middle East. In one particularly devastating attack, on Sept. 14, 2019, Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq and Khurais oil-processing facilities were badly damaged by a combined missile and drone strike, sending shock waves crashing through the global oil market. The drones are relatively cheap to manufacture and can be difficult to defend against, particularly the loitering “suicide” munitions that have been used with increasing frequency by Iran and its proxies against Arab, American and Israeli interests across the Middle East. The targets include civilian airports, major oil storage sites, commercial shipping, and both military and diplomatic facilities. Defense policy planners and military commanders are hard pressed to come up with a strategy that can effectively counter Iran’s successful harnessing of asymmetric warfare to its domestic drone-production capabilities. Ali Bakir, a research assistant professor at Qatar University’s Ibn Khaldon Center for Humanities and Social Sciences, said Tehran is leveraging drone strikes by its extremist proxies to strengthen its position in the region. A coordinated response by regional allies is needed to prevent further attacks, he added. “Although not of sophisticated nature, Iran’s fleet of drones poses a growing threat to its neighbors and security in the Gulf,” Bakir told Arab News. “This threat stems from the fact that Tehran is using drones with relatively primitive technology as missiles to compensate for the lack of adequate ammunition and advanced targeting systems. Equipping the IRGC’s regional franchise with these drones enables Iran to extend its reach and lethality. “Surprisingly, despite the serious damage caused by the Iranian drones used to attack Saudi Arabia’s strategic oil facilities in 2019, no adequate and strategic response has yet been developed to counter Tehran’s drone threat, either by the Arab states or by the US.” The IRGC’s use of proxies, such as the Houthis and Iraqi Shiite militia groups such as Kataeb Hezbollah, to launch drone strikes gives it a measure of plausible deniability. To date it has not faced any major military pushback against its expanding production line. A missile fired by Houthi militants at Saudi Arabia in 2017 had been made in Iran. (AFP/File Photo) This has allowed drone attacks to continue, including the strike this month on King Abdullah Airport in the southern Saudi city of Jazan that injured at least 10 civilians. Analysts have also highlighted the ability of Iran to circumvent global sanctions to acquire the necessary components and technology to mass-produce explosives-laden UAVs. This has allowed designated terrorist groups, trained and equipped by the IRGC’s extraterritorial Quds Force, to use increasingly sophisticated drones in locations ranging from the Golan Heights to the Strait of Hormuz. Without a comprehensive regional strategy that employs a more active posture to deter and weaken Iran’s combat-drone capabilities, Tehran and its transnational network of militant groups is likely to conclude that the benefits outweigh the cost of escalating attacks. “I believe that the response to Iran’s growing threat should be proactive, collective, and multi-layered,” said Bakir. This handout image provided by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Media on February 10, 2021 reportedly shows a view of the damaged hull of a Flyadeal Airbus A320-214 aircraft on the tarmac at Abha International Airport in Saudi Arabia's southern Asir province. (AFP/Saudi Ministry of Media/File Photo) “In other words, countering Tehran’s drone threat should incorporate intelligence efforts to block foreign components smuggled from Germany, France, the US and other countries into Iran to be used in its drone program. “On a military level, while it is important to develop dynamic, technological and cost-efficient solutions to address this challenge, the response should not rely solely on defensive measures. Acquiring advanced capabilities of the same nature can constitute a credible deterrence and establish a favorable balance of threat. “The problem remains with Iran’s armed militias, which are harder to deter and have mostly little to lose. When it is necessary, drone shipments should be targeted before reaching them. Stealth attacks on Iran’s militias that use these drones should be executed to raise the cost and, whenever necessary, let Iran bear the responsibility.” During a recent conference in Chicago, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, an organization of exiled Iranian opposition figures, attempted to highlight to a broad US audience the imperative of recognizing the growing national security threat posed by Iran’s drone program. Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the NCRI’s Washington office, said the mastermind behind Tehran’s drone program, Brig. Gen. Saeed Aghajani, was personally responsible for orchestrating the 2019 attacks on Saudi oil facilities. “There has to be a comprehensive policy to succeed in containing the Iranian regime’s threat regarding its drones and supporting its proxies,” Jafarzadeh told Arab News. “The central element of the right policy should be accountability. When Tehran wages terrorism and takes people hostage and hires proxies, it uses them as a tool to gain concessions from its counterparts. So far, because of the lack of accountability, regime terrorism has actually been empowered. A handout picture provided by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) on February 27, 2021 shows debris on the roof of a building in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh in the aftermath of a missile attack claimed by Yemen's Houthi militia. (AFP/SPA/File Photo) “Instead, there should be consequences for the regime’s illegal and rogue behavior. When former Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani was eliminated, it made the Iranian public very happy, it created fear among the IRGC and Quds Force commanders, it demoralized its proxies, and it further shrank the influence of the regime in the region. “Tehran threatened to take revenge but that has not come in the past 22 months. Instead, the regime lost several other key persons with no ability to retaliate. This is the best example we have that Tehran is much weaker than it claims.” However, it appears Washington is unlikely to embark on a more proactive policy that would raise the stakes for Iran and its proxies. The Biden administration has already lifted sanctions on a number of figures linked to Iran’s ballistic missiles program, and has signaled it remains keen to restart negotiations on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. These moves suggest there is little appetite in the White House to tackle head-on the low-intensity drone campaign being waged across the Middle East by the IRGC. Those, like Jafarzadeh, who strongly disagree with the US administration’s more conciliatory approach say any revived negotiations should not exclude holding Iran to account for the drone attacks. “Tehran has to pay the price for every terror plot, every missile they fire, every UAV they launch, and every person they kill in the region or in Iran,” Jafarzadeh said. A handout photo made available by the Iranian Army office on January 5, 2021, shows military officials inspecting drones on display prior to a military drone drill at an undisclosed location in central Iran. (AFP/Iranian Army Office/File Photo) “For the Muslim and Arab nations, it is very important to rely on the experience of the past 40 years. The Iranian regime wants to make a show of force to obligate the countries of the region to provide concessions to the Iranian regime, but only decisiveness has worked. “Most importantly, this regime is very weak and vulnerable and its strategic and regional resources are very limited now.” That Tehran feels emboldened enough to launch drone strikes against oil tankers, international airports and other civilian targets, despite an array of sanctions designed to prevent them and their proxies developing such capabilities, shows that this strategy needs a rethink, according to analysts. “We believe that sanctions will not help,” Tal Beeri, head of the research department at the Alma Research and Education Center in Israel, told Arab News. “The Iranians know how to act militarily under sanctions, both in terms of force buildup and in terms of the use of force. The last few years have proven this well.” A handout photo made available by the Iranian Army office on January 5, 2021, shows drones on display prior to a military drone drill at an undisclosed location in central Iran. (AFP/Iranian Army Office/File Photo) If sanctions are proving insufficient, neutralizing the strategic threat posed by the Iranian network of proxy-enabled drone strikes will probably require a measure of cooperation and knowledge-sharing by states in the region that have found themselves in the crosshairs of Iran’s proxy militant groups. Iran is not the only country in the region with a robust drone program. Greater regional cooperation, including better intelligence sharing and the outside acquisition of drone weapon systems, might offer an antidote to Tehran’s ambitions on a wide front. Static air-defense systems can only hold the line up to a point against the increasingly sophisticated drone tactics and technology in the hands of the IRGC’s proxies. “The essence of the threat is the wide deployment and accessibility of the UAVs program,” said Beeri. “The program has become accessible to all of Iran’s proxies in the Middle East. Today all proxies have intelligence-gathering UAVs and attacking UAVs, and they know how to operate them with great professionalism. “The UAVs program is a fact. In our opinion, it cannot be thwarted — but can be disrupted.”

News article:
WASHINGTON, D.C.: In recent months multiple waves of attacks by so-called loitering munitions, a type of unmanned aerial vehicle designed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have been launched against civilian facilities in various parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Iran’s political pawn in Yemen, the Houthis, has been given the know-how and components to use the technology as part of a regional strategy that has led to a spike in drone attacks throughout the Middle East. In one particularly devastating attack, on Sept. 14, 2019, Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq and Khurais oil-processing facilities were badly damaged by a combined missile and drone strike, sending shock waves crashing through the global oil market. The drones are relatively cheap to manufacture and can be difficult to defend against, particularly the loitering “suicide” munitions that have been used with increasing frequency by Iran and its proxies against Arab, American and Israeli interests across the Middle East. The targets include civilian airports, major oil storage sites, commercial shipping, and both military and diplomatic facilities. Defense policy planners and military commanders are hard pressed to come up with a strategy that can effectively counter Iran’s successful harnessing of asymmetric warfare to its domestic drone-production capabilities. Ali Bakir, a research assistant professor at Qatar University’s Ibn Khaldon Center for Humanities and Social Sciences, said Tehran is leveraging drone strikes by its extremist proxies to strengthen its position in the region. A coordinated response by regional allies is needed to prevent further attacks, he added. “Although not of sophisticated nature, Iran’s fleet of drones poses a growing threat to its neighbors and security in the Gulf,” Bakir told Arab News. “This threat stems from the fact that Tehran is using drones with relatively primitive technology as missiles to compensate for the lack of adequate ammunition and advanced targeting systems. Equipping the IRGC’s regional franchise with these drones enables Iran to extend its reach and lethality. “Surprisingly, despite the serious damage caused by the Iranian drones used to attack Saudi Arabia’s strategic oil facilities in 2019, no adequate and strategic response has yet been developed to counter Tehran’s drone threat, either by the Arab states or by the US.” The IRGC’s use of proxies, such as the Houthis and Iraqi Shiite militia groups such as Kataeb Hezbollah, to launch drone strikes gives it a measure of plausible deniability. To date it has not faced any major military pushback against its expanding production line. A missile fired by Houthi militants at Saudi Arabia in 2017 had been made in Iran. (AFP/File Photo) This has allowed drone attacks to continue, including the strike this month on King Abdullah Airport in the southern Saudi city of Jazan that injured at least 10 civilians. Analysts have also highlighted the ability of Iran to circumvent global sanctions to acquire the necessary components and technology to mass-produce explosives-laden UAVs. This has allowed designated terrorist groups, trained and equipped by the IRGC’s extraterritorial Quds Force, to use increasingly sophisticated drones in locations ranging from the Golan Heights to the Strait of Hormuz. Without a comprehensive regional strategy that employs a more active posture to deter and weaken Iran’s combat-drone capabilities, Tehran and its transnational network of militant groups is likely to conclude that the benefits outweigh the cost of escalating attacks. “I believe that the response to Iran’s growing threat should be proactive, collective, and multi-layered,” said Bakir. This handout image provided by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Media on February 10, 2021 reportedly shows a view of the damaged hull of a Flyadeal Airbus A320-214 aircraft on the tarmac at Abha International Airport in Saudi Arabia's southern Asir province. (AFP/Saudi Ministry of Media/File Photo) “In other words, countering Tehran’s drone threat should incorporate intelligence efforts to block foreign components smuggled from Germany, France, the US and other countries into Iran to be used in its drone program. “On a military level, while it is important to develop dynamic, technological and cost-efficient solutions to address this challenge, the response should not rely solely on defensive measures. Acquiring advanced capabilities of the same nature can constitute a credible deterrence and establish a favorable balance of threat. “The problem remains with Iran’s armed militias, which are harder to deter and have mostly little to lose. When it is necessary, drone shipments should be targeted before reaching them. Stealth attacks on Iran’s militias that use these drones should be executed to raise the cost and, whenever necessary, let Iran bear the responsibility.” During a recent conference in Chicago, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, an organization of exiled Iranian opposition figures, attempted to highlight to a broad US audience the imperative of recognizing the growing national security threat posed by Iran’s drone program. Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the NCRI’s Washington office, said the mastermind behind Tehran’s drone program, Brig. Gen. Saeed Aghajani, was personally responsible for orchestrating the 2019 attacks on Saudi oil facilities. “There has to be a comprehensive policy to succeed in containing the Iranian regime’s threat regarding its drones and supporting its proxies,” Jafarzadeh told Arab News. “The central element of the right policy should be accountability. When Tehran wages terrorism and takes people hostage and hires proxies, it uses them as a tool to gain concessions from its counterparts. So far, because of the lack of accountability, regime terrorism has actually been empowered. A handout picture provided by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) on February 27, 2021 shows debris on the roof of a building in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh in the aftermath of a missile attack claimed by Yemen's Houthi militia. (AFP/SPA/File Photo) “Instead, there should be consequences for the regime’s illegal and rogue behavior. When former Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani was eliminated, it made the Iranian public very happy, it created fear among the IRGC and Quds Force commanders, it demoralized its proxies, and it further shrank the influence of the regime in the region. “Tehran threatened to take revenge but that has not come in the past 22 months. Instead, the regime lost several other key persons with no ability to retaliate. This is the best example we have that Tehran is much weaker than it claims.” However, it appears Washington is unlikely to embark on a more proactive policy that would raise the stakes for Iran and its proxies. The Biden administration has already lifted sanctions on a number of figures linked to Iran’s ballistic missiles program, and has signaled it remains keen to restart negotiations on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. These moves suggest there is little appetite in the White House to tackle head-on the low-intensity drone campaign being waged across the Middle East by the IRGC. Those, like Jafarzadeh, who strongly disagree with the US administration’s more conciliatory approach say any revived negotiations should not exclude holding Iran to account for the drone attacks. “Tehran has to pay the price for every terror plot, every missile they fire, every UAV they launch, and every person they kill in the region or in Iran,” Jafarzadeh said. A handout photo made available by the Iranian Army office on January 5, 2021, shows military officials inspecting drones on display prior to a military drone drill at an undisclosed location in central Iran. (AFP/Iranian Army Office/File Photo) “For the Muslim and Arab nations, it is very important to rely on the experience of the past 40 years. The Iranian regime wants to make a show of force to obligate the countries of the region to provide concessions to the Iranian regime, but only decisiveness has worked. “Most importantly, this regime is very weak and vulnerable and its strategic and regional resources are very limited now.” That Tehran feels emboldened enough to launch drone strikes against oil tankers, international airports and other civilian targets, despite an array of sanctions designed to prevent them and their proxies developing such capabilities, shows that this strategy needs a rethink, according to analysts. “We believe that sanctions will not help,” Tal Beeri, head of the research department at the Alma Research and Education Center in Israel, told Arab News. “The Iranians know how to act militarily under sanctions, both in terms of force buildup and in terms of the use of force. The last few years have proven this well.” A handout photo made available by the Iranian Army office on January 5, 2021, shows drones on display prior to a military drone drill at an undisclosed location in central Iran. (AFP/Iranian Army Office/File Photo) If sanctions are proving insufficient, neutralizing the strategic threat posed by the Iranian network of proxy-enabled drone strikes will probably require a measure of cooperation and knowledge-sharing by states in the region that have found themselves in the crosshairs of Iran’s proxy militant groups. Iran is not the only country in the region with a robust drone program. Greater regional cooperation, including better intelligence sharing and the outside acquisition of drone weapon systems, might offer an antidote to Tehran’s ambitions on a wide front. Static air-defense systems can only hold the line up to a point against the increasingly sophisticated drone tactics and technology in the hands of the IRGC’s proxies. “The essence of the threat is the wide deployment and accessibility of the UAVs program,” said Beeri. “The program has become accessible to all of Iran’s proxies in the Middle East. Today all proxies have intelligence-gathering UAVs and attacking UAVs, and they know how to operate them with great professionalism. “The UAVs program is a fact. In our opinion, it cannot be thwarted — but can be disrupted.”

News article:
Here's What You Need to Remember: The narrow Strait of Hormuz is well known as a high-tension flashpoint close to the Iranian border where large portions of the region’s commercial and military shipping traffic travel. The Strait of Hormuz is also known for being an area with a high risk for mines and even some kinds of land-fired ballistic missiles. Swarms of Iranian small boats harassed and tried to intimidate a group of U.S. Navy ships as they transited the Strait of Hormuz on May 10, prompting the U.S. warships to repeatedly fire warning shots in an effort to diffuse the situation. Several U.S. Navy Patrol boats, a Navy guided-missile cruiser and several U.S. Coast Guard ships were escorting a guided missile submarine, the USS Georgia, when they were approached at provocative high-speeds by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy boats with, as a Navy report describes it, “their weapons uncovered and manned.” The Iranian high-speed approaches, which closed within just 150 yards of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Maui traveling at speeds above 30 knots, were conducted by Iranian Fast In-Shore Attack Craft vessels. “After the two IRGCN vessels failed to respond to repeated warnings and closed within 300 yards, Maui exercised lawful de-escalatory measures by firing warning shots. The two IRGCN vessels again failed to respond to warnings and closed to within 150 yards of Maui, at which time Maui fired additional warning shots,” according to the Navy report. While the Navy report referred to the Iranian actions as “unsafe and unprofessional,” reactions among service and Pentagon leaders may have been even more pronounced. Certainly, the kind of event is by no means new or unprecedented, as Iran has long been known to operate in this fashion, regularly stopping short of actually starting a lethal weapons engagement. The narrow Strait of Hormuz is also well known as a high-tension flashpoint close to the Iranian border where large portions of the region’s commercial and military shipping traffic travel. The Strait of Hormuz is also known for being an area with a high risk for mines and even some kinds of land-fired ballistic missiles. Apart from simply engaging in harassing or provocative behavior, there does not appear to be a sensible explanation for the Iranian small boat actions, unless, of course, the small boat swarming included some kind of serious attack contingency. The strategic aim of a small boat attack would of course be to simply overwhelm ship defenses and deck-mounted guns by approaching in close proximity in a dispersed fashion to “flood the zone” so to speak, and breach the protective perimeter or envelope surrounding a surface ship and it’s close-in weapons ranges with speed and volume. Although unlikely to cause catastrophic structural damage to larger U.S. Navy ship with small arms fire or missiles, Iranian small boats packed with explosives for suicide bombing missions could present a very serious threat to a large surface ship, depending upon the size and scope of a blast radius. Destroying numerous small boats approaching simultaneously would, it seems, present a kind of ship defense predicament for certain ships such as Navy Cruisers or U.S. Coast Guard ships armed with medium-caliber deck-mounted guns. However, alongside deck-mounted guns or other weapons, U.S. Navy warships could be armed with Close-in-Weapons-Systems (CIWS) phalanx guns able to fire hundreds of projectiles per minute to blanket areas with defensive fire. A deck-mounted Phalanx, such as the Navy’s current CIWS weapon, would fire hundreds of small steel penetrating projectile rods at approaching small boats, potentially disabling or even destroying them as they seek to approach. CIWS can also blanket a large area and, interestingly, the Navy began a massive fleet-wide upgrade of its CIWS weapons system years ago for the specific purpose of destroying small boat attacks. As far back as 2014, the U.S. Navy began implementing a CIWS 1B variant upgrade which greatly expanded the protective aperture beyond air defense to incorporate surface defenses as well, in part to specifically counter the kinds of small boat threats regularly presented by Iran. Therefore, upgraded CIWS weapons can now destroy close-in threats that are on the surface and not just coming from the air, a protective technology of great relevance to these kinds of provocation. Should the small boats simply be too fast and too numerous for deck mounted guns or larger munitions to intercept, then a surface-firing CIWS weapon could prevent an attacking small boat from being able to closely approach or penetrate the ship’s hull. However, the group of Navy ships only included one navy cruiser along with several U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Boats, according to the Navy report. While some Coast Guard Cutters do have CIWS, most of the smaller Navy and Coast Guard patrol ships do not. Therefore, perhaps the Iranian small boats were extra provocative, at least in part, because they knew they might not have to face CIWS should they approach closer in. Regardless, for a host of obvious reasons, there is little rationale or basis upon which it might appear to make any sense for the Iranian fast-attack craft to engage U.S. Navy warships in any kind of serious exchange of fire.

Thirteen feet long and weighing 1,000 pounds, the rocket-propelled, radar-guided AIM-54 flew at Mach five as high as 80,000 feet while carrying a devastating, 135-pound warhead over a range of more than 100 miles. Former Navy F-14 pilot Francesco Chierici called the Phoenix “a lethal sledgehammer of a missile.” But in more than 30 years of U.S. service ending with the type’s retirement from Navy service in the mid-2000s, American Tomcats fired just three AIM-54s in anger. All in 1999 while targeting Iraqi aircraft violating a U.N. no-fly zone. None of those Phoenixes struck their targets. The only country successfully to wield the AIM-54 in combat has been Iran, which in the early 1970s acquired 79 F-14s and hundreds of Phoenixes from the United States. Iranian Tomcats fired many AIM-54s at Iraqi planes during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war that began on Sept. 22, 1980. But it’s possible the first Iranian Phoenix kill actually took place before full-scale fighting broke out. In the fall of 1980, as tensions escalated, Iranian jets flew limited strikes on Iraqi forces just across the border opposite Iran. F-14s flew top cover. According to aviation historian Tom Cooper, on Sept. 9, 1980, Iranian Tomcat pilot Mohammed-Reza Ataayee and a wingman were protecting a formation of F-4Es bombing Iraqi positions near the border. “My back-seater was 1st Lt. Sultan Pasha-Pour,” Ataayee told Cooper. Back then, I was a major and the second Tomcat was piloted by Maj. Shahram Rostami … The ground radar announced to us one target that was approaching the border and closing fast, and asked us if it is possible for us to engage it. At the time the government had given us strict orders to never stray over the border or engage in cross-border combats, in order to give Saddam Hussein no excuse for an invasion. We were to engage only if they violated our airspace. Then we had the right to engage and destroy them. I told the radar I will head toward TFB.4 [Tactical Fighter Base 4, near Dezful] to land and refuel. After refueling, we took off from Dezful and I was immediately alerted that there was an aircraft roughly 50 or so miles away, in a northern direction. I saw that this target was coming from direction of Hamedan, meaning from north to south. I asked the radar are you sure it is a foe and not a friend. They said stand by so they could check the status of the target, but after a short delay the radar said, ‘No, this is definitely an enemy.’ For us it was hard to imagine an Iraqi pilot would be as brazen as to enter our airspace. Until then, the Iraqis never had the guts to do so. I told my [back-seat radar-intercept officer] Pasha-Pour to launch a missile at this target. After a quick pause I repeated my order. He told me to do it. I told him to do it. Finally, he pushed the button. Because I flew F-5s earlier, I was used to seeing the missile going off the wingtip rails and accelerate really fast. I never fired an AIM-54 before and did not know what a Phoenix launch actually felt like. Once Pasha-Pour pushed the button, I could see nothing. I only heard the sound of something detaching from the belly of my aircraft. I told Pasha-Pour that I think that, unfortunately, the missile malfunctioned and fell to the earth. Thus I inverted my aircraft to see what was going on below and saw the missile falling away. But then I saw it releasing a smoke trail … only then did I recall that the launch sequence took several seconds. I rolled out and got back to checking the radar, and saw the countdown until the missile would hit. This was counting down — five, four, three, two, one then zero. And then I saw the target disappear from my radar. The ground radar called to congratulate — that poor guy nearly fainted in excitement!’ The Iranian air force officially credited Ataayee with a kill of an Iraqi Sukhoi Su-20M flown by pilot named Faysal Abdul-Fattah Abdul Rahman, Cooper explained. But Iraq never actually operated any Su-20Ms. In 1980 it did however operate Su-20s -- not M-models -- that Iraq bought from the Soviet Union in 1973. According to one Iraqi government study that Cooper cited, the first Iraqi loss in the conflict with Iran was an Su-22 flown by No. 44 squadron commander Maj. Noubar Abdel-Hamid Al Hamadani, shot down on Sept. 14, 1980. “While the [Iranian] F-14 crew certainly had good reason to claim its first kill on Sept. 9, 1980, currently it remains unknown if Ataayee and Pasha-Pour really scored the first-ever kill by an AIM-54,” Cooper wrote. “It’s possible that this honor belongs to 1st Lt. Fereydoon-Ali Mazandarani and 1st Lt. Qassem Soltani, who claimed to have shot down a MiG-23 with an AIM-54 on Sept. 17, 1980.” David Axe served as Defense Editor of the National Interest.

Israeli F-15 fighter jets escorted an American heavy bomber through the region as it made its way to the Persian Gulf on Saturday, in an apparent threat to Iran. “The flight represents the continued operational cooperation with American forces in the region,” the Israel Defense Forces said. The escort mission came as Israeli and American officials have increasingly threatened to act against Tehran’s nuclear program, as Iran has stalled indirect negotiations with the United States in Vienna regarding a mutual return to the 2015 nuclear deal. The Israeli military shared photographs and video footage of the flight, showing the American B-1b bomber, which is capable of carrying heavy bunker-buster bombs that would be needed for a strike on Iran’s largely underground nuclear facilities, alongside the Israeli F-15 jets. Israeli officials have explicitly threatened a military strike on Iran’s nuclear program, while Americans have discussed the matter more circumspectly, referring to “other options” beyond diplomatic negotiations in order to halt Tehran’s atomic aspirations.

Israel has twice conducted airstrikes on enemy nations’ nuclear programs, bombing Iraq’s nuclear reactor in 1981 and Syria’s in 2007. However, an attack on Iran’s nuclear program is widely expected to be far, far more complicated as Tehran has spread out its facilities throughout the country, buried them deep underground, and funded a number of powerful proxies throughout the region who would likely retaliate against Israel if such a strike should be carried out.

News article:
Washington: A US Air Force bomber escorted by fighter jets from allies including Israel has flown over key waterways in the Middle East where American and Iranian naval vessels have faced off. The B-1B Lancer passed over the Gulf, Bab al-Mandeb Strait, Suez Canal and Gulf of Oman, the US Central Command, or Centcom, said in a statement on Sunday. It also flew over the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint for a fifth of world oil output at the head of the Gulf that Iran considers a strategic area of influence. "The bomber task force mission... was intended to deliver a clear message of reassurance," Centcom said. Fighter jets from Israel, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, all US allies opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran, escorted the US bomber over their respective airspaces. "Military readiness for any contingency or mission -- from crisis response to multilateral exercises to one-day presence patrols like this -- depend on reliable partnerships," said Centcom commander General Frank McKenzie, the head of US forces in the Middle East. Egyptian fighter jets also accompanied the B-1B, a supersonic bomber that can carry the heaviest conventional payload of all the US military’s planes. In January, a US B-52 bomber, also capable of carrying nuclear weapons, flew over the Middle East. Since February, Iran and Israel have been accused of engaging in what analysts have called a "shadow war", in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges. The regional patrol, Centcom’s fifth such operation this year, comes as talks aimed at reviving the 2015 deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program have stalled. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly offered to return to the nuclear accord, but his administration has voiced growing frustration over delays after a hardline government took office in Iran. Then-president Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018 and imposed sweeping sanctions, leading Iran to step up contested nuclear work in retaliation. Meanwhile, an Iranian general has said Israel and the United States were likely to have been behind a cyber attack that interrupted the distribution of fuel at service stations. Tuesday’s attack "technically" resembles two previous incidents whose perpetrators "were unquestionably our enemies, namely the United States and the Zionist regime", the Revolutionary Guards’ Gholamreza Jalali said. "We have analysed two incidents, the railway accident and the Shahid Rajaei port accident, and we found that they were similar," Jalali, who heads a civil defence unit responsible for cyber activity, told state television late Saturday. In July, Iran’s transportation ministry said a "cyber disruption" had affected its computer systems and website, according to Fars news agency. And in May last year, the Washington Post reported that Israel carried out a cyber attack on the Iranian port of Shahid Rajaei in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic route for global oil shipments. Tuesday’s cyber attack caused traffic jams on major arteries in Tehran, where long queues at petrol stations disrupted the flow of traffic. The oil ministry later took service stations offline so that petrol could be distributed manually, according to the authorities.

It also flew over the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint for a fifth of world oil output at the head of the Gulf that Iran considers a strategic area of influence. "The bomber task force mission... was intended to deliver a clear message of reassurance," Centcom said. Fighter jets from Israel, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, all US allies opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran, escorted the US bomber over their respective airspaces. "Military readiness for any contingency or mission -- from crisis response to multilateral exercises to one-day presence patrols like this -- depend on reliable partnerships," said Centcom commander General Frank McKenzie, the head of US forces in the Middle East. Egyptian fighter jets also accompanied the B-1B, a supersonic bomber that can carry the heaviest conventional payload of all the US military’s planes. In January, a US B-52 bomber, also capable of carrying nuclear weapons, flew over the Middle East. Since February, Iran and Israel have been accused of engaging in what analysts have called a "shadow war", in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges. The regional patrol, Centcom’s fifth such operation this year, comes as talks aimed at reviving the 2015 deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program have stalled. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly offered to return to the nuclear accord, but his administration has voiced growing frustration over delays after a hardline government took office in Iran. Then-president Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018 and imposed sweeping sanctions, leading Iran to step up contested nuclear work in retaliation. Meanwhile, an Iranian general has said Israel and the United States were likely to have been behind a cyber attack that interrupted the distribution of fuel at service stations. Tuesday’s attack "technically" resembles two previous incidents whose perpetrators "were unquestionably our enemies, namely the United States and the Zionist regime", the Revolutionary Guards’ Gholamreza Jalali said. "We have analysed two incidents, the railway accident and the Shahid Rajaei port accident, and we found that they were similar," Jalali, who heads a civil defence unit responsible for cyber activity, told state television late Saturday. In July, Iran’s transportation ministry said a "cyber disruption" had affected its computer systems and website, according to Fars news agency. And in May last year, the Washington Post reported that Israel carried out a cyber attack on the Iranian port of Shahid Rajaei in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic route for global oil shipments. Tuesday’s cyber attack caused traffic jams on major arteries in Tehran, where long queues at petrol stations disrupted the flow of traffic. The oil ministry later took service stations offline so that petrol could be distributed manually, according to the authorities.

Topic: Great Power Competition Region: World Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: U.S. Air ForceB-1B-1 BomberChinaRussia Strategic bombers send a message to friend and foe alike. Here's What You Need to Know: Strategic bombers can assure allies and partners while deterring near-peer competitors. Air Force B-1 bombers have gone to India and Norway as part of the service’s massively stepped-up Bomber Task Force (BTF) global operations, intended to further solidify international partnerships, interoperability and conduct high-impact deterrence missions intended to reassure U.S. allies amid ongoing threats posed by Russia and China. Bomber Task Forces, a longstanding U.S. Air Force practice, are expanding in size, scope and frequency, often extending to less visited parts of the globe such as the Arctic and parts of Western Asia. These Task Forces often include B-1s, B-52 and B-2 to demonstrate force and resolve, particularly in high-threat contested areas such as the South China Sea area parts of Eastern Europe. “I’m pleased with the way we have approached it to get to places around the globe and show presence for partners and allies. We have implemented leaner logistics and faster turn times and done some good experiments. We are working with our partners and allies and putting a lot of focus on the Pacific and Europe to give us more reach. We have the highest bomber aircrew readiness in the history of the command,” said General Timothy Ray, Air Force Global Strike Command Commander. B-1 bombers in Norway introduce new patrol opportunities to show force and presence in the Arctic region which is increasingly contested by major power rivals. Competitors such as Russia and China are looking to expand influence, gather or harvest natural resources and, perhaps most of all, gain unparalleled strategic advantage by establishing a tactical footprint with quick access to virtually all parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Also, places like the South China Sea in the Pacific may present new opportunities for smaller, shorter, more targeted and tactically relevant BTFs, particularly in and around island areas where China continues to increase operation. “We are looking more aggressively beyond the current list of locations. Small scale short deployments give us different options,” Ray said. Interestingly, Ray’s strategic emphasis is already taking to the sky, as the U.S. Central Command just sent two B-52H Stratofortress bombers flying through vital parts of the Middle East in what is seen as a warning message to Iran. It was the fourth bomber deployment into the Middle East already just this year. “Multiple partner nations and U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft accompanied the U.S. bombers at different points during the flight, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and Qatar,” a statement from U.S. Central Command said. As part of his discussion about Bomber Task Forces, Ray referred to the re-engineering of the B-52 as well as the addition of new radar and cruise missiles to the platform such as the emerging Air Launched Rapid Response (ARRW) hypersonic weapon. “We have done some flight tests on ARRW and plan to do more tests later this year,” Ray added. Precision targeting, a new generation of networking technologies and upgraded weapons systems also bring new opportunities for deterrence. For instance, bombers can now much more quickly and efficiently receive and integrate new threat data or intelligence information while in route. Point to point communications between ground command and control centers, ships, air assets and even nearby drones can operate in a dispersed, widely disaggregated way, yet still sustain high levels of secure connectivity. B-52 mission pilots, for example, don’t have to merely load target coordinates up into a database prior to flight but can also receive new ones in near real-time should intelligence change on the ground. Therefore, not only do potential adversaries know the precision-target devastation bombers could inflict in the event of war, but they are also increasingly aware that modern bombers can hold much larger areas at risk and overcome many standard enemy countermeasures.

Topic: Aircraft Carriers Region: World Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: US NavyHistoryNavyCarrier Strike GroupAnti-ship MissilesChina Sinking a carrier is easier said than done. Here's What You Need to Remember: To even try to sink an American flattop, you first must hit it. That's not easy, either. No carrier sails without an air wing with as many as 50 fighter aircraft plus several escorting destroyers, cruisers and submarines. A Chinese admiral and pundit once told a trade-show audience that Beijing could resolve China's territorial disputes by sinking two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and killing thousands of American sailors. Rear Adm. Lou Yuan's threat isn't an empty one. The Chinese military has deployed an array of weaponry that it acquired specifically to target American flattops. But a U.S. Navy test in 2005 proved that even if you hit them, carriers are really hard to sink. Lou made his provocative comment on Dec. 20, 2018 at the Military Industry List summit, according to media reports. “What the United States fears the most is taking casualties,” declared Lou, an anti-American author, social commentator and military theorist at the PLA Academy of Military Science. Sinking just one carrier could kill 5,000 Americans, Lou pointed out. Sink two, and you double the toll. "We’ll see how frightened America is" after losing 10,000 sailors, Lou crowed. Leaving aside the likelihood of a full-scale war breaking out between the world's two leading military powers and economies, sinking a carrier is easier said than done. History underscores the difficulty of the undertaking. In 1964 Viet Cong saboteurs managed to damage and briefly sink the former U.S. Navy escort carrier Card while the vessel, then operating as an aircraft ferry for U.S. Military Sealift Command, moored in Saigon. But the last time anyone permanently sank a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in combat was during World War II. Twelve American carriers sank during the war, usually following intensive air attacks. The last to sink, USS Bismarck Sea, fell victim to Japanese kamikazes in February 1945. In subsequent decades, American flattops suffered serious accidents including collisions and fires, but none sank. It's very difficult to sink a buoyant, thousand-feet-long ship that's mostly made of steel. The U.S. Navy knows this from experience. In 2005, the Navy itself targeted the decommissioned carrier America in order to determine just how much punishment the vessel could withstand before slipping beneath the waves. "The ship was pummeled by explosions both above and below the waterline," The War Zone reporter Tyler Rogoway explained in 2018. "After nearly four weeks of these activities, the carrier was scuttled. On May 14, 2005, the vessel's stern disappeared below the waterline and the ship began its voyage to the seafloor." "America stood up to four weeks of abuse and only succumbed to the sea after demolition teams scuttled the ship on purpose once and for all, it's clear that America was built to sustain heavy damage in combat and still stay afloat." Consider also the carrier-shaped pontoon ship that Iran built as a scale target for a 2015 war game. While small and flimsy compared to a real flattop, the pontoon vessel itself endured an intensive assault. "Iran struck the faux carrier with a barrage of anti-ship missiles, then swarmed it with small boats and then landed commandos on it," Rogoway reported. Still, the fake flattop apparently remained afloat. To even try to sink an American flattop, you first must hit it. That's not easy, either. No carrier sails without an air wing with as many as 50 fighter aircraft plus several escorting destroyers, cruisers and submarines. A virtual wall of defensive weaponry surrounds the flattop out to a distance of several hundred miles. Still, China or another country could attempt to target the carriers with submarines, cruise missiles and ballistic rockets. "They will employ multiple systems in order to confuse and overwhelm U.S. defenses," naval historian Robert Farley wrote in 2017. "They will rely on the threat of attack to keep U.S. carrier battle groups as far as possible from the main theaters of operation." "But the observation that the enemy has a missile or torpedo that can kill a carrier only begins a conversation about carrier vulnerability," Farley continued. "Shooting anything at an aircraft carrier is a costly, difficult operation." The carrier's attackers could face withering counterfire from the vessel's defenders. "Beyond the monetary cost, launching an open attack against an American carrier strike group, with its own cruisers, destroyers and submarines, is almost certainly a suicide mission." And if the United States' reaction to the 9/11 terror attacks is any indication, Washington surely would deploy all its remaining military might, including its surviving eight or nine carriers, against country behind the sinking. "So there are two questions that remain for anyone who thinks they even have a shot at taking down one of these enormous steel behemoths," Farley explained. "Can you do it? And even if you can, is it worth it?" David Axe served as Defense Editor of the National Interest. He is the author of the graphic novels War Fix, War Is Boring and Machete Squad.

News article:
The Iranian military announced it would begin Sunday a large-scale exercise in the Gulf of Oman, the northern part of the Indian Ocean, and in sections of the Red Sea, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The news agency quoted Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, Iran’s deputy army chief, as saying the drill will be a demonstration of Iran’s power at sea, “warning the enemies that any act of aggression against Iran will draw a crushing response from the army.” The drill, dubbed “Zolfaqar-1400,” will involve forces from the Iranian Army Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force, and Air Defense units, Sayyari said in a press conference Saturday, according to Tasnim. It is expected to cover an area of over one million square kilometers (386,102 square miles) southeast of Iran, stretching from the eastern side of the Strait of Hormuz to the northern part of the Indian Ocean, as well as part of the Red Sea, the army general said.

In 2018, then-United States president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, raising tensions across the wider Middle East. Sunday’s drill comes as nuclear negotiations between Iran and world powers are to resume on November 29. Iran has breached limits set by the nuclear deal and is enriching small amounts of uranium to its closest-ever levels to weapons-grade purity as its stockpile continues to grow. Iran claims its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. Talks began in April in Vienna between Tehran and the remaining five parties to the 2015 deal, aimed at bringing Washington back into the agreement. But that dialogue has been stalled since the sixth round of talks in June, when ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi won Iran’s presidential election.

Topic: Iran Air Force Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: IranSaeqehF-14F-5MilitaryF-4 Phantom Iran's new "state of the art" fighter yet appears identical to an F-5F Tiger II two-seater jet. Here's What You Need To Remember: The irony is that Tehran doesn’t need to be ashamed of its resourceful use of old jet fighters. In the nine-year-long Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s, Iranian fighter pilots fought one of the most intense air wars in recent history defending their home soil. Though higher-performance F-4 Phantoms and F-14 Tomcats shot down dozens of Iraqi fighters (and suffered losses in return), even the F-5s chalked up a number of kills against MiG-21 fighters and Su-20 attack jets. In February 2017 I published an article on the Iranian Saeqeh (“Thunderbolt”) fighter. Billed as Iran’s first domestically-built jet fighter to enter operational service, the Saeqeh. Fast forward and we are again greeted with headlines for yet another “100% indigenously made” fighter jet, this time a “state of the art” two-seater called the Kowsar. And yet it appears identical to an F-5F Tiger II two-seater jet. If anything, it is far less original than the Saeqeh, which has airframe modifications including enlarged strakes and twin vertical tail stabilizers. The Kowsar doesn’t appear to have any external changes from the F-5F. How was this jet even worthy of the photo-op with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in the instructor’s seat for Iranian Defense Industry Day? It happens there really is a program to build a combat-capable Kowsar advanced jet trainer. It simply wasn’t the aircraft on display this summer. According to Iranian aviation expert Babak Taghvaee, the Kowsar may merely be an avionics testbed—a regular F-5F fitted with new avionics (rumored to be of Chinese origin) eventually intended for use in the Saeqeh fighter, spruced up with a fresh coat of gleaming paint for the photo-op. The test-bed used may date all the way back to Iran's first attempt to reverse-engineer the F-5 in the 1990s, the Azaraksh. This was because the real Kowsar-88 wasn't ready yet. Iran had announced back in 2013 it was developing a Kowsar-88 trainer which could also serve in the light attack role. In 2017, footage of a prototype undergoing taxi trials was unveiled which you can see here. Though influenced by the F-5, the prototype is a different airplane and is much shorter. Interestingly, it bears a striking resemblance to the Taiwanese AIDC AT-3 jet trainer. Details are scarce, but the actual Kowsar-88 apparently would have a digital glass cockpit using three multi-function displays and uses two J85-13 turbojet engines reverse-engineered from the F-5. The public has had short memories as President Rouhani also attended a ceremony showing off the Kowsar-88’s in July 2017. Even the most uninformed observer can compare this Kowsar to the one displayed August 2018 and see they are not the same airplanes. According to the European Defense Review, sixteen domestically-built Kowsar-88s are planned to take over training duties currently undertaken by the more capable Saeqeh jets in the next decade. Iran will attempt to acquire additional J85 engines on the black market, but if that fails, will cannibalize the parts from twelve older F-5A and B model aircraft. Meanwhile, Tehran reportedly plans to deploy fifty single-seat Saeqeh-1 fighters and fourteen two-seat Saeqeh-2 fighters by rebuilding additional rusty old F-5E and F-5F airframes. Depending on the status of international sanctions, Iran may also seek to procure Russian Yak-130 or Chinese JL-10 (aka L-15 Falcon) supersonic trainers. Versatile trainer/light attack jets continue to be popular with militaries across the globe from China’s L-15, to the Nigerian Alpha Jets fighting Boko Haram, to South Korea’s FA-50 Golden Eagle, which has seen a lot of combat in The Philippines. In addition to being forgiving stepping stones for training fighter pilots to fly more demanding aircraft, advanced jet trainers can perform counter-insurgency and strike missions far more cost-efficiently than a high-performance jet fighter. Supersonic trainers with radar can also perform light air defense duties. Of course, these are not the sort of aircraft one uses to fight off F-15 Eagles or F-22 stealth fighters, which is precisely the major threat Iranian defense have to worry about coming from the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Instead, programs like the Kowsar reflect Tehran’s plans to shore up fighter pilot training and sustain the number of operational airframes capitalizing on the raw material furnished by America prior to the Iranian Revolution if international sanctions curtail foreign procurement—as seems more likely since U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal. The latest episode with the not-Kowsar fighter illustrates yet again the casual dishonesty of Tehran’s propagandists. Iranian industry wanted to display the Kowsar-88 for an expo—which does appear to be a real airplane! However, the actual Kowsar-88 wasn’t ready for display this August, so Tehran simply took an old, very well-known jet fighter and claimed it was a new one, in full view of domestic and international audiences that would know better. The irony is that Tehran doesn’t need to be ashamed of its resourceful use of old jet fighters.

Iran on Tuesday said its military warned off U.S. drones it says approached during the country’s annual war games exercises. “These aircraft [RQ-4 and MQ-9 U.S. drones] changed their route after approaching the borders of the Islamic Republic of Iran following the air defence’s interception and decisive warning,” state media IRIB reported, according to Reuters. The incident came as Iran was conducting its annual war games that in parts of the Red Sea, north of the Indian Ocean and east of the Strait of Hormuz. “We are familiar with false reports emanating from Iranian state media as of late. Again, we are not seeing operation reports that suggest the Iranian military has prevented U.S. forces from fulfilling its objectives in the region,” U.S. Army Maj. John Rigsbee, a spokesperson for Centcom, said in a statement to The Hill. The reports from Iran come weeks before Iran and the U.S. are set to resume talks to reenter the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal. These will be the first talks regarding reentering the nuclear deal that former President Trump exited from in 2018 that the U.S. will directly participate in as previous communications in the spring were indirect. The six rounds of indirect negotiations that occurred earlier this year ended in June when Iran elected a new president, but State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the U.S.’s strategy in the talks will not change. ​​”We have been unambiguous when it comes to our position that there was tremendous progress in rounds one through six in these talks in Vienna. It would be neither productive nor wise to take up from any other position from where we left off in June, from the conclusion in the sixth round,” Price said. — Updated at 2:32 p.m.

It would be neither productive nor wise to take up from any other position from where we left off in June, from the conclusion in the sixth round,” Price said. — Updated at 2:32 p.m.

News article:
The Iranian Army has intercepted two US unmanned aerial vehicles that had penetrated into the country’s airspace, giving them stern warnings to stay away from the zone where it was holding massive drills. The media bureau of the drills, codenamed Zolfaqar-1400, said in a statement on Tuesday that the American aircraft, including General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper and Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, intruded into the country’s Flight Information Region (FIR) and Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). It explained that the American drones had already been monitored by the Iranian integrated air defense network from kilometers away, and were eventually warned off by the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force as they were trying to approach the war game area. The statement said the aircraft veered away and left the region shortly afterward. Forces from the Army Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, and Air Defense have taken part in Zolfaqar-1400 war game that covers an area stretching from the eastern sector of the strategic Strait of Hormuz to the northern tip of the Indian Ocean. The joint military drills kicked off on Sunday. On the second day of the exercises, the Iranian Navy’s offshore units flew the homegrown and radar-evading Omid drone to jam the radars of the mock enemy stationed on the coast. The unmanned aerial vehicle is said to be fairly effective in electronic warfare. Iranian military experts and technicians have in recent years made great progress in developing and manufacturing a broad range of military equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient in this regard. Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the Islamic Republic will not hesitate to build up its defense capabilities, emphasizing such abilities are entirely meant for the purpose of defense and will be never subject to negotiations.

News article:
Topic: China Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: ChinaASBMCarrier Killer MissilesArleigh Burke-classFord-ClassAircraft Carrier China is all set up to do target practice in the desert—on replicas of American vessels like aircraft carriers. Why? Photos taken by satellite imagery company Maxar on November 7, 2021, on behalf of the U.S. Naval Institute reveal that China has built an accurate mock-up of the deck (but not the island superstructure and other equipment) of a Ford-class aircraft carrier at a missile test range in the Taklamakan desert in western Xinjiang Province. Also spotted were highly detailed replicas of two U.S. Arleigh-Burke-class guided-missile destroyers and at least two more carrier-shaped targets, as well as a seventy-five-meter-long ship-like target mounted on six-meter wide rails. You can see the satellite imagery combined in this graphic published by Reuters. These efforts are almost certainly so the test range can offer more realistic practice targets for China’s growing arsenal of anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs). These weapons, which unlike the more widely used naval cruise loft high into space before plunging down at incredible speeds, have cast a long shadow in military competition between the U.S. and China since Beijing first unveiled its DF-21D “carrier killer” missile in 2009. The DF-21D, which itself is mounted on a mobile truck launcher making it harder to kill preemptively, has a maximum range exceeding nine hundred miles. That means it could threaten to heavily damage or destroy powerful U.S. Navy supercarriers from well beyond the attack range of its onboard warplanes. Since then, China has unveiled several more ASBM-type missiles: the DF-26B which may have a range of up to 2,500 miles—meaning it could sink ships at the U.S. naval base in Guam—and several shorter-range ASBM missiles seemingly intended for export (M20B, CM-401, BP-12B). China is reportedly planning to deploy ASBMs on its H-6 strategic bombers and Type 055 missile cruisers. The mockups at the Taklamakan site are not China’s first carrier-like practice targets—a crude concrete pad had been used as a practice target at Shuangchengzi since 2003 and a mockup near the current site was targeted in missile tests in 2013. However, the new mockups are much more detailed representations of U.S. Navy vessels. According to USNI, the current equipment was first erected and then dismantled in 2019—only to be reassembled in September 2021 per historical satellite imagery. Extensive instrumentation is visible at the new site to collect data on missile strikes, but no impact craters are visible, suggesting the site hasn’t been put to use yet for missile tests. Why China Is Testing Anti-Ship Missiles in a Desert Despite their formidable speed and reach, ASBMs have never been used in combat before, and there’s debate over just how reliable they would prove at hitting moving targets using their terminal infrared- or radar-guidance seekers. U.S. carriers and destroyers typically maintain high speeds of thirty knots, and once alerted to a missile launch (the launch flash can likely be detected from space) would seek to change course and exit the kill box the missile’s seeker can scan. Thus, to be effective the seeker must either scan a broad enough area and be able to discriminate between desirable and undesirable targets, and/or it should receive midcourse targeting adjustments from friendly surveillance assets tracking the target vessel—say, a submarine, drone, or maritime patrol plane. The first reports of Chinese tests against a carrier-like target were reported in January 2013 by Want China Times. These were supported by satellite photos showing two craters blasted into a carrier-like structure measuring 200 meters in length. It wasn’t until six years later, China finally had DF-21D and DF-26B test-fired successfully at moving maritime targets near the Paracel Islands. China’s apparent return to land-based ASBM target tests is likely intended to limit the controversy and observability of tests in the open commons of the Pacific Ocean. In other words, the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force didn’t want the U.S. military collecting nearly as much data from its missile tests as China did. The land-based tests may also prove less expensive or logistically complicated to orchestrate, and the smaller rail-based target may allow missile units to repeatedly practice striking a moving target. Meanwhile, a more detailed rendering of the Ford-class’s deck shape and the superstructure on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer may also test the seeker’s ability to acquire and identify those target profiles. On the downside, the surrounding desert environment will create different discrimination challenges for both radar and infrared seekers than a vessel would at sea, so it’s not a completely satisfactory substitute. Furthermore, while accuracy against moving targets may be a necessity for Chinese ASBMs to be effective, is not by itself sufficient. That’s because ASBMs are highly visible both to radar and infrared sensors, and the U.S. Navy has been introducing countermeasures against the threat for over a decade, notably including SM-3 anti-ballistic missile interceptors, as well as electronic warfare and other countermeasures to disrupt missile guidance. Skeptics of Chinese ASBMs also argue that China lacks robust enough maritime surveillance capabilities to reliably detect and track ships at sea necessary to cue missile attacks. Remember, the missile units require communication with naval, aerial, and space-based surveillance platforms to know when and where to lob their missiles. In a conflict, the U.S. forces would certainly do their utmost to disrupt or destroy the spotters and their communication links with both electronic warfare and kinetic attacks. However, this argument is growing less convincing as China has methodically expanded and enhanced its maritime surveillance capabilities with radars deployed on a network of artificial islands, additional satellites launched into space, and new types of robotic spy submarines, surveillance drones, and maritime patrol aircraft. This map, for example, illustrates the many overlapping sensors China can deploy to track ships entering the waters between The Philippines and Vietnam. Regardless, practice against realistic and moving target tests, and forming spotter-shooter kill chains seem like necessary prerequisites before simulating more complex tactics used in combat scenarios against a reactive enemy with air defenses, such as salvo-firing missiles to overwhelm a carrier task force’s air defense capacity. It’s worth noting that—as far we know—China hasn’t yet gone as far as Iran in creating a floating mockup of a U.S. aircraft carrier for target practice. After taking its prescribed pounding in its second outing in July 2020, Iran’s mockup carrier capsized while returning to port. That at least won’t be a problem with China’s desert-based practice targets.

The drills involved units from the army, Navy, Air Force, and Air Defence troops, and were designed to improve the country’s combat and defence capability, strengthen coordination between various branches of the armed services, and reinforce Iran’s capability to operate in remote international waters.The US military has not commented on the alleged incident.Humbling a SuperpowerThe MQ-9 Reaper drone is the US Air Force’s weapon of choice for Washington’s controversial drone strike programme, with the drones used extensively to target mostly poor countries with limited or non-existent air defences in places like Afghanistan, Africa, and Yemen. Although they typically carry weapons, the drones can be configured for reconnaissance operations, and in addition to the military, are used by US Customs and Border Protection on the border with Mexico.The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a whale-headed UAV designed specifically for intelligence gathering operations. Iran knocked one of these large $220 million stealthy drones out of the sky over the Strait of Hormuz in June 2019 after it entered Iranian airspace and refused to heed warnings to leave. A domestically-developed Khordad 3 air defence system was used to shoot the drone down. Iran collected the UAV’s wreckage, meticulously put it back together and proudly put it on permanent display at its National Aerospace Park in Tehran last year.The ill-fated Global Hawk is one of two intruding US drones that Iran has managed to take down over the years. In late 2011, a US RQ-170 flying wing-shaped reconnaissance drone was safely brought down in northeastern Iran. The United States initially claimed that the drone had malfunctioned and crashed. However, Iran said that its cyber warfare forces managed to hack into and commandeer the UAV mid-flight, landing it safely. Later, US media reported that the drone may indeed have been captured by jamming its satellite and ground control signals, following a GPS spoofing attack using a Russian-made jamming system. The US later asked Iran to return the drone, with an Iranian company responding by promising to send miniature pink toy versions of the UAV to then-president Barack Obama.Iran later reportedly worked to reverse engineer the UAV into at least two drone designs – the Shahed 171 Simorgh and the Saegheh.Iran isn’t the only nation to have shot down US drones. In 2019, Yemen’s Houthi militia, who have been battling a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, also managed the feat, reportedly dropping two Reaper drones flying over Yemeni airspace in June and August of that year. US Central Command confirmed the first incident and claimed that Iran shot the aircraft down or “enabled” the Houthis to do so. The Houthis reportedly used a 2K12 Kub, NATO designation SA-6 – an ancient Soviet-era surface-to-air missile system hailing from the 1960s, in the June 2019 incident. The USSR provided the former nation of South Yemen with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment in the 1970s and 1980s, when the country was a Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic.

The drills involved units from the army, Navy, Air Force, and Air Defence troops, and were designed to improve the country’s combat and defence capability, strengthen coordination between various branches of the armed services, and reinforce Iran’s capability to operate in remote international waters.The US military has not commented on the alleged incident.Humbling a SuperpowerThe MQ-9 Reaper drone is the US Air Force’s weapon of choice for Washington’s controversial drone strike programme, with the drones used extensively to target mostly poor countries with limited or non-existent air defences in places like Afghanistan, Africa, and Yemen. Although they typically carry weapons, the drones can be configured for reconnaissance operations, and in addition to the military, are used by US Customs and Border Protection on the border with Mexico.The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a whale-headed UAV designed specifically for intelligence gathering operations. Iran knocked one of these large $220 million stealthy drones out of the sky over the Strait of Hormuz in June 2019 after it entered Iranian airspace and refused to heed warnings to leave. A domestically-developed Khordad 3 air defence system was used to shoot the drone down. Iran collected the UAV’s wreckage, meticulously put it back together and proudly put it on permanent display at its National Aerospace Park in Tehran last year.The ill-fated Global Hawk is one of two intruding US drones that Iran has managed to take down over the years. In late 2011, a US RQ-170 flying wing-shaped reconnaissance drone was safely brought down in northeastern Iran. The United States initially claimed that the drone had malfunctioned and crashed. However, Iran said that its cyber warfare forces managed to hack into and commandeer the UAV mid-flight, landing it safely. Later, US media reported that the drone may indeed have been captured by jamming its satellite and ground control signals, following a GPS spoofing attack using a Russian-made jamming system. The US later asked Iran to return the drone, with an Iranian company responding by promising to send miniature pink toy versions of the UAV to then-president Barack Obama.Iran later reportedly worked to reverse engineer the UAV into at least two drone designs – the Shahed 171 Simorgh and the Saegheh.Iran isn’t the only nation to have shot down US drones. In 2019, Yemen’s Houthi militia, who have been battling a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, also managed the feat, reportedly dropping two Reaper drones flying over Yemeni airspace in June and August of that year. US Central Command confirmed the first incident and claimed that Iran shot the aircraft down or “enabled” the Houthis to do so. The Houthis reportedly used a 2K12 Kub, NATO designation SA-6 – an ancient Soviet-era surface-to-air missile system hailing from the 1960s, in the June 2019 incident. The USSR provided the former nation of South Yemen with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment in the 1970s and 1980s, when the country was a Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic. The missile system used in the August 2019 incident has not been specified. https://sputniknews.com/20211106/iran-announces-large-scale-drill-in-southern-waters-sending-warning-to-enemies---report-1090532378.html iran Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 2021 Ilya Tsukanov Ilya Tsukanov News en_EN Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 1920 1080 true 1920 1440 true 1920 1920 true Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 Ilya Tsukanov america, iran, drone

(MENAFN- Nam News Network) TEHRAN, Nov 10 (NNN-IRNA) – The Iranian army intercepted two U.S. drones and warned them to stay away from the zones, where it was carrying out the Zolfaqar-1400 military drills, the army's media bureau said in a statement yesterday. The U.S. aircraft, including MQ-9 and RQ-4 drones, intruded into the country's Flight Information Region and Air Defence Identification Zone during the drills, according to the statement. The drones were approaching to gather intelligence, but they changed their course and flew away after receiving decisive warnings, it said. The Iranian army on Sunday launched a large-scale military exercise on the southern coasts, east of the Strait of Hormuz. During the manoeuvre, attended by ground force, navy, air force and air defence, Iran's army tested locally-developed missiles, torpedoes and unmanned aerial vehicles, according to official reports. The two-day joint exercise was wrapped up yesterday with a naval parade. Iranian army commanders said, the drills aimed at enhancing preparations to ward off threats and sending a message of peace and friendship to regional states.– NNN-IRNA

Topic: Iran Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: IranDronesUnmanned AircraftJCPOANegotiations This latest incident between Tehran and Washington comes just weeks before the two countries are set to resume talks to restart the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. Iranian state media claimed on Tuesday that the Iran military had “warned off” U.S. drones that were operating near an annual exercise at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The annual Zulfiqar 1400 exercises began on Sunday, east of the Strait of Hormuz, and extended over an area of more than a million square kilometers (around 400,000 square miles) in the Sea of Oman, the Indian Ocean and even into parts of the Red Sea. The war games concluded on Tuesday with a parade of warships that included Iranian submarines. Exactly where the drones were when they were “warned off” hasn’t been entirely established, but the types of unmanned aerial vehicles were noted in a state TV report. “These aircraft [RQ-4 and MQ-9 U.S. drones] changed their route after approaching the borders of the Islamic Republic of Iran following the air defence’s interception and decisive warning,” state media IRIB reported, according to Reuters. The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, remotely piloted, surveillance aircraft that first entered service in 1998. The unmanned aircraft can provide a broad overview and systematic surveillance using its high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared sensors, while it can maintain long loiter times over target areas. As such, the RQ-4 Global Hawk can survey as much as forty thousand square miles one hundred square kilometers of terrain per day, roughly area the size of South Korea or Iceland. Meanwhile, MQ-9 Reaper—also known as the Predator B—UAV is capable of remote control as well as autonomous flight operations. It is a hunter-killer UAV designed for long-endurance, high-altitude surveillance. It first entered service in 2007. The U.S. military operates roughly forty-nine of the RQ-4 Global Hawks and nearly two hundred of the MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft. Series of Incidents Iran has been accused of orchestrating various recent attacks on shipping in the sea lanes serving the Gulf, which is where a large portion of the world’s oil is produced. This latest incident between Tehran and Washington comes just weeks before the two countries are set to resume talks to restart the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. That would be the first talks regarding the United States’ re-entry into the nuclear deal that former President Donald Trump exited from in 2018. Six previous rounds of indirect negotiations had occurred earlier this year and ended in June when the Islamic Republic elected a new president. It is unlikely that the U.S. strategy will change in the next round of talks. “We have been unambiguous when it comes to our position that there was tremendous progress in rounds one through six in these talks in Vienna,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement, reported by TheHill.com. “It would be neither productive nor wise to take up from any other position from where we left off in June, from the conclusion in the sixth round.” The next round of talks is set to resume in Vienna on November 29.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Jan. 7 By Maksim Tsurkov - Trend: For Tehran, possible gas supplies from Iran to Georgia will have a political context, not an economic one, said Vagif Aliyev, head of the Investment Department of State Oil Company of Azerbaijan in an interview with ANS TV channel. He added that while Georgia is a close neighbor and strategic ally of Azerbaijan, each state determines its own energy strategy. "SOCAR has strong position in Georgia. Over the past five years, SOCAR has become the largest taxpayer in Georgia. Georgia and Azerbaijan signed an agreement on gas deliveries until 2030", Aliyev said. "We are the main supplier of natural gas to the country, in addition, another part of the volume Tbilisi receives as transit fee for transportation of Russian gas through its territory to Armenia." Azerbaijan exported 1.5 billion cubic meters of gas to Georgia in Jan.-Nov. 2015. Gas from Azerbaijan to Georgia is delivered via the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline, which transports gas produced in "Shah Deniz" gas-condensate field in the Caspian's Azerbaijani sector. SOCAR supplies its own gas to Georgia via a pipeline that passes through the Azerbaijan's Gazakh district. Power flow of gas through this pipeline is about three billion cubic meters a year. Azerbaijan is the main supplier of gas to Georgia with a share of 77.9 percent of total imports of this category. Speaking about possible gas supplies to Georgia from Iran, Aliyev said that it could happen, most likely, on the small scale. "It is important to think how important the Georgian market is for Iran," he said. According to the agreement with Georgia, Iran has to deliver gas to Armenian border and Georgia will receive it on its border with this country. Currently, Iran exports gas to Turkey in the framework of the gas swaps with Azerbaijan - to Nakhchivan, as well as to Armenia. ---

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Jan. 14 By Elena Kosolapova - Trend: Georgia is considering the possibility to replace the Russian gas with the gas from Azerbaijan, said Georgian Deputy Energy Minister Mariam Valishvili in an exclusive interview with Trend Jan. 14. She said this issue is being discussed at the negotiations with Azerbaijan's State Oil Company (SOCAR) and Russia's Gazprom. Azerbaijan is the main supplier of gas to Georgia. Russian gas deliveries to Georgia are carried out only in the form of payment for its transit to Armenia, for which the country is supplied with 10 percent of total shipments. Gazprom supplied 300 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas to Georgia in 2014. Currently, Georgia is discussing with Gazprom the possibility for the Russian side to pay for gas transit to Armenia in money, said Valishvili. The amount that Russia has to pay for transit in 2016 is being discussed particularly. Valishvili said that the negotiations on the terms of gas transit to Armenia are held annually as the contract is concluded for one year. "Those 10 percent of the gas that Georgia has previously received from Russia, are planned to be replaced with supplies from Azerbaijan as far as possible," she said. "This possibility has been discussed during the negotiations with SOCAR this week," she said. "But the experts must examine the technical preparedness of the existing pipelines from Azerbaijan to Georgia for increasing the supplies in the required volumes." She also said that Georgia's gas needs are growing every year. "It will be impossible to completely replace the Russian gas, which is being received as the payment for transit, with Azerbaijani gas," she said. "Georgia can compensate the remaining volumes through the direct supplies from Russia. The possibility of such supplies was also discussed at the talks with Gazprom, but the prices offered by the Russian side are quite high." Valishvili also said that currently there is no infrastructure for gas supplies from any third country. "In the long-term, Georgia is interested in gas supplies from Iran, but this issue is not on the agenda in the near-term, and no talks with Tehran are underway on this issue," she added. The deputy minister also said that technical specifications of the already available gas infrastructure, as well as the possibility of Azerbaijan's participation in the construction of new facilities of this infrastructure in Georgia, were discussed during the talks with SOCAR. The issue of cost of the Azerbaijani gas delivered to Georgia was not discussed, she added. At the same time, Valishvili stressed that Azerbaijan sells gas to Georgia at a very competitive and favorable price. The deputy minister said that no agreements with Gazprom and SOCAR have been reached yet. --- Follow the author on Twitter: @E_Kosolapova

News article:
Petroleum Minister Bijan Zangeneh said on Thursday that Iran will start within the next ten days negotiations on how to use Oman's unused LNG capacity. Having returned from a short visit to Muscat, he told Shana that during the meeting with Omani Oil and Gas Minister Mohammed bin Hamad Al Rumhi, both sides also exchanged views on the international crude oil market, IRNA reported on Jan.21. 'The visit which lasted few hours was made upon the invitation of the Omani minister of oil and gas. Gas export, using vacant LNG capacity, and oil market were the main issues discussed during the meeting.' On exporting Iran's gas to Oman via pipeline, he said, 'It was agreed that a pipeline to carry 1 billion cubic feet or 28 million cubic meters a day at the annual volume of 10 billion cubic meters be constructed jointly between the two countries.' 'The value of the contract depends on the oil price. Nevertheless, with the current oil prices, the value of exporting 10 billion cubic meters a year will be around 1.5 to 2 billion dollars annually.' Saying that technical aspects of the pipeline were finalized during meeting, Zangeneh added that Oman unused LNG capacity which Iran could not use to export the product due to sanctions, will be utilized. 'Today it was decided that in the first possible time, which I think will be the next 10 days, National Iranian Gas Export Company and the Oman side will start negotiating with the foreign firms to use the unused capacity.' 'We also discussed financing the project,' said the Iranian minister. Regarding the talks on oil markets in Muscat, Zangeneh said Oman has always been ready to cooperate with OPEC. 'However, and unfortunately, OPEC lacked any clear stand in this regard and there is difference among the members on how to manage the market,' he said.

'We also discussed financing the project,' said the Iranian minister. Regarding the talks on oil markets in Muscat, Zangeneh said Oman has always been ready to cooperate with OPEC. 'However, and unfortunately, OPEC lacked any clear stand in this regard and there is difference among the members on how to manage the market,' he said.

(MENAFN- AFP) French energy giant Total will sign a contract with Iran to buy crude oil, the company's chief executive said Thursday after meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during his visit to France. "We plan to sign a contract which will allow us to take between 150,000 and 200,000 barrels of crude a day," Patrick Pouyanne said. The deal will be signed at the French presidency later Thursday. With the end of economic and financial sanctions, Iran has decided to increase its oil production to 500,000 barrels a day, a decision which further weakened oil prices last week. The price of crude oil is currently around $32 (29 euros) a barrel, about 70 percent less than it was in June 2014. Iran, which has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves, currently produces 2.8 million barrels a day, about a million of which are destined for export. Pouyanne said other French projects were also in the pipeline with Iran. "Total has been very present in Iran, very loyal to Iran. We have obviously envisaged other projects but they need to be discussed," he said.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Jan. 29 By Aygun Badalova - Trend: Iran is more than willing to sell its gas to Europe but the country might not be able to do this very soon, US expert on Central Asia and energy issues Bruce Pannier believes. "To export large volumes of gas, pipelines are required and currently there are no pipelines linking Iran to Europe," Pannier told Trend. On January 16, the International Atomic Energy Agency verified Tehran's compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), opening the way for Iran's return to the global energy market. The same day, the US and the European Union announced that they were lifting their sanctions against Iran. The removal of sanctions against Iran will allow the country not only to increase its oil production and export, but also to become one of the major gas exporter to the global markets. Iran holds 17 percent of the world's proved natural gas reserves and more than one-third of OPEC's reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). As of January 2015, Iran's estimated proved natural gas reserves were 1,201 trillion cubic feet. The country is also the world's third-largest dry natural gas producer, after the US and Russia. Pannier mentioned that Iran has expressed interest in joining the Trans Anatolian gas pipeline project, which is aimed at the transportation of Azerbaijani Shah Deniz field's gas from Georgian-Turkish border to the western borders of Turkey. "SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan) has expended significant time and resources toward realizing the project. I cannot imagine Baku would want to share pipeline capacity with anyone for the foreseeable future, so more pipelines need to be built," Pannier said. Iran's ambassador to Azerbaijan Mohsen Pak Ayeen recently said that after the removal of sanctions, Tehran is capable of joining major regional projects such as TANAP. Meanwhile, SOCAR high representative said that the commercial supplies of Iranian gas via TANAP have not been discussed up till now. There are also questions about the diplomacy involved in Iran joining a pipeline project through Turkey since Tehran and Ankara are not on the best of terms, according to Pannier. Meanwhile he believes Tehran will attempt to improve relations with Ankara because Turkey is the best (quickest and most economical) route for Iran to ship anything to Europe. "The EU would probably encourage better ties between Ankara and Tehran and any gas pipeline projects carrying Iranian gas through Turkey could qualify to be considered as part of the EU's Southern Gas Corridor," Pannier said. "And yes, there is certainly a large amount of money to be made, and not just by Iran as transit countries such as Turkey stand to gain," he added. At the same time, Pannier believes that LNG is probably Iran's best opportunity for exporting gas to Europe in the near future. "In some ways, Iran is fortunate that many European countries have already constructed or are constructing terminals to receive LNG, although the plans envisioned receiving LNG from North Africa and possibly some Gulf states, and sometime in the next decade, possibly from the US also," he said. "So some of the necessary infrastructure is already in place and more is currently under construction. These terminals could take Iranian LNG as well, and it's worth mentioning the current political situation in North Africa cast some doubts about supplies from that source," Pannier added. Iranian officials have stated that export of LNG to Europe is a priority for the country. Iran has already developed an LNG plant by 50 percent, which is expected to become operational in 2018 with 10.5 million tons annual production capacity. Within the next three years the country expects to launch five LNG projects. Currently Iran reportedly is in talks with France, Germany and Belgium for construction of LNG tankers. Pannier believes that Iran will be able to attract investments to develop necessary infrastructure in energy sphere. "Reports said deals worth some $18 billion were signed when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was in Italy and billions more in contracts were expected to be signed during his visit to France," Pannier said. "But if Iran really needs the investment now, and if it wants to continue receiving foreign investment in its projects, the country might have to learn to become an easier partner to deal with," Pannier added.

News article:
The lifting of international sanctions on Iran will lead to increased opportunities for Pakistan to promote bilateral trade and investment, and to re-initiate work on the many stalled projects agreed to in the past, including Iran-Pak Refinery project. The proposed Iran-Pak Refinery is of great significance to Pakistan in the wake of rising demand of refined petroleum products in Pakistan and inability of its existing oil refineries to meet the present and future demand. Iran-Pak Refinery project, to be constructed at Gwadar port in Balochistan at a cost of $4 billion, as a joint venture with the government of Pakistan on the basis of equal shareholding, was shelved some years ago. It was also planned as part of the project to lay an oil pipeline from Iran to Gwadar port to transport crude oil for processing at the proposed refinery. The project, conceived in the late 1990s, was planned to refine 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) or about 4 million tons per annum (MTPA) of the Iranian heavy crude. The fully integrated refinery project was first proposed to be established at Port Qasim, Karachi for which project implementation framework was finalised, but it could not take-off. The project was revived by the Iranian side in 2007 to be re-located at Khalifa Point in Hub, Balochistan for which 700 acres of land was also acquired, but still there was no progress seen, apparently due to many commercial issues. Nonetheless, it was in April 2011 that the project was revived once again for construction at Gwadar port, and Pakistan State Oil (PSO) was nominated to be the JV partner representing the Pakistan side. Today, Pakistan has a total refining capacity to process around 400,000bpd or about 19MTPA of crude oil, against the current demand of 24MTPA. Total global refining capacity is 97 million bpd, and Pakistan, with nominal world share of 0.4 percent, is ranked 48th. Demand for oil products in the country is expected to grow steadily at seven percent on year-on-year basis, according to recent studies, in particular for the furnace oil, motor spirit, diesel and aviation fuel, which accounts for 78 percent of total oil demand. Thus, the demand-supply gap will continue to strain heavily on the imports in future, if oil refining capacity is not added at a large scale. Global refining capacity is expected to reach 115 million bpd by 2020 despite low crude oil prices and consequently the gloomy scenario for the oil and gas sector. It is however speculated that the global trend of declining oil prices would be arrested in the near future. Interestingly, most recent oil refining capacity additions have taken place in the Asia-Pacific region. Pakistan should therefore be no exception as future energy consumption poses a serious challenge for the nation, and refining margins are high. Currently, there are seven oil refineries operating in the country. Major players in the sector are Pak-Arab Refinery Co Ltd (Parco) of 100,000bpd (4.5MTPA), National Refinery Ltd (NRL) of 64,000bpd (2.9MTPA), Pakistan Refinery Ltd (PRL) of 47,000bpd (2.1MTPA), Attock Refinery Ltd (ARL) of 43,000bpd (1.9MTPA), Byco Petroleum Pakistan Ltd (BPPL) of 35,000bpd (1.6MTPA) and Byco Oil Pakistan Ltd (BOPL) of 120,000bpd (5.4MTPA) output capacity, which was commissioned in June 2015. Currently, capacity expansion project of ARL, which is totally dependent on local crude oil and condensate, by 10,400bpd (0.47 MTPA) is being implemented. Parco, which is a joint venture between the governments of Pakistan and the UAE, processes heavy crude from the UAE only. Pakistan Refinery and National Refinery also process indigenous crude, blending with crude oil imported from the Gulf and Saudi Arabian sources. To meet fast growing demand of the POL (petroleum oils and lubricants) products it was planned by the government since long to set up new refinery projects, besides undertaking capacity expansion of the existing refineries. It was projected to achieve total capacity, in phases, up to 520,000bpd by 2014-15. The plans however were not implemented as envisaged, though the government had initiated the largest refinery project in Pakistan namely Khalifa Coastal Refinery, of capacity 250,000bpd or 13MTPA. To be installed at Hub near Gadani coastal area in Balochistan, the refinery was approved by the ECC of the Cabinet in 2007 at a cost of $6 billion, followed by signing of the project implementation agreement in Islamabad on November 13, 2007. The project, a joint venture of Parco and International Petroleum Investment Co (IPC) of the UAE, was scheduled for commissioning in 2011. The complex would include a 250MW power plant, grid station, mini port terminal, and petrochemical city for downstream industries, road network and other infrastructure. Sadly, the project remained on hold for long and there had been no physical progress on the construction of Khalifa Refinery for which the government has provided 1,000 acres of land to the investors as free-hold lease. Perhaps, work on the project was suspended in the past due to global recession and difficult business environments of the petroleum sector. Parco revived the project in October 2009 approving initial funding of $500 million to start construction of Khalifa Refinery by December 2009. Later, the company, Khalifa Coastal Refinery Co Ltd (KCRC) was formed in March 2011 to execute the project, but it has not materialised as yet. To optimally utilise indigenous crude oil, the Badin Refinery was planned in 1991, with a capacity of 35,000bpd extendable to 45,000bpd. The project, a joint venture of the PSO with Kuwait, was to be established at Jamshoro to meet large furnace oil requirements of a number of thermal power plants located there. Another lobby however wanted the refinery to be set up in Karachi. The project received low priority by the government, apparently on the issue of its location, and has not been developed. Indus Refinery Ltd, in private sector, of 93,000bpd capacity located near Port Qasim Karachi is another long-running project, which has not been completed as yet. There is indeed a long list of missed opportunities in the petroleum sector. Trans-Asia Refinery project was planned of 100,000bpd capacity at Port Qasim, Karachi. Also, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had shown interest to set up refineries of 200,000bpd at Port Qasim and 300,000bpd capacity at Hub, respectively. Likewise, China wanted to construct a refinery and petrochemical complex at Gwadar port. There has been no progress on any of these projects. But in a latest development, China and the UAE investors have shown interest in setting up oil refineries in Pakistan. Also, the first refinery to be established in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is on cards based on indigenous crude oil, of initial capacity 20,000bpd to be doubled in the next phase. A multinational company has recently conducted study for selection of a suitable site for the refinery between Kohat and Karak where oil wells are located. The nation keenly looks towards further progress in this direction. The writer is former Chairman of the State Engineering Corporation

The lifting of international sanctions on Iran will lead to increased opportunities for Pakistan to promote bilateral trade and investment, and to re-initiate work on the many stalled projects agreed to in the past, including Iran-Pak Refinery project. The proposed Iran-Pak Refinery is of great significance to Pakistan in the wake of rising demand of refined petroleum products in Pakistan and inability of its existing oil refineries to meet the present and future demand. Iran-Pak Refinery project, to be constructed at Gwadar port in Balochistan at a cost of $4 billion, as a joint venture with the government of Pakistan on the basis of equal shareholding, was shelved some years ago. It was also planned as part of the project to lay an oil pipeline from Iran to Gwadar port to transport crude oil for processing at the proposed refinery. The project, conceived in the late 1990s, was planned to refine 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) or about 4 million tons per annum (MTPA) of the Iranian heavy crude.

News article:
Turkey won an arbitration case against Iran in a gas dispute and will receive a 13.3 to 15.8 percent discount on gas purchased from Iran between 2011 and 2015. The news was announced by Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Hamidreza Araqi as a discount around 10 to 15 percent, the country's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported yesterday morning. The minister reportedly said: "Although the court's [the International Court of Arbitration] ruling is final, the money that Iran should pay out to Turkey has not yet been determined," while estimating the compensation to be around $1 billion. Later in the day, speaking to a TV channel, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak said that the mentioned discount will be something between 13.3 and 15.8 percent and Iran will be paying back the higher amount Turkey paid.The two sides have to agree on the exact percentage of the discount in a few months. If they fail to agree on a certain percentage, the court will make a decision on that too. Turkey currently imports about 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Iran – the country's second largest supplier after Russia – under a 25-year deal that was signed in 1996. However, stating that the price charged by Iran was too high, Turkey approached the International Court of Arbitration in 2012, demanding that the price be lowered by 25 percent.Iran agreed to the discount only if the imported amount of gas was increased, which Ankara rejected. The issue was therefore taken to court, which decided in Turkey's favor, setting the discount at a 10 to 15 percent, according to Araqi.In 2012, Turkey approached International Court of Arbitration with a second case, claiming that Iran's delivery was lower than the agreed amount and decided in favor of Iran. Turkey's state-run BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corporation sued Iran in 2014 over high gas prices. Winning the case, BOTAŞ received a 16.5 percent discount and a $900 million payment from Iran.The discount has led to expectations of a discount in domestic prices. Energy prices have been an issue for Turkey since they started to follow a global downward trend. Last week Albayrak said that prices, which have been declining since June 2014, will soon be reflected in domestic natural gas prices. Due to the fluctuations in energy prices over the last decade, natural gas prices have been increasing and Turks have faced very high costs. Albayrak said that the government tried to deflect these increasing costs through subsidies and, as a result, BOTAŞ has been suffering losses for years. "Recently, we have seen energy prices decreasing and, therefore, hopefully this decrease will also mean BOTAŞ can offer discounts on its price tariffs," he said.Yesterday Albayrak stated that the government has been working on a discount package for energy prices, and Iran's forced-discount will strengthen this government plan. "Hopefully, this discount will be reflected in consumer prices soon," he added.Meanwhile, Turkey's natural gas consumption reached a new high, with 235 million cubic meters burned on a daily basis last week, while many parts of the country suffered from extreme cold. According to a report by the Anadolu Agency (AA) from data compiled by the Ministry for Energy and Natural Resources, Turkey consumed a total of 1.128 billion cubic meters of natural gas between Jan. 25 and Jan. 29, which is equal to an average consumption 235 million cubic meters per day. These figures are a historic high for the national consumption of natural gas.When weather forecasts hitting minus 20 degrees Celsius just one week earlier, the Ministry for Energy and Natural Resources considered the possibility of high natural gas consumption in houses and, accordingly, ordered power plants producing electricity from natural gas to switch to using reserve fuel. Power plants started generating electricity from fuel oil or diesel oil on Jan. 21, and returned to normal operations in stages after temperatures returned normal seasonal averages.Total annual natural gas consumption stood at 48 billion cubic meters in Turkey in 2014. The Turkish Natural Gas Distributors Union Association (GAZBİR) downgraded their estimates for the coming year's annual consumption of natural gas from 51 billion cubic meters to 47.8 billion cubic meters.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Feb. 4 By Aygun Badalova - Trend: Iran may attach political importance to exporting gas to Europe, in a way to complicate the possible reapplication of sanctions against the country, David Koranyi, director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasian Energy Futures Initiative and deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center believes. Koranyi told Trend that Iran's gas production potential is enormous, however yet the country faces formidable obstacles to gas exports. "Domestic residential demand continues to grow, and gas is needed for reinjection into oil fields to keep up production,"Koranyi told Trend. For Iran, many obstacles to foreign investment will remain even after the sanctions have been lifted, he believes. Koranyi mentioned that Iran also plans to build up a first class petrochemical industry and export electricity regionally instead of gas. The country's petrochemical output capacity currently stands at 60 million tons. The Islamic Republic hopes to bring this capacity to 120 million tons by 2020 and 180 million tons by 2025. "The current price environment in Europe does not help either, it does not seem commercially viable to bring gas all the way from South Pars to the European markets," Koranyi said. "At the same time Iran may attach political importance to exporting gas to Europe by pipeline or LNG, as it will increase its importance and complicate the reapplication of sanctions in a worst case scenario," he added. On January 16, the International Atomic Energy Agency verified Tehran's compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), opening the way for Iran's return to the global energy market. The same day, the US and the European Union announced that they were lifting their sanctions against Iran. Iran holds 17 percent of the world's proved natural gas reserves and more than one-third of OPEC's reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). As of January 2015, Iran's estimated proved natural gas reserves were 1,201 trillion cubic feet. At the same time, Iran is the world's third-largest dry natural gas producer, after the US and Russia. In 2013, Iran became the world's largest gas-flaring country, surpassing Russia, according to the EIA. Last year Head of National Iranian Gas Exports Company Alireza Kameli said that the export of gas to Europe is uneconomical for Iran. He also said that exporting LNG to European markets is on Iranian Oil Ministry's top agenda. Speaking about the oil sector, Koranyi said that Iran's return will have profound repercussions for international markets. "Iran's barrels will add to an already oversupplied global oil markets and may drive down prices further," he said. Iran's current oil production is estimated to be around 2.8 million barrels per day (mbpd), of which about one million barrels are exported. Free of sanctions, the country plans to increase its oil export by 500,000 barrels per day, and then raise the figure by another 500,000 to two million barrels per day within a six month period at the next step.

News article:
After lifting the international sanctions on Iran, its crude oil sales to Europe reached above 300,000 barrels, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Saturday. Iran’s oil exports used to record a high of more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2011; however, the tougher sanctions imposed on Iran in 2012 because of its nuclear program, lead to a fall to a little more than 1 million bpd. After the rubber-stamping of the nuclear deal with world powers last year, however, Tehran has ordered a 500,000 bpd increase in oil output. “Based on the contract signed between the National Iranian Oil Co and France’s Total, it was agreed that Total will buy 160,000 bpd of crude oil from Iran to be delivered in Europe,” Zanganeh was quoted as saying by news agency SHANA. The contract would be finalized on Feb 16, he added. Furthermore, Zanganeh also said Italy’s Eni was interested in buying 100,000 barrels of crude oil from Iran and its representatives would visit Tehran in near future to discuss the contract. “Eni has voiced its interest in one of Iran’s fields which will be treated like the agreement reached with Total,” he said. Iran’s oil minister said Italian refiner Saras was intent to buy 60,000 to 70,000 barrels of crude oil from Iran. Tehran is working on attracting foreign investors that have been frightened by sanctions and low by mitigating the terms it offers on oil development contracts. Tehran and its pragmatic president are putting in efforts to deliver the promise of economic recovery. The new contracts, comprising those in the upstream exploration and development sectors are expected to attract more than $40 billion in foreign investment. Iran has put off a planned oil conference in London, which was due to have taken place in February to reveal its new contracts, until November. An Iranian official said “the U.S. urged Tehran to hold off” until a final nuclear deal was reached.

Tehran is planning to sell 300,000 barrels of oil per day to the European market. Meanwhile, Anglo-Swiss commodity trader Glencore has become the first Western company to deal in Iranian crude. It’s the first time Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh has revealed how much Iranian oil is heading to Europe. Now that sanctions have been lifted, Iran is planning to boost exports by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the coming months, with much of the rest going to Asia. Iran has also agreed on a deal with France’s Total. "Based on the contract signed between the National Iranian Oil Co and France's Total, it was agreed that Total will buy 160,000 bpd of crude oil from Iran to be delivered in Europe," Zanganeh was quoted as saying by the SHANA news agency. He added that the contract would be finalized on February 16. Zanganeh said Italy’s Eni was interested in buying 100,000 bpd of oil from Tehran and its employees would visit the Iran to discuss the contract. He added that Italian refiner Saras is also interested in buying 60,000 to 70,000 bpd. Meanwhile, a tanker chartered by Glencore loaded 80,000 metric tons of fuel oil on Friday and is bound for Singapore, according to Thomson Reuters ship tracking data, quoted by media. Iran intends to raise more than $40 billion of foreign investment for its oil industry, including exploration and development. Iran on EU shopping spree after lifting of Western sanctions https://t.co/k0p9xgUb6Epic.twitter.com/tGc09shgse — RT (@RT_com) January 27, 2016 Additional crude from Iran could shatter the already fragile market. Oil prices dropped to 12-year lows of less than $27 a barrel in January due to global oversupply. According to the chief economist of the World Bank's Middle East and North Africa Region Shantayanan Devarajan, a million bpd increase in Iran's oil exports can make prices fall by an additional 13 percent, or $3 per barrel, TASS reported. As of 10:30am GMT Monday, Brent was trading at $33.47 per barrel, while US WTI cost $30.41.

News article:
Dubai: Iran’s oil minister said foreign oil companies that owe his country billions of dollars are likely to settle their debts in euros. Greece’s Hellenic Petroleum, Italy’s Saras and Royal Dutch Shell owe Iran about $4 billion which will be paid back in euros, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh was cited by the ministry’s news agency Shana as saying on Tuesday. Shell has said it was ready to settle its debts to Iran, but Greece’s Hellenic Petroleum is having trouble to pay Iran back and “alternative methods are being worked out”, Zanganeh said, according to Shana. He did not elaborate. A Shell spokesman said: “We will settle our outstanding debt to NIOC (National Iranian Oil Co) as soon as we are lawfully able to do so,” declining to comment on whether the payment would be made in euros. Zanganeh also said Emirates National Oil Co, Japan and the Netherlands had started settling their debts to Iran’s central bank. Iran wants to recover tens of billions of dollars it is owed by buyers of its oil in euros and is billing new crude sales in euros, too, looking to reduce its dependence on the US dollar following last month’s sanctions relief. A source at state-owned NIOC told Reuters last week that Iran will charge in euros for its recently signed oil contracts with firms including French oil and gas major Total, Spanish refiner Cepsa and Litasco, the trading arm of Russia’s Lukoil. Safar-Ali Karamati, deputy director of international affairs for marketing and crude oil operations at NIOC, has told Shana that Iran favours the euro as the payment currency for its oil export contracts.

News article:
Despite the current global glut in crude that began to send prices plunging in mid-2014, Iran is starting to prime its pumps in an effort to boost exports by a million barrels of oil per day in six months. The first Iranian oil shipment to depart the country since the lifting of U.S. and other Western sanctions Jan. 16 will leave this weekend, according to the head of Iran’s state-owned oil company. Four million barrels of crude are headed to French, Russian and Spanish customers, National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) Managing Director Roknoddin Javadi said Saturday. “Two million barrels of the cargo has been purchased by France’s Total and the rest is purchased by two companies from Russia and Spain,” Javadi was quoted as saying by Iran’s official energy news service Shana. Javadi didn’t identify the other customers, but said the oil purchased by the Russian firm is destined for Romanian refineries. OPEC Crude Oil Basket Reference Price | FindTheData The deal with the French oil giant Total SA came in the wake of a high-profile European tour taken by a business delegation headed by Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani last month. Total executives agreed to buy 160,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil. This is the first shipment associated with that agreement. Iran is undercutting its geopolitical rival Saudi Arabia by about a dollar per barrel for oil sold to Europe in a bid to lure business away from the oil-rich kingdom, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has been tapping its massive budget surplus and selling oil at a discount to Asia as it grapples with the U.S. shale boom that has disrupted the global energy landscape. Concerns about losing market share have kept crude flowing out of OPEC member states, exacerbating the global supply glut that’s rattled oil-dependent economies from Oklahoma to Nigeria. Meanwhile, there’s now so much oil out there that the world is running out of places to store it. The energy shipment this weekend isn’t the first to go to a European buyer since the lifting of sanctions last month. The Swiss commodities trading giant Glencore PLC last week loaded 80,000 metric tons of Iranian fuel oil, a distillate product that can be used as heating oil, on a ship destined for the UAE. While Iran is able to sell oil more freely now than in the recent past, U.S. sanctions related to the country’s record on human rights and terrorism remain in place. Many shipowners are hesitant to carry the nation’s crude because these sanctions prohibit dollar-based transactions with Iranian companies or their government. Most oil is paid for in dollars, which means that to avoid U.S. scrutiny the transactions have to be carried out using currency conversions that raise costs. Many European insurers also are reluctant to cover cargo ships carrying Iran’s oil because they use the American financial system and pool resources with American companies, according to the Wall Street Journal. This exposes them to U.S. retaliatory measures.

News article:
Iran has shipped crude oil to Europe for the first time in five years just a month after world powers lifted sanctions on Tehran in step with the landmark nuclear deal reached last July. The oil shipment to Europe opened “a new chapter” in Iran’s oil industry, Rokneddin Javadi, Deputy Oil Minister said on Sunday, IRNA news agency reported. Iran is said to have recently loaded several European tankers with oil after announcing on Saturday that it would do so within the next 24 hours. “In the coming 24 hours, 4 million barrels of crude oil will be loaded onto 3 tankers destined for Europe,” Rokneddin Javadi, managing director of the National Iranian Oil Company, was quoted as saying by the Shana news agency. “Of those 4 million barrels of crude, 2 million barrels are assigned to France’s Total, and 2 million barrels have been bought by two companies in Russia and Spain,” he added. Iran has signed a deal with French oil giant Total for daily export of 160,000 to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, according to the IRNA. While Iran has just recently restarted oil exports to Europe, it has steadily been increasing its oil exports to Japan, challenging Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE, Mehr news agency reported on Sunday. Iran’s exports to Japan have increased by 34 percent since December of 2015, while Saudi Arabia has witnessed only a 5-percent rise. Iran is seeking to gain at least 10 percent of Japan’s market, which would mean a daily export of 350,000 barrels per day, Mehr news agency said, citing Seyyed Mohsen Ghamsari, Executive Director for International Affairs at National Iranian Oil Company. Another announcement was made by Iran’s vice president on Saturday, who also said that the country’s overall exports are set to substantially increase. “One of the opportunities created by the JCPOA was the increase in oil exports,” Jahangiri said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, the Tasnim news agency reported. #Iran’s #Oil Exports to Hit 2mln bpd in Coming Months: First VPhttps://t.co/Wed378iqWq — Tasnim News Agency (@Tasnimnews_EN) February 13, 2016 He said that Iran’s exports, which currently stand at 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd), will amount to 1.5 million bpd by mid-March, and to 2 million within a few months. The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) is also seeking to step up its oil trade with other costumers, including China, South Korea, India and Turkey. Western countries lifted sanctions on Iran in January after the UN nuclear watchdog confirmed that Tehran had complied with all of the conditions required under a deal designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

News article:
Greece is in preliminary talks with Iran to secure natural gas for local needs and provide a gateway for the Persian Gulf nation to supply fuel to other parts of Europe, Greek Energy Minister Panos Skourletis said on Feb.24. Greece produces little oil and almost no gas, while Iran is a member of OPEC and holds gas reserves that BP Plc ranks as the world's largest. According to Bloomberg, the countries agreed in January for Iran to supply crude to Hellenic Petroleum SA and buy oil products from the refiner. That deal, possibly Iran's first such agreement with a European company since the lifting of sanctions, opens the road to cooperation in the gas market too, Skourletis said in an interview in Athens. "What's sure is that Iran wants to start selling its natural gas in liquefied form using ships and is interested in Greece," he said. The Revythousa re-gasification terminal near Athens is one potential entry point for Iranian gas, and a planned facility at Alexandroupolis in the north of the country is another. Iran is interested in both sites "for exporting to Europe," Skourletis said. Iranian Oil Ministry media officials in Tehran couldn't be reached for immediate comment. Diversifying Supply Greece is hoping that the removal last month of international sanctions against Iran will help it diversify its sources of energy and enhance the European country's role as a regional energy-distribution hub. Greece was forced to import more liquefied natural gas and switch at least one power plant to using oil for fuel in 2009, when a dispute between Russia and Ukraine disrupted gas supplies. Iran's Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia discussed potential energy cooperation with Skourletis on Jan. 22 in Athens. Iran, which currently lacks facilities to export LNG, wants to use idle capacity at a facility in neighboring Oman to process raw gas into a liquefied form for sale, the Iranian Oil Ministry's news service Shana reported on Feb. 21, citing Alireza Kameli, managing director of National Iranian Gas Export Co. Iran and Oman are negotiating to build a pipeline to send gas across the Persian Gulf to the Omani facility, Shana reported. By liquefying gas, producers can ship it by tanker to distant markets not linked by pipelines. Regional Pipelines Iranian companies have expressed interest in participating with Depa, Greece's state-run gas supplier, in a company that will build and run the planned floating LNG storage and re-gasification facility at Alexandroupolis, Skourletis said. Expansion of the Revythousa gas-importing terminal will be completed in 2017, and with adequate investment, the plant could also send gas northward to other areas in Europe, he said. Both facilities will be connected to two international pipeline systems, the planned Trans Adriatic Pipeline and Gas Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria links, Skourletis said. The market test for the Interconnector pipeline, which will link the Greek and Bulgarian gas systems, is due to be finished this month. "If that shows that the project is viable, it will open the road for the Alexandroupolis facility," Skourletis said. Iran is also interested in Greece's refineries, he said. The Greek government has no plans to reduce its 35 percent share in Hellenic Petroleum, the country's biggest refiner, so any purchase of a stake could only happen via a private investor in the company, Skourletis said. Paneuropean Oil & Industrial Holdings, owned by the Latsis Group, owns 43 percent of Hellenic Petroleum, according to the refiner's website.

News article:
Greece is in preliminary talks with Iran to secure natural gas for local needs and provide a gateway for the Persian Gulf nation to supply fuel to other parts of Europe, Greek Energy Minister Panos Skourletis said on Feb.24. Greece produces little oil and almost no gas, while Iran is a member of OPEC and holds gas reserves that BP Plc ranks as the world's largest. According to Bloomberg, the countries agreed in January for Iran to supply crude to Hellenic Petroleum SA and buy oil products from the refiner. That deal, possibly Iran's first such agreement with a European company since the lifting of sanctions, opens the road to cooperation in the gas market too, Skourletis said in an interview in Athens. "What's sure is that Iran wants to start selling its natural gas in liquefied form using ships and is interested in Greece," he said. The Revythousa re-gasification terminal near Athens is one potential entry point for Iranian gas, and a planned facility at Alexandroupolis in the north of the country is another. Iran is interested in both sites "for exporting to Europe," Skourletis said. Iranian Oil Ministry media officials in Tehran couldn't be reached for immediate comment. Diversifying Supply Greece is hoping that the removal last month of international sanctions against Iran will help it diversify its sources of energy and enhance the European country's role as a regional energy-distribution hub. Greece was forced to import more liquefied natural gas and switch at least one power plant to using oil for fuel in 2009, when a dispute between Russia and Ukraine disrupted gas supplies. Iran's Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia discussed potential energy cooperation with Skourletis on Jan. 22 in Athens. Iran, which currently lacks facilities to export LNG, wants to use idle capacity at a facility in neighboring Oman to process raw gas into a liquefied form for sale, the Iranian Oil Ministry's news service Shana reported on Feb. 21, citing Alireza Kameli, managing director of National Iranian Gas Export Co.

News article:
Pakistan is considering allowing oil imports from Iran via land route in the face of lifting of international sanctions.According to an official aware of the development, discussions are going on in government circles that the country, which had stopped oil import through land route about six years ago, should remove the restrictions as UN and US sanctions on Tehran have been withdrawn.“This plan will lead to resumption of oil imports from Iran which has been on halt since 2010,” the official said.This way oil smuggling from Iran, which has been continuing without much interruption through Balochistan, will come to an end and legal avenues will open up.Instead of refined oil, Iran is capable of exporting crude oil in big volumes. Two Pakistani refineries - Pakistan Refinery Limited and Bosicor - had been importing Iranian crude until 2010 but after the sanctions banks refused to open letters of credit for oil purchases.In an effort to check smuggling of goods, particularly petroleum products, Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies have sealed a 500km belt along the border by digging trenches and placing barbed wire. However, despite that, smugglers still find a way to dodge the security checks.Among the smuggled goods, oil has a dominant place for decades. Apart from other means of transportation, mules are used to ship oil canisters from the other side of the border. Small-scale smugglers hire children who carry bottles of fuel and cross into Pakistan.According to a government study, the main stumbling block in the way of trade with Iran is the payment for goods through banks. Now after the lifting of sanctions, Pakistan is hoping to open banking channels in June this year, which will also lead to the opening of land route for oil supply from Iran.At present, oil demand in Pakistan stands at 22 million tons per year. Local refineries produce 13 million tons and the remaining is imported.Pakistan State Oil is a major oil supplier and importer. Local refineries meet 45% of demand for high-speed diesel, which is widely used in transport and agricultural sectors. They also meet 35-40% of need for petrol and 30-35% of demand for furnace oil, which is consumed in power plants.Pakistan is currently importing crude oil from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia to meet the requirement of refineries including Parco, Pakistan Refinery, Attock Refinery, National Refinery and Byco.Published in The Express Tribune, March 5, 2016.

Baku, Azerbaijan, March 4 Trend: After having signed an agreement with Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR, there is no more need in importing gas from Iran, said Kakha Kaladze, Georgian deputy prime minister and energy minister. He made the remarks at a joint press conference with SOCAR President Rovnag Abdullayev, Georgia Online news website reported March 4. Kaladze said Georgia started simultaneous talks with Iran due to technical problems regarding the natural gas supply from Azerbaijan. "We had a meeting and talked about how it was possible to receive Iran's gas," Kaladze said. "Theoretically, there is an opportunity for that, but there is no such a need today. We have signed an agreement with a strategically partner country, a company, which will ensure the natural gas supply to Georgia and meet the market's needs." Georgia and Azerbaijan's SOCAR signed agreements March 4 in Tbilisi, under which the Azerbaijani side will increase natural gas supply to Georgia by 463 million cubic meters and reduce prices for the gas sold at social tariffs, as well as the commercially sold gas.

News article:
Algeciras, Spain: The Monte Toledo oil tanker covered the uneventful voyage from Iran to Europe with a haul of 1 million barrels of crude in just 17 days, but its journey has been four years in the making. On Sunday, the tanker became the first to deliver Iranian crude into Europe since mid-2012, when Brussels imposed an oil embargo in an attempt to force the Middle Eastern nation to negotiate the end of its nuclear programme. The ban was lifted in January as part of a broader deal that ended a decade of sanctions. The 275-metre tanker started offloading its cargo into a refinery owned by Cia Espanola de Petroleos, near Algeciras, a few miles from Gibraltar. By midday, the vessel had already pumped to shore about a fifth of its cargo. In southern Spain, the tanker’s arrival was met with little fanfare. It was a quiet Sunday at the refinery, and for the workers, the Monte Toledo is just one of the eight or so vessels they expect to receive this month. By the time the refinery has taken in all the Iranian crude, another tanker from Algeria will be already waiting. Nonetheless, there’s a wider significance. As the Monte Toledo started to pump to shore through two 21-inch floating hoses connected to a giant buoy and a 1.8km submarine pipeline, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani declared in Tehran that more oil exports “will be added soon.” Ali Tayebnia, the country’s minister of Economy and Finance, said that Iran’s oil exports will “soon return” to 2 million barrels a day. “Arrangements have been made for the return of Iran to the market,” he said according to Shana, the Oil Ministry’s news service. Around Europe, other tankers with Iranian oil are close behind the Monte Toledo. In February, 29 vessels loaded crude from the Middle Eastern nation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of those, three are heading toward Europe — the Eurohope tanker is sailing to Constanta, an oil port in Romania, and the Atlantas is on its way to France. Another one, the Distya Akula, is anchored at the mouth of the Suez Canal, and is likely to head into a Mediterranean port. The Monte Toledo and its companions are the vanguard in the return of Iran into the European oil market. Petro-Logistics SA, a Geneva-based tanker-tracking firm, estimated Iran exported in February about 1.4 million barrels a day, up 350,000 barrels a day from the average 2015 level. Although the increase falls short of the 500,000 barrels a day that Tehran had promised, there are signs that exports into Europe will pick up this month. “It does take a while to get those fields back up,” said Petro-Logistics director Daniel Gerber. “But I think they’re going to hit the increase of 500,000 barrels a day in March.” Seth Kleinman, head of energy research at Citigroup Inc in London, agreed, saying that in addition to higher export volumes this month, more countries were buying. “You see tankers going to Spain, Romania, Tanzania, France and the UAE,” he said. “You got an uptick to India in February too.” Still, hurdles remain. Lingering banking restraints mean some customers are finding it hard to transfer payments for Iranian crude and the National Iranian Oil Co. has offered to swap crude for gasoline to get deals done, according to local reports. Iran will want to win back customers in Europe, where Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other rival suppliers stepped in after the embargo was imposed. Tehran also faces a rival unknown four years ago: the US has started exporting crude and companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp are shipping American oil into refineries in the Mediterranean. Before the embargo Europe imported on average about 400,000 barrels a day of oil from Iran, according to the International Energy Agency. Cepsa alone was buying about 60,000 barrels a day. Total SA was among the biggest buyers and the French company is waiting to receive the Atlantas tanker later this month at its refinery in Le Havre. Other European top buyers in the past, including Repsol SA, Eni SpA and Hellenic Petroleum SA, have yet to purchase any. If all goes as Tehran has planned, the Middle Eastern country will boost its production back to the 3.6 million barrels a day it pumped in 2011. After the European embargo was imposed and the US tightened other sanctions, Iranian output dropped to about 2.8 million barrels a day. In February, the nation pumped 3 million barrels a day for the first time since July 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Algeciras, Spain: The Monte Toledo oil tanker covered the uneventful voyage from Iran to Europe with a haul of 1 million barrels of crude in just 17 days, but its journey has been four years in the making. On Sunday, the tanker became the first to deliver Iranian crude into Europe since mid-2012, when Brussels imposed an oil embargo in an attempt to force the Middle Eastern nation to negotiate the end of its nuclear programme. The ban was lifted in January as part of a broader deal that ended a decade of sanctions. The 275-metre tanker started offloading its cargo into a refinery owned by Cia Espanola de Petroleos, near Algeciras, a few miles from Gibraltar. By midday, the vessel had already pumped to shore about a fifth of its cargo. In southern Spain, the tanker’s arrival was met with little fanfare. It was a quiet Sunday at the refinery, and for the workers, the Monte Toledo is just one of the eight or so vessels they expect to receive this month. By the time the refinery has taken in all the Iranian crude, another tanker from Algeria will be already waiting. Nonetheless, there’s a wider significance. As the Monte Toledo started to pump to shore through two 21-inch floating hoses connected to a giant buoy and a 1.8km submarine pipeline, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani declared in Tehran that more oil exports “will be added soon.” Ali Tayebnia, the country’s minister of Economy and Finance, said that Iran’s oil exports will “soon return” to 2 million barrels a day. “Arrangements have been made for the return of Iran to the market,” he said according to Shana, the Oil Ministry’s news service. Around Europe, other tankers with Iranian oil are close behind the Monte Toledo. In February, 29 vessels loaded crude from the Middle Eastern nation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of those, three are heading toward Europe — the Eurohope tanker is sailing to Constanta, an oil port in Romania, and the Atlantas is on its way to France. Another one, the Distya Akula, is anchored at the mouth of the Suez Canal, and is likely to head into a Mediterranean port. The Monte Toledo and its companions are the vanguard in the return of Iran into the European oil market. Petro-Logistics SA, a Geneva-based tanker-tracking firm, estimated Iran exported in February about 1.4 million barrels a day, up 350,000 barrels a day from the average 2015 level. Although the increase falls short of the 500,000 barrels a day that Tehran had promised, there are signs that exports into Europe will pick up this month. “It does take a while to get those fields back up,” said Petro-Logistics director Daniel Gerber. “But I think they’re going to hit the increase of 500,000 barrels a day in March.” Seth Kleinman, head of energy research at Citigroup Inc in London, agreed, saying that in addition to higher export volumes this month, more countries were buying. “You see tankers going to Spain, Romania, Tanzania, France and the UAE,” he said. “You got an uptick to India in February too.” Still, hurdles remain. Lingering banking restraints mean some customers are finding it hard to transfer payments for Iranian crude and the National Iranian Oil Co. has offered to swap crude for gasoline to get deals done, according to local reports. Iran will want to win back customers in Europe, where Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other rival suppliers stepped in after the embargo was imposed. Tehran also faces a rival unknown four years ago: the US has started exporting crude and companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp are shipping American oil into refineries in the Mediterranean. Before the embargo Europe imported on average about 400,000 barrels a day of oil from Iran, according to the International Energy Agency. Cepsa alone was buying about 60,000 barrels a day. Total SA was among the biggest buyers and the French company is waiting to receive the Atlantas tanker later this month at its refinery in Le Havre. Other European top buyers in the past, including Repsol SA, Eni SpA and Hellenic Petroleum SA, have yet to purchase any. If all goes as Tehran has planned, the Middle Eastern country will boost its production back to the 3.6 million barrels a day it pumped in 2011. After the European embargo was imposed and the US tightened other sanctions, Iranian output dropped to about 2.8 million barrels a day. In February, the nation pumped 3 million barrels a day for the first time since July 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

President János Áder expressed Hungary’s keenness to support Egypt’s developmental efforts in a meeting with President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi in Budapest on Tuesday. El-Sisi has been on an official visit to the Hungarian capital since Monday, when he attended a summit for the Visegrád Group in which he tackled Egypt’s efforts to fight terrorism and block illegal immigration to Europe. Áder expressed during his meeting with El-Sisi following the summit his country’s keenness to extend its support to Egypt in all fields by exchanging expertise and fostering joint investments, a statement by the Egyptian presidency read. El-Sisi, from his side, said that Hungarian investments and industries currently have an opportunity to enter the Egyptian market and enjoy the country’s modern infrastructure and its access to African markets. The two leaders also discussed a number of regional and international issues of mutual concern, especially the developments in Libya, Afghanistan, as well as joint efforts to face the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic. Áder hailed Egypt’s role in consolidating stability in the Middle East and Africa as well as its efforts to combat illegal immigration, ensure co-existence among religions, and back peaceful solutions to the region’s crises. The Hungarian president stressed that his country fully understands the Egyptian stance towards the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the importance of the River Nile’s water to Egypt, affirming that settling the GERD dispute should enhance stability in the entire region. Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia recently expressed their readiness to engage in the African Union-sponsored negotiations to resolve their decade-long dispute over the mega dam Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile. In this regard, El-Sisi reiterated on Tuesday Egypt’s stance on the need to reach a legally binding agreement that regulates the filling and operation of the dam based on international law and the UN Security Council’s presidential statement, which was issued in mid-September, encouraging the three sides to return to the negotiation table of the AU. The two leaders also hailed the ongoing level of cooperation and coordination between Egypt and Hungary in the management of water resources, especially water treatment plants. Since 1926, Hungary’s manufacturer Ganz EEPM has delivered more than 200 complete pumping stations to Egypt, according to the company’s website. Áder also lauded Egypt’s recent steps regarding the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which led to consolidating calm between the Israeli and Palestinian sides and improving the Palestinians’ humanitarian conditions. Egypt, through diplomatic efforts, has urged the revival of the peace process between the Israeli and Palestinian sides to ensure Palestinians’ legitimate rights, ease regional tensions, and achieve stability in the Middle East. Such efforts included a meeting between El-Sisi and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett last month in Egypt, marking the first time an Israeli PM has made a visit to Egypt in a decade. Additionally, in May, Egypt sponsored a ceasefire deal between Israel and Palestinian factions within the Gaza Strip to end an 11-day episode of Israeli military aggression on Gaza, during which more than 250 Palestinians, including 66 children, were killed. Egypt also pledged $500 million for the reconstruction of Gaza in the aftermath of the Israeli attacks. Search Keywords: Short link:

Egyptian Foreign Minister and the UK Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly welcomed on Sunday recent progress in bilateral relations since the Egypt-UK free trade agreement went into force earlier this year, as well as the easing of the travel restrictions between the two countries. Shoukry also discussed various means of boosting Egyptian-British ties with Cleverly, who is on his first official visit to Egypt. The British minister's visit comes nearly a month after the UK removed Egypt from a travel red list, which imposes a mandatory 10-day quarantine at a hotel on visitors from Egypt to the kingdom due to coronavirus concerns. The free trade agreement, known as the association deal, was signed between Egypt and the UK in December 2020 to provide a platform to deepen trade and investment relations between the two countries after Brexit. The two ministers said the new developments would contribute to promoting tourism and investment between Cairo and London, a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry said. Shoukry expressed during the meeting Egypt's support for the efforts made by the UK to make the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) successful. The event is scheduled to be hosted in Glasgow in November. Egypt is hoping the conference's outcomes will push forward efforts to combat climate change, most significantly providing support to developing countries under the 2016 Paris agreement, Shoukry added. Shoukry noted that Egypt is looking forward to hosting the next session of the COP in 2022, adding that the country seeks to help boost international efforts to face climate change. Egypt has been selected as a nominee to host the UN Climate Change Conference COP 27, scheduled for November 2022.

President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi flew to the Greek Capital Athens on Tuesday to attend the ninth trilateral summit between Egypt, Greece, and Cyprus. During the summit, the three countries signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) covering energy cooperation. Last week, during the minister of electricity and renewable energy’s visit to Athens a MoU was signed to build an undersea cable connecting the Egyptian and Greek power grids. An almost identical MoU was signed between Egypt and Cyprus on Saturday, which will see the two countries exchange up to two gigawatts of electricity. The memoranda are all part of the Euro-Africa $4 billion interconnector project, an electricity highway connecting the national grids of Egypt, Cyprus and Greece via a 1396km submarine cable. The summit also saw the initialling of an agreement between the three states covering immigration. This week’s summit will build on the achievements of earlier summits, says Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady. The ninth trilateral summit is part of a cooperation mechanism launched in 2014 between Egypt, Greece, and Cyprus. The summits quickly turned into a broad alliance fostering cooperation across a range of economic, political, and strategic interests. During the sixth summit in Crete in 2018 the three countries decided to establish the East Mediterranean Gas Forum (EMGF). Headquartered in Cairo, EMGF also includes France, Italy, Jordan, Palestine, and Israel as members. During this week’s summit, President Al-Sisi held bilateral meetings with the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades to discuss economic and trade relations, and regional files of mutual concern. The 10th tripartite summit is scheduled for December. *A version of this article appears in print in the 21 October, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Short link:

Egypt's Arab Organisation for Industrialisation (AOI) set up a solar energy plant in Uganda's Tororo district, a photovoltaic power station with a capacity of 4MW. The solar panels being installed in the plant were produced by the AOI’s Arab Renewable Energy Company (ARECO), under the supervision of the government’s New and Renewable Energy Authority, Chairman of the AOI Abdel-Moneim El-Tarras said on Thursday. El-Tarras said the organisation is keen on exchanging expertise with Uganda and training technical workers on maintenance works. The AOI has an ambitious plan to secure all the needs of local and African markets from electricity based on solar energy, he added. The new plant is an expression of Egypt's keenness to boost cooperation with Nile Basin countries, he stated. El-Tarras underlined the importance of putting into effect President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi's directives concerning boosting cooperation with brotherly African countries in the industrialisation domain. The AOI chairman said the organisation mobilises all its manufacturing and technological potential to take part in development projects in Uganda and other African states. The organisation supports renewable energy projects through the Egyptian Initiative for Nile Basin Development, he said. Egypt has been involved in numerous development and infrastructure projects in Uganda and many African countries, including in the water, energy, and health fields. Earlier this week, Egypt inaugurated the AFri Egypt Medical Centre in Jinja, Uganda, as part of Egypt's efforts to bolster bilateral cooperation in various fields. Other projects Egypt is implementing in the continent include the construction of the $2.9 billion Julius Nyerere Hydropower Station and Dam project in Tanzania in cooperation between Egypt’s Arab Contractors and El-Sewedy Electric company. In late August, Egypt’s state-owned Arab Contractors announced that it has won a contract to establish a 150km-long road to the tune of 110 million euros in DR Congo. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry held a meeting in Tripoli on Thursday morning with interim Prime Minister Abdel-Hamid Dbeibah ahead of attending an international conference to support Libyan stability later today. According to a statement by the foreign ministry, Shoukry affirmed to Dbeibah, who is the head of Libya's Government of National Unity (GNU), Egypt’s support of all efforts aiming at fully implementing the roadmap agreed upon by Libyans and ensuring the exit of all military and armed foreign troops from the country. "This should come in a way that meets the aspirations of the Libyan people toward a better future and contributes to restoring Libyan security, stability, and territorial integrity and sovereignty," Shoukry said. Delegates from 31 countries and international organisations are participating in the conference, including the UN, the European Union, the Arab League, and the African Union. This includes Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Malta, Chad, Niger, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Russia, China, and DR Congo. The Tripoli conference comes two months ahead of planned parliamentary and presidential elections, which are scheduled for 24 December as part of the political roadmap agreed to by all Libyan parties in a United Nations-led peace process. Egypt has affirmed on several occasions the necessity of holding the Libyan elections on schedule, as a step toward ending the decade-long of conflict in the country. On Monday, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi stressed to German Chancellor Angela Merkel the necessity of moving forward with the political process in Libya, holding elections in the country in December, and the exit of all foreign forces from the country. In September, Libya's eastern-based parliament passed a no-confidence vote in the Libyan unity government, posing a new challenge for holding the planned elections. The vote, however, failed to secure the minimum legal threshold to oust the government. The Egyptian foreign minister stressed at the time that the roadmap agreed upon by the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum and supported by the UN Security Council remains as the approach adopted by the international community to end the conflict in Libya. Shoukry also met today with Libyan Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush as well as his counterparts from Tunisia, Algeria, Greece, and Chad on the sidelines of the conference. Bilateral relations Shoukry and Dbeibah also followed up during the meeting on developments of Egyptian-Libyan relations in light of the latest round of meetings of the Egyptian-Libyan joint higher committee in September. Dbeibah hailed Egypt’s role and supportive efforts to achieve stability in Libya, advance political settlement, and bring the views of Libyan parties closer. Search Keywords: Short link:

Egypt and Qatar aspire to promote economic cooperation amid recent rapprochement efforts between the two countries, according to Trade and Industry Minister Nevine Gamea and Qatar's Ambassador to Cairo Salem bin Mubarak Al-Shafi. Gamea and Al-Shafi met in Cairo on Friday in a new step toward developing their bilateral cooperation, which resumed after a-four-year-hiatus following the the signing of the Al-Ula reconciliation agreement earlier this year. Friday's meeting came on the heels of a series of recent high-level talks between officials from both countries, including a meeting in August between Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who agreed to continue consultation to boost bilateral relations. Gamea said during the meeting both countries' governments are exerting "intensive efforts" to achieve "further rapprochement" at the political and economic levels, a statement by the trade ministry read. The statement added that Gamea urged the translation of agreements between the two countries' political leadership into concrete projects that serve the interest of the two peoples. She also called for building on the "solid" ground laid by President El-Sisi and Qatari Emir Tamim to enhance the rates of trade exchange and develop joint investments. Gamea underscored the significance of establishing new frameworks for cooperation between Cairo and Doha in the commercial, investment and industrial fields as well as working on forming an Egyptian-Qatari trade committee to follow up on all projects of bilateral cooperation during the coming phase. She also stressed the importance of joint work between the two countries at the ministerial level to push bilateral relations to "unprecedented levels," the statement added. Gamea extended through the Qatari ambassador an invitation to the Qatar's Trade and Industry Minister Mohammad bin Hamad to visit Cairo "to discuss files and themes of joint work between the two countries during the next stage." For his part, the Qatari ambassador stressed that both countries share a common desire to start a new phase of bilateral cooperation in various fields, saying "Egypt represents a strategic depth for the countries of the region." Al-Shafi also called for boosting the rates of intra-regional trade and joint investments between Egypt and Qatar "to reflect the great potentials of both countries and to translate the distinguished relations that bind the two brotherly peoples," the statement added. "There is a consensus between the Egyptian and Qatari governments on a substantial number of cooperation files," the Qatari ambassador stressed. He also hailed the recent economic reforms and urban development in Egypt. He highlighted that Qatar has investments in the Egyptian market, especially in the financial and real estate sectors. The Arab quartet of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut all diplomatic ties and transport links with Qatar in June 2017, charging that Doha was too close to Iran and backed terrorist groups – allegations Doha has always denied. In January, Egypt and the Arab quartet signed the Al-Ula Declaration with Qatar, restoring diplomatic, economic and travel ties with Doha. In the wake of the Al-Ula declaration, Egypt and Qatar agreed to move beyond their disputes and work towards settling all outstanding issues. Three rounds of talks between the Egyptian-Qatari committee – tasked with developing relations between Cairo and Doha – were held throughout the year. Following the signing of the declaration, Qatar Airways and EgyptAir resumed flights between the two countries' capitals. Both countries exchanged ambassadors in the summer.

News article:
The United Kingdom’s Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly said that what Egypt has achieved in the energy field is revolutionary and has put Cairo on the path to achieving energy security. This also means that Egypt has many successful stories to tell during its participation in the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 26, Cleverly — who made his first visit to Cairo in mid-October — told Al-Ahram Daily newspaper in an interview published on Sunday. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi arrived on Sunday afternoon in Scotland to participate in the COP 26 summit slated for Monday and Tuesday in Glasgow under the chairmanship of the UK. Cleverly expressed his country’s pleasure that El-Sisi will attend the summit, saying that “Prime Minister Johnson will be very happy, as he takes the climate issue very seriously.” “We also have positive indications towards Egypt’s positions on the climate issue and environment in general,” he noted, adding that his country is already cooperating with Egypt in multiple energy and renewable energy projects. “I am confident that the climate issue is one of the most prominent fields in which we will closely cooperate for a better future for both Egypt and the UK,” he added. Egypt has advanced from 26th place in 2020 to the 20th among the world’s top 40 markets in the Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index for 2021. Under its 2030 vision, Egypt plans to increase the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources to 20 percent by 2022 and up to 42 percent by 2035, with wind providing 14 percent, hydropower 2 percent, photovoltaic 22 percent, and concentrated solar power 3 percent by 2035. Additionally, Cairo is working on a host of projects to preserve the environment by making use of the country’s plentiful natural gas production. The boom in the North African country’s gas production has been supported by huge gas discoveries and production in the Mediterranean. Including the Go Green initiative, Egypt has been exerting constant efforts to create and develop an environment-friendly industry by localising modern industrial technologies and creating professional technical cadres to fight pollution and reduce harmful emissions. Cleverly said that the UK is also interested in investing in renewables, referring to the newly signed deal between the UK’s Globeleq and the Egyptian government’s Benban Solar Energy Park. On 14 October, the British independent power producer Globeleq announced the acquisition of the ARC for Renewable Energy Plant at the Benban Solar Park near Aswan, Egypt. Cleverly confirmed that the UK is interested in investing in the energy field in Egypt after the Benban deal, adding that “Egypt is doing well in the field of energy, and it has a huge and promising future.” “We have a business sector and companies that are very enthusiastic to work in energy.” During his visit to Cairo, Cleverly held talks with a number of Egyptian ministers and officials, including Egyptian Transportation Minister Kamel El-Wazir. The British minister said that he discussed with El-Wazir investments opportunities in the transport sector’s infrastructure in Egypt. Transportation projects are so important for Egypt due to its jammed streets, Cleverly said. “I wandered across Cairo’s streets; It was so crowded. It is a huge challenge, and we have the same issue in London,” he added. “I also saw the development in the roads here [in Cairo], and I also saw several modes of transportation,” he said, stressing that the UK is very keen to continue to cooperate with Egypt in developing the transportation sector. Cleverly also discussed the decade-old dispute caused by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a controversial hydropower project that Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile, stressing that the UK understands the importance of the Nile to Egypt. “It is an existential matter,” he said. Moreover, he expressed his wish that Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia reach a deal through the negotiations. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Qatar’s ambassador in Cairo said that his country considers Egypt a fertile ground for investment in light of the unprecedented progress and the positive improvements the country is going through in all fields; particularly in the investment climate. Ambassador Salem bin Mubarak Al-Shafi made the comments during his meeting with Egypt’s Minister of Finance Mohamed Maait at the ministry's headquarters on Saturday. Qatari investments in Egypt significantly increased in FY2019/2020 by 77.8 percent to record $679.4 million, up from $382.2 million in FY2018/2019, according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). Trade exchange between the two countries also went up by 11.8 percent in 2020, compared to 2019, to post $22.7 million. Al-Shafi assumed his position as Qatar's new ambassador to Egypt in August after Cairo ended a four-year diplomatic and travel boycott of Doha under the Al-Ula reconciliation agreement, which was signed in January of this year. Officials from both countries have been holding consultation meetings since to explore ways of bolstering bilateral relations. Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Qatar’s Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani agreed in a meeting in Baghdad in August to continue consultation to boost bilateral relations during the coming period. The Qatari diplomat asserted his country's willingness to rejuvenate cooperation ties between Egypt and Qatar in all spheres in order to achieve mutual development for both countries, stressing the existence of the political will to that end. For his part, Maait stressed Egypt’s government has managed to create a healthy environment for foreign and local investments in different areas and provided promising investment opportunities in national and developmental mega projects. Egypt’s government plans to raise the private sector’s contribution to the country’s economic activity to 50 percent over the coming three years, Maait said. He also noted that the government fosters the private sector to expand its venture and productive activities as a key engine of Egypt’s economic growth. Under its Vision 2030, Egypt seeks to boost the private sector’s contribution to the GDP and attract further foreign investments. According to the latest figures, private sectors investments represented 52.5 percent of Egypt’s total investments in FY2018/2019. Maait told Al-Shafi that the government acts to enlarge the initial public offering (IPO) programme through listing more state-owned companies over the coming months for the sake of expanding their broad-based ownership and leaving an ample room for the private sector to invest in. Maait stated that the government’s economic reforms have improved the country's economic indicators and achieved the developmental and fiscal objectives during FY2020/2021. Accordingly, Egypt posted an initial surplus of 1.4 percent of the GDP, decreased the budget’s overall deficit to 7.4 percent, and achieved a 3.3 percent in real GDP growth, Maait expounded. On that basis, global finance and credit rating institutions reassured their confidence in Egypt’s economy’s solidness and its ability to counter both internal and external shocks, the minister added. Maait also reviewed with the Qatari ambassador his ministry's efforts to upgrade Egypt’s customs and tax systems in order to streamline the procedures in both systems for the investors, lay the foundation of tax justice in the business community, and engage the informal business in the formal economy. Maait pointed out that the application of the advanced cargo information (ACI) system in Egypt’s seaports would significantly reduce customs clearance measures, facilitate trade flow, and lure investment.

News article:
Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hasanein Egypt is exerting all efforts to combat extremism and terrorism during its presidency of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union (AU) this November. The AU announced that Egypt will chair the presidency of Peace and Security Council in light of Egypt's "diplomatic successes and efforts to play an effective role in supporting and strengthening the peace and security in the African continent." The Peace Council said that Egypt's efforts would focus on managing disasters in Africa and finding lasting solutions to confront challenges such as terrorism, illegal immigration, and the repercussions of climate change on continental peace and security. The Peace and Security Council is scheduled to discuss the report of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission on continental efforts to prevent and combat terrorism. The Council provides an opportunity for members to develop a strategy to enhance efforts to combat terrorism and extremism through its various research and studies centers. The Peace and Security Council is an organ of the African Union for the prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts and follows the model of the UN Security Council. It has 15 members with equal voting powers, elected by the AU Executive Council and endorsed by the AU Assembly during its ordinary sessions. Egypt holds the membership of the Council for the North African region between 2020 and 2022. Since assuming the presidency in 2019, Cairo has intensified its presence within the institutions of the Union and strengthened its relationship with the countries through initiatives and cooperation agreements covering all fields. Meanwhile, the Egyptian Armed Forces concluded Sunday three training programs delivered to 67 military personnel from 18 African states.

Egypt has inked seven development financing grant agreements with the US worth $125 million through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Minister of International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat announced on Monday. Al-Mashat, US Ambassador to Egypt Jonathan Cohen, and Mission Director of USAID Egypt Leslie Reed witnessed the signing. The signed agreements are expected to play a role in stimulating Egypt’s government efforts in developing the sectors of basic education, higher education, science and technology, agriculture, health, economic governance, trade, and investment, in addition to $5 million allocated for combating the repercussions of the pandemic, according to the minister. The agreements allocate $17 million to the sector of basic education; $31 million to the US-Egypt Higher Education Initiative (HEI); $4 million to US-Egyptian cooperation in the sector of science and technology; $27 million to economic governance; $5 million to agriculture and rural development; and $28 million to bolstering trade and investment in Egypt. Al-Mashat elaborated that the strategic partnership with the US integrates with the national efforts of developing various sectors to achieve social and economic development referring to the ‘Closing the Gender Gap Accelerator’ that was launched by the Ministry of International Cooperation, the National Council for Women, and the World Economic Forum, which is the first unique public-private collaboration model in Africa and the Middle East that works towards taking decisive action on closing economic gender gaps. The ministry is currently designing a new programme with USAID to ensure the economic and social empowerment of women in collaboration with relevant stakeholders in order to improve the work environment for women in the private sector, as well as expand women’s financial inclusion, according to Al-Mashat. “I am pleased to announce today $125 million in economic assistance from the United States to Egypt. This is part of the US Government’s $30 billion investment in Egypt over the last 40 years, which has brought clean water and wastewater services to 25 million Egyptians, eliminated polio, built 2,000 schools, and provided 4,000 university scholarships,” said Cohen. Meanwhile, USAID’s Reed stated that the seven agreements being celebrated reinforce the strategic partnership between the United States and Egypt and the tremendous impact that the joint efforts have on Egypt’s people, adding that she is looking forward to the successes that will be achieved through these agreements. Egypt’s cooperation portfolio with the USAID since 2014 has reached about $900 million in implementing priority projects in education, higher education, governance, small- and medium-sized enterprises, tourism, agriculture, and the private sector. The total development cooperation portfolio between Egypt and the USA since 1978 amounts to over $30 billion, covering various sectors that represent development priorities for Egypt’s government.

All international efforts must lead to the unconditional and simultaneous exit of all foreign forces from the oil-rich country without exception, Shoukry said at a meeting Saturday with United Nations Special Envoy for Libya Ján Kubiš. Kubiš is on an official visit to Egypt to participate in a meeting of Libya's 5+5 commission in Cairo to discuss means of expelling the foreign forces Libya. Shoukry stressed to Kubiš that the foreign presence is a “clear” threat to the sovereignty of the North African country, and has a “direct” impact on the security of Libya's neighbouring countries and regional stability. A UN report published in March said that the arms embargo imposed on Libya by the UN Security Council in 2011 remains "totally ineffective." Citing a Panel of Experts on Libya, the report added that civilians, including migrants and asylum seekers, continue to suffer widespread rights violations and abuses. The arms embargo aims to stem the violence that has affected Libya since 2011 when a NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi. Shoukry and Kubiš also stressed during today's meeting the importance of holding the Libyan parliamentary and presidential elections on time on 24 December in accordance with the political roadmap agreed upon and relevant UN resolutions, according to a statement released by the Egyptian foreign ministry. They warned against any attempt to delay the elections, saying such a step would have negative repercussions on Libyan security and stability, prolong the country's crisis and compound division. The long-awaited elections are supposed to help unify the country after years of conflict and division. In recent years, Libya has been split between two rival east and west-based administrations. Last year, the two camps signed a ceasefire in Geneva; earlier this year, an interim government was established through internationally sponsored negotiations to guide the country towards the December elections. Libya's 5+5 military mission, formed in early 2020, was the agreed third track to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign fighters from Libya. Additionally, Saturday's meeting witnessed a briefing from the UN envoy on the outcome of his recent contacts with all parties concerned with the Libyan situation. He expressed his appreciation of Egypt’s efforts to support the country’s stability and support the legitimate aspirations of its people. In recent months, Egypt hosted a host of meetings to bridge the gap between various Libyan parties and foster dialogue. Cairo has been pushing for a political settlement in Libya for years, a complete disarming of militias, an end to foreign intervention in the country as well as a fair distribution of wealth between various regions in the country.

Libyan renegade General Khalifa Haftar has sent his son to Israel to ask for political and military support, veteran Israeli journalist Yossi Melman revealed yesterday. Last Monday, a private jet took off from Dubai landed at Ben Gurion airport, Melman wrote in Haaretz. He added: "The plane was on the ground for about 90 minutes, and then continued on to its final destination in Libya," noting that it belonged "to the Libyan warlord Gen. Khalifa Haftar and is used to fly his family and aides." According to Melman, Saddan Haftar, the son of Khalifa Haftar, was on board and he met with Israeli security officials. However, Melman said it was not clear who Saddam had met with. Melman said that during his secret meeting, Saddam asked for military and political support as he is running in the presidential elections, noting that Libya would normalise ties with Israel should he win the presidency. The Israeli journalist said Khalifa Haftar has held several secret meetings with representatives from Israel's Mossad agency and from the Israeli National Security Council. Melman added that Israel has always been interested in Libya due to its geostrategic location on the Mediterranean, as it's Egypt's neighbour, and because it's home to a large Jewish community.

News article:
France is hosting an international conference on Libya on Friday as the North African country heads into long-awaited elections next month, a vote that regional and world powers hope will pull the oil-rich nation out of its decade-old chaos. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and several world leaders will take part in the Paris conference, and are expected to push for transparent, credible elections. They will also urge the withdrawal of mercenaries and foreign forces from Libya, as stated in last year's U.N.-brokered cease-fire that ended fighting between rival factions in the country. Libya has been engulfed in chaos since a NATO-backed uprising 2011 that toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. The oil-rich country was for years split between rival governments - one based in the capital, Tripoli, and the other in the eastern part of the country. Each side is backed by different foreign powers and militias. Friday's conference is co-chaired by France, Germany, Italy, Libya, and the United Nations, and attended by international and regional high-level officials. The participants are expected to push for an "indisputable and irreversible" election process, a joint commitment to fight trafficking of people and weapons through Libya. They also are expected to advocate for tangible efforts withdraw mercenaries and foreign troops, according to French President Emmanuel Macron's office. Harris said Monday she will take part in the conference "to demonstrate our strong support for the people of Libya as they plan for elections." Also expected to attend are Libyan leaders Mohamed el-Manfi, head of the presidential council, Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush. The conference comes less than six weeks before Libyans are scheduled to cast their ballots in the first round of the presidential elections on Dec. 24. Parliamentary elections are to take place nearly two months later, along with a second round of the presidential vote. The long-awaited vote, however, still faces challenges, including unresolved issues over election laws and occasional infighting among armed groups. Other obstacles include the deep rift that remains between the country's east and west and the presence of thousands of foreign fighters and troops. The U.N. has estimated that there have been at least 20,000 foreign fighters and mercenaries in Libya over the past few years, including Russians, Syrians, Turkish, Sudanese, and Chadians. A leading rights group questioned Thursday whether Libyan authorities can hold free and fair elections. Human Rights Watch criticized what it said were Libya's restrictive laws that undermine freedom of speech and association, as well as the presence of armed groups accused of intimidating, attacking and detaining journalists and political activists. "The main questions leaders at the summit should ask are: can Libyan authorities ensure an environment free of coercion, discrimination, and intimidation of voters, candidates, and political parties?" it said in a statement. In July, the U.N. special envoy for Libya, Jan Kubis, accused "spoilers" of trying to obstruct the vote to unify the divided nation. The Security Council has warned that any individual or group undermining the electoral process could face U.N. sanctions. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said this week, "We want to see an election which the Libyan people can believe in, that is credible, and that is in line with the past agreements." Politicians and warlords in western Libya issued statements this week opposing holding the vote according to the laws ratified by the country's parliament. Khaled al-Meshri, head of Tripoli-based Supreme Council of State, went further and threatened in televised comments to resort to violence to prevent powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter, a potential frontrunner in the presidential race, from taking office if he is elected. Libya's civil war escalated in 2019, as Hifter, who commands the self-styled Libyan Arab Armed Forces, launched an offensive to take Tripoli from armed militias loosely allied with the then U.N.-supported but weak government in the country's capital. Hifter, who was allied with an east-based administration, was backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and France. However, his 14-month campaign and march on Tripoli ultimately failed in June 2020, after Qatar and Turkey intensified their military support, with the latter sending mercenaries and troops to help shore up western Libya militias.

President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi stressed to Tunisian PM Najla Bouden on Friday Egypt's support for Tunisia and the efforts exerted by President Kais Saied and the newly formed government to achieve stability and development for the Tunisian people. The Egyptian president also conveyed to the Tunisian prime minister Egypt's readiness to both "harness all available capabilities to help Tunisia achieve security and development," and develop bilateral cooperation in order to consolidate the historical ties between the two countries. The Egyptian president and the Tunisian prime minister are in Paris to attend the international conference on Libya, which aims to ensure that the Libyan sides stick to the agreed upon plan to hold elections in December as a key step toward ending the decade-old crisis in the country. In October, President Saied appointed Bouden to head a new cabinet, nearly three months after he dismissed the government of Hichem Mechichi and suspended the activities of parliament. Egypt has repeatedly affirmed its support for Saied's decisions, calling them “historic." For her part, PM Bouden expressed appreciation for Egypt's support to her country as well as Egypt's "vital role in maintaining security and stability regionally," Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said. She said her country cherishes the "close and distinguished relations with Egypt at the formal and popular levels," expressing Tunisia's interest in "benefiting from the Egyptian success story under the inspiring leadership of the President El-Sisi" through bilateral coordination in all fields, especially in on the economic and security levels. The two sides affirmed the joint political will to strengthen the framework of cooperation, maximize communication channels, and exchange information on combating terrorism, Rady added. El-Sisi and Bouden also exchanged views on a number of regional issues of mutual interest, including the latest developments on Libya. They agreed to boost Egyptian-Tunisian coordination to end the crisis in Libya, given that both countries share borders with the country, and also in light of the fact that Tunisia is the current representative of Arab countries on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). They stressed that such coordination aligns with the will of the Libyan people by backing national institutions and efforts to achieve security and stability, as well as preserve the unity and sovereignty of Libya. El-Sisi and Bouden also emphasised the importance of implementing the relevant UN and international decisions in terms of holding the Libyan elections on time and the exit of all foreign forces and mercenaries from Libya. El-Sisi and Bouden also tackled the latest development concerning the decade-old dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). The Egyptian president thanked Tunisia for supporting the Egyptian stance on the importance of reaching a comprehensive and legally binding agreement on filling and operating the Renaissance Dam. In September, the UNSC adopted a Tunisia-drafted presidential statement encouraging Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia "to resume negotiations" to swiftly reach a "mutually acceptable and binding agreement on the filling and operation" of the GERD.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi discussed means of developing Egypt-France military cooperation during a meeting with French Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly in Paris on Friday. El-Sisi, who is visiting France to participate in the international Paris conference on Libya, expressed to Parly his appreciation for the strategic relations between Egypt and France in different domains, especially on security and military matters. The Egyptian president stressed that the forces fighting terrorism need to unify and coordinate their efforts to guarantee a strong and effective response to the threat, Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said. For her part, Parly stressed her country's keenness to strengthen partnership with Egypt, particularly military cooperation within the framework of joint counter-terrorism efforts. Egypt is a key pillar of security and stability in the Middle East and Africa, Parly told El-Sisi. The two sides agreed to intensify consultation and coordination to confront and undermine the threat of terrorism, and prevent the movement of terrorists from tension spots to other areas, which threatens security in the region and particularly in North Africa and the Sahel. Both sides agreed on the necessity of supporting the political track to end the crisis in Libya and adhering to the planned timetable for the presidential and parliamentary elections in the country - set to take place on 24 December - in order to hand over power to a legitimate, elected authority by the free will of the Libyan people. They also highlighted that such a step will herald a new page in Libyan history, help restoring the country's national institutions, security and stability, and expel foreign forces from Libyan soil, the statement added.

News article:
Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told the Paris Conference on Libya Friday that holding the elections in Libya on schedule in December will enable the Libyan people "to express their free will" and derail the efforts of those "seeking narrow goals." “Our meeting today comes at a time when the situation in Libya is moving toward what is better - as the political process is passing through a decisive stage that aims to crown the international and regional efforts by holding elections on their scheduled date in December,” the Egyptian president told regional and international leaders in Paris. The Paris conference is being organised by the United Nations, with the participation of regional and world leaders, as the North African country is heading into the long-awaited elections on 24 December. The participants in the conference include French President Macron; Libya's Prime Minister Abdel-Hamid Dbeibah; and the Head of Libya's Presidential Council, Mohamed Menfi. They also include Tunisian Prime Minister Najla Bouden; German Chancellor Angela Merkel; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov; Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi; the UN envoy to Libya Ján Kubiš; and the US Vice President Kamala Harris. El-Sisi expressed in his speech to the conference his hope that the long-awaited Libyan elections are carried out successfully in a way that “befits the deep-rootedness of the brotherly Libyan people,” and allows their country to restore its active Arab and regional role. "Holding the elections will enable our Libyan brothers to express their free will and derail the efforts of those who wish to jump over this entitlement in pursuit of narrow goals that are far removed from the supreme interests of Libya." "If we do not pay attention, this could lead to the outbreak of public fury that can lead us back to to square one, which we don't wish to happen,” the Egyptian president warned. He praised the measures taken by the Libyan Presidential Council and the Government of National Unity (GNU) to prepare for elections. He also praised the "great efforts" of the Libyan Parliament and coordination with Libya’s High Electoral Commission to hold the polls. Binding timeframe for ending foreign military presence The Egyptian president urged the Paris conference to set a “clear and binding timeframe” for the exit of all foreign troops and fighters from the country, as well as all mercenaries who entered Libya after 2011. He also urged agreement among the participants in the conference on mechanisms and guarantees to implement the decisions reached on the issue of the exit of foreign troops and fighters. El-Sisi also commended the “sincere and patriotic” endeavours of the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission (JMC) to implement its plans towards freeing Libya from foreign troops. The conference’s position “should be clear and unambiguous in rejecting the continuation of the status quo. " "It should condemn the continued violation of international decisions on the necessity of ending all forms of foreign military presence in Libya,” El-Sisi said. “This should be done in order to prevent matters from sliding backwards in a way similar to what happened in many previous stages,” he stressed. The presence of foreign troops and mercenaries on the Libyan territories violates the UN Security Council’s decisions 2570-2571 and the conclusions of the Berlin 2 Conference, which were agreed upon regionally and internationally, El-Sisi said. The foreign military presence in Libya also violates the decisions of the Arab League, the African Union, and neighbouring countries on the necessity of withdrawing all foreign troops and mercenaries from Libya “without any exceptions or further stalling." “Libya cannot restore its sovereignty, unity, and the desired stability without seriously dealing with the main issue obstructing this: the presence of foreign forces, mercenaries, and foreign troops on its soil,” El-Sisi affirmed. Egyptian support to a unified, free Libya El-Sisi urged Libyan people to “dismiss from your country every foreigner and intruder, no matter how much they claim that their presence is good for you." The Egyptian president affirmed Egypt’s readiness to provide all forms of support to Libya to implement the plan of the JMC to end the presence of foreign troops on Libyan soil, unify state institutions, and build capacities so that Libyans “can reclaim their resources and be able to decide their fate and chart their future.” "Rise to the occasion" He urged all actors inside and outside Libya to "rise to the occasion" and "act responsibly and rationally” in a way that helps Libya get through its crisis and end its people’s suffering. El-Sisi warned against some “attempts by parties inside and outside Libya to undermine any progress regarding this path under false pretexts." El-Sisi said those parties should “drop their aspirations of expansion; imposing their influence; and tampering with the resources and security of others." They should also stop “the policy of imposing a fait accompli using military or physical force; providing safe havens or any other form of support to terrorist and extremist groups; and transferring their elements from one country to another,” El-Sisi added.

News article:
It has been a decade since one of the largest mass expressions of frustration, the Arab Spring, rocked foundations across the Middle East and North Africa. In the decade since, the path forward has not always been direct or clear. I had the privilege of leading Tunisia as prime minister for more than three years. It was a challenging but rewarding time. In my efforts to help build a sustainable democracy in Tunisia, I knew that reliable neighbors were essential. I was particularly concerned about the state of Libya, our neighbor. I knew then, and I feel even more strongly now, that a stable and prosperous Libya is important for the Libyan people and the broader region. Following the 2011 revolution and for far too long, Libya has been used as a tool for destabilization and a breeding ground for radical ideologues pushing division, violence and terrorism. The trade routes that once benefited both our countries were essentially cut off. Sadly, aspirations for democratic self-determination in Libya were stymied or squashed against the wishes of the people, fueling a cycle of hopelessness, distrust and apathy. Today, only a stable, prosperous and democratic Libya can help to counter this trend of despair and instead inspire hope. A new future is within reach in Libya following U.N.-sponsored talks in Geneva. Democratic elections are set for Dec. 24. These elections must proceed and must succeed. And for that I believe that there's an urgent need to focus on the Libyan national reconciliation and the quest of consensus within the Libyan political class before the election. This will help to avoid having the election be contested or not recognized. The ultimate goal is to create a true democracy in Libya and not a democracy by name only—which provides nothing—a part constitutional deadlock. Democracy needs content to survive and evolve. As a chief of government, I worked hard to facilitate mobility between the two countries. Millions of people used to cross the borders and trade between Tunisia and Libya was flourishing. Nowadays and following the COVID-19 outbreak, the borders with Libya's neighbors, including Tunisia, are beginning to reopen. What's more, regional cooperation is beginning again. Recently, the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission held a meeting in Egypt for the U.N. mission and representatives of Libyan neighbors including Sudan, Chad and Niger to discuss the process of removing foreign fighters from Libyan territories. This is significant. It is clear that Libya, and the region, is focused on creating conditions that favor peace and stability. A democratic Libya would benefit all its neighbors, from those who share its borders to those across the Mediterranean. Libya's close proximity to Spain, France, Italy and Greece provides an opportunity to reset immigration trends, with a focus on legal, safe and ethical treatment and processing of migrants. Only through a stable and prosperous Libya will there be enough resources and political will to meet this moment. Not only will a stable Libya protect the rights of migrants, but it will also help reduce the elevated level of immigration from North Africa, as Libya becomes an increasingly desirable place to live and work. There is no denying that climate change is upon us, and the constraints from extreme weather events are only growing. Libya is in a unique position, one where we can capitalize on old forms of energy production while investing heavily in new renewable forms of production. With incredible potential for solar and wind power generation, Libya is poised to be a valued energy partner to Europe, especially as it has to deal with an increasingly untrustworthy supplier to the European Union's east. Libya has the capabilities to address both short-term needs while advancing future forms of energy production—but that can only be unlocked by a democratic reunification of Libya. Without a democratic republic, accountability is unlikely, and Libya's economic engines will continue to only serve a minority. The message a democratic Libya would send to the world's oppressed people cannot be overstated. It would lift up the voiceless, empower the people and show an alternative to violence—creating the environment to de-radicalize individuals and inspire others throughout the region to build their own democratic state. Through unlocking the aspirations of the people, Libya, and in time the region, will build a new age of prosperity and engagement. Finally, a stable Libya provides a buttress against foreign influence in the region. Some countries see their foreign policy best served by keeping countries in the Middle East and North Africa weak, fractious and easily influenced—but these conditions are not advantageous to any other good-faith actor in the region. Building regional resilience is vitally necessary to prevent these influences from growing. As I said when I was prime minister, when democracy flourishes in Libya, so too will stability, transparency and accountability throughout the region. With a stable economy and a strengthened private sector, Libya will be able to engage on equal footing with European and African partners like Tunisia, set an example to others in the region and build hope for the future. A stable Libya will have the capability to not only defend but advance human rights, build prosperity and be an engine for positive development across the region well into the future. That's why Libya's stability is about more than Libya. Youssef Chahed is the former prime minister of Tunisia. The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.

In the decade since, the path forward has not always been direct or clear. I had the privilege of leading Tunisia as prime minister for more than three years. It was a challenging but rewarding time. In my efforts to help build a sustainable democracy in Tunisia, I knew that reliable neighbors were essential. I was particularly concerned about the state of Libya, our neighbor. I knew then, and I feel even more strongly now, that a stable and prosperous Libya is important for the Libyan people and the broader region. Following the 2011 revolution and for far too long, Libya has been used as a tool for destabilization and a breeding ground for radical ideologues pushing division, violence and terrorism. The trade routes that once benefited both our countries were essentially cut off. Sadly, aspirations for democratic self-determination in Libya were stymied or squashed against the wishes of the people, fueling a cycle of hopelessness, distrust and apathy. Today, only a stable, prosperous and democratic Libya can help to counter this trend of despair and instead inspire hope. A new future is within reach in Libya following U.N.-sponsored talks in Geneva. Democratic elections are set for Dec. 24. These elections must proceed and must succeed. And for that I believe that there's an urgent need to focus on the Libyan national reconciliation and the quest of consensus within the Libyan political class before the election. This will help to avoid having the election be contested or not recognized. The ultimate goal is to create a true democracy in Libya and not a democracy by name only—which provides nothing—a part constitutional deadlock. Democracy needs content to survive and evolve. As a chief of government, I worked hard to facilitate mobility between the two countries. Millions of people used to cross the borders and trade between Tunisia and Libya was flourishing. Nowadays and following the COVID-19 outbreak, the borders with Libya's neighbors, including Tunisia, are beginning to reopen. What's more, regional cooperation is beginning again. Recently, the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission held a meeting in Egypt for the U.N. mission and representatives of Libyan neighbors including Sudan, Chad and Niger to discuss the process of removing foreign fighters from Libyan territories. This is significant. It is clear that Libya, and the region, is focused on creating conditions that favor peace and stability. A democratic Libya would benefit all its neighbors, from those who share its borders to those across the Mediterranean. Libya's close proximity to Spain, France, Italy and Greece provides an opportunity to reset immigration trends, with a focus on legal, safe and ethical treatment and processing of migrants. Only through a stable and prosperous Libya will there be enough resources and political will to meet this moment. Not only will a stable Libya protect the rights of migrants, but it will also help reduce the elevated level of immigration from North Africa, as Libya becomes an increasingly desirable place to live and work. There is no denying that climate change is upon us, and the constraints from extreme weather events are only growing. Libya is in a unique position, one where we can capitalize on old forms of energy production while investing heavily in new renewable forms of production. With incredible potential for solar and wind power generation, Libya is poised to be a valued energy partner to Europe, especially as it has to deal with an increasingly untrustworthy supplier to the European Union's east. Libya has the capabilities to address both short-term needs while advancing future forms of energy production—but that can only be unlocked by a democratic reunification of Libya. Without a democratic republic, accountability is unlikely, and Libya's economic engines will continue to only serve a minority. The message a democratic Libya would send to the world's oppressed people cannot be overstated. It would lift up the voiceless, empower the people and show an alternative to violence—creating the environment to de-radicalize individuals and inspire others throughout the region to build their own democratic state. Through unlocking the aspirations of the people, Libya, and in time the region, will build a new age of prosperity and engagement. Finally, a stable Libya provides a buttress against foreign influence in the region. Some countries see their foreign policy best served by keeping countries in the Middle East and North Africa weak, fractious and easily influenced—but these conditions are not advantageous to any other good-faith actor in the region. Building regional resilience is vitally necessary to prevent these influences from growing. As I said when I was prime minister, when democracy flourishes in Libya, so too will stability, transparency and accountability throughout the region. With a stable economy and a strengthened private sector, Libya will be able to engage on equal footing with European and African partners like Tunisia, set an example to others in the region and build hope for the future. A stable Libya will have the capability to not only defend but advance human rights, build prosperity and be an engine for positive development across the region well into the future. That's why Libya's stability is about more than Libya. Youssef Chahed is the former prime minister of Tunisia. The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.

A delegation of the Peace and Security Council during its visit to Mogadishu (Egyptian Foreign Ministry) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat A Delegation of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU), chaired by Egypt, has concluded a visit to Mogadishu, Somalia. Discussions during the visit focused on bolstering the AU's support to ensure stability in Somalia amid the parliamentary elections. Talks also covered the fate of the troops of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). The visit commenced on Nov.8 and was concluded on Nov. 10; it was led by Egypt's Ambassador to Ethiopia and Permanent Representatives to the African Union Mohamed Gad, according to a statement issued by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. The delegation met with several officials from the Somali government, including President of Somalia Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo and Prime Minister of Somalia Mohamed Hussein Roble. It also convened with Head of AMISOM Francisco Madeira in addition to holding other meetings with the UN mission, foreign missions, and representatives of the civil community and women. The statement said the delegation discussed the political and security developments in the country. Discussions also highlighted means to reach a joint understanding among the federal government, the AU, and the UN towards the arrangements related to AMISOM. AMISOM is expected to withdraw from the country by the end of this year, according to security reports. The AMISOM troops consist of more than 19,000 soldiers and 1,000 policemen. This step represents a red flag since it indicates the return of Al-Shabaab militant group, affiliated with al-Qaeda, as revealed by the Institute for Security Studies (ISS).

Building ties between Libya and Israel will be discussed later, Sama news agency reported Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh saying yesterday on the sidelines of the Paris conference on Libya. According to the news site, an Israeli reporter asked Dbeibeh who is possible for establishing ties with Israel and the latter said that the Libyan people should make the decision on this issue. "This issue would be discussed later on," he said. It is worth noting that the renegade Libyan General Khalifa Haftar and Saiful Islam Al Gaddafi, who are looking to run in the presidential election, have already made their way to Israel in order to get its support in the elections. Haftar, Sama said, has already pledged to normalise ties with Israel should he became president. Some 30 countries and organisations took part in the Paris conference in France on Friday; however Israel, Greece and Cyprus were not invited. Representing Libya was the internationally recognised PM Dbeibeh and the head of the Presidential Council Khalid Al-Mishri. The conference aimed at ensuring Libya sticks to a plan to hold elections in December and turn a new page in its history. Algeria FM: 'Normalisation with Israel irresponsible'

News article:
The thaw between Cairo and Doha is being felt most in the economic arena, writes Gamal Essam El-Din Following January’s signing of the Al-Ula agreement which signalled an end to the rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt, Egyptian-Qatari rapprochement has been among the fastest to develop. On 1 November, President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi met with Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani on the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It was their second meeting in two months, the first having taken place in late August during the Baghdad Conference on Cooperation and Partnership. The Glasgow meeting was followed by EgyptAir opening a new office in the Qatari capital Doha. EgyptAir’s chairman, Amr Abul-Enein, said “the opening of an EgyptAir office in Doha is a further sign that Egypt-Qatar relations are getting back to normal.” Meanwhile, the ambassadors of Qatar and Egypt have been holding meetings with officials in both countries to promote investment. Following a meeting with Qatari Ambassador to Cairo Salem bin Mubarak Al-Shafi on 22 October, Nevine Gamea, the minister of trade and industry, said the governments of Egypt and Qatar were engaged in “intensive efforts to further political and economic rapprochement”. “We want to push trade exchange higher and boost joint investments between the two countries,” said Gamea. “We have already agreed to form a joint trade committee to examine and follow-up on potential joint investments.” During the meeting Gamea extended an invitation to Qatar’s Trade and Industry Minister Mohamed bin Hamad to visit Cairo to discuss further cooperation. Al-Shafi said Egypt and Qatar are both seeking to consolidate bilateral cooperation. “Egypt offers strategic depth to all countries of the region,” said Al-Shafi. He went on to highlight existing Qatari investments in Egypt, particularly in the financial and real estate sectors, adding that Doha “is serious about pushing them to higher levels”. Immediately following the Al-Ula Agreement an official Qatari delegation visited Cairo to inaugurate a $1.3 billion luxury hotel. Mohamed Abdel-Hamid, deputy chairman of parliament’s Economic Affairs Committee, notes that during the four-year rift between Egypt and Qatar, Qatari investment in-flows continued. “Despite tense relations with Qatar and Turkey — the two main supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood — in recent years, Egypt never adopted an aggressive attitude towards the two countries’ investors.” Semi-official figures suggest that during the years of boycott between Cairo and Doha, Qatar invested around $5 billion in Egypt, mainly in the real estate sector. The Qatari company Diar, which is behind the St Regis Hotel complex in Cairo, maintained Egyptian projects worth $3 billion, while Qatar Petroleum had a major stake in $4.4 billion Egyptian Refining Company which was launched in 2019. Restoring full relations with Qatar will clear the path for increased Qatari investments in Egypt, particularly in the real estate, tourism, petroleum, energy, and banking sectors, says Abdel-Hamid. “Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund has an estimated $300 billion, and private Qatari investors are interested in the Egyptian market which has already attracted large investments from oil-rich Arab Gulf countries,” he said. During a meeting with Minister of Finance Mohamed Maait on 30 October, Al-Shafi said “Egypt has taken measures which make the investment climate very attractive, and we are keen to tap this field.” Maait said Egypt had created an attractive environment for foreign and local investors in national and mega development projects and “the government plans to push the contribution of the private sector — both local and foreign — to economic growth to over 50 per cent in the coming three years.” He added that “Qatari investors could tap into the privatisation when the government acts to enlarge the initial public offering programme by listing more state-owned companies in the coming months.” On 21 October, Minister of Transport Kamel Al-Wazir met with his Qatari counterpart Jassim bin Saif Al-Sulaiti to discuss cooperation between the two countries. Al-Wazir said Egypt would welcome cooperation in the field of maritime transport as the country transforms itself into a hub for global trade and logistics. On 25 October, Egypt’s Ambassador to Doha Amr Al-Sherbini met with Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad Al-Muraikhi to discuss ways to boost bilateral cooperation. Despite the thaw in relations between Egypt and Qatar, many in Egypt remain wary of Qatar because of its connections with the Muslim Brotherhood, and the negative coverage Cairo receives from Doha-based Al-Jazeera. Yosri Al-Moghazi, deputy chairman of parliament’s Arab Affairs Committee, said that “though Egypt and Qatar have adopted a pragmatic approach recently, concerns remain over Qatar’s alliance with Muslim Brotherhood and political Islam.” “Cairo’s policy right now is to foster mutually beneficial cooperation with Qatar in the economic and investment spheres, while moving more cautiously on the political front.” Al-Moghazi believes Al-Jazeera’s coverage was a major reason Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain imposed a blockade on Qatar. “Although the four countries have now restored relations with Qatar Al-Jazeera’s activities remain taboo.” In August, Al-Jazeera began broadcasting live from Cairo for the first time in eight years. Yet sources agree the channel remains suspect because of its negative coverage of events Egypt. “Al-Jazeera is still blacklisted, and its website remains blocked inside Egypt,” said a media source who asked not to be identified. He pointed out that for Al-Jazeera to operate officially in Egypt it must be licensed by the Higher Council for Media Regulation, and for this to happen the channel “needs to radically alter its coverage of Egypt and refrain from defending Islamist movements, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood”. *A version of this article appears in print in the 18 November, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

During a meeting with Minister of Finance Mohamed Maait on 30 October, Al-Shafi said “Egypt has taken measures which make the investment climate very attractive, and we are keen to tap this field.” Maait said Egypt had created an attractive environment for foreign and local investors in national and mega development projects and “the government plans to push the contribution of the private sector — both local and foreign — to economic growth to over 50 per cent in the coming three years.” He added that “Qatari investors could tap into the privatisation when the government acts to enlarge the initial public offering programme by listing more state-owned companies in the coming months.” On 21 October, Minister of Transport Kamel Al-Wazir met with his Qatari counterpart Jassim bin Saif Al-Sulaiti to discuss cooperation between the two countries. Al-Wazir said Egypt would welcome cooperation in the field of maritime transport as the country transforms itself into a hub for global trade and logistics. On 25 October, Egypt’s Ambassador to Doha Amr Al-Sherbini met with Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad Al-Muraikhi to discuss ways to boost bilateral cooperation. Despite the thaw in relations between Egypt and Qatar, many in Egypt remain wary of Qatar because of its connections with the Muslim Brotherhood, and the negative coverage Cairo receives from Doha-based Al-Jazeera. Yosri Al-Moghazi, deputy chairman of parliament’s Arab Affairs Committee, said that “though Egypt and Qatar have adopted a pragmatic approach recently, concerns remain over Qatar’s alliance with Muslim Brotherhood and political Islam.” “Cairo’s policy right now is to foster mutually beneficial cooperation with Qatar in the economic and investment spheres, while moving more cautiously on the political front.” Al-Moghazi believes Al-Jazeera’s coverage was a major reason Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain imposed a blockade on Qatar. “Although the four countries have now restored relations with Qatar Al-Jazeera’s activities remain taboo.” In August, Al-Jazeera began broadcasting live from Cairo for the first time in eight years. Yet sources agree the channel remains suspect because of its negative coverage of events Egypt. “Al-Jazeera is still blacklisted, and its website remains blocked inside Egypt,” said a media source who asked not to be identified. He pointed out that for Al-Jazeera to operate officially in Egypt it must be licensed by the Higher Council for Media Regulation, and for this to happen the channel “needs to radically alter its coverage of Egypt and refrain from defending Islamist movements, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood”. *A version of this article appears in print in the 18 November, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

Egypt’s Universal Health Insurance System (UHIS) is a pioneering project and a model for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to follow, said French Ambassador to Egypt Marc Baréty. Baréty made his comments during a meeting held on Tuesday with Mohamed Maait — Egypt’s minister of finance and the chairman of the UHIS’s authority in the ministry’s headquarters in Cairo. The ambassador also said that France is eager to boost cooperation with Egypt across all fields and to support the country’s development plans; particularly in the transportation field and the UHIS. During the meeting, Maait told Baréty that President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi instructed the government to extend the UHIS’s umbrella to cover all governorates in 10 years instead of 15, adding that its first phase is expected to be done by June. On a macroeconomic level, the minister told Baréty that Egypt is aiming to achieve a sustainable economic growth rate that ranges between six and seven percent over the coming years under Egypt’s 2030 Vision. He also told him that the government plans to accelerate its initial public offering programme by listing more state-owned companies in the Egyptian Exchange over the coming months for the sake of expanding the ownership base of these companies, especially by the private sector. Furthermore, the minister showcased Egypt’s efforts in terms of its economic reforms that enabled the country to be resilient against economic shocks, adding that Egypt’s leadership is significantly keen on creating an investment climate in the country in which Egyptian and foreign private sector companies can play a role in the country’s mega development projects. These efforts also aim to attract more foreign direct investments to the domestic market, including giving incentives to French companies to expand their businesses in Egypt, Maait told Baréty. Additionally, the minister mentioned the pro-active containment measures that Egypt took to contain the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic, which required two percent of the country’s GDP to execute. On 21 September, Baréty assumed his position as the French ambassador to Egypt, succeeding Stéphane Romatet. In a statement published by MENA, a number of French economists said that Egypt’s economic reforms have fostered an investment-friendly environment and enhanced the country’s GDP growth. They also noted that exchanging visits between senior officials and heads of the major companies in both countries aims to push forward bilateral investments and trade exchange, according to the statement. French investments in the Egyptian market amounted to around €5 billion in 2020, according to the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Egypt. There is a total of 165 French companies currently operating in Egypt that have around 38,000 employees. Moreover, trade exchange between France and Egypt has reached €3 billion, which mainly includes food products, medicine, construction, telecommunications, environment, tourism, renewable energy, and automotive manufacturing, according to the chamber.

News article:
On 12 November, Egypt took part in the Paris International Conference on Libya, jointly chaired by Germany, France, and Italy. It was Egypt’s third participation in a major international conference on Libya. President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi also attended the two Berlin conferences on Libya in January 2020 and in June this year. Egypt has also hosted related technical activities on Libya, including meetings of the Constitutional Committee and the 5+5 Joint Military Committee, and sponsored activities related to the economic track and social tracks, including meetings of the Libyan Tribes Forum. These contributions reflect how closely involved Egypt is in the Libyan question. At the Paris conference, President Al-Sisi presented Cairo’s position on Libya, reaffirming fixed principles that include the need to rebuild state institutions which collapsed in the decade following Muammar Gaddafi’s fall. As the country plunged into civil strife Libya became the playground militias, organised crime rings, terrorists and foreign fighters and mercenaries. “The restoration of lasting stability, the realisation of social peace, and the preservation of the national fabric and identity of Libya involves certain mandatory prerequisites. These are to achieve the comprehensive national reconciliation of all Libyan people, to attend to the just distribution of wealth in order to promote comprehensive development across all Libyan regions and to stimulate the economy and ensure the optimum benefit from Libya’s resources so as to meet the aspirations of its people,” said President Al-Sisi. Another prerequisite is to enable Libya to regain its national sovereignty, something which President Al-Sisi said will not happen “until we deal seriously with the presence of mercenaries and foreign fighters on Libyan territory”. The Paris conference served as an expression of international and regional will to eliminate obstacles to the restoration of stability in Libya. Shortly before the conference, Egypt hosted a meeting between Libya’s southern neighbours and the 5+5 Joint Military Committee (JMC) in order to lay the foundations for the restoration of security in southern Libya where tensions and disorder continue to shape an environment conducive to terrorists, foreign mercenaries and fighters and rebel groups. Egypt will soon host a second round of this track. Another major concern President Al-Sisi addressed in Paris was the forthcoming legislative and presidential elections in Libya. He lauded the resolute steps the Libyan Presidency Council, cabinet, and the High Electoral Commission have taken towards this critical juncture, and called on Libyan political forces to set aside narrow factional interests for the sake of the country. Failure to do this “will create a state of popular anger that could cast the situation back to square one,” he said, alluding to Libyan parties that have been working to obstruct the electoral process to further personal and factional ends. Appealing to the Libyans’ patriotic spirit, Al-Sisi said: “The time has come for you, the descendants of Omar Al-Mukhtar, to seek inspiration from the resolve of your forefathers, who made the dearest and most precious sacrifices for the sake of freedom and national self-determination, and expel every foreign interloper regardless of how much they claim their presence is good for you. It is in your own hands to bring good, as long as you overcome your differences and summon the resolve to build your country through the exercise of Libyan free will.” Egypt expects conditions to improve in Libya if it can pass the critical test of legislative and presidential elections on 24 December. Improvement hinges, however, on the continued shift in the balance of forces towards those that favour peace. This is why Egypt has been working impartially, without backing any candidate or side, to help Libyans not just hold free and fair elections but also to accept the result of the polls. A successful Libyan electoral process will relieve Cairo of many political burdens, especially given most of the prominent candidates for president have good relations with Egypt. Turkey’s reluctance to remove the thousands of mercenaries it introduced into Libya remains a major problem. Ankara’s evasiveness was manifested in its reservation on the point regarding the evacuation of foreign fighters and mercenaries in the resolutions adopted in the Berlin II conference, and reflected in the low level of its participation in the Paris conference where it was represented by its deputy foreign minister. French President Emmanuel Macron pointedly mentioned both Russia and Turkey in regard to the problem of foreign mercenaries, though of the two Russia was the more constructive. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a press conference following his visit to Paris on 12 November that Moscow was ready to help remove forces linked to the Russian Wagner Group on condition it is “complete, phased, gradual, and synchronised with regard to both the supporters of Libya’s west and east.” The same principle has also been stressed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The removal of mercenaries and foreign forces will take time, and Cairo rests hopes the Libyan elections will produce an authority capable of taking matters firmly in hand. In terms of Libyan security and national sovereignty, this involves the reunification of the military establishment, the tightening of control over Libya’s borders, and resolve on the part of the government and legislature to take the measures necessary to end the foreign military presence in their country. Egypt is hoping Libya will succeed in safeguarding and building on the political gains made since the October 2020 signing of the ceasefire. Though subsequent progress has been slower than desired, conditions have still improved considerably. There have been a number of interim phases, of which the latest is by far the most hopeful militarily, politically and economically. There have, of course, been bumps along the way, but Egypt trusts this will be the last interim phase on the way to lasting stability. *A version of this article appears in print in the 18 November, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

The roadmap is the outcome of a high-level regional conference held in the Egyptian capital in late 2018 The African Union's (AU) Peace and Security Council (PSC) unanimously approved during a meeting on Sunday an Egyptian document detailing how to reinforce the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping process, according to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry. The PSC's meeting was presided over by Egypt's Ambassador to Addis Ababa and its Permanent Representative to the AU Osama Abdel-Khalek. The document, named Cairo Roadmap, is the outcome of a high-level regional conference held in the Egyptian capital in late 2018, and was ratified during a meeting of the African defence ministers held in Cairo in December 2019, Abdel-Khalek said. The Cairo Roadmap presents a number of recommendations, introduced by the African states and forged by Egypt, to support the UN chief's initiative for peacekeeping and to preserve the interests of African countries that contribute the most to UN peacekeeping forces, including Egypt, which ranked seventh among contributing states. The roadmap includes four main axes to enhance the performance of UN peacekeeping missions, he added. Egypt assumed the chairmanship of AU Peace and Security Council earlier this month.

The roadmap is the outcome of a high-level regional conference held in the Egyptian capital in late 2018 The African Union's (AU) Peace and Security Council (PSC) unanimously approved during a meeting on Sunday an Egyptian document detailing how to reinforce the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping process, according to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry. The PSC's meeting was presided over by Egypt's Ambassador to Addis Ababa and its Permanent Representative to the AU Osama Abdel-Khalek. The document, named Cairo Roadmap, is the outcome of a high-level regional conference held in the Egyptian capital in late 2018, and was ratified during a meeting of the African defence ministers held in Cairo in December 2019, Abdel-Khalek said. The Cairo Roadmap presents a number of recommendations, introduced by the African states and forged by Egypt, to support the UN chief's initiative for peacekeeping and to preserve the interests of African countries that contribute the most to UN peacekeeping forces, including Egypt, which ranked seventh among contributing states. The roadmap includes four main axes to enhance the performance of UN peacekeeping missions, he added. Egypt assumed the chairmanship of AU Peace and Security Council earlier this month.

The Egyptian Minister of Water Resources, Mohamed Abdel-Aty, with the head of the Palestinian Water Authority, Mazen Ghoneim (Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt's Minister of Water Resources Mohamed Abdel-Aty discussed with head of the Palestinian Water Authority Mazen Ghoneim ways to enhance cooperation and possible mechanisms to activate the MoU signed between the two countries in the field of water resources and irrigation. The officials met in Cairo ahead of the 13th session of the Arab Ministerial Water Council, chaired by Lebanon, on Thursday. Abdel-Aty stressed the need to achieve the maximum levels of cooperation and coordination between the two countries to meet the peoples’ goals in sustainable development and reach the optimal management of limited water resources. The meeting reviewed water projects in Egypt, such as canal rehabilitation, modern irrigation, and wastewater reuse. The Palestinian minister expressed his desire to benefit from Egyptian expertise in these fields. The MoU between Egypt and Palestine aims to develop the Palestinian capabilities in water resources management and develop the skills of Palestinian technical cadres. It also organizes training courses and provides technical support in groundwater, planning, management, and development of water resources. The Arab League issued a statement announcing the draft agenda of the session of the Arab Ministerial Water Council, saying it includes 24 items, namely the executive plan for the Arab water security strategy in the Arab region to address the challenges and future requirements of sustainable development (2010-2030). The meeting will also discuss proposals to update the development following several comments suggested and adopted by Arab states before submitting them to the Economic and Social Council and the Arab Summit. It will include a presentation at the meeting of the mini-committee to discuss controversial items in the draft guiding principles for cooperation between Arab countries to exploit common water resources. The meeting will also discuss an item on Arab preparations for the 9th World Water Forum 2022 in Dakar, Senegal. The Council will be briefed on signing the MoU between the President of the current session, Qatar, and the Technical Secretariat of the Ninth Water Forum.

A Palestinian journalist imprisoned by Israel without trial is in poor health after nearly 50 days on hunger strike, his wife said on Monday. "He is vomiting blood and has lost 25 kilograms (55 pounds)," Mohammed al-Qiq's wife, Fayha Shalash, told AFP. She said that if he loses consciousness she believes his doctors will feed him intravenously. A controversial Israeli law passed in July allows the force-feeding of prisoners in certain circumstances, though it has not yet been invoked. Qiq, a 33-year-old reporter for Saudi TV channel Al Majd, was arrested on November 21 at his home in the West Bank city of Ramallah and in mid-December placed under administrative detention, which allows imprisonment without trial for six-month periods renewable indefinitely. He began a hunger strike on November 25, alleging torture by his captors and is currently in the hospital wing of Ramle prison, in central Israel. He was jailed in 2008 for 16 months for student activism which Israel says was linked to Islamist militant group Hamas. Palestinians have regularly gone on hunger strike to protest administrative detentions.

PCHR Condemns Application of Force-Feeding against Administrative Detainee, Journalist Mohammed al-Qeeq Ref: 03/2016 In an unprecedented step on Tuesday, 12 January 2016, Israeli forces applied the force-feeding law against the administrative detainee, journalist Mohammed al-Qeeq, who has been on a hunger strike for about 50 days. Al-Qeeq was handcuffed and then forcibly administrated intravenous fluids. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) is gravely concerned over the risks that may result from force-feeding al-Qeeq. Moreover, PCHR calls upon the international community to promptly intervene to save his life and stop force-feeding. It should be noted that the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) approved on 30 July 2015 in the second and third reading of the amendment to the so-called “Law to Prevent Harm of Hunger Strike”, which PCHR warned of its consequences at that time and demanded its immediate annulment. Many international bodies have also warned of the adoption of such law, which is considered by the United Nations Special Rapporteur against torture as means of torture, and by the Special Rapporteur on the right to health as a serious violation. Mohammed Usamah al-Qeeq (33) has been on an open hunger strike since 25 November 2015 in protest against placing him under 6-month administrative detention. Al-Qeeq has since refused to eat or undergo medical tests, so his health status deteriorated. Therefore, Al-Qeeq was taken to al-Afoulah Hospital in Israel and is still there, as his health condition is getting worse. Human rights sources reported that he suffers from permanent headache and pains in the stomach and joints, vomits blood and lost 13 kilograms. It should be mentioned that on 21 November 2015, Al-Qeeq, Correspondent at al-Majd Saudi Channel, was arrested from his house in Ramallah. He was then subjected to tough interrogation, during which he was exposed to torture, including shackling (Shabeh), before being placed under administrative detention. Therefore, he started a hunger strike. PCHR is concerned over the life of Mohammed al-Qeeq, and: Calls upon the international community to pressurize the Israeli forces to stop all attempts to forcibly feed him fearing for his life; Reiterates its call upon the international community to urgently move to stop the Israeli serious and systematic abuses against the Palestinian detainees in the Israeli prisons; Emphasizes that administrative detention is illegal and falls under the category of political arrests, constituting a violation of the detainee’s right to a fair trial, including his right to receive an adequate defense and to be informed of the charges against him; and Stresses that the force-feeding is considered as a form of torture and degrading treatment under the international law.

Many international bodies have also warned of the adoption of such law, which is considered by the United Nations Special Rapporteur against torture as means of torture, and by the Special Rapporteur on the right to health as a serious violation. Mohammed Usamah al-Qeeq (33) has been on an open hunger strike since 25 November 2015 in protest against placing him under 6-month administrative detention. Al-Qeeq has since refused to eat or undergo medical tests, so his health status deteriorated. Therefore, Al-Qeeq was taken to al-Afoulah Hospital in Israel and is still there, as his health condition is getting worse. Human rights sources reported that he suffers from permanent headache and pains in the stomach and joints, vomits blood and lost 13 kilograms. It should be mentioned that on 21 November 2015, Al-Qeeq, Correspondent at al-Majd Saudi Channel, was arrested from his house in Ramallah. He was then subjected to tough interrogation, during which he was exposed to torture, including shackling (Shabeh), before being placed under administrative detention. Therefore, he started a hunger strike. PCHR is concerned over the life of Mohammed al-Qeeq, and: Calls upon the international community to pressurize the Israeli forces to stop all attempts to forcibly feed him fearing for his life; Reiterates its call upon the international community to urgently move to stop the Israeli serious and systematic abuses against the Palestinian detainees in the Israeli prisons; Emphasizes that administrative detention is illegal and falls under the category of political arrests, constituting a violation of the detainee’s right to a fair trial, including his right to receive an adequate defense and to be informed of the charges against him; and Stresses that the force-feeding is considered as a form of torture and degrading treatment under the international law.

News article:
A Palestinian journalist who went on hunger strike 50 days ago over his six-month detention without trial in an Israeli prison is in critical condition, his family says. Muhammed al-Qeq, who was arrested by Israel’s internal security agency Shin Bet in November, is the first journalist to protest extrajudicial detention by refusing food. His father revealed shocking details of al-Qeq’s health, saying “he is about to die now, and he vomits and urinates blood.”The only way to save al-Qeq’s life, his father said, is to set him free. “For those who have consciences, and [also] human rights organizations in the west and east, please try to save the life of my son and grandsons,” he appealed. Al-Qeq, 33, was arrested on November 21 by Israel’s Shin Bet security service, which accused him of links to Hamas. Seven weeks ago he launched a hunger strike in protest at being detained without charges or due legal process, refusing food and drinking only water. Al-Qeq’s wife, Faiha’a Shalash, has told RT the Israelis arrested him in his house in Ramallah, citing as justification alleged media incitement to violence. She said al-Qeq was made to suffer inhuman and degrading treatment while in an Israeli detention center. “We knew that he was subject to all kinds of threat and torture methods, like being beaten on a small chair when he was handcuffed and blindfolded for long hours,” his wife said. “They insulted and shouted at him in a humiliating manner and he was but in a very small prison that is not suitable to a human being. He also was threatened with sexual assault […] and internment for seven years if he doesn’t admit his accusation of incitement to violence.” Shalash, who is a journalist herself, said the accusation of incitement to violence does not fit with reality and “depends on news reports made by Muhammed as a journalist and as it was his work.” She is confident al-Qeq was detained because he described the Israelis as an occupying force committing crimes against humanity in the West Bank. Al-Qeq’s brother, Hamam, added: “It is about showing the reality in Palestine objectively, Israel doesn’t want a Palestinian journalist to show the reality to the international community objectively.”

News article:
The ICRC's role and key working principles Hunger strikes are not a new form of protest, but since 2012, a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel and, as of 2015, in Palestine increasingly turned to hunger strikes to protest their detention or conditions of detention. While the ICRC does not judge the reasons and choices for such forms of protest, just as it does not generally take position on the reasons for which people are detained, as a humanitarian organization, it follows up very closely on hunger strikers' health condition and well-being. At all times, the ICRC seeks to ensure that the rights of detainees on hunger strike and their dignity and physical integrity as patients are respected, and that the treatment they receive and the conditions in which they are held are humane and meet international standards. It also reminds the authorities of the importance of family visits, and ICRC colleagues stay in close contact with families throughout a hunger strike, to ensure they are kept updated about their loved ones' situation. Crucially, as a neutral organization, the ICRC cannot advocate for the end of a hunger strike, nor for the concerned authorities to agree with the striker's demands. It however encourages the patient, their representatives and the respective authorities involved to keep communicating and exchanging in order to find a solution that will avoid any loss of life. The Q&A below offers a recap of the ICRC's role in this regard, both during individual and collective hunger strikes, and the key principles underpinning its work. What can the ICRC do when detainees go on hunger strike? When the ICRC visits an Israeli or Palestinian place of detention where a hunger strike is in progress, it carefully assesses the situation to understand the issue(s) at stake through private meetings with the detainees, and discussions with the prison managers, custodial staff and health staff involved. The ICRC neither judges the merits or legitimacy of hunger strikes as a means of protest, nor does not take part in the negotiations between the authorities and the detainees on hunger strike. While urging both the detaining authority and the detainee to find a solution, the ICRC strives to ensure that the rights and physical and psychological integrity of detainees on hunger strike are respected including the choice to continue or abandon the hunger strike- and that proper care and treatment is provided to them with their consent. The ICRC will continue to visit detainees on hunger strike regularly, to assess their health condition and the medical attention provided by the hospital and by detaining authorities. ICRC delegates also stay in regular contact with the concerned detainees' families, delivering "Salamats" (verbal greetings) and keeping them well informed about the evolution of their loved ones' health condition. What is the role of an ICRC medical doctor during a visit to detainees on hunger strike? ICRC physicians play a specific and crucial role: they assess the medical condition of detainees on hunger strike and seek to ensure that their refusal to intake food is based on a voluntary decision and in full knowledge of the possible consequences of fasting on their health and life. An ICRC doctor must also attempt to make sure the hunger strikers are not suffering from a mental illness, for if they were, that would call into question the strikers' capacity to make a voluntary and fully informed choice to refuse nourishment. Through dialogue with health staff managing the hunger strikers, the ICRC physician aims to ensure that the medical care being provided meets current technical and ethical standards, especially regarding critical health issues known to arise from prolonged fasting or, should a hunger striker choose to stop his protest, from resuming nourishment after a prolonged fast. In Israel and Palestine, two ICRC physicians carry out visits to Israeli or Palestinian places of detention, and closely monitor any detainee on hunger strike, offering them independent and confidential medical advice. If deemed necessary, for instance during mass and prolonged hunger strikes, the ICRC may also call on its headquarters for additional support to follow up individually on each hunger striker. What is the ICRC's position on the forced feeding or forced treatment of detainees? The ICRC is opposed to force feeding or any treatment which goes against a patient's wishes because it is essential that detainees' choices be respected at all times and their dignity preserved. Forced feeding of hunger strikers is never ethically acceptable. It is furthermore a violation of internationally accepted medical ethics and may lead to violations of international humanitarian law. In its opposition to the forced feeding of hunger strikers, the ICRC bases its decision on policies approved by the World Medical Association in the Declaration of Tokyo (1975) and the WMA Malta Declaration as revised in 2006. The latter states: "Where a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the doctor as capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgement concerning the consequences of such voluntary refusal of nourishment, he or she shall not be fed artificially. The decision as to the capacity of the prisoner to form such a judgement should be confirmed by at least one other independent doctor. The consequences of the refusal of nourishment shall be explained by the doctor to the prisoner." The ICRC position will always be to consider the detainee's freely made choices and the preservation of their human dignity as key criteria for such choices.

News article:
Amnesty International has urged the Israeli regime to release a hunger striking Palestinian journalist who is in critical condition. In a public statement published on Friday, the rights organization called for Israeli authorities to immediately cease all non-consensual medical treatment and other punitive measures against Mohammed al-Qiq. Qiq has been held without charge or trial under Israel’s so-called administrative detention since November 21, 2015. He has been on hunger strike since November 25. The Palestinian’s health is reportedly deteriorating. He refuses everything except water in protest against the administrative detention policy. “The Israeli authorities should release him unless he is charged with an internationally recognizable criminal offense and tried in proceedings adhering to international standards,” Amnesty said. The UK-based rights group also demanded that the Tel Aviv regime authorities conduct an independent investigation into Israeli security forces for allegations of involvement in torturing Qiq during captivity. The photo shows Palestinian demonstrators in front of the Dome of the Rock mosque at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, in al-Quds, on January 22, 2016, holding portraits of Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq, and placards bearing the portraits of ten Palestinians who have been killed by Israeli forces and whose bodies are still being held by them. (AFP) A medical rights group reported on January 19 that Israeli authorities have force-treated Qiq in defiance of international law, which considers the practice a violation of human rights. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHR-Israel) called upon doctors and medics at HaEmek Hospital in Afula to stop force-treating the 33-year-old journalist. The group said Qiq had been forcefully hooked up to an infusion of salts and vitamins. “Al-Qiq was tied to the bed and forcefully held down by prison wardens, while a member of the medical staff made the infusion. For four days, al-Qiq remained tied to the bed, hooked up to the IV (intravenous) drip, while pleading for its removal, but to no avail,” the group said. It also stated that the actions contradict the World Medical Association's declarations on hunger strikers, including the Malta Declaration which “forbids applying pressure to end a hunger strike and forced medical treatment.” The World Medical Association, the Red Cross, and the United Nations, consider force-feeding a cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment, and a flagrant violation of international law. Administrative detention is an illegal scheme devised by Tel Aviv under which Palestinian inmates are kept in Israeli detention facilities without trial or charge. The PHR-Israel has slammed Israeli authorities for the use of administrative detention, describing it as “the reason for al-Qiq’s [hunger strike] and previous hunger strikes.” More than 7,000 Palestinians are reportedly being held in 17 Israeli prisons and detention centers.

It also stated that the actions contradict the World Medical Association's declarations on hunger strikers, including the Malta Declaration which “forbids applying pressure to end a hunger strike and forced medical treatment.” The World Medical Association, the Red Cross, and the United Nations, consider force-feeding a cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment, and a flagrant violation of international law. Administrative detention is an illegal scheme devised by Tel Aviv under which Palestinian inmates are kept in Israeli detention facilities without trial or charge. The PHR-Israel has slammed Israeli authorities for the use of administrative detention, describing it as “the reason for al-Qiq’s [hunger strike] and previous hunger strikes.” More than 7,000 Palestinians are reportedly being held in 17 Israeli prisons and detention centers.

Amnesty International has urged the Israeli regime to release a hunger striking Palestinian journalist who is in critical condition. In a public statement published on Friday, the rights organization called for Israeli authorities to immediately cease all non-consensual medical treatment and other punitive measures against Mohammed al-Qiq. Qiq has been held without charge or trial under Israel’s so-called administrative detention since November 21, 2015. He has been on hunger strike since November 25. The Palestinian’s health is reportedly deteriorating. He refuses everything except water in protest against the administrative detention policy. “The Israeli authorities should release him unless he is charged with an internationally recognizable criminal offense and tried in proceedings adhering to international standards,” Amnesty said. The UK-based rights group also demanded that the Tel Aviv regime authorities conduct an independent investigation into Israeli security forces for allegations of involvement in torturing Qiq during captivity. The photo shows Palestinian demonstrators in front of the Dome of the Rock mosque at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, in al-Quds, on January 22, 2016, holding portraits of Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq, and placards bearing the portraits of ten Palestinians who have been killed by Israeli forces and whose bodies are still being held by them. (AFP) A medical rights group reported on January 19 that Israeli authorities have force-treated Qiq in defiance of international law, which considers the practice a violation of human rights. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHR-Israel) called upon doctors and medics at HaEmek Hospital in Afula to stop force-treating the 33-year-old journalist. The group said Qiq had been forcefully hooked up to an infusion of salts and vitamins. “Al-Qiq was tied to the bed and forcefully held down by prison wardens, while a member of the medical staff made the infusion. For four days, al-Qiq remained tied to the bed, hooked up to the IV (intravenous) drip, while pleading for its removal, but to no avail,” the group said.

A Palestinian journalist on a two-month-long hunger strike in an Israeli jail could die at any minute, his attorney warned on Monday. Mohammed al-Qiq’s health is “very, very bad,” lawyer Jawad Boulus told AFP after a visit on Sunday. “He faces the possibility of death at any moment.” Qiq, a 33-year-old father of two and a correspondent for Saudi Arabia’s Almajd TV network, was arrested on November 21 of last year at his home in the West Bank city of Ramallah and is being held under Israel’s controversial administrative detention measure, which allows indefinite detention without trial for terror suspects. Detainees can appeal their detention to the High Court of Justice, but do not receive due-process trials. Several hundred Palestinian terror suspects are believed to be held by Israel, along with a handful of Israeli Jewish suspects arrested in recent months for suspected anti-Arab terror activity. Qiq has been refusing food since November 25 in protest over the “torture and ill-treatment that he was subjected to during interrogation,” according to Addameer, a Palestinian rights group. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms After 61 days since his strike began, Qiq’s organs are said to be at risk of failure. The Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security service, alleges Qiq is an active member of the Islamist terror group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. “We refuse to accept the purported security excuses for keeping the reasons for his administrative detention secret,” said MK Osama Sa’adi, of the Joint (Arab) List, of Qiq’s continued incarceration. Advertisement “It’s inconceivable that a television reporter and a normative person can sit in prison without trial or [proof of] guilt. Those who decided to jail Mohammed al-Qiq will be responsible for his death. If we reach that point, there will be chaos here. That’s why I demand he be released immediately and unconditionally,” Sa’adi said in a statement Monday. The administrative detention policy has been condemned by human rights advocates abroad, and more recently by right-wing Israeli groups, which railed at the incarceration without charges of far-right activists. Qiq was transferred to hospital in the Israeli city of Afula about a month ago, said a spokeswoman of the Israel Prisons Service. His family has said they expect Israel to feed him intravenously if he loses consciousness, though Israeli authorities have denied they will force-feed him. A controversial Israeli law passed in July allows the force-feeding of prisoners in certain circumstances, though it has yet to be invoked. Top Palestinian Authority official Saeb Erekat told AFP that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “personally bears responsibility for al-Qiq’s life.” Advertisement Qiq was jailed for a month in 2003 and then for 13 months in 2004. In 2008, he was sentenced to 16 months on charges linked to his activities on the student council at the West Bank’s Birzeit University. Mohammed Allan, a 31-year-old prisoner whom Israel accuses of being a leader of the Islamic Jihad terror group, ended a two-month hunger strike in August 2015 after his detention without charges was suspended.

News article:
Palestinian journalist Muhammad al-Qiq, who has been on hunger strike in Israeli jail for 61 days, is on brink of death, the journalist's lawyer told Ma'an. After a visit with al-Qiq on Monday, Ashraf Abu Sneina, a lawyer from the Palestinian Authority's commission of detainees and ex-detainee affairs, said al-Qiq is unconscious and cannot speak, adding that he has exhibited "sudden symptoms that could lead to his death." The head of the committee, Issa Qaraqe, accused Israel of “reckless and indifferent treatment of al-Qiq,” which stems from “a decision by the extremist Israeli government and its intelligence to let him die.” The 33-year-old journalist from the southern West Bank town of Dura has been on hunger strike to protest his administrative detention -- internment without trial or charge -- since Nov. 24. Qaraqe called on all appropriate organizations and human rights groups to exert every means available to pressure Israel to free al-Qiq, "because if he dies as a martyr, the situation will deteriorate both among Palestinians inside and out of Israeli prisons." “Israel has to be aware that it will pay a heavy toll if Muhammad dies in custody,” Qaraqe said. While possible evidence against al-Qiq is still being withheld, Amnesty International reported on Jan. 23 that the military judge at the Ofer Military Court said the file against him “accuses him of ‘incitement,’ of working with media associated with Hamas, a Palestinian political faction with an armed wing, and also of being a ‘threat to the security of the area.’" Following the report, Mahmoud Ulayyan, a member of Gaza's journalism union, said he believes al-Qiq is inarguably being held due to his work as a journalist, and that Palestinian journalists urgently need protection from the "continuous Israeli violations" launched against them. In their report, Amnesty International demanded that Israel either release or charge al-Qiq, who the group said has been mistreated and tortured in ways that violate international law. On Jan. 19, medical rights group Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), said the group had found that doctors in HaEmek Hospital in Afula, where al-Qiq is being treated, were "forcing treatment upon (al-Qiq) and pressuring him to end his hunger strike." PHRI called on doctors to stop the "forced treatment" and respect international human rights law, which says hunger strikers cannot be forced or pressured to intake food or supplements. The group said the hunger striker had been "hooked up against his will to an infusion of salts and vitamins, and blood was taken with the permission of the hospital's ethics committee." "Al-Qiq was tied to the bed and forcefully held down by prison wardens while a member of the medical staff made the infusion. For four days al-Qiq remained tied to the bed, hooked up to the IV drip, while pleading for its removal, to no avail," the group said at the time. Eventually doctors did remove the drip, however PHRI still said that their actions "contradict(ed) the World Medical Association's declarations on hunger strikers, to which medical personnel in Israel are committed, including the Malta Declaration which forbids both applying pressure to end a hunger strike and forced medical treatment." Last week, Israeli media reported that the chairman of the Israeli Medical Association World Fellowship announced at an Israeli Knesset meeting that 71 UK doctors had called on the World Medical Association to expel the Israeli Medical Association from the body, claiming that Israeli doctors have carried out “medical torture” on Palestinians.

News article:
The PLO has called for the unconditional release of a Palestinian journalist in Israeli custody whose 62-day hunger strike has brought him close to death ahead of an appeal by the prisoner’s lawyers before Israel’s Supreme Court this week. Muhammad al-Qiq, a 33-year-old journalist from the southern West Bank town of Dura, went on hunger strike on Nov. 24, 2015 to protest his administrative detention — interment without charge or trial in Israeli prison. PLO Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi said in a statement Monday that Israel must release him immediately, condemning the “unlawful practice of administrative detention” as well as “severe and unjust acts of torture” committed by Israel’s prison authorities. Ashrawi said the executive committee supported al-Qiq as well as all other Palestinian prisoners who have launched strikes against their detention. “They embody a selfless struggle for justice and independence in Palestine, and expose the brutality and criminality of the continued military occupation, particularly in relation to the thousands of Palestinian men, women and children prisoners in Israeli jails,” she said. The Israeli Supreme Court is set to hear an appeal for al-Qiq’s release on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m., the Palestinian Authority’s Committee for Prisoners’ Affairs said. The journalist’s lawyers will speak out against his administrative detention, under which hundreds of Palestinian political detainees are currently being held. The committee warned that any further deterioration of al-Qiq’s health or his potential death could have far-reaching consequences for Israel politically, including popular unrest among Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. The committees’ head, Issa Qaraqe, warned again Tuesday that Israel’s prison authorities may still take the decision to force-feed al-Qiq, in what would be the first use of the controversial practice since it was approved by Israeli lawmakers last year. A lawyer for the committee, Ashraf Abu Sneina, told Ma’an on Monday after visiting al-Qiq that the journalist was unconscious and unable to speak, adding that he had exhibited “sudden symptoms that could lead to his death.” Initially detained on Nov. 21, 2015, an Israeli military judge confirmed al-Qiq’s administrative detention on Dec. 30, 2015, and an appeal filed against his detention was rejected by the Ofer Military Court on Jan. 17. While the Israeli authorities have suggested that al-Qiq is being held “incitement,” working with Hamas-affiliated media, and being a “threat to security,” Amnesty International said last week that withholding al-Qiq on secret evidence was unlawful. An investigation by the rights group also revealed that al-Qiq had been mistreated and tortured during his administrative detention. Physicians for Human Rights Israel reported that doctors in the hospital where al-Qiq is being held had “forced” medical treatment on the prisoner. They said the action did not amount to force-feeding but was still a violation of international law. Some 45 Palestinian prisoners affiliated to the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) being held in the Megiddo and Gilboa prisons meanwhile began a two-day strike Tuesday in an act of solidarity with al-Qiq. The Handala Center for Palestinian Prisoners and Former Prisoners said that the 45 prisoners launched the strike in ab attempt to apply pressure on Israel to release al-Qiq, as well as the end to the solitary confinement of prisoner Bilal Kayid. Kayyid, who has spent over 14 years in Israeli prison, is being held in a “putrid cell without ventilation, light or proper winter blankets,” the prisoners’ center said. It added that Kayid was recently transferred from Mediggo prison to solitary confinement in Ashkelon prison where he has been denied sleep and family visits. Palestinian prisoners of Israel frequently stage hunger strikes against poor prison conditions and the conditions of their detention, with several detainees coming close to death before reaching eventual deals with the Israeli authorities.

Scores of Hamas detainees on hunger Strike Hamas protest unlawful detention in Palestinian gaols Released on 14 October 1997 at 13:00 hours GMT For the third consecutive day, scores of prisoners affiliated to the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) have been on hunger strike in Palestinian prisons. In a letter received by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, the hunger-striking prisoners stated that they were protesting against their illegal and unjust detention. They stated, in the letter smuggled out from the prison, that the situation in the prisons is close to explosive and that they were being detained as “hostages of a political process without start or end”. The lawyers of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, despite numerous requests, have not yet been permitted to visit any of the hunger-striking prisoners. The prison administration will only permit such access when a permit is granted by President Arafat or the Police Chief Ghazi Jabali. Presently the Palestinian Centre is seeking to obtain special permission from the Attorney-General to visit the prisoners and to assess their health and conditions of detention. Information received by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights indicates that some 50 detainees affiliated to Hamas began an open-ended hunger strike on Sunday 12 October 1997. In response, the security forces separate them and consequently their conditions of detention may be worse. Whereas a groups of prisoners usually occupy large cells together, the hunger-strikers have been separated and moved to smaller cells; four detainees to a two-person cell. Others have been moved from Gaza Central Prison (Saraya). Ten were moved to Police Headquarters in Gaza City. While another two were moved to the Preventive Security headquarters. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights warns of the deterioration of the conditions and health of the Hamas detainees and calls upon the Palestinian National Authority to release them, and should publicly declare their intention to respect human rights and the rule of law. In particular, the Palestinian National Authority should resist pressure from foreign governments, in particular the United States and Israel to violate the human rights of the Palestinian people. Especially as a number of these prisoners were detained in similar circumstances in late February 1996, when an arrest campaign was undertaken against Hamas activists following suicide bomb attacks. Then, as now, the detainees were arrested without due process, held without charge and are being denied the possibility of being brought before a judge. Other instances of illegal imprisonment and violation of due process have occurred recently. On 15 August 1997, 11 prisoners were released upon an order by the Attorney-General Fayez Abu Rahmah but they were re-detained three hours later by Palestinian security services. The Palestinian Legislative Council and Palestinian human rights groups have asked for the release of all these prisoners, or, as required by law, for them to be brought before a court for a fair trial. In every instance, these detainees have been persistently and steadfastly denied these basic rights. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights while acknowledging there are political pressures exerted believes that the Palestinian National Authority should respect the rule of law and human in Palestine in the face of these demands to violate Palestinian human rights. Indeed, it is absurd that the Palestinian National Authority is undertaking these arrests and detentions at the very same time that the Israel is releasing leading Hamas activists.

Scores of Hamas detainees on hunger Strike Hamas protest unlawful detention in Palestinian gaols Released on 14 October 1997 at 13:00 hours GMT For the third consecutive day, scores of prisoners affiliated to the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) have been on hunger strike in Palestinian prisons. In a letter received by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, the hunger-striking prisoners stated that they were protesting against their illegal and unjust detention. They stated, in the letter smuggled out from the prison, that the situation in the prisons is close to explosive and that they were being detained as “hostages of a political process without start or end”. The lawyers of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, despite numerous requests, have not yet been permitted to visit any of the hunger-striking prisoners. The prison administration will only permit such access when a permit is granted by President Arafat or the Police Chief Ghazi Jabali. Presently the Palestinian Centre is seeking to obtain special permission from the Attorney-General to visit the prisoners and to assess their health and conditions of detention. Information received by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights indicates that some 50 detainees affiliated to Hamas began an open-ended hunger strike on Sunday 12 October 1997. In response, the security forces separate them and consequently their conditions of detention may be worse. Whereas a groups of prisoners usually occupy large cells together, the hunger-strikers have been separated and moved to smaller cells; four detainees to a two-person cell. Others have been moved from Gaza Central Prison (Saraya). Ten were moved to Police Headquarters in Gaza City. While another two were moved to the Preventive Security headquarters. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights warns of the deterioration of the conditions and health of the Hamas detainees and calls upon the Palestinian National Authority to release them, and should publicly declare their intention to respect human rights and the rule of law. In particular, the Palestinian National Authority should resist pressure from foreign governments, in particular the United States and Israel to violate the human rights of the Palestinian people. Especially as a number of these prisoners were detained in similar circumstances in late February 1996, when an arrest campaign was undertaken against Hamas activists following suicide bomb attacks. Then, as now, the detainees were arrested without due process, held without charge and are being denied the possibility of being brought before a judge. Other instances of illegal imprisonment and violation of due process have occurred recently. On 15 August 1997, 11 prisoners were released upon an order by the Attorney-General Fayez Abu Rahmah but they were re-detained three hours later by Palestinian security services. The Palestinian Legislative Council and Palestinian human rights groups have asked for the release of all these prisoners, or, as required by law, for them to be brought before a court for a fair trial. In every instance, these detainees have been persistently and steadfastly denied these basic rights. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights while acknowledging there are political pressures exerted believes that the Palestinian National Authority should respect the rule of law and human in Palestine in the face of these demands to violate Palestinian human rights. Indeed, it is absurd that the Palestinian National Authority is undertaking these arrests and detentions at the very same time that the Israel is releasing leading Hamas activists.

Israel court rules Palestinian hunger striker to stay in jail A hunger-striking Palestinian journalist is to remain in Israeli jail despite warnings over his deteriorating health, the country's top court ruled Wednesday. The Supreme Court said it would not release Mohammed al-Qiq immediately but would follow his health on a daily basis. Qiq has been on hunger strike for 63 days over his detention under Israel's administrative detention law and his organs are at risk of failure any day, his legal team says. A Palestinian man carries a placard bearing a portrait of Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq during a demonstration demanding his release near the Beit El settlement, north of Ramallah, on January 22, 2016 ©Abbas Momani (AFP/File) The European Union on Wednesday said it was "especially concerned" about his deteriorating health. After 50 days of a hunger strike, the risk of death grows daily, experts say, with few able to survive beyond 70 days if only drinking water. His lawyer Jawad Boulus asked the Supreme Court to release him but the three judges ruled that an earlier decision by a military court to detain him was legal. Boulus said the judges were "briefed on classified material and are convinced" that Qiq "constitutes a danger to the security of Israel," so declined to overturn the military court's ruling. The evidence provided by the Shin Bet security services was presented to the judges without witnesses, who had to leave the room. Under Israel's controversial administrative detention law, the state can hold suspects for renewable six-month periods without trial. Qiq, a 33-year-old father of two and a correspondent for Saudi Arabia's Almajd television, was arrested on November 21 at his home in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Shin Bet said he was arrested for "terror activity" as a member of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. He denies the charges and has been refusing food since November 25 in protest at the "torture and ill-treatment that he was subjected to during interrogation", according to Addameer, a Palestinian human rights organisation. During the trial, which was attended by four Arab members of the Israeli parliament, judge Elyakim Rubinstein brought up the case of Mohammed Allan. Allan ended a two-month hunger strike last summer after Israel suspended his detention without trial. During his strike and after his release he became a symbol of resistance for many Palestinians. Rubinstein asked how long after abandoning his strike Allan was able to return to health, and he was told about a month by lawyer Boulus. Over 680 Palestinians are currently under administrative detention, out of 6,800 in jail in Israeli prisons, according to Addameer. Qiq was jailed for a month in 2003 and then for 13 months in 2004 for Hamas-related activities.

News article:
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says a Palestinian prisoner, who has been on a hunger strike for the past 64 days, "has entered a critical stage", PressTV reports. Mohammed al-Qiq's life is "at risk," the body warned on Thursday, referring to the 33-year-old journalist, who was arrested in the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank in November last year. The father of two, who used to work for Saudi Arabia's Almajd TV network, has been accused by Israel's Shin Bet internal spy service of "terror activity" involving the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas. The Palestinian journalist denied the charges and began the hunger strike after facing torture during interrogation. The ICRC called on his Israeli captors "to find a solution that will avoid any loss of life." Qiq's wife, Faihaa, has also argued against his wrongful detention, saying that "Mohammed is a Palestinian journalist, who was only covering the situation in the West Bank and he was arrested because of it." The occupied Palestinian territories have been witnessing escalating tensions sparked by Israeli violations against the al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Over 160 Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed by Israeli forces since October 2015 amid the escalation. On Wednesday, Israel's Supreme Court overturned Qiq's appeal against his incarceration. Also on Wednesday, the European Union said it was "especially concerned" about the prisoner's deteriorating health. Israeli forces also carried out 574 attacks against reporters during the course of the last year, the Annual Report by the Palestine Office of the Islamic Radios and Televisions Union recently pointed out. Detentions, extension of detention periods, and the issuance of subpoenas comprised 85 of the cases.

News article:
Israel's Supreme Court on Thursday suspended the detention without trial of a Palestinian journalist who has been on hunger strike for more than two months, but he cannot leave hospital without permission. Mohammed al-Qiq, 33, was said to be on hunger strike for 72 days to protest being held under Israel's controversial administrative detention law, which allows the state to hold suspects for renewable six-month periods without trial. The court said the order was being suspended due to his poor health. His family will be allowed to visit him in hospital. Qiq's lawyer said the journalist had earlier pledged to refuse any order that "doesn't guarantee his freedom". "I'm going to visit him now to know his decision," said Jawad Boulus. The International Committee of the Red Cross said last week that Qiq's life was in danger. Qiq, a father of two and a correspondent for Saudi Arabia's Almajd TV network, was arrested on November 21 at his home in the West Bank city of Ramallah. He has been refusing food since November 25 in protest against the "torture and ill treatment that he was subjected to during interrogation", according to Addameer, a Palestinian rights organization. Israel's Supreme Court previously refused to order his release, although it said it would follow his health on a daily basis. Shin Bet, the Israeli domestic security service, says Qiq was arrested for "terror activity" as part of the Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. Qiq was jailed for a month in 2003 and then for 13 months in 2004 for Hamas-related activities. In 2008, he was sentenced to 16 months on charges linked to his activities on the student council at the West Bank's Birzeit University.

News article:
Palestinian prisoner Muhammad al-Qiq said Thursday he rejected an Israeli court decision to temporarily suspend his detention without trial and would continue a hunger strike that is now in its 72nd day. The Palestinian Authority Committee of Prisoners' Affairs said the imprisoned journalist viewed the court ruling as an attempt to undermine his resistance against the "immoral and inhumane administrative detention," referring to Israel's internment of Palestinians without trial or charge. Al-Qiq also said it was an attempt to undermine public and international opinion that is critical of Israeli policy. The prisoners' committee said al-Qiq would not end his hunger strike unless Israel agreed to his full release. It added al-Qiq was refusing to receive medical treatment unless at a Palestinian hospital. Earlier Thursday, the Israeli Supreme Court suspended his six-month administrative detention sentence citing medical concerns, with the sentence to be resumed upon an improvement of his health. Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Prisoner's Society, decried it as a "bad decision," although he expressed hope al-Qiq might accept medical treatment while a more acceptable solution was sought. Al-Qiq has said he will continue his hunger strike until "martyrdom or freedom." Shackled to his bed, the 33-year-old journalist is now in critical condition and only able to communicate by written messages. On Thursday morning, a member of Physicians for Human Rights Israel, Dr. Mahmoud Mahamid, was able to visit al-Qiq in HaEmek Hospital, where he found him "at imminent risk of death." The rights group said in a statement that Mahamid was concerned by al-Qiq's condition, but "encouraged" by the refusal of the hospital's medical staff to force treat him. Al-Qiq initially went on hunger strike in late November to protest the torture and ill-treatment he said he faced in Israeli custody. However, his protest quickly developed into another bid to challenge Israel's use of administrative detention -- internment without trial or charge. Numerous Palestinian prisoners have undertaken hunger strikes to protest the controversial practice, including last year Khader Adnan and Muhammad Allan, who were both close to death by the time Israel agreed to their release. Thursday's court ruling mirrors a decision taken last year to temporarily freeze the administrative detention of hunger-striker Allan. Allan continued his hunger strike following that decision and he only agreed to end the protest when Israel promised not to renew his administrative detention. The Palestinian Prisoner's Society has said that Israel's security establishment has so far shown little willingness to negotiate on al-Qiq's release. During previous hunger strikes, Israel feared that prisoners' deaths might spark unrest in the occupied Palestinian territory, but unrest has already shaken the territory for months, and Fares said last week that the security establishment now believe they have "nothing to lose."

News article:
‘When you feel that all the doors are sealed, and you stand there humiliated and alone, knowing in advance that the court system is a charade, one is left with no other option but a hunger strike.” These are the words of Mohammad Allan, a former Palestinian hunger striker, during a telephone interview. The point behind the above interview was for me to understand why Palestinian prisoners choose such an extreme method of protest while in Israeli detention. The latest of such cases is that of Mohammad Al Qeq. Both Al Qeq and Allan were imprisoned under similar circumstances and were subjected to torture and humiliation while in prison, according to various rights groups. They were interrogated without the presence of lawyers and held indefinitely under a notorious law known as ‘administration detention’ law, with Al Qeq still enduring these horrific scenarios. In Israel, with its various laws bent on abuse, humiliation and torture, the above scenario is applied as law. In other countries, these methods are applied in extreme circumstances, but in Israel, it is standard procedure. Al Qeq, for example, is a journalist with no proven militant ties. The accusations levelled against him have not been formally presented, but rather propagated through Israeli media spokespersons who claim that he used his reports for Saudi Al-Majd TV to “incite” violence. Allan, and other hunger strikers we spoke to were held under similar circumstances, with “evidence” that is scanty. Last Thursday, the Israeli Supreme Court made a decision to “suspend” the administration detention order, on the condition that Al Qeq was not allowed to leave the Israeli hospital, where he was shackled to his bed for many days and nights. As was expected, he refused, fully aware that the suspension order, similar to the one that the court passed to end Allan’s equally protracted hunger strike, was not a promise of freedom. The subversive aim was to have him end his strike before securing yet another six-month detention order, as Israeli military courts often do. On the day the court made its decision, Al Qeq’s hunger strike had crossed the 72-day mark. Both Allan and Al Qeq are 33 years old; the former from Nablus and the latter from Ramallah. Despite the obvious risks, they both felt compelled to enter into a hunger strike in exchange for their possible freedom — and even to use their bodies as a voice so the world can see what it often refuses to hear. “It is our last and only choice,” said Allan, 33, who underwent a hunger strike for so long that it resulted in brain damage, and nearly cost him his life. “First, I made my intentions clear by refusing three meals in a row, and by sending a written note through the Dover (Hebrew for a prisoner who serves as a spokesperson for a prison ward).” Then, the punishment commences. “It is like a psychological warfare between the prison authorities, state and legal system apparatuses against a single individual,” which, according to Allan, lasts for 50-60 days. That ‘warfare’ is duplicated in all such cases, and not one person was ever spared the costly price expected of him or her. Hana Shalabi’s hunger strike lasted for 47 days, after which she was eventually deported to Gaza, far away from her northern village of Burgin, near Jenin. Khader Adnan, 37, is also from Jenin. His experience is typical in some sense to the rest, but also unique in the sense that he was held under the notorious laws for renewable six-month periods that dragged into years. Like Al Qeq, he too declared the terms of his battle with hunger: death or freedom. In fact, to exact his freedom he went through several hunger strikes, including two particularly long ones. In early 2012, he refused food for 66 days. After he was freed and re-arrested, he endured another 56 days of hunger. His death, as in the cases of Al Qeq and Allan, was declared imminent. He was finally freed in July 2015. When we asked him what compelled him to follow that dangerous path twice, his answer was instant: Unlawful and “repeated arrests, the savagery of the way I was arrested, the brutality of the interrogation and finally the prolonged administrative detention” — without trial. Al Qeq embarked on his hunger strike on November 24, only three days after he was detained, also citing torture and ill-treatment. Aside from being thrown into a legal black hole, with no due processes, and held based on “secret evidence”, torture is often cited as an overriding reason for the striking Palestinians. So what follows a prisoner’s declaration of a hunger strike? “Almost instantly, a hunger striker is thrown into solitary confinement, denied access to a mattress and blanket and other basic necessities,” said Allan. “Only after six weeks or so, do Israeli prison authorities agree to talk to lawyers representing hunger strikers to discuss various proposals. But within that period of time, the prisoner is left entirely unaided, separated from the other prisoners and subjected to an uninterrupted campaign of intimidation and threats. Mental torture is far worse than hunger.” What is equally comparable to the pangs of hunger and mental deterioration is what happens to the prisoner’s body in the process of extreme deprivation and in some cases, as in the case of Al Qeq refusal to receive medical treatment as well. A freed hunger striker, Ayman Sharawneh, originally from Dura, Hebron, but who has been deported to Gaza, spoke about the gradual collapse of one’s body. He went on hunger strike on July 1, 2012, and suspended it on March 17 the following year. He said: “I started to lose my hair, suffered from constant nausea, sharp pain in my guts, threw up ... I had an excruciating headache and then I began to suffer from fissures all over my skin and body.” The decade or more that Sharawneh had spent in an Israeli prison, and months of hunger strike, had taken a toll on his body, which developed permanent ailments, notwithstanding kidney problems. Was it worth it? Those who were freed insist that it was the best choice, considering the hopeless detention conditions and the unfair Israeli judicial system. But Adnan does not see hunger strike as a personal strategy for limited personal gains. “Mohammad Al Qeq is not striking for himself,” said Adnan. “He is striking on behalf of all the prisoners,” whose number is estimated by prisoners’ rights group Addameer at nearly 7,000, among whom 670 are held under administrative detention. According to Adnan, the issue of hunger strikes should not be seen as a battle within Israeli jails, but as part and parcel of the Palestinian people’s fight against military occupation. The list of well-known Palestinian hunger strikers exceeds Al Qeq, Adnan, Allan, Sharawneh and Shalabi, and includes many others, not forgetting Samir Issawi, Mahmoud Sarsak, Thaer Halahleh and Bilal Thiab. But what all of these former hunger strikers seem to have in common is their insistence that their battles were never concerned with the freedom of individuals only, but with that of an entire group of desperate, oppressed and outraged people. — With reporting by Yousuf Al Jamal Dr Ramzy Baroud has been writing about the Middle East for over 20 years.

‘When you feel that all the doors are sealed, and you stand there humiliated and alone, knowing in advance that the court system is a charade, one is left with no other option but a hunger strike.” These are the words of Mohammad Allan, a former Palestinian hunger striker, during a telephone interview. The point behind the above interview was for me to understand why Palestinian prisoners choose such an extreme method of protest while in Israeli detention. The latest of such cases is that of Mohammad Al Qeq. Both Al Qeq and Allan were imprisoned under similar circumstances and were subjected to torture and humiliation while in prison, according to various rights groups. They were interrogated without the presence of lawyers and held indefinitely under a notorious law known as ‘administration detention’ law, with Al Qeq still enduring these horrific scenarios. In Israel, with its various laws bent on abuse, humiliation and torture, the above scenario is applied as law. In other countries, these methods are applied in extreme circumstances, but in Israel, it is standard procedure. Al Qeq, for example, is a journalist with no proven militant ties. The accusations levelled against him have not been formally presented, but rather propagated through Israeli media spokespersons who claim that he used his reports for Saudi Al-Majd TV to “incite” violence. Allan, and other hunger strikers we spoke to were held under similar circumstances, with “evidence” that is scanty. Last Thursday, the Israeli Supreme Court made a decision to “suspend” the administration detention order, on the condition that Al Qeq was not allowed to leave the Israeli hospital, where he was shackled to his bed for many days and nights. As was expected, he refused, fully aware that the suspension order, similar to the one that the court passed to end Allan’s equally protracted hunger strike, was not a promise of freedom. The subversive aim was to have him end his strike before securing yet another six-month detention order, as Israeli military courts often do. On the day the court made its decision, Al Qeq’s hunger strike had crossed the 72-day mark. Both Allan and Al Qeq are 33 years old; the former from Nablus and the latter from Ramallah. Despite the obvious risks, they both felt compelled to enter into a hunger strike in exchange for their possible freedom — and even to use their bodies as a voice so the world can see what it often refuses to hear. “It is our last and only choice,” said Allan, 33, who underwent a hunger strike for so long that it resulted in brain damage, and nearly cost him his life. “First, I made my intentions clear by refusing three meals in a row, and by sending a written note through the Dover (Hebrew for a prisoner who serves as a spokesperson for a prison ward).” Then, the punishment commences. “It is like a psychological warfare between the prison authorities, state and legal system apparatuses against a single individual,” which, according to Allan, lasts for 50-60 days. That ‘warfare’ is duplicated in all such cases, and not one person was ever spared the costly price expected of him or her. Hana Shalabi’s hunger strike lasted for 47 days, after which she was eventually deported to Gaza, far away from her northern village of Burgin, near Jenin. Khader Adnan, 37, is also from Jenin. His experience is typical in some sense to the rest, but also unique in the sense that he was held under the notorious laws for renewable six-month periods that dragged into years. Like Al Qeq, he too declared the terms of his battle with hunger: death or freedom. In fact, to exact his freedom he went through several hunger strikes, including two particularly long ones. In early 2012, he refused food for 66 days. After he was freed and re-arrested, he endured another 56 days of hunger. His death, as in the cases of Al Qeq and Allan, was declared imminent. He was finally freed in July 2015. When we asked him what compelled him to follow that dangerous path twice, his answer was instant: Unlawful and “repeated arrests, the savagery of the way I was arrested, the brutality of the interrogation and finally the prolonged administrative detention” — without trial. Al Qeq embarked on his hunger strike on November 24, only three days after he was detained, also citing torture and ill-treatment. Aside from being thrown into a legal black hole, with no due processes, and held based on “secret evidence”, torture is often cited as an overriding reason for the striking Palestinians.

Palestinian journalist Mohamed al-Qeeq, who began an open-ended hunger strike in an Israeli jail 81 days ago, now stands on the brink of death, a Palestinian official warned Saturday. "He is in very bad shape; his health is deteriorating by the minute," Issa Qaraqe, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's committee on detainees, told Anadolu Agency. According to Qaraqe, al-Qeeq has lost almost 60 kilograms and currently stands on "the brink of death". "He is suffering chest pain, muscle cramps and significant increases in body temperature," Qaraqe warned. Last week, al-Qeeq rejected an Israeli court decision to remove him from administrative detention, saying he would maintain his hunger strike until his unconditional release. Al-Qeeq's wife, Fayha Shalash, for her part, has called on Palestinian political factions -- including the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority -- to save her husband's life before it's too late. Shalash, 29, told Anadolu Agency that she would not accept condolences from Palestinian officials in the event that her husband succumbed to starvation. Originally from the West Bank city of Hebron (Al-Khalil), al-Qeeq, 32, had lived in Ramallah, where he worked for Al-Majd TV, a popular Arabic-language satellite television channel. Al-Qeeq began his hunger strike on Nov. 24 of last year -- three days after being arrested by Israel for alleged "incitement" -- to protest his ongoing detention without trial. shortlink copied Last Update: Feb 14, 2016 4:58 pm KEYWORDS homepage

News article:
Prayer beads patterned in the colors of the Palestinian flag rest in the fragile hands of hunger-striking Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq, who lies in his hospital bed staring at the wall. By his side, on the 85th day of his protest against his administrative detention, is a copy of the Quran and a group of close friends and supporters. Outside, Israeli guards stand at the entrances to his room and the whole ward. Al-Qiq has been pushed close to death by the hunger strike he started on Nov. 25, but has refused to end it even after his administrative detention was suspended, but not canceled, by Israel's supreme court because it ordered he be treated at an Israeli hospital in the city of Afula. Another offer this week for him to be treated at the Palestinian Makassed Hospital in East Jerusalem was no better, because Israeli forces regularly enter the hospital to arrest patients. "Two days ago, he had signs of a heart attack and he always has pain in his chest. He is determined to go to the hospital in Ramallah. He says I'm a journalist and even the Israeli court said I'm not a prisoner, so it is my right to be treated in Ramallah Hospital, not Afula," al-Qiq's friend Mohammed Liwesi told Anadolu Agency on Wednesday. Al-Qiq himself is too weak to speak and visitors are given only a minute to see him. A video shared online earlier this week showed the journalist, whose gaunt and now fully-bearded face displays the impact of his hunger strike, writhing in pain. Liwesi said al-Qiq's doctor believes his case is unusual in that, unlike other high-profile Palestinian hunger strikers, he has refused to take a saline drink, instead only drinking plain water. He has also refused medical examinations, preventing the doctors from being able to fully evaluate his condition. Liwesi said that with al-Qiq determined to stand by his condition to be treated in Ramallah, despite his constant pain, they are hoping that a solution can come from ongoing talks between Palestinian and Israeli authorities. "The Israeli government has been thinking that this is a war between the government and al-Qiq, but it's not exactly like that. He's just a journalist," said Liwesi. Waiting in the hospital hallways outside al-Qiq's room are a handful of supporters on their second day of a hunger strike called in solidarity with al-Qiq and led by Shiekh Raed Salah, a high-profile leader of the Israel-based Islamic Movement. Salah, whose group commands strong support among parts of the Arab-Israeli community but was outlawed by Israel late last year, told Anadolu Agency the court decision was "unjust and racist." "We are in an open-ended strike, there is no specific number of days, our strike is linked with the developments, meaning that if Mohammed al-Qiq remains on his hunger strike for days or weeks, [then] we will continue the same hunger strike and will not stop," Salah told Anadolu Agency. "[If he dies], it is very clear in my opinion that this will not pass quickly and easily in the Palestinian street. The Palestinian street is now nervous and follows moment-by-moment the developments of the prisoner Mohammed al-Qeeq," said Salah, warning that there would be a strong "backlash" if al-Qiq died. London-based human rights watchdog Amnesty International on Wednesday called for Israel to grant al-Qiq's request to be treated at a hospital of his choice.

Prayer beads patterned in the colors of the Palestinian flag rest in the fragile hands of hunger-striking Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq, who lies in his hospital bed staring at the wall. By his side, on the 85th day of his protest against his administrative detention, is a copy of the Quran and a group of close friends and supporters. Outside, Israeli guards stand at the entrances to his room and the whole ward. Al-Qiq has been pushed close to death by the hunger strike he started on Nov. 25, but has refused to end it even after his administrative detention was suspended, but not canceled, by Israel's supreme court because it ordered he be treated at an Israeli hospital in the city of Afula. Another offer this week for him to be treated at the Palestinian Makassed Hospital in East Jerusalem was no better, because Israeli forces regularly enter the hospital to arrest patients. "Two days ago, he had signs of a heart attack and he always has pain in his chest. He is determined to go to the hospital in Ramallah. He says I'm a journalist and even the Israeli court said I'm not a prisoner, so it is my right to be treated in Ramallah Hospital, not Afula," al-Qiq's friend Mohammed Liwesi told Anadolu Agency on Wednesday. Al-Qiq himself is too weak to speak and visitors are given only a minute to see him. A video shared online earlier this week showed the journalist, whose gaunt and now fully-bearded face displays the impact of his hunger strike, writhing in pain. Liwesi said al-Qiq's doctor believes his case is unusual in that, unlike other high-profile Palestinian hunger strikers, he has refused to take a saline drink, instead only drinking plain water. He has also refused medical examinations, preventing the doctors from being able to fully evaluate his condition. Liwesi said that with al-Qiq determined to stand by his condition to be treated in Ramallah, despite his constant pain, they are hoping that a solution can come from ongoing talks between Palestinian and Israeli authorities. "The Israeli government has been thinking that this is a war between the government and al-Qiq, but it's not exactly like that. He's just a journalist," said Liwesi. Waiting in the hospital hallways outside al-Qiq's room are a handful of supporters on their second day of a hunger strike called in solidarity with al-Qiq and led by Shiekh Raed Salah, a high-profile leader of the Israel-based Islamic Movement. Salah, whose group commands strong support among parts of the Arab-Israeli community but was outlawed by Israel late last year, told Anadolu Agency the court decision was "unjust and racist." "We are in an open-ended strike, there is no specific number of days, our strike is linked with the developments, meaning that if Mohammed al-Qiq remains on his hunger strike for days or weeks, [then] we will continue the same hunger strike and will not stop," Salah told Anadolu Agency. "[If he dies], it is very clear in my opinion that this will not pass quickly and easily in the Palestinian street. The Palestinian street is now nervous and follows moment-by-moment the developments of the prisoner Mohammed al-Qeeq," said Salah, warning that there would be a strong "backlash" if al-Qiq died. London-based human rights watchdog Amnesty International on Wednesday called for Israel to grant al-Qiq's request to be treated at a hospital of his choice. "As an unconvicted detainee, al-Qiq has the right to treatment by doctors of his choice. Given his critical health situation, the Israeli authorities must respect his wishes and transfer him to the hospital that he has chosen without delay," Amnesty said in a statement.

News article:
Palestinian and Israeli officials are in advanced stages of talks over a compromise meant to end the hunger strike of a Palestinian detained in Israel. Mohammed al-Qiq, a 33-year-old journalist from Ramallah, has been on a hunger strike for the past 87 days in protest against his detention without trial. He was arrested by Israeli security forces on November 21 in connection with alleged involvement in terror activities. The impending deal stipulates that Qiq, who is hospitalized in the northern Israeli city of Afula, is to be transferred to Al-Makassed hospital in East Jerusalem, where he will end his hunger strike. At this stage it is unclear whether Israel is prepared not to renew Qiq's detention after his health improves. Sources told Haaretz that an agreement isn't expected to be reached before Saturday evening. The High Court suspended Qiq's detention earlier this month due to his medical condition. He isn't consuming anything but tap water, and has refused to receive essential minerals. He is conscious but isn't communicating. According to sources in the hospital, he is lucid, but his body is growing weaker. The doctors intend to take life-saving measures if his condition deteriorates drastically. The impending agreement is similar to the one offered to Qiq on Monday by the High Court of Justice. Justice Elyakim Rubinstein denied a request by Qiq's attorneys to transfer the hunger striker to Ramallah, saying that a hospital in East Jerusalem is the only option. Qiq rejected the deal because Israel refused to promise not to re-arrest him after he recuperates. The agreement, if finalized, is expected resemble the one reached between Israel and another Palestinian administrative detainee, Mohammed Alan. As per the deal, the state won't renew his detention unless new evidence warrants it. Prior to his arrest, Qiq was often interviewed by media outlets affiliated with Hamas, and is considered very critical of the Palestinian Authority. During the period before his arrest, he wrote articles criticizing the PA and its security services for the arrest of political activists in the West Bank. In an article that appeared in a London-based Arabic newspaper in October, he called those claiming that the Palestinian people were weary of violence and bloodshed “liars” who were trying to undermine the intifada.

A deal may be struck Sunday between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to release hunger striker Mohammed al-Qiq from Israeli custody, the Palestinian Ma’an news agency reported Saturday, quoting Palestinian officials. Former minister-without-portfolio Qadura Fares said PA officials hoped to reach a compromise that al-Qiq and his family would accept, though he warned there was “no guarantee” of such an agreement. The Palestinian Committee for Prisoners’ Affairs claimed Saturday that a deal may see Israel agree to release the detained journalist in May, and vow not to place him in administrative detention in the future, in exchange for al-Qiq, now on his 88th day without food, ending his strike. The 33-year-old journalist was arrested and held by Israel without charge on November 21 under administrative detention. He has refused food since November 25 and is currently being treated at Emek Medical Center in the northern city of Afula. On Tuesday the High Court of Justice rejected al-Qiq’s petition to be transferred to a hospital in Ramallah, and ruled he must stay in the Israeli hospital where he is currently being held.

The United Nations has expressed concern about his fate, with the International Committee of the Red Cross describing his condition as critical. The Shin Bet security service says Qiq was detained under the controversial administrative detention directive for activity on behalf of the Palestinian terror group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.

News article:
The Israel Prisons Service tried a new approach Monday to persuade hunger-striking Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq to end his fast — bringing in two high-ranking Hamas prisoners to make the case, the Walla news website reported, quoting Palestinian sources. Jamal Abu al-Hija and Muhammad Shariach were taken under heavy guard to the Emek Medical Center in the northern city of Afula, where al-Qiq is into his 90th day of refusing food. The two apparently asked him to end his hunger strike. Jamal Abu al-Hija was arrested in 2002 and sentenced to nine life sentences for involvement in at least six bombings — including the Meron Junction attack that killed nine Israelis in 2002, and the Jerusalem Sbarro pizzeria bombing that killed 15 in 2001. The 33-year-old al-Qiq was arrested and held by Israel without charge on November 21, 2015, under administrative detention. He has refused food since November 25. Qiq, whose condition has been rapidly deteriorating, rejected an Israeli offer earlier this month to transfer him to East Jerusalem’s al-Maqased Hospital, saying he would only end his fast if he is sent to a medical facility in the West Bank, under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction.

News article:
The Israel Prisons Service tried a new approach Monday to persuade hunger-striking Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq to end his fast — bringing in two high-ranking Hamas prisoners to make the case, the Walla news website reported, quoting Palestinian sources. Jamal Abu al-Hija and Muhammad Shariach were taken under heavy guard to the Emek Medical Center in the northern city of Afula, where al-Qiq is into his 90th day of refusing food. The two apparently asked him to end his hunger strike. Jamal Abu al-Hija was arrested in 2002 and sentenced to nine life sentences for involvement in at least six bombings — including the Meron Junction attack that killed nine Israelis in 2002, and the Jerusalem Sbarro pizzeria bombing that killed 15 in 2001. The 33-year-old al-Qiq was arrested and held by Israel without charge on November 21, 2015, under administrative detention. He has refused food since November 25. Qiq, whose condition has been rapidly deteriorating, rejected an Israeli offer earlier this month to transfer him to East Jerusalem’s al-Maqased Hospital, saying he would only end his fast if he is sent to a medical facility in the West Bank, under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction.

The Shin Bet security service says Qiq was detained under the controversial administrative detention directive for activity on behalf of the Palestinian terror group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. He denies this. Hundreds of protesters last week gathered outside the Emek Medical Center to demand Qiq’s immediate release from Israeli custody.

News article:
Palestinian journalists wearing mock Israeli prison uniforms hold a rally in solidarity with their hunger-striking colleague Muhammad al-Qiq, in Gaza City on 24 February. Mohammed Asad APA images Muhammad al-Qiq’s body has collapsed and his heart rate has slowed, lawyers report, as the 33-year-old Palestinian journalist and father of two enters day 92 of his hunger strike against his detention by Israel without charge or trial. Meanwhile, Israel is still refusing to allow al-Qiq’s wife Fayha Shalash and their two young children to be with him during what is feared may be his final hours. On Tuesday, Shalash spoke by telephone from the occupied West Bank to a solidarity rally for her husband in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott. “Muhammad al-Qiq did not go on strike to harm himself or to hurt his two children who wait for him minute by minute, but rather to tell the Israelis: our decision is to live free or to die with dignity,” Shalash said. “This is the message of every Palestinian to the world,” Shalash added. No negotiations Since Sunday, all negotiations between al-Qiq and Israel have ceased. Jawad Bolous, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, said Israel’s failure to respond to al-Qiq’s final compromise forced them to “cease following up on the case.” Al-Qiq’s family said he is now “in God’s hands.” Issa Qaraqe, the Palestinian Authority head of prisoner affairs, said that Israel’s silence was proof of its “deliberate intention” to let al-Qiq die. Qaraqe suggested that Israel may be trying to make an example of al-Qiq for other Palestinian prisoners. “The Israelis apparently decided to put an end to this wave of strikes,” he told Al Jazeera. “A prisoner may pay his life for it, but for [the Israelis] it would be a message delivered.” Pressure While direct negotiations have ended, Israel brought two high-ranking Hamas prisoners under heavy guard to al-Qiq’s bedside on Monday. This was reported by the Hebrew website Local Call, as well as by Palestinian media. While there has been no announcement of the purpose of the visit, reports claimed the men told al-Qiq that the Hamas leadership was not interested in individual hunger strikes at present and that the organization feared his death would escalate the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. In other words, their goal was likely to convince al-Qiq to accept terms for ending his hunger strike. But al-Qiq, who has been arrested by the Palestinian Authority and Israel for alleged involvement with Hamas several times in the past, remains on strike. Al-Qiq has maintained that he would not end his strike unless he was transferred to a hospital in the occupied West Bank. However, last weekend he agreed to be transferred to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem on condition the Israeli authorities promised his administrative detention order would not be renewed. When Israel’s high court initially offered to transfer al-Qiq to al-Makassed hopsital earlier this month, he refused, stating he would not break his strike until he was free. “Pick up the phone” Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and B’Tselem, have called Israel’s detention of al-Qiq unlawful and demanded his immediate release. Martina Anderson, an Irish member of the European parliament and the chair of the European Union’s delegation to Palestine, called on the European Union to intervene on behalf of Muhammad al-Qiq. “Al-Qiq is undertaking this strike for all Palestinian prisoners,” Anderson said. “He is hunger-striking in protest at being detained without charge and against being tortured.” I raised the case of Mohammed Al-Qiq Palestinian Journalist on hunger strike for 92 days - he is dying @SFIntDept pic.twitter.com/1z3lxAfuEk — MEP Martina Anderson (@M_AndersonSF) February 24, 2016 But doctors and lawyers fear that any intervention at this point may be too late to reverse the damage the last three months without food has wreaked on his body. In Belfast on Wednesday, youth activists from the political party Sinn Féin joined Palestine solidarity activists to hold a vigil in solidarity with al-Qiq at the city’s International Wall.

News article:
Israel-held Palestinian journalist ends 94-day hunger strike A Palestinian journalist held by Israel without trial, Mohammed al-Qiq, agreed Friday to end his 94-day hunger strike under a deal for his release in May, an NGO announced. "An agreement has been reached under which his administrative detention will end on May 21 and will not be renewed," the Palestinian Prisoners' Club said, referring to Qiq's imprisonment without trial. "He is ending his hunger strike today," said the NGO which has been defending his case. Palestinians protest calling for the release of Mohammed al-Qiq, in the West bank town of Hebron on February 16, 2016 ©Hazem Bader (AFP) The Israeli army, in a statement, was less categorical on his release. "He will continue to remain in custody until May 21, 2016. On that date, the situation will be examined to determine whether there is new information or security circumstances which require extending detention," it said. But for Qiq's family and supporters it was a victory. "The determination of the detained journalist Mohammed al-Qiq has won," his wife Fayha Shalash told reporters at the family home in the southern West Bank village of Dura. "We will in the coming hours be next to him to actually end this hunger strike," she said, adding that his first sustenance would be minerals administered intravenously. "We want to deeply thank all those who stood with us during the 94 days" of the hunger strike, she added. "On May 21, he will be freed and meanwhile he will be treated because his health condition is very dangerous." She said her husband would remain in the Afula hospital of northern Israel until his release. - Mainly only tap water - The 33-year-old reporter for Saudi television channel Al-Majd started his fast on November 25 in protest at the "torture and ill treatment that he was subjected to during interrogation", according to Addameer, a Palestinian rights organisation. Qiq has occasionally taken minerals and vitamins but mainly ingests only tap water, say doctors who have visited him in hospital in Afula. He had previously conditioned ending his fast on being transferred to a hospital in the West Bank city of Ramallah, under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction. Israel's Supreme Court turned down the demand and make a counter-proposal to move him to Palestinian-run Makassed hospital in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Qiq turned down the court proposal saying Makassed was located in an area under Israeli sovereignty and police could enter at will to rearrest him. The United Nations has expressed concern about his fate and the International Committee of the Red Cross described his condition as critical. Qiq was arrested on November 21 in Ramallah. Israel's Shin Bet domestic security service says he was detained for "terror activity" on behalf of the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza, a charge he denies. He was jailed for a month in 2003 and then for 13 months in 2004 for Hamas-related activities. In 2008, Qiq was sentenced to 16 months on charges linked to his activities on the student council at the West Bank's Birzeit University. Israel's controversial administrative detention law allows the state to hold suspects without trial for periods of six months, renewable indefinitely. The Supreme Court on February 4 officially suspended the internment order against Qiq but ordered him confined to hospital. Palestinian prisoner Mohammed Allan ended a two-month hunger strike in August last year and was freed in November. And in July, Khader Adnan was released after a 56-day hunger strike against his administrative detention, a procedure which dates back to Palestine under British mandate.

A surprise navy drill conducted by Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and the United States is meant to send a "direct message" to Iran and its "power projection" in the region, a senior Israeli naval official said on Thursday. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "We intend to continue to cultivate relations with the countries participating in the exercise," he said. "The Iranians are quite independent in the maritime space, and it is important to keep their activities away from the State of Israel in order to prevent terrorism." 2 View gallery A U.S. Navy vessel sailing behind an Israeli Navy ship in the Red Sea ( Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit ) The exercise — which began Wednesday in the Red Sea — constitutes the first public naval exercise between the U.S. Israel and the two Gulf countries. "It's far more convenient to cooperate at sea. It is far from prying eyes and one cannot see it from the land," said the official, adding that while additional exercises are planned, the Gulf states may not take part. "These are the countries with which we have a common enemy after all," he added. "At sea, there are many aspects of consensus, and sometimes this can lead to cooperation and mutual understanding. We need to stall any Iranian entrenchment and this threat is shared by other countries in the region." The five-day exercise includes training on the USS Portland and will "enhance interoperability between participating forces' maritime interdiction teams", a statement by the United States Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) said. 2 View gallery U.S. Navy officers onboard an Israeli Navy vessel in the Red Sea ( Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit ) "Maritime collaboration helps safeguard freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade, which are essential to regional security and stability," said Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of NAVCENT, U.S. 5th Fleet and Combined Maritime Forces. The U.S. 5th Fleet is based in the Gulf island state of Bahrain and operates in the Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Red Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean Iran announced on Sunday its own large-scale sea, land and air military drill will be held east of the Strait of Hormuz, the Sea of Oman, and the northern parts of the Indian Ocean. "The military exercise in Iran's coast on the Gulf of Oman aims to display the country's military might and readiness to confront our enemies," Rear Admiral Mahmoud Mousavi, the spokesman for the Zolfaqar-1400 drill, told state television.

Speaking to the local Tasnim news agency, Hajizadeh added that Israel could launch a war, but Iran will finish it. Video of the drill released by Tehran showed the launch of a Qader ballistic missile which the military claims is able to reach targets up to 300 kilometers (186 miles) away.

A surprise navy drill conducted by Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and the United States is meant to send a "direct message" to Iran and its "power projection" in the region, a senior Israeli naval official said on Thursday. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "We intend to continue to cultivate relations with the countries participating in the exercise," he said. "The Iranians are quite independent in the maritime space, and it is important to keep their activities away from the State of Israel in order to prevent terrorism." 2 View gallery A U.S. Navy vessel sailing behind an Israeli Navy ship in the Red Sea ( Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit ) The exercise — which began Wednesday in the Red Sea — constitutes the first public naval exercise between the U.S. Israel and the two Gulf countries. "It's far more convenient to cooperate at sea. It is far from prying eyes and one cannot see it from the land," said the official, adding that while additional exercises are planned, the Gulf states may not take part. "These are the countries with which we have a common enemy after all," he added. "At sea, there are many aspects of consensus, and sometimes this can lead to cooperation and mutual understanding. We need to stall any Iranian entrenchment and this threat is shared by other countries in the region." The five-day exercise includes training on the USS Portland and will "enhance interoperability between participating forces' maritime interdiction teams", a statement by the United States Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) said. 2 View gallery U.S. Navy officers onboard an Israeli Navy vessel in the Red Sea ( Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit ) "Maritime collaboration helps safeguard freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade, which are essential to regional security and stability," said Vice Adm.

News article:
Here's What You Need to Remember: Eleven Iranian patrol boats acted dangerously near a group of U.S. Navy craft in April 2020. Armed speedboats belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy habitually harass U.S. Navy and allied vessels in the Persian Gulf, in particular in the strategic Strait of Hormuz that connects the Gulf to the open ocean. Now those boats have farther-flying missiles, the militia claimed. The IRGCN now possesses ship-launched anti-ship missiles with a range as far as 430 miles, naval militia leader Adm. Ali Reza Tangsiri told Iranian state media. As recently as September 2020, the militia said its best anti-ship missile could travel just 180 miles, Defense News noted. The missile claim could have implications for tensions in the Gulf region. The IRGCN’s boats in mid-April 2020 sailed dangerously close to a group of U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels practicing helicopter operations. Eleven Iranian fast attack craft “repeatedly conducted dangerous and harassing approaches of the USS Lewis B. Puller, USS Paul Hamilton, USS Firebolt, USS Sirocco, USCGC Wrangell and USCGC Maui while the U.S. vessels were conducting joint integration operations with U.S. Army AH-64E Apache attack helicopters in the international waters of the North Arabian Gulf,” the Navy stated. Puller is a sea-base ship with a large flight deck. Hamilton is a guided-missile destroyer. Firebolt and Sirocco are patrol boats. Wrangell and Maui are Coast Guard cutters. Puller’s battle group had been practicing deploying Apaches for strikes on small craft just like the type that harassed the group. “The IRGCN vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds, including multiple crossings of the Puller with a 50 yard closest point of approach and within 10 yards of Maui‘s bow,” the Navy stated. On April 22, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he was authorizing the Navy to “shoot down and destroy” Iranian boats that harass American vessels. Trump however did not formally instruct the Navy to change its rules of engagement. The Navy periodically fires warning shots near Iranian boats but as a matter of policy does not attack the boats for the mere act of operating unprofessionally. It’s worth noting that U.S. forces also have operated in close, even dangerous, proximity to Iranian forces. “What he was emphasizing is all of our ships retain the right of self-defense, and people need to be very careful in their interactions to understand the inherent right of self-defense,” Deputy U.S. Defense Secretary David Norquist told NBC News. The back-and-forth claims and threats mark another month of escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the United States from the deal that limited Iran’s nuclear-weapons program. Iranian missileers in June 2019 shot down a U.S. Navy Global Hawk spy drone flying near the Strait of Hormuz. In January 2020 U.S. forces assassinated IRGC leader Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq. Iran retaliated with barrages of rockets targeting American facilities in the region. Longer-range missiles could make the IRGCN more dangerous in wartime. It’s not clear whether or how the new munitions might alter the militia’s tactics during peacetime. David Axe is defense editor of The National Interest.

News article:
Naval forces of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Israel, and the United States have held a joint maritime exercise in the Red Sea, marking the first publicly acknowledged naval drill among the four. The United States Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), which participated in the drills on the US side, said on Thursday that the naval exercise kicked off on Wednesday. The five-day drills include training on the USS Portland vessel and will “enhance interoperability between participating forces’ maritime interdiction teams,” a US statement said. “Maritime collaboration helps safeguard freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade, which are essential to regional security and stability,” claimed Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, commander of NAVCENT, US 5th Fleet, and Combined Maritime Forces. An Israeli naval officer told reporters that the start of such military cooperation under US auspices could help counter Iran’s “power projection” in the region. The US 5th Fleet is based in the tiny Persian Gulf state of Bahrain and operates in the Persian Gulf, Sea of Oman, Red Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean. Iran has repeatedly called on regional countries to rid the region of “extra-regional forces” in order to establish sustainable security through intra-regional cooperation. It has also strongly denounced normalization agreements with the Israeli regime, as the main destabilizing element in the region. The UAE and Bahrain were respectively the first and second Arab countries that normalized their ties with Israel last year under US-pushed agreements which were called the Abraham Accords. Sudan and Morocco also followed suit soon afterward. The normalization deals, however, have been denounced by Palestinians and the people of the region as “treacherous,” sparking mounting opposition as well as protests in the four Arab countries. Saudi Arabia, which is expected to join in as well, is reportedly preparing its ultra-conservative population and “waiting for the right moment” to officially announce a normalization deal with the Tel Aviv regime. Back in 2018, Israel and some of its then-secret Arab friends lobbied former US president Donald Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and adopt a confrontational policy against the Islamic Republic. However, since the administration of Joe Biden came to office, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have drifted away – at least to some extent – from their anti-Iran positions, saying occasionally that they seek “good relations” with Iran. Biden’s point man for Iran in region The Biden administration has promised to rejoin the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and abandon Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran. Talks began in April on that promise but were halted after Iran’s presidential election in June. Iran has recently announced that the talks, held in the Austrian capital Vienna, will resume on November 29. The US State Department said on Thursday that Biden’s special envoy for Iran, Robert Malley, will “lead an interagency team to the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain from November 11-20.” In a statement, the State Department said Malley’s regional tour is intended to hold consultations with the United States’ partners and attend a series of regional engagements. It added that he will coordinate with the aforementioned countries over their approaches toward Iran, including the upcoming seventh round of talks in Vienna. This poster, published by Iran’s Foreign Ministry, outlines Iran’s three-point stance on US return to full compliance with the JCPOA, as explained by Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh during a press conference on November 8, 2021. In recent days, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has said on several occasions that Iran is seeking a “good agreement” through the multilateral talks in the Austrian capital, Vienna, which are scheduled to resume after a five-month hiatus on November 29. On Wednesday, Amir-Abdollahian’s deputy, Ali Baqeri-Kani, who is Iran’s lead negotiator at the talks, made it clear that the nuclear issue is already resolved, emphasizing that the focus would be on the removal of all of Washington’s illegal sanctions. Iran has repeatedly reassured the other JCPOA signatories that it will resume full compliance with its nuclear obligations under the deal after the US, as the instigator of the current crisis, removes all of its sanctions and gives Iran a guarantee that it will not leave the deal again. On Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh once again spelled out what the US must do to regain its JCPOA membership and restore the deal.

Topic: Fighter Jets Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: F-14 TomcatIranian Air ForceIran-Iraq WarGrummanIranian Revolution In the first six months of the war, the F-14’s superiority quickly became apparent; it reportedly racked up at least fifty air-to-air victories in the first six months of the war, with only one aircraft damaged in return. Throughout its history, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat has been operated by exactly two nations: the United States, which retired the aircraft in 2006 in favor of the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet; and Iran, which continues to use them. Throughout the second half of the 1970s and the 1980s, other nations clamored for access to the new jet, but export restrictions prevented Washington from sharing it. Iran ultimately only received the jet in the early 1970s because of concerns that Iraq, which had received cutting-edge fighters from the Soviet Union, could outpace the Shah’s forces in the event of a war between the two. The Shah, who had eagerly aligned himself with the West at every turn, was a reliable enough ally that the U.S. government felt it could trust him with one of the best fighter aircraft in the world—or, to be more precise, eighty of them. In early 1979, as the Shah’s regime fell and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini installed a revolutionary theocracy in its place, Washington had second thoughts about this decision. But by then it was too late; the newly created Islamic Republic of Iran took control of seventy-nine of the eighty planes and began to operate them in 1980 when—sure enough—Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Iran. In the first six months of the war, the F-14’s superiority quickly became apparent; it reportedly racked up at least fifty air-to-air victories in the first six months of the war, with only one aircraft damaged in return. Following this astonishing string of successes, Iraqi pilots changed tactics, by and large refusing to engage the F-14s, and Iranian pilots, knowing their value, likewise remained back from actual combat, using the planes’ advanced sensors to coordinate the movements of other, lesser aircraft. In spite of the restrictions placed on them, Iranian engineers also made several improvements to the Tomcat, including the addition of bomb racks to transform them from air superiority fighters to ground-attack ones. By the end of the war, the plane had made at least two hundred kills, losing only eight to enemy action. The second part was more due to the plane’s lack of availability as to its supposed invincibility; because of U.S. sanctions, spare parts for the aircraft were impossible to import, meaning that they were cannibalized from other aircraft; in 1988, the number of operational aircraft had dwindled to around thirty. Today, that number is estimated to have increased to forty, though even these vary in readiness. Trevor Filseth is a current and foreign affairs writer for the National Interest. Image: Flickr

The Shah, who had eagerly aligned himself with the West at every turn, was a reliable enough ally that the U.S. government felt it could trust him with one of the best fighter aircraft in the world—or, to be more precise, eighty of them. In early 1979, as the Shah’s regime fell and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini installed a revolutionary theocracy in its place, Washington had second thoughts about this decision. But by then it was too late; the newly created Islamic Republic of Iran took control of seventy-nine of the eighty planes and began to operate them in 1980 when—sure enough—Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Iran. In the first six months of the war, the F-14’s superiority quickly became apparent; it reportedly racked up at least fifty air-to-air victories in the first six months of the war, with only one aircraft damaged in return. Following this astonishing string of successes, Iraqi pilots changed tactics, by and large refusing to engage the F-14s, and Iranian pilots, knowing their value, likewise remained back from actual combat, using the planes’ advanced sensors to coordinate the movements of other, lesser aircraft. In spite of the restrictions placed on them, Iranian engineers also made several improvements to the Tomcat, including the addition of bomb racks to transform them from air superiority fighters to ground-attack ones. By the end of the war, the plane had made at least two hundred kills, losing only eight to enemy action. The second part was more due to the plane’s lack of availability as to its supposed invincibility; because of U.S. sanctions, spare parts for the aircraft were impossible to import, meaning that they were cannibalized from other aircraft; in 1988, the number of operational aircraft had dwindled to around thirty. Today, that number is estimated to have increased to forty, though even these vary in readiness. Trevor Filseth is a current and foreign affairs writer for the National Interest. Image: Flickr

News article:
Earlier this month, authorities at Mogadishu’s international airport seized six disassembled drones. Turkish pressure forced Somali authorities to release the Turkish engineers who accompanied the shipment. Those engineers said the drones were for agricultural purposes. This seems unlikely. First, the drones cost $780,000, far out of range of any Somali farmer. Second, the Turkish export licenses show the drones have a 3-4-hour flight endurance and payload capacity that suggests a military rather than agricultural role. Nor is it coincidental that Turkey has helped build a sprawling drone base manned by both Turkish and Somali intelligence operatives adjacent to Somalia’s National Intelligence and Security Agency, an organization that supports rather than stymies Somalia’s most radical terrorist groups. As Turkey’s assistance grows not only for Somali terrorist groups but also for Ethiopia’s genocidal regime and Sudanese Islamists, the Turkish drone base in Mogadishu poses a challenge to stability and security within the region. Inside Somalia, Ethiopia, and Sudan, those struggling for democracy and a more moderate, tolerant future increasingly find themselves both outgunned by their enemies and ignored by the West. The Somalia drone base is not alone. Earlier this year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that Turkey had built a drone base on land seized during its 1974 invasion of Cyprus. "Turkey is not 780,000 square kilometers for us; Turkey is everywhere for us," he said. The base at Lefkoniko Airport, or Gecitkale Air Base, as Erdogan rebranded it, extends the operational range of Turkey’s drone fleet to threaten Israel, Egypt, and the Suez Canal, and shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean. Nor is Turkey the only problem. Iran has both used its drones to strike at Saudi Arabia and exported the means to manufacture them to Hezbollah, Asaib Ahl-e Al Haq, and the Houthis. These groups have effectively transformed pockets of Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen into Iranian drone bases. Pakistani drones now also threaten India. The White House should not shrug off attacks that fail to kill Americans: Drones will only grow more accurate and capable with time and trial. The United States should undertake a multipronged strategy in response. Congress should guarantee that U.S. allies threatened by Turkish, Iranian, or Pakistani drones have a qualitative military edge in both drones and counterdrone defense. Turkey bases drones in occupied northern Cyprus? Then the Pentagon should provide Cyprus or Greece drones that can strike deep into Turkey. The Turkish military provides drones to an increasingly unstable Somali government? Then it is time to provide drones to Kenya and Somaliland to counter the threat even if, in the latter case, it requires American specialists. Iran and Turkey provide Ethiopia with drones to use against its own people? Then, at a minimum, the U.S. should provide the Tigrayans with the ability to detect and shoot down those drones. The same need to provide defenses holds true for the Armenians, Emiratis, and Saudis. India, too, should be guaranteed a qualitative military edge in drones as Pakistan and perhaps even Turkey transfers drones to terrorists in Kashmir. Israel is a trickier issue, as it is not only a potential victim but also a proliferation problem: The Biden administration should bring financial and diplomatic pressure to bear to end Israel's drone sales to Ethiopia and Azerbaijan. For the U.S. to remain passive in the face of a growing threat, however, is an abrogation of both leadership and responsibility. Allying with America should be a path to security, not a liability.

News article:
The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy says during confrontations in the Persian Gulf over the past 18 months, Iranian forces have "slapped" the Americans six times. Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, speaking to a gathering of Basij students at the former US embassy compound in Tehran Saturday, was apparently referring to the period since the US assassination of Iran's legendary commander General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. The Iranian youth, he said, should know “the importance of the Persian Gulf and the fact that our country is of great geographical significance". “This importance has led us to slap the Americans six times in one and a half years of confrontation, many of which have not been covered by the media yet,” Admiral Tangsiri said. Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy He cited the IRGC Navy's intervention last month to prevent US forces from stealing an Iranian oil cargo in the Sea of Oman in a dramatic operation which involved Iranian forces rappelling to the ship's deck, calling it the latest slap. “The tanker was carrying Iranian oil, but with the support of the Americans, it was refusing to deliver its cargo to our country; of course, this was the second ship we confiscated and the previous one was not reported,” the commander explained. “In order to stop it, the first group of our forces landed on the deck of the oil tanker in a heliborne operation and the second group entered the ship after traveling by vessels. However, as soon as the tanker headed to our waters, two American destroyers quickly approached from both sides to prevent its transfer to our waters,” he recounted. Six Iranian speed boats and two vessels were then dispatched to the scene, warning away a US helicopter which fired chaff as it fled, thinking it might be targeted by Iranian missiles, Admiral Tangsiri said. “Of course, we also had missiles as well as combat and reconnaissance drones in the area, but we only deployed our gunboats to confront the US destroyers because we wanted to humiliate them,” he added. The commander said the Americans refrain from entering Iran's territorial waters lest it could lead into a confrontation with IRGC naval forces. He touched on the history of direct confrontations between US and Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, most importantly during the 1980-1988 Iraqi war under the former dictator Saddam Hussein on Iran. "In the eight years of the Sacred Defense, when Iraq became helpless in the face of Iran, the Americans entered into a direct conflict with Iran in the Persian Gulf in 1987 to support Saddam's army," Admiral Tangsiri said. "We in the IRGC Navy have sacrificed nine martyrs in direct battles with the Americans to defend the territory of our beloved country in the Persian Gulf. Of course, some of the confrontations have not been covered by the media for some reason," he said. "For the nine martyrs sacrificed in direct battles with the Americans, we were able to give them nine memorable slaps, and today they have realized the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic in the maritime domain."

Topic: US-Iran Relations Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: U.S.-Iran RelationsUnited StatesIranPersian GulfNavy SealsTanker War The supertanker Bridgeton—formerly the Kuwaiti tanker al-Rekkah—was the first ship to receive a U.S. escort. Here’s What You Need to Remember: The Tanker War demonstrated how Iran could retaliate against foreign pressure through calibrated, and semi-deniable attacks on the valuable shipping passing through the narrow waters of the Gulf—even though the campaign failed to inflict substantial economic damage, or indeed sink many large ships. A less violent variant of this strategy has evidently been implemented by Tehran today in its harrassment and sabotage of shipping in the Gulf On July 21, 1987, a gigantic 414,000-ton supertanker entered the Persian Gulf with an unusually prominent escort—a U.S. Navy missile cruiser and three frigates. The narrow straits of the Persian Gulf had become a shooting gallery due to the Iran-Iraq War, still raging seven years after Iraq’s surprise invasion of Iran in 1980. As Iran counterattacked into Iraqi territory, Baghdad—supplied and armed by the Soviet Union, France, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia—began blasting Iranian oil tankers with missiles, often with assistance from U.S. surveillance assets. Iran retaliated by targeting Kuwaiti tankers with imported Chinese Silkworm missiles. Though terrifying, both side’s anti-ship missiles inflicted relatively little damage as the tankers were simply too bulky to be easily sunk. The same was not true for the frigate USS Stark, struck accidentally by an Iraqi Exocet missile in May 1987 that killed thirty-seven crew. But Washington had an axe to grind with Tehran, not Baghdad—and decided to respond to pleas for military escort from Kuwait. This led to the controversial policy of reflagging Kuwaiti tankers so they could be escorted by U.S. warships in Operation Earnest Will. The supertanker Bridgeton—formerly the Kuwaiti tanker al-Rekkah—was the first ship to receive a U.S. escort. Upon entering the narrow Straits of Hormuz, a flight of four Iranian Phantom jets swooped towards the Bridgeton convoy, but turned away at the last minute. On July 23, Tehran rumbled that tanker was carrying “prohibited goods” but made no obvious moves U.S. intelligence had learned of Iranian plans to attack the convoy with motorboats operated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy. Indeed, the head of the IRGC had lobbied for such an attack but was vetoed by Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini. He had a subtler approach in mind. As the Bridgeton cruised eighteen miles west of Iran’s Farsi Island on the morning of July 24, she abruptly struck what resembled a spiked-ball chained to the sea floor—a variant of an old Soviet M-08 mine built by North Korea and exported to Iran. An explosion ripped a large hole the tanker’s port cargo tank, flooding five of her thirty-one compartments but not injuring any crew. The night before, IRGCN motorboats had lain three chains totaling sixty mines spaced a half-kilometer part along the convoy’s well-known path. Ironically, the Bridgeton, limping along at just six knots, effectively escorted the U.S. warships back to port, because the huge tanker was the only vessel likely to survive hitting another mine. The “Bridgeton incident” was an inauspicious start for Earnest Will—highlighting the Navy’s failure to plan for mines. Iranian Mir-Hossein Prime Minister Mousavi gloated it had dealt "an irreparable blow on America's political and military prestige." Cunningly, the minelaying was both clearly Iranian in origin, while being technically deniable. However, the tactic inspired France and the UK, and later Italy and the Netherlands, to deploy their own warships to the Gulf, including seven minesweepers The U.S. Navy had few assets immediately at hand to deal with mines. Then, as today, mine warfare was a neglected branch. Weeks later, the Navy deployed the amphibious carrier USS Guadalcanal with RH-53D Sea Stallion minesweeping helicopters aboard. Eventually six ocean-going and five-riverine minesweepers joined Earnest Will, which at its peak involved as many as thirty U.S. Navy ships including carriers and the huge battleship Missouri. SEALs, Little Birds and Swift Boats As deploying U.S. mine-sweeping units ashore in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait proved politically prohibitive, Kuwait instead furnished two barges, Hercules and Wimbrown that the Pentagon promptly converted into mobile sea bases, complete with their own extensive self-defense weapons. The floating bases also hosted assets vital to a covert U.S. counter-offensive called Operation Prime Chance to catch the Iranians red-handed in the act. These included two Navy SEAL teams, six 64-foot-long Mark III “swift boats” and six tiny egg-shaped “Little Bird” helicopters from the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation regiment. On September 21, a trio of Little Bird choppers flying off the frigate Jarrett were assigned to shadow the Iranian tank landing ship Iran Ajr, suspected to have been converted for minelaying. An MH-6 helicopter equipped with a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor and night-vision goggles led the way, escorted by two AH-6 gunships loaded with 7.62-millimeter miniguns and 2.75” rocket pods. Hovering stealthily 500 meters away, the helicopter crews recorded footage of the Iran Ajr’s crew deploying mines next to the Middle Shoals navigational buoy used by tankers. The Little Birds were ordered to open fire, and they raked the 614-ton vessel with their miniguns, causing the crew to take cover. However, Iranian sailors resumed deploying the mines a half-hour later. This time the night-vision-aided helicopter pilots unleashed a sustained barrage including rockets, killing three crew—and causing the remaining twenty-six to abandon ship. The following morning, Navy SEALs on Mark III boats rescued all but two of the Iranian sailors and boarded Iran Ajr. They found nine mines onboard and seized a logbook recording past minelaying activity, including maps showing the locations of those mines. Then the Navy towed Iran Ajr to deep water and blew her up. A trio of minigun-armed MH-6 helicopters tangled again with four Iranian ships approaching the sea base Hercules on October 8, including a corvette, a Swedish-built Boghammar and two Boston whaler type boats. The Boghammar’s crew fired Stinger missiles at the scout helicopters before being sunk by return fire. Eight Iranian crew were killed, and six more rescued from the water. When an Iranian missile struck the U.S.-flagged Sea Island City on October 16, injuring eighteen crew, Washington authorized a counterattack three days later called Operation Nimble Archer, resulting in the destruction of two Iranian oil platforms used to host IRGCN boats. But Iranian minelaying continued. On April 14, 1988, the crew of the frigate Samuel B. Roberts spotted three Iranian mines and realized she had unwittingly cruised into a minefield. While attempting to back out of danger, Roberts struck a mine which nearly split her in two and injured ten sailors. A heroic damage control effort saved the ship and her crew. Navy divers later identified additional mines in the area—with serial numbers identical to those on the Iran Ajr. Four days later, the U.S. launched a second retaliatory strike targeting two more Iranian oil platforms called Operation Praying Mantis. This time frigates and gunboats of the regular Iranian Navy counter attacked, resulting in the U.S. Navy’s largest foray since World War II, in which half of Iran’s surface combatants were sunk or crippled. This subdued Iranian naval operations thereafter. The Iran-Iraq war ended four months later—but sadly, not before one final tragic incident. On July 3, the U.S. Aegis missile cruiser Vincennes was skirmishing with Iranian fast boats, having unknowingly entered Iranian territorial waters, when her radar reported she was being approached by an Iranian F-14 Tomcat fighter. The cruiser fired two radar-guided SM-2 missiles at the contact—bringing down Iranian A300 airliner Flight 655, killing all 290 civilians aboard. Operation Earnest Will concluded September 26 when the USS Vandergrift escorted a final tanker into the Persian Gulf. The operatives involved in Prime Chance remained active, however, until June 1990. The Tanker War demonstrated how Iran could retaliate against foreign pressure through calibrated, and semi-deniable attacks on the valuable shipping passing through the narrow waters of the Gulf—even though the campaign failed to inflict substantial economic damage, or indeed sink many large ships. A less violent variant of this strategy has evidently been implemented by Tehran today in its harassment and sabotage of shipping in the Gulf. However, experience from the Tanker War suggested that even controlled, asymmetric harassment attacks may risk provoking a more destructive retaliation.

On July 3, the U.S. Aegis missile cruiser Vincennes was skirmishing with Iranian fast boats, having unknowingly entered Iranian territorial waters, when her radar reported she was being approached by an Iranian F-14 Tomcat fighter. The cruiser fired two radar-guided SM-2 missiles at the contact—bringing down Iranian A300 airliner Flight 655, killing all 290 civilians aboard. Operation Earnest Will concluded September 26 when the USS Vandergrift escorted a final tanker into the Persian Gulf. The operatives involved in Prime Chance remained active, however, until June 1990. The Tanker War demonstrated how Iran could retaliate against foreign pressure through calibrated, and semi-deniable attacks on the valuable shipping passing through the narrow waters of the Gulf—even though the campaign failed to inflict substantial economic damage, or indeed sink many large ships. A less violent variant of this strategy has evidently been implemented by Tehran today in its harassment and sabotage of shipping in the Gulf. However, experience from the Tanker War suggested that even controlled, asymmetric harassment attacks may risk provoking a more destructive retaliation.

Topic: Drone Warfare Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: Drone WarfareGreat Power CompetitionStrategic CompetitionPLARussian Military The transition from the war on terror to strategic competition is underway. Here's What You Need to Remember: The concept of drone swarms, for example, does not only make sense when it comes to blanketing an area with surveillance from multiple angles at once, but also with respect to survivability and success against sophisticated enemies. The U.S. Air Force Reaper Drones were crucial to victories in the War on Terrorism by delivering lethal, decisive and precise hellfire missile attacks upon terrorist and insurgent targets. They also provided countless hours of real-time intelligence to ground commanders through video surveillance in the Middle East and around the world. In fact, these drones have been continually expanding mission scope through a growing weapons arsenal and even new air-to-air attack capability. Yet, could the Reaper survive a war against China or Russia? Probably not. “We have effective RPAs that were designed for permissive environments where they do not have IADS (Integrated Air Defense Systems) or fighter jets coming after them. We will need a balance of the right size of a permissive RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft - drones) fleet as well as RPAs designed for contested environments and more high end threats like Russia and China,” Lt Gen Joseph T. Guastella, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, U.S. Air Force, told The Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in a video interview. Senior Air Force weapons developers certainly see a continued role for the Reaper, particularly regarding its more recent ability to drop a much greater sphere of weapons and fire an AIM-9X air-to-air missile. However, simply put, the drone may not be stealthy enough, small enough or fast enough to survive a war against any major opponent armed with advanced air defenses or sophisticated air-to-air weapons. “The Reaper fleet is healthy and robust and remains a critical part of our force. It is an effective platform for counterterrorism and deterrence. Its ISR and kinetic value offer incredibly valuable assets,” Guastella said. Guastella’s reference to the need for drones capable of flying in a so-called contested environment was discussed in the context of an incident last year wherein Iran shot down a U.S. Global Hawk drone. Such an occurrence certainly raises the question as to whether certain larger, less stealthy drones might prove too vulnerable for certain major power wars. “We have a rogue regime with Iran,” Guastella. So, given Guastella’s comment about the need for new drones, some might wonder just what kind of technical characteristics future drones need. Of course, much of this is already being worked on, which might explain why there continues to be a massive push toward engineering stealthier drones as well as smaller drones. The concept of drone swarms, for example, does not only make sense when it comes to blanketing an area with surveillance from multiple angles at once, but also with respect to survivability and success against sophisticated enemies. One reason is redundancy, as a deployment of many small drones in a swarm means the mission can continue in the event that several were shot down, jammed or disabled. Also, a smaller target is simply less visible to an enemy and therefore more difficult to hit. Small drones can also test enemy air defenses or move into extremely close-in, lower altitude, high-threat environments with less risk of destruction.

Topic: Aircraft Carrier Region: Americas Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: ChinaU.S. NavyAircraft CarrierKitty Hawk-ClassUSS America The last time anyone permanently sank a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in combat was during World War II. Here’s What You Need to Remember: "So there are two questions that remain for anyone who thinks they even have a shot at taking down one of these enormous steel behemoths," Farley explained. "Can you do it? And even if you can, is it worth it?" A Chinese admiral and pundit told a trade-show audience that Beijing could resolve China's territorial disputes by sinking two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and killing thousands of American sailors. Rear Adm. Lou Yuan's threat isn't an empty one. The Chinese military has deployed an array of weaponry that it acquired specifically to target American flattops. But a U.S. Navy test in 2005 proved that even if you hit them, carriers are really hard to sink. Lou made his provocative comment on Dec. 20, 2018 at the Military Industry List summit, according to media reports. “What the United States fears the most is taking casualties,” declared Lou, an anti-American author, social commentator and military theorist at the PLA Academy of Military Science. Sinking just one carrier could kill 5,000 Americans, Lou pointed out. Sink two, and you double the toll. "We’ll see how frightened America is" after losing 10,000 sailors, Lou crowed. Leaving aside the likelihood of a full-scale war breaking out between the world's two leading military powers and economies, sinking a carrier is easier said than done. History underscores the difficulty of the undertaking. In 1964 Viet Cong saboteurs managed to damage and briefly sink the former U.S. Navy escort carrier Card while the vessel, then operating as an aircraft ferry for U.S. Military Sealift Command, moored in Saigon. But the last time anyone permanently sank a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in combat was during World War II. Twelve American carriers sank during the war, usually following intensive air attacks. The last to sink, USS Bismarck Sea, fell victim to Japanese kamikazes in February 1945. In subsequent decades, American flattops suffered serious accidents including collisions and fires, but none sank. It's very difficult to sink a buoyant, thousand-feet-long ship that's mostly made of steel. The U.S. Navy knows this from experience. In 2005, the Navy itself targeted the decommissioned carrier America in order to determine just how much punishment the vessel could withstand before slipping beneath the waves. "The ship was pummeled by explosions both above and below the waterline," The War Zone reporter Tyler Rogoway explained in 2018. "After nearly four weeks of these activities, the carrier was scuttled. On May 14, 2005, the vessel's stern disappeared below the waterline and the ship began its voyage to the seafloor." "America stood up to four weeks of abuse and only succumbed to the sea after demolition teams scuttled the ship on purpose once and for all, it's clear that America was built to sustain heavy damage in combat and still stay afloat." Consider also the carrier-shaped pontoon ship that Iran built as a scale target for a 2015 war game. While small and flimsy compared to a real flattop, the pontoon vessel itself endured an intensive assault. "Iran struck the faux carrier with a barrage of anti-ship missiles, then swarmed it with small boats and then landed commandos on it," Rogoway reported. Still, the fake flattop apparently remained afloat. To even try to sink an American flattop, you first must hit it. That's not easy, either. No carrier sails without an air wing with as many as 50 fighter aircraft plus several escorting destroyers, cruisers, and submarines. A virtual wall of defensive weaponry surrounds the flattop out to a distance of several hundred miles. Still, China or another country could attempt to target the carriers with submarines, cruise missiles and ballistic rockets. "They will employ multiple systems in order to confuse and overwhelm U.S. defenses," naval historian Robert Farley wrote in 2017. "They will rely on the threat of attack to keep U.S. carrier battle groups as far as possible from the main theaters of operation." "But the observation that the enemy has a missile or torpedo that can kill a carrier only begins a conversation about carrier vulnerability," Farley continued. "Shooting anything at an aircraft carrier is a costly, difficult operation." The carrier's attackers could face withering counterfire from the vessel's defenders. "Beyond the monetary cost, launching an open attack against an American carrier strike group, with its own cruisers, destroyers and submarines, is almost certainly a suicide mission." And if the United States' reaction to the 9/11 terror attacks is any indication, Washington surely would deploy all its remaining military might, including its surviving eight or nine carriers, against the country behind the sinking. "So there are two questions that remain for anyone who thinks they even have a shot at taking down one of these enormous steel behemoths," Farley explained. "Can you do it? And even if you can, is it worth it?" David Axe served as Defense Editor of the National Interest. He is the author of the graphic novels War Fix, War Is Boring and Machete Squad.

News article:
Iran's Navy Commander Rear Admiral Shahram Irani says Russia and China have indicated their readiness to hold joint naval maneuvers with Iran. Speaking in an interview with Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) on Sunday, the Iranian commander said the country's Navy carries out annual maneuvers, adding, "We will also hold drills this year." "We have invited different countries to take part in the drills, and Russia and China have so far voiced their readiness to do so," Irani noted. The commander added that different units of Iran's Armed Forces take part in joint maneuvers with other countries. Russian Ambassador to Tehran Levan Dzhagaryan said in August that Iran, Russia and China will hold joint maritime exercises – dubbed CHIRU – in the Persian Gulf around late 2021 or early 2022, to ensure international shipping safety and combat piracy. "At the end of this year or the beginning of the next year, the annual joint naval exercises, CHIRU, will be held in the Persian Gulf region. Russian, Iranian and Chinese warships are taking part in it. The main aim is to practice actions on ensuring international shipping safety, and combating sea pirates," Dzhagaryan said in an interview with Sputnik. Late in December 2019, Iran, Russia and China staged a four-day joint maritime exercise in the Indian Ocean and the Sea of Oman area. The drills, dubbed the ‘Marine Security Belt’ exercise, covered 17,000 square kilometers and consisted of various tactical exercises such as target practicing and rescuing ships from assault and incidents such as fires. The Sea of Oman is a particularly sensitive waterway as it connects to the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes and which in turn connects to the Persian Gulf.

News article:
Iran's Navy Commander Rear Admiral Shahram Irani says Russia and China have indicated their readiness to hold joint naval maneuvers with Iran. Speaking in an interview with Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) on Sunday, the Iranian commander said the country's Navy carries out annual maneuvers, adding, "We will also hold drills this year." "We have invited different countries to take part in the drills, and Russia and China have so far voiced their readiness to do so," Irani noted. The commander added that different units of Iran's Armed Forces take part in joint maneuvers with other countries. Russian Ambassador to Tehran Levan Dzhagaryan said in August that Iran, Russia and China will hold joint maritime exercises – dubbed CHIRU – in the Persian Gulf around late 2021 or early 2022, to ensure international shipping safety and combat piracy. "At the end of this year or the beginning of the next year, the annual joint naval exercises, CHIRU, will be held in the Persian Gulf region. Russian, Iranian and Chinese warships are taking part in it. The main aim is to practice actions on ensuring international shipping safety, and combating sea pirates," Dzhagaryan said in an interview with Sputnik. Late in December 2019, Iran, Russia and China staged a four-day joint maritime exercise in the Indian Ocean and the Sea of Oman area. The drills, dubbed the ‘Marine Security Belt’ exercise, covered 17,000 square kilometers and consisted of various tactical exercises such as target practicing and rescuing ships from assault and incidents such as fires. The Sea of Oman is a particularly sensitive waterway as it connects to the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes and which in turn connects to the Persian Gulf.

Topic: Drones Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: U.S. NavyNavy DronesReaper DronesGlobal Hawk DroneGreat Power Competition Competition with China will be nothing like the war on terror. Here's What You Need to Remember: Simply put, the Reaper drone may not be stealthy enough, small enough or fast enough to survive a war against any major opponent armed with advanced air defenses or sophisticated air-to-air weapons. The U.S. Air Force Reaper Drones were crucial to victories in the War on Terrorism by delivering lethal, decisive and precise hellfire missile attacks upon terrorist and insurgent targets. They also provided countless hours of real-time intelligence to ground commanders through video surveillance in the Middle East and around the world. In fact, these drones have been continually expanding mission scope through a growing weapons arsenal and even new air-to-air attack capability. Yet, could the Reaper survive a war against China or Russia? Probably not. “We have effective RPAs that were designed for permissive environments where they do not have IADS (Integrated Air Defense Systems) or fighter jets coming after them. We will need a balance of the right size of a permissive RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft - drones) fleet as well as RPAs designed for contested environments and more high end threats like Russia and China,” Lt Gen Joseph T. Guastella, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, U.S. Air Force, told The Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in a video interview. Senior Air Force weapons developers certainly see a continued role for the Reaper, particularly regarding its more recent ability to drop a much greater sphere of weapons and fire an AIM-9X air-to-air missile. However, simply put, the drone may not be stealthy enough, small enough or fast enough to survive a war against any major opponent armed with advanced air defenses or sophisticated air-to-air weapons. “The Reaper fleet is healthy and robust and remains a critical part of our force. It is an effective platform for counterterrorism and deterrence. Its ISR and kinetic value offer incredibly valuable assets,” Guastella said. Guastella’s reference to the need for drones capable of flying in a so-called contested environment was discussed in the context of an incident last year wherein Iran shot down a U.S. Global Hawk drone. Such an occurrence certainly raises the question as to whether certain larger, less stealthy drones might prove too vulnerable for certain major power wars. “We have a rogue regime with Iran,” Guastella. So, given Guastella’s comment about the need for new drones, some might wonder just what kind of technical characteristics future drones need. Of course, much of this is already being worked on, which might explain why there continues to be a massive push toward engineering stealthier drones as well as smaller drones. The concept of drone swarms, for example, does not only make sense when it comes to blanketing an area with surveillance from multiple angles at once, but also with respect to survivability and success against sophisticated enemies. One reason is redundancy, as a deployment of many small drones in a swarm means the mission can continue in the event that several were shot down, jammed or disabled. Also, a smaller target is simply less visible to an enemy and therefore more difficult to hit. Small drones can also test enemy air defenses or move into extremely close-in, lower altitude, high-threat environments with less risk of destruction.

Here's What You Need to Remember: On Oct. 16, 1987, an Iranian missile struck a Kuwaiti tanker, injuring 19 people. In response, a U.S. task force targeted two inoperable oil platforms that IRGC forces were using as bases for armed speedboats. Tensions have escalated in the Persian Gulf region in the aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision unilaterally to withdraw the United States from the agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. military has implicated Iranian agents in several summer 2019 attacks on civilian ships sailing near Iran. The U.S. Navy sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her strike group to the region. The U.S. Air Force deployed B-52 bombers and F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. If war breaks out, American forces could target Iran’s small navy as well as the vessels belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps militia. The battle could be brief. Iran’s fleet has a long history of waging losing fights with the United States and other Western powers. During World War II, the Allied powers worried that Iran, while technically neutral, might sympathize with and aid the Nazis, potentially depriving the Allies of the country’s oil. On Aug. 25, 1941, Commonwealth and Soviet forces invaded. British and Australian warships steamed into Abadan Harbor as part of a surprise attack. HMS Shoreham opened fire first, striking the Iranian warship Palang. Soon virtually the entire Iranian fleet was in ruins and commander-in-chief Adm. Gholamali Bayandor lay dead. The British and Soviets divided up Iran and deposed its shah. In the two decades following the war, the new regime rebuilt the navy with mostly British-made ships, some of which remain in service today. The new Iranian navy fought hard during the bloody Iran-Iraq war between 1980 and 1988. Iran’s attacks on tanker ships—some strictly neutral, others admittedly supplying Iraq—incited international rage. In 1987, Washington approved Kuwait’s request to “reflag” its tankers as American vessels, in order to allow the U.S. Navy to escort the ships through the Persian Gulf. The Americans’ Operation Earnest Will, lasting from July 1987 to September 1988, included several smaller efforts that resulted in the destruction of Iranian forces. The Navy converted two oil-service barges into “sea bases” for Special Operations Forces and armed helicopters, and the U.S. Army placed attack copters aboard Navy ships. On Sept. 21, 1987 Little Bird helicopters from the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment attacked the Iranian vessel Ajr as she laid mines, forcing the crew to abandon ship. A few days later, Little Birds sank three Iranian patrol boats. On Oct. 16, 1987, an Iranian missile struck a Kuwaiti tanker, injuring 19 people. In response, a U.S. task force targeted two inoperable oil platforms that IRGC forces were using as bases for armed speedboats. American warships surrounded the platforms, compelling the Iranian crews to evacuate. U.S. commandos climbed aboard one platform to gather up any documents the Iranians had left behind. Four U.S. destroyers opened fire, setting the platforms ablaze. On April 14, 1988, the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts struck an Iranian mine while escorting tanker ships through the Persian Gulf. The carrier USS Enterprise led a retaliatory raid. Two U.S. destroyers and an amphibious assault ship carrying a battalion of U.S. Marines assaulted an oil platform the Iranians were using as a staging base. The Iranians fired back, drawing heavy return fire from the destroyers and Marine Cobra helicopters. Marines stormed the platform, capturing one surviving Iranian gunner. Iranian speedboats raided three civilian cargo ships. As the Iranians withdrew, Enterprise’s A-6 bombers zeroed in, sinking one speedboat with cluster bombs. The Iranian missile boat Joshan fired a Harpoon anti-ship missile at a group of American warships—and missed. The Americans fired back with Harpoon and Standard missiles then sank the damaged Joshan with their guns. While the U.S. ships fought off Iranian air attacks, Tehran’s 1960s-vintage destroyers joined the battle. Sahand and Sabalan both fired without effect at A-6s overhead. The A-6s shot back with Harpoons and laser-guided bombs, sinking Sahand and badly damaging Sabalan. At least 56 Iranians died in the fighting. Two U.S. Marines perished when their helicopter crashed. Battered, the Iranian fleet pulled back, and since then has been hesitant to make good on its periodic threats against Iran’s neighbors and the United States.

News article:
Iran appears to be preparing for a space launch as negotiations continue in Vienna over its tattered nuclear deal with world powers, according to an expert and satellite images. The likely blast off at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport comes as Iranian state media has offered a list of upcoming planned satellite launches in the works for the Islamic Republic’s civilian space program, which has been beset by a series of failed launches. Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard runs its own parallel program that successfully put a satellite into orbit last year. Iran’s foray into space comes at a precarious time for the Islamic Republic, with Israel and the United States considering secondary options in case talks fail, discussing possible military drills in order to practice destroying Iranian nuclear facilities in a potential worst-case scenario. Israel already believes that Iran is ratcheting up its forces into order to attack neighboring nations. Conducting a launch amid the Vienna talks fits the hardline posture struck by Tehran’s negotiators, who already described six previous rounds of diplomacy as a “draft,” exasperating Western nations. Germany’s new foreign minister has gone as far as to warn that “time is running out for us at this point.” But all this fits into a renewed focus on space by Iran’s hardline President Ebrahim Raisi, said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who studies Tehran’s program. With Iran’s former president Hassan Rouhani, who shepherded the nuclear deal, out of office, concerns about alienating the talks with launches that the US asserts aids Tehran’s ballistic missile program likely have faded. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “They’re not walking on eggshells,” Lewis said. “I think Raisi’s people have a new balance in mind.” Iranian state media did not acknowledge the activity at the spaceport and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The US military, which tracks space launches, did not respond to requests for comment. Satellite images taken Saturday by Planet Labs Inc. obtained by The Associated Press show activity at the spaceport in the desert plains of Iran’s rural Semnan province, some 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of Tehran. Advertisement A support vehicle stood parked alongside a massive white gantry that typically houses a rocket on the launch pad. That support vehicle has appeared in other satellite photos at the site just ahead of a launch. Also visible is a hydraulic crane with a railed platform, also seen before previous launches and likely used to service the rocket. Other satellite images in recent days at the spaceport has shown an increase in the number of cars at the facility, another sign of heightened activity that typically proceeds a launch. A building also believed to be the “checkout” facility for a rocket has seen increased activity as well, Lewis said. “This is fairly traditional pre-launch activity,” he told the AP. The activity comes after Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency on December 5 published an article saying its space program had four satellites ready for launch. It described one, the low-orbit imaging satellite Zafar 2, as being “under the final phase of preparation.” Zafar, which means “victory” in Farsi, weighs some 113 kilograms (250 pounds). The Zafar 1, however, failed to enter orbit after a February 2020 launch at the spaceport. That launch used a Simorgh, or “Phoenix,” rocket that carried the rocket into space, but failed to put it in orbit at the correct speed, according to Iranian officials at the time. Iran had spent just under 2 million euros ($2.3 million) to build the satellite. Iran’s civilian space program has seen a series of setbacks and fatal explosions plague it in recent years. One mysterious blast even caught the attention of then-US president Donald Trump in 2019, who tweeted out what appeared to be a classified US spy satellite picture of the explosion’s aftermath with the caption: “The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident.” Advertisement Meanwhile, the Guard in April 2020 revealed its own secret space program by successfully launching a satellite into orbit. The head of the US Space Command later dismissed the satellite as “a tumbling webcam in space” that would not provide Iran vital intelligence — though it showed Tehran’s ability to successfully get into orbit. Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space. But under Raisi, Iran’s Supreme Council of Space met for the first time in 11 years, according to a recent report by state-run television. Raisi said at the November meeting that it “shows the determination of this government to develop the space industry.” A high-ranking member of the Guard who runs its aerospace program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, attended the meeting along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian. The US alleges such satellite launches defy a UN Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. Tehran also says it has not violated the UN resolution, as it only “called upon” Tehran not to conduct such tests. But the possible launch also comes as tensions again rise over Iran’s nuclear program. Since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear accord with world powers in 2018, Iran slowly abandoned all the limits the deal put on its program. Today, Tehran enriches uranium up to 60 percent purity — a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Its stockpile of enriched uranium also continues to grow and international inspectors face challenges in monitoring its advances. Lewis said he expects to see the space program accelerate given Raisi’s interest. “They’re not constrained by worries about the Iran deal in the same way that Rouhani was,” he said.

News article:
Iran appears to be preparing for a space launch as negotiations continue in Vienna over its tattered nuclear deal with world powers, according to an expert and satellite images. The likely blast off at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport comes as Iranian state media has offered a list of upcoming planned satellite launches in the works for the Islamic Republic’s civilian space program, which has been beset by a series of failed launches. Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard runs its own parallel program that successfully put a satellite into orbit last year. Iran’s foray into space comes at a precarious time for the Islamic Republic, with Israel and the United States considering secondary options in case talks fail, discussing possible military drills in order to practice destroying Iranian nuclear facilities in a potential worst-case scenario. Israel already believes that Iran is ratcheting up its forces into order to attack neighboring nations. Conducting a launch amid the Vienna talks fits the hardline posture struck by Tehran’s negotiators, who already described six previous rounds of diplomacy as a “draft,” exasperating Western nations. Germany’s new foreign minister has gone as far as to warn that “time is running out for us at this point.” But all this fits into a renewed focus on space by Iran’s hardline President Ebrahim Raisi, said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who studies Tehran’s program. With Iran’s former president Hassan Rouhani, who shepherded the nuclear deal, out of office, concerns about alienating the talks with launches that the US asserts aids Tehran’s ballistic missile program likely have faded. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “They’re not walking on eggshells,” Lewis said. “I think Raisi’s people have a new balance in mind.” Iranian state media did not acknowledge the activity at the spaceport and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The US military, which tracks space launches, did not respond to requests for comment. Satellite images taken Saturday by Planet Labs Inc. obtained by The Associated Press show activity at the spaceport in the desert plains of Iran’s rural Semnan province, some 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of Tehran. Advertisement A support vehicle stood parked alongside a massive white gantry that typically houses a rocket on the launch pad. That support vehicle has appeared in other satellite photos at the site just ahead of a launch. Also visible is a hydraulic crane with a railed platform, also seen before previous launches and likely used to service the rocket. Other satellite images in recent days at the spaceport has shown an increase in the number of cars at the facility, another sign of heightened activity that typically proceeds a launch. A building also believed to be the “checkout” facility for a rocket has seen increased activity as well, Lewis said. “This is fairly traditional pre-launch activity,” he told the AP. The activity comes after Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency on December 5 published an article saying its space program had four satellites ready for launch. It described one, the low-orbit imaging satellite Zafar 2, as being “under the final phase of preparation.” Zafar, which means “victory” in Farsi, weighs some 113 kilograms (250 pounds). The Zafar 1, however, failed to enter orbit after a February 2020 launch at the spaceport. That launch used a Simorgh, or “Phoenix,” rocket that carried the rocket into space, but failed to put it in orbit at the correct speed, according to Iranian officials at the time. Iran had spent just under 2 million euros ($2.3 million) to build the satellite. Iran’s civilian space program has seen a series of setbacks and fatal explosions plague it in recent years. One mysterious blast even caught the attention of then-US president Donald Trump in 2019, who tweeted out what appeared to be a classified US spy satellite picture of the explosion’s aftermath with the caption: “The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident.” Advertisement Meanwhile, the Guard in April 2020 revealed its own secret space program by successfully launching a satellite into orbit. The head of the US Space Command later dismissed the satellite as “a tumbling webcam in space” that would not provide Iran vital intelligence — though it showed Tehran’s ability to successfully get into orbit. Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space. But under Raisi, Iran’s Supreme Council of Space met for the first time in 11 years, according to a recent report by state-run television. Raisi said at the November meeting that it “shows the determination of this government to develop the space industry.” A high-ranking member of the Guard who runs its aerospace program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, attended the meeting along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian. The US alleges such satellite launches defy a UN Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. Tehran also says it has not violated the UN resolution, as it only “called upon” Tehran not to conduct such tests. But the possible launch also comes as tensions again rise over Iran’s nuclear program. Since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear accord with world powers in 2018, Iran slowly abandoned all the limits the deal put on its program. Today, Tehran enriches uranium up to 60 percent purity — a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Its stockpile of enriched uranium also continues to grow and international inspectors face challenges in monitoring its advances. Lewis said he expects to see the space program accelerate given Raisi’s interest. “They’re not constrained by worries about the Iran deal in the same way that Rouhani was,” he said.

News article:
Iran held an unannounced air defense drill at a nuclear facility for the second time this month on Monday, as a senior military commander warned of a "crushing" response against any Israeli attack. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that sounds of anti-aircraft fire heard on Monday from around the Bushehr nuclear power plant were caused by an air defense exercise. "This exercise took place at 5 A.M. local time (1:30 GMT) with full preparation and coordination with the armed forces," a local official, Mohammadtaqi Irani, told Fars. Gholamali Rashid, one of Iran's top military commanders, was quoted by Iranian news agency nournews as saying during the military exercise: "If Israel carries out attacks against Iran, our armed forces will immediately attack all centers, bases, routes, and spaces used to carry out the aggression." In early December, Iranian air defenses fired a missile as part of an exercise over the central town of Natanz, which also houses nuclear installations. Indirect talks between Iran and the United States have resumed in a bid to revive Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, which the United States abandoned three years ago, reimposing harsh sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Iran's arch-foe, Israel, has warned it will adopt other measures should diplomacy fail to curb Iran's fast-advancing nuclear program.

Anti-aircraft fire was reported Monday in the vicinity of a nuclear site in Bushehr, Iran, according to preliminary reports. An Iranian official told the country’s semi-official Fars news agency that the anti-aircraft fire was to test air defenses at the site. “This exercise took place at 5 a.m. local time (130 GMT) with full preparation and coordination with the armed forces,” Mohammadtaqi Irani told the agency, according to Reuters. Numerous explosions have been reported over the past few years in complexes vital to Iran’s nuclear program and its energy and military sectors.

Israel has reportedly approved a budget of some NIS 5 billion ($1.5 billion) to be used to prepare the military for a potential strike against Iran’s nuclear program. It includes funds for various types of aircraft, intelligence-gathering drones and unique armaments needed for such an attack, which would have to target heavily fortified underground sites. The reported anti-aircraft fire at Bushehr came days after Western powers reported some progress in talks to save the landmark Iran nuclear deal, though European diplomats warned that they were “rapidly reaching the end of the road.” In a blow to European mediators, Iran requested a new pause in the talks in Vienna, which aim to bring the United States back into the 2015 agreement and roll back Iran’s nuclear activities.

The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, did not specify the exact length of time Iran needs to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon. Estimates have put the breakout time at several months. “But it’s really short. It is unacceptably short,” the official was quoted as saying by Reuters.

News article:
Precision-strike combat drones as well as sophisticated ballistic and cruise missiles have played a major role in the large-scale military exercises that Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) is holding in an area stretching along the southern shores of the country.

Precision-strike combat drones as well as sophisticated ballistic and cruise missiles have played a major role in the large-scale military exercises that Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) is holding in an area stretching along the southern shores of the country. On Tuesday and the second day of the Great Prophet 17 joint drills, the IRGC aerospace forces flew unmanned aerial vehicles, and the aircraft struck a series of fixed and mobile targets on the ground and in the sea using bombs with pinpoint accuracy. Attack helicopters provided close air support (CAS) and fired accurately at the designated targets. Troops practiced coastal defense exercises and anti-heliborne tactics as well.

Marking the third day of massive joint military exercises, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC)’s Ground Force has employed an advanced homegrown tank dubbed Karrar for the first time. Karrar, an upgraded version of the T-72m tanks, came into service during the Great Prophet 17 joint drills in the country’s southern coasts on Wednesday. The new tank is furnished with special coatings to withstand heatwaves and can hide from heat-seeking missiles. It is also equipped with GPS navigation systems. The Great Prophet 17 drills kicked off on Monday, covering the coastlines of the southern Iranian provinces of Hormozgan, Bushehr, and Khuzestan. The IRGC Ground Force’s special units practiced their defensive skills in Lark Island. They used new weapons and military equipment as well as new tactics to carry out offensive and defensive operations. After receiving intelligence on the hypothetical enemy, they hit the identified targets with heavy and semi-heavy weapons. Iran’s Armed Forces hold routine military exercises throughout the year. Iranian military experts and technicians have in recent years made great progress in developing and manufacturing a broad range of domestically-manufactured equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient in this regard. Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the Islamic Republic will not hesitate to build up its defense capabilities, emphasizing such abilities are entirely meant for the purpose of defense and will be never subject to negotiations.

News article:
Topic: Missiles Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: RussiaMilitaryTechnologyWorldNavyU.S. NavyAircraft Carrier Aircraft carriers face a litany of threats in the modern age, but the U.S. Navy has spent the last half-century thinking of ways to defeat threats to them. Kornets mounted on dhows is the least of a carrier’s worries. Here's What You Need to Remember: Langfan does mention the thermobaric version of the Kornet as having massive explosive potential. While this is true, the thermobaric version has very little penetrative capabilities. It’s unlikely that a thermobaric Kornet would make its way through the hull, though it probably would leave a significant dent or create spalling on the other side. Could Russian Kornet Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) attack the USS Abraham Lincoln, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier? Using limited analysis of the capabilities of the Kornet and the carrier’s defensive capabilities, Mark Langfan, the Chairman of Americans for a Safe Israel, has come to the conclusion that Kornets were a serious threat to the carrier. However, Langfan’s research misrepresents many aspects of the Kornet and displays a large oversight of many aspects of naval warfare. First, he analyzes the attack on the carrier in a vacuum. In a deployment around the shores of Iran would be backed up by a litany of smaller destroyers and patrol ships. In particular, the Cyclone-class patrol ships are assigned to the waters in the Persian Gulf. These ships are optimized to take on the small boats that could mount Kornets, with dual 25-millimeter autocannons. Cyclones are also equipped with Griffin missiles , which are optimized for use against small boats and can take them out from as far as eight kilometers away. The carrier also has its own air wing, which could be used to strike small ships before they even entered engagement range. Even if we look at the Kornet versus carrier engagement in a vacuum, the Kornet faces major problems. Langfan says the Kornet is “fire-and-forget,” which is incorrect as no variant of the missile mounts a seeker that can be used to track the target independently. All are reliant on a laser beam from the launching post for guidance to the target. Some launching posts, such as Kornet mounts on armored vehicles, have the capability to automatically track the target with the launching post, but such launching posts are heavy. Installing one on a wooden-hulled small boat is highly impractical. Assuming a regular tripod firing post is used, a Kornet attack is still impractical. The regular Kornet tripod is unstabilized, as it is meant to be used on stable dry land. Mounting it on a boat’s deck would make it bob and weave with the motion of the boat, making an accurate missile shot impossible at any significant range. So what if a missile is launched, and somehow tracks properly? Still, probably not much. Carriers are armed with a multitude of self-defense missiles and systems, such as the Phalanx CIWS or RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile. The sensors on these devices, while optimized to track larger anti-ship missiles likely would have no problem tracking the smaller Kornet. The relatively slow speed of the Kornet would give these systems a generous window of engagement before the missile hit the carrier. But what if the Kornet actually hit? Again, not much. The article discusses the Kornet’s ability to pierce through steel. While the Kornet’s warhead is easily capable of defeating the hull of an aircraft carrier, the thin jet of molten metal created by its HEAT warhead is unlikely to do much damage. ATGMs rely on this jet of metal hitting a crew member or critical flammable component in a tank to take it out of action. The crew, ammunition, and fuel are all relatively compactly packed together in a tank. Not so in a ship. A Kornet hit would likely only kill people within a very small radius of the impact, if anyone is there at all. After penetrating, it would leave only a small hole (generally smaller than the diameter of the missile itself) in the hull. Damage control teams on ships are trained to deal with far more devastating damage, and patching the hole a Kornet would create is likely child’s play for them. Most anti-ship missiles feature a massive warhead that’s meant to crash through the hull and embed itself meters deep into a ship before detonating for massive damage. Kornets detonating on the hull itself would likely deal very little damage to vital areas of the ship. Langfan does mention the thermobaric version of the Kornet as having massive explosive potential. While this is true, the thermobaric version has very little penetrative capabilities. It’s unlikely that a thermobaric Kornet would make its way through the hull, though it probably would leave a significant dent or create spalling on the other side. Aircraft carriers face a litany of threats in the modern age, but the U.S. Navy has spent the last half-century thinking of ways to defeat threats to them.

(MENAFN- Nam News Network) TEHRAN, Dec 25 (NNN-TASNIM) – A top Iranian commander, said yesterday that, the five-day drill in the southern parts of the country, was a response to recent threats by Israel. Chief of the Iranian armed forces, Mohammad Baqeri said, recent threats from some Israeli officials prompted the Iranian side to hold the war game, dubbed“Great Prophet 17.” He noted that the war game was among Iran's most successful missile exercises, so far. The drill was held in the Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, and the coastal areas of the southern Iranian provinces of Hormuzgan, Bushehr, and Khuzestan. Yesterday, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), launched 16 ballistic missiles of different classes, during the drill. The footage of the drill showed all the missiles hit the same target simultaneously, Baqeri said. They struck and destroyed the very distant target, he added, noting that, this is only part of Iran's missile power. Also yesterday, IRGC's Chief Commander, Hossein Salami, said, the exercise, particularly its last stage, had conveyed a very clear message and a serious and real warning to Israeli officials. “They must be careful of their mistakes,” he said.– NNN-TASNIM

Topic: Ballistic Missiles Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: IranWar With IranAircraft CarrierU.S. NavyAnti-Ship Missile The succession of Fateh strikes in the last nineteen months signal a new willingness by Tehran to use its ballistic missiles—both those on home soil and deployed to Syria—to pressure adversaries across the Middle East. Here's What You Need To Remember: The domestically-developed Fateh-110 is not Iran’s longest-range missile, but it has nonetheless spearheaded a succession of missile strikes targeting Tehran’s foes since 2017. On the morning of January 20, 2019, a six-by-six Mercedes-Benz truck in al-Kiswah, Syria crewed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps began elevating a missile mounted on its back into firing position. Once the nearly nine-meter long missile attained a roughly seventy-degree angle, it solid-fuel rocket blasted it on an arcing trajectory towards Mount Hermon, twenty-miles to the west on the Israeli-controlled portion of the Golan Height. Skiers vacationing at the ski-resort there could see the contrails of the Fateh-110 (“Conqueror”) missile streaking towards them at three times the speed of sound (video here.) However, the missile was also detected by Israeli radars. As Israel’s David’s Sling anti-ballistic missile system was not yet operational, the IDF made do with the Iron Dome, a system designed for swatting slower, unguided artillery shells and rockets. Two Tamir interceptor missiles rocketed over snowboarderstowards the Fateh missile at Mach 2, switched to electro-optical sensors for terminal guidance and destroyed it. Israeli website Debka claims the attack was ordered by the head of the Iranian Quds force, General Qassam Suleimani, as a means to test Israeli defenses. Later that day, the IDF retaliated with an intense series of strikes in Syria detailed in this earlier article. The domestically-developed Fateh-110 is not Iran’s longest-range missile, but it has nonetheless spearheaded a succession of missile strikes targeting Tehran’s foes since 2017. During the Iran-Iraq War, Iran relied upon Soviet Scud-B missile purchased from Libya (20), North Korea (120, plus 150 more post-war) and Syria (12) to retaliate against Iraq’s larger ballistic missile force. Afterwards, North Korea assisted Iran in setting up production of a domestic Scud-variant called the Shahib-1. However, the Shahib and its successors are liquid-fuel rockets which required days to gas up, limiting their reactivity and leaving them vulnerable to preemptive strikes. Starting in 1995, Iranian engineers began developing the first Fateh missile by adapting an unguided Zelzal-2 610-millimeter long-range artillery rocket, itself a reverse-engineered Soviet Luna-M “FROG” rocket. Chinese experts assisted with installing an inertial guidance system and maneuvering fins to allow the rocket to make course corrections. The initial Fateh missile tested in 2001 had a range of only 130 miles. In the following decade, Iran built and tested three additional generations of improved Fateh-110A, Fateh-110B (or Mod 3) and 110D1 models, eventually boosting range to 180 miles and improving accuracy using GPS-guidance. The Fateh’s payload ranges in size from a 990 to 1,433-pound warhead. Its accuracy remains debated, with claims that a Fateh will land on average within either 100 or 250 meters of its designated target. A 2017 report assessed a total of one hundred Iranian Fateh launchers in service with the IRGC Aerospace Force. Like the Scud tactical missiles which Iraq used to bombard Israel and Saudi Arabi during the 1991 Gulf War, the truck-mounted Fateh can be moved and fired on short notice, making it survivable versus preemptive attacks. However, the missile’s limited range meant that the Fateh could only be used against countries bordering Iran. However, Tehran has also sold the Fateh-110A design for domestic manufacture in Syria under the name M-600 Tisheree. Syria began using M-600s to attack anti-Assad rebels starting in 2012. Since 2007, Damascus and Iran have also transferred Fateh-110s and M-600s to Hezbollah, leading Israel to repeatedly bomb missile transfers because it views solid-fuel ballistic missiles as potential game-changers. Iran’s Carrier-Killing Missiles? The Fateh has spawned a bewildering variety of successors. In 2015 Tehran unveiled the lighter steel/titanium composite Fateh-313 with 310 mile range. Then in August 2018 it announced the Fateh-Mobin (“Bright Conqueror”), which has an infrared-seeker for terminal guidance, and claimed radar-evasive features—though such features were not discernible in the image shown to the public. In 2011, Iran also unveiled an anti-ship version of the Fateh-110 called the Khalij Fars (“Persian Gulf”), ostensibly equipped an electro-optical seeker to allow it hit to home in on a moving naval target, though photographic evidence isunclear on that. An Iranian article claims that in a 2013 test, the missile struck a moving naval target with eight-meters of accuracy (recording here). Anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) are rare and difficult to defend against. China’s development of DF-21D and DF-26 ASBMs has raised concerns about the survivability of aircraft carriers. The Khalij Fars, however, has one-quarter the DF-21’s range at 190 to 220 miles, and relatedly a lower maximum speed of Mach 3 compared to the DF-21’s Mach 10, making it easier to intercept. Like the Chinese missiles, the Khalij Fars would also require external reconnaissance assets to provide initial target-cueing for its inertial guidance system. However, the Khalij Far’s limitations are significantly mitigated by the fact that the Persian Gulf is quite confined, with only between 25 to 250 miles separating the western and eastern shores. Iran also claims to have developed a Mach 4 anti-radiation variant called the Hormuz-1 and Hormuz-2 which are designed to home-in on land- and sea-based radars respectively. If real, these would be the world’s first anti-radiation ballistic missiles. Revenge-by-Missile In 2016, Iran also showed off a modernized “Zolfaghar” variant of the Fateh capable of carrying thirty thirty-seven-pound submunitions, and with a purported range of 434 miles—enough to strike Riyadh from Iranian soil. Later photos suggested the Zolfaghar was made of up filament-wound fiber to reduce weight, thereby increasing range. Skepticism of the Zolfaghar’s reach was largely quashed on June 18–19, 2017 when in retaliation for a terrorist attack on the Iranian parliament that killed eighteen, the IRGC fired six Zolfaghars targeting ISIS-held Mayadin, Syria. The missiles were launched 370 miles away in Kermanshah, Iran—the first missile strike launched from Iranian territory since 2001. Despite Tehran’s claims that all six missiles landed on target, however, the strike’s accuracy was questionable. An assessment by Jane’s suggests only one or two missiles landed in Mayadeen—hitting an open field, causing no casualties. The IDF reported that three missiles landed in Iraq (the border is over forty miles away.) An Iranian general later claimed the Iraqi explosions were casings jettisoned by the missiles prior to impact. Then on September 8, 2018, two months after the IRGC lost ten soldiers in a border skirmish with Kurdish separatists, Iran launched seven Fateh-110B missiles on another cross-border strike targeting the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iran, located in Koya, Iraq. This far deadlier attack killed eighteen Kurds and injured at least fifty. Footage of the strike released by Iranian media depicts two missiles striking a compound, suggesting greater precision. Finally, on October 1, 2018—a week after gunmen massacred twenty-five in an Iranian military parade—the IRGC launched a third cross-border salvo: six Fateh-110 and medium-range Qiam missiles targeting the ISIS-held town of al-Bukamal, Syria. However, two of the Qiam missiles may have crashed during launch (the IRGC claims otherwise). Iran claims the strike killed twenty-five ISIS fighters, but locals and the U.S. military reported the strike inflicted no damage. The succession of Fateh strikes in the last nineteen months signal a new willingness by Tehran to use its ballistic missiles—both those on home soil and deployed to Syria—to pressure adversaries across the Middle East.

News article:
The United States voiced concern on December 30 over Iran's new space launch, saying such activities use technology that can help further its ballistic-missile program. "The United States remains concerned with Iran's development of space launch vehicles, which pose a significant proliferation concern," a State Department spokesperson said after Iran announced it had launched a rocket carrying three satellites. The space launch vehicles "incorporate technologies that are virtually identical to, and interchangeable with, those used in ballistic missiles, including longer-range systems," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also said the launch violated UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which backed the 2015 nuclear deal and called on Iran not to carry out work on ballistic missiles with the potential to carry nuclear warheads. Earlier on December 30, Defense Ministry spokesman Ahmad Hosseini said the rocket used was an Iranian Simorgh (Phoenix) rocket and that the payload reached an altitude of 470 kilometers. It was unclear whether any objects had successfully entered Earth’s orbit. Iran’s Tasnim news agency quoted Hosseini as saying the launch was a “space research mission.” He said the "performance of the space center and the performance of the satellite carrier were satisfactory." State television showed footage of the rocket launching from the Imam Khomeini Spaceport near the northern city of Semnan. The reported launch comes amid difficult negotiations in Vienna between Tehran and world powers over reviving the nuclear deal aimed at restricting Iran's nuclear program. That deal has been under threat since the United States withdrew from it and reimposed sanctions against Iran in 2018. One reason the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump gave for withdrawing from the agreement was concern that it did not restrict Iran’s strategic missile program. Iran has said that it is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons and that its rocket tests do not have military objectives. European delegates to the talks for weeks have warned that they are close to collapsing. In a joint statement on December 28, they said: “We are clear that we are nearing the point where Iran’s escalation of its nuclear program will have completely hollowed out” the 2015 agreement. Iran's chief negotiator at the talks, Ali Bagheri, said on December 30 that the talks had seen some progress. "Some written changes on the lifting of sanctions were established between the two parties and relatively satisfactory progress has been made over the first days of the eighth round of negotiations," Bagheri said in a video published by Tasnim. Negotiations to restore the agreement began earlier this year but were put on hold in June as the Islamic republic held its presidential election, which brought an ultraconservative government led by President Ebrahim Raisi to power. They resumed in late November, and the latest round got under way on December 27. The nuclear deal offered Iran relief from sanctions that have weighed heavily on its economy. Bagheri said on December 30 that the discussions had recently focused mainly on the lifting of sanctions. "We hope that after a few days of pause, more serious work will continue on the question of lifting sanctions," he continued. Talks are due to resume on January 3.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry has stressed that advancement in science and research, including in aerospace field, is an inalienable right of the Iranian nation, lambasting meddlesome comments by the United States over Iran’s recent launch of a satellite carrier. Iran’s Defense Ministry on Thursday announced that the country’s domestically-built satellite carrier rocket, Simorgh (Phoenix), successfully launched three research devices in a space research mission that scored yet another achievement for the Islamic Republic’s civilian space program. Later on Thursday, the US State Department said Washington “remains concerned with Iran’s development of space launch vehicles.” It also claimed that such satellite launches would violate a UN Security Council resolution, calling on the Islamic Republic to steer clear of any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads. On Friday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh condemned comments by the White House, stressing that scientific and research progress, including in the field of aerospace, is the Iranian nation’s inalienable right and that such meddlesome statements would not break Iranians' resolve to progress in that field. “No resolution prevents the Islamic Republic of Iran from continuing its space program and the related experiments, including in the field of satellites-carriers, thus, citing UNSC Resolution 2231 is purely fallacious and fundamentally untrue,” he stressed. “As previously stated, the Islamic Republic of Iran has the right to use peaceful technologies in the path of its scientific-research development according to international standards, and in so doing, it will not await the opinions of some countries that seek to impose their dictates,” Khatibzadeh added. He also paid tribute to young Iranian scientists for their remarkable achievements in the field of aerospace despite illegal and unjust sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic.

Topic: Iran Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: IranAircraft CarrierNavyMilitary The "Elite" Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGC-N) had transformed an old target barge into a large-scale mock-up that loosely resembled the U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. Here's What You Need to Remember: The vessel can reportedly carry out combat, logistical and intelligence-gathering missions and Tehran has said the warship can establish stable security in maritime transportation lines and provide assistance to the commercial and fishing fleets of the Islamic Republic. Warships capable of carrying aircraft are used by navies around the world, but to date, the Iranian Navy isn't one of those countries that operate a carrier. The closest that the Islamic Republic of Iran has come to building an aircraft carrier is to "simulate" an American carrier as a weapons test platform. The "Elite" Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGC-N) had transformed an old target barge into a large-scale mock-up of that loosely resembled the U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. It was used in the February 2015 "Great Prophet IX" exercises and again this past summer in similar exercises. Embarrassingly for the IRGC-N the faux carrier proved difficult to sink – that is until it floundered in waters in the channels near the Iranian naval base at Bandar Abbas. Now, Tehran could be inching closer to developing a true carrier. The Associated Press reported this month that the IRGC-N reportedly launched a heavy warship that was capable of carrying helicopters, drones and missile launchers. From the photographs that have been released online, it appears to be a large cargo vessel rather a true warship. The vessel, which was named after the "martyred" Guard Naval Commander Abdollah Roudaki, was photographed carrying truck-launched surface-to-surface missiles and anti-aircraft missiles. It lacks anything resembling a flight deck and instead has a flat section mid-hull that has been designated as a landing pad for a helicopter. It looks less like a carrier than the First World War era warships that were converted into carriers. According to IRGC-N claims, the Abdollah Roudaki is 150 meters or about 492 feet in length, and displaces some 400 tons – significantly smaller than the 332 meters (1,092 feet) length of an actual Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, and still roughly half the length of the America-class amphibious assault ships. The vessel can reportedly carry out combat, logistical and intelligence-gathering missions and Tehran has said the warship can establish stable security in maritime transportation lines and provide assistance to the commercial and fishing fleets of the Islamic Republic. "Today we are witnessing a combat and logistic support ship join the IRGC's Navy that can both defend itself, defend our interests at sea, and play a role in securing our country's maritime lines near and far," Maj.-Gen. Hossein Salami said during a ceremony earlier this month – as reported by ParsToday. "Some may have thought that the basis of our performance is close-range warfare, but we declare that both close-range combat in far-off areas and long-range combat are on our agenda." Exactly what the purpose of this aircraft carrying vessel is has yet to be seen. One factor could be a matter of internal jurisdiction within the Islamic Republic. While the Iranian Navy patrols the waters of the Gulf of Oman and beyond, the IRGC-N's role has largely been to patrol the waters of the Persian Gulf. Rear Adm. Alireza Tangsiri, commander of the IRGC's Navy, also suggested his force was ready for deep-water patrolling beyond the Persian Gulf. "Presence and assignments in the Indian Ocean is our right." The Abdollah Roudaki could certainly provide the IRGC-N with true blue-water naval capabilities, but driving truck-launched surface-to-surface missile and anti-aircraft missile platforms onto the deck hardly seem to make for a capable warship.

According to IRGC-N claims, the Abdollah Roudaki is 150 meters or about 492 feet in length, and displaces some 400 tons – significantly smaller than the 332 meters (1,092 feet) length of an actual Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, and still roughly half the length of the America-class amphibious assault ships. The vessel can reportedly carry out combat, logistical and intelligence-gathering missions and Tehran has said the warship can establish stable security in maritime transportation lines and provide assistance to the commercial and fishing fleets of the Islamic Republic. "Today we are witnessing a combat and logistic support ship join the IRGC's Navy that can both defend itself, defend our interests at sea, and play a role in securing our country's maritime lines near and far," Maj.-Gen. Hossein Salami said during a ceremony earlier this month – as reported by ParsToday. "Some may have thought that the basis of our performance is close-range warfare, but we declare that both close-range combat in far-off areas and long-range combat are on our agenda." Exactly what the purpose of this aircraft carrying vessel is has yet to be seen. One factor could be a matter of internal jurisdiction within the Islamic Republic. While the Iranian Navy patrols the waters of the Gulf of Oman and beyond, the IRGC-N's role has largely been to patrol the waters of the Persian Gulf. Rear Adm. Alireza Tangsiri, commander of the IRGC's Navy, also suggested his force was ready for deep-water patrolling beyond the Persian Gulf. "Presence and assignments in the Indian Ocean is our right." The Abdollah Roudaki could certainly provide the IRGC-N with true blue-water naval capabilities, but driving truck-launched surface-to-surface missile and anti-aircraft missile platforms onto the deck hardly seem to make for a capable warship.

News article:
Here's What You Need to Remember: In September 2003, U.S. authorities nabbed Iranian Serzhik Avasappian in a South Florida hotel as part of a sting operation. Agents had showed Avasappian several F-14 parts worth $800,000 and arrested him after he offered to buy the components. Tensions have escalated in the Persian Gulf region in the aftermath of U.S. president Donald Trump’s decision unilaterally to withdraw the United States from the agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. military has implicated Iranian agents in several summer 2019 attacks on civilian ships sailing near Iran. The U.S. Navy sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her strike group to the region. The U.S. Air Force deployed B-52 bombers and F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. If war breaks out, American forces likely will attempt to secure Gulf air space by destroying or suppressing Iran’s air forces. The regular Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force and the air wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps militia together operate around 700 aircraft. The IRIAF’s 1970s-vintage F-14s could be U.S. forces’ first targets. According to a survey by Flight Global, the Iranian air force in 2019 operates around 24 F-14 Tomcats from a batch of 79 of the Grumman-made, swing-wing fighters that Iran acquired in the mid-1970s before the Islamic revolution. The U.S. Navy retired its last Tomcat in 2006. But with its long range and powerful radar, the F-14 remains one of the world’s most capable fighters. For that reason, the Americans for many years have been trying to ground the Ayatollah’s F-14s. Sixty-eight of Iran’s F-14s survived the Iran-Iraq War that ended in 1988. Sanctions that the United States imposed after the 1979 revolution prevented Iran from openly acquiring spare parts for the heavyweight fighters. Tehran established self-sufficiency programs—not just in the air force, but across the nation’s economy—in an effort to satisfy material needs that foreign companies had once met. In many sectors, the self-sufficiency initiative worked. Besides producing all its own oil, Iran has declared itself autonomous in agriculture, steel production, electricity generation and civil aviation. But Iranian companies struggled to produce all the specialized parts that the Tomcat requires. Tehran turned to the black market, paying huge sums to shady middlemen to sneak F-14 parts into Iran. American authorities became aware of the illicit trade as early as 1998. In March that year, federal agents arrested Iranian-born Parviz Lavi at his home in Long Island, charging him with violating U.S. export law by attempting to buy up spare parts for the F-14’s TF-30 engine and ship them to Iran via The Netherlands. Lavi got five years in prison plus a $125,000 fine. More arrests followed. In 1998, an aircraft parts vendor in San Diego told U.S. customs officials that Multicore Ltd. in California had requested price information for air intake seals used only on the F-14. Agents arrested Multicore’s Saeed Homayouni, a naturalized Canadian from Iran, and Yew Leng Fung, a Malaysian citizen. “Bank records subpoenaed by the Customs Service showed that Multicore Ltd. had made 399 payments totaling $2.26 million to military parts brokers since 1995 and had received deposits of $2.21 million,” The Washington Post reported . The company shipped parts mostly through Singapore. The feds began investigating 18 companies that had supplied airplane components to Multicore. In September 2003, U.S. authorities nabbed Iranian Serzhik Avasappian in a South Florida hotel as part of a sting operation. Agents had showed Avasappian several F-14 parts worth $800,000 and arrested him after he offered to buy the components. “While these components may appear relatively innocuous to the untrained eye, they are tightly controlled for good reason,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement interim agent Jesus Torres said in a statement. “In the wrong hands, they pose a potential threat to Americans at home and abroad.” Even with U.S. authorities tamping down on the illicit trade in F-14 parts, Iran persisted. After shutting down Multicore, the feds confiscated the firm’s Tomcat components and sent them to the Defense Department’s surplus-parts office. In 2005, a company—allegedly Iranian—bought the very same parts from the military. The parts war escalated after the U.S. Navy retired its last F-14s in 2006, leaving Iran as the type’s only operator. In 2007, U.S. agents even seized four intact ex-U.S. Navy F-14s in California—three at museums and one belonging to a producer on the military-themed T.V. show JAG—charging that the F-14s had not been properly stripped of useful parts that could wind up in Iranian hands. The U.S. Congress was furious at the Pentagon for its lax handling of the F-14-parts problem. Rep. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, described it as “a huge breakdown, an absolute, huge breakdown.” Lawmakers passed a bill specifically banning any trade in Tomcat components to Iran or any other entity, and then-president George W. Bush signed the law in 2008. A minor tragedy unfolded as the military paid contractors to dismantle, crush and shred many of the approximately 150 retired F-14s. Scores of old F-14s—properly “demilitarized”—are still on display in museums across the United States. But none remain at the famous airplane “boneyard” in Arizona, where the Pentagon stores retired planes just in case it needs them again. Even so, the underground trade in Tomcat parts continues, with shady companies scouring the planet for leftover components. In early 2014, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security investigated Israeli arms dealers that it said had twice tried to send F-14 spares to Iran. And in late 2016, an aviation expert from Dallas named Erik Johnston, a representative of the Fort Worth Aviation Museum and a Union Pacific railroad worker discovered the hulks of two old F-14s on private land in Temple, Texas. According to The Houston Chronicle, the F-14s somehow wound up in Temple in the late 1980s after the government paid a contractor to scrap the two jets. It was a suspicious find. Johnston said he was shocked the F-14s for so long escaped the U.S. government’s notice, especially considering Iran’s strong interest in the type. "The thing that kept stumping us — was why the F-14s were there," Johnston mused. David Axe was Defense Editor of the National Interest.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran displayed three ballistic missiles at an outdoor prayer esplanade in central Tehran on Friday as talks in Vienna aimed at reviving Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers flounder. The missiles — known as Dezful, Qiam and Zolfaghar — have official ranges of up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and are already-known models, the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said. Diplomats from countries that remain in the 2015 nuclear deal — Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China — are working with Tehran to revive the accord, which had sought to limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. American diplomats are present at the nuclear talks in Vienna but they are not in direct talks with Iranians. The accord collapsed in 2018 when then-president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. A report by Iranian state television said the missiles on display were the same types as those used to strike US bases in Iraq.

The Iranian military mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 with two surface-to-air missiles after the attacks, killing all 176 people on board. After days of denial, the Guard publicly apologized, blaming an air defense operator who authorities said mistook the Boeing 737-800 for an American cruise missile. An Iranian military court in November held a hearing for 10 people suspected of having a role in downing the Ukrainian airliner.

News article:
The spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Saturday that Iran’s recent show of force in military drills was acting as a deterrent for Israel’s “empty threats” against Tehran. Brigadier General Ramezan Sharif claimed that Israel had subdued its rhetoric against Iran in the wake of military drills held by Tehran. Most recently, Tehran held a five-day annual exercise last month which culminated in the firing of multiple ballistic missiles that generals said were a warning to Israel and included a mock strike on Israel’s nuclear facility. “After the exercise, the Zionists’ prime minister officially ordered their military figures not to talk about Iran at all,” Sharif claimed in an interview with al-Alam news channel, cited by the Fars news agency. Sharif said Iran assessed that Israel was interested in carrying out strikes against its nuclear program, but that the location of the sites would prevent it.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said last month that Israel is “without a doubt not a party to the deal in Vienna if it will happen.” In response to recent public comments by Israel Defense Forces officials that Israel was ready to strike Iran at any moment, Bennett said: “I’m in favor of speaking little and doing a lot.” Associated Press contributed to this report.

Israel has long maintained its opposition to US plans to return to the terms of the original deal and has said it will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said last month that Israel is “without a doubt not a party to the deal in Vienna if it will happen.” In response to recent public comments by Israel Defense Forces officials that Israel was ready to strike Iran at any moment, Bennett said: “I’m in favor of speaking little and doing a lot.” Associated Press contributed to this report.

News article:
Defense Minister Benny Gantz is expected to meet next week with Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, Channel 12 News reported. This will be the second meeting between Gantz and Abbas this year, and comes against the backdrop of a series of lone-wolf terrorist attacks in Jerusalem, including one fatal attack. The purpose of the latest meeting is to strengthen Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, so that Hamas will not be strengthened in Judea and Samaria. Several proposals for security and economic cooperation that will assist the PA in its day-to-day operations will be presented. Regional Cooperation Minister Issawi Frej will also join Gantz in his visit to Ramallah. Frej told Channel 12 News that the situation in the PA is "on the verge of collapse." "The mood of the PA spreads to its citizens. It controls the area through 200,000 salaries, and it does not have the ability to pay it so it pays half salaries, resulting in it having no control over the street." According to him, this is the cause of the current wave of terrorism. Gantz previously met with Abbas in August to discuss measures to strengthen the PA's economy. Following the meeting, Israel agreed to loan the PA NIS 500 million.

News article:
Ramallah - Kifah Zboun Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas suggested to the United States, Egypt, Jordan, and other parties that the negotiations with Israeli parties begin with “border demarcation,” a well-informed Palestinian source told Asharq Al-Awsat. The source added that President Abbas would present his suggestions to the Israeli Defense Minister, Benny Gantz, during their meeting next week in Ramallah. The president will inform Gantz that confidence-building measures and support for the Palestinian Authority (PA) are in no way a substitute for political negotiations, warning that he will resort to measures if the Israeli government does not engage in such talks. The Palestinian source confirmed that Abbas would inform Gantz that the plan he launched at the UN would be implemented if the current Israeli government insisted on following a path away from political negotiations. In September, Abbas launched an initiative during which he gave Israel has one year to withdraw from the Palestinian territory it occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, threatening to withdraw recognition of Israel. The Central Council, the highest Palestinian legislative body, will discuss various options if it holds its upcoming meeting at the beginning of next month. Abbas will meet Gantz next week, accompanied by the Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Issawi Frej. Frej said he believes that the meeting aims to strengthen the PA and calm tensions amid a wave of attacks. The meeting, which will be Gantz and Abbas’ second meeting, is also expected to address security and economic cooperation. In a meeting that aimed to break the deadlock in relations, Abbas first met with Gantz in late August at the presidential headquarters in the central West Bank. After the meeting, Israel authorized permits to work in Israel for an additional 15,000 Palestinian workers. It allowed the Palestinian territories to get 4G cellular service. It also agreed to grant tens of thousands of Palestinians the right to family reunification. But Gantz ignored requests to return the bodies of dozens of Palestinians held by Israel, stop storming Palestinian areas classified as A, work to stop settler violence in the West Bank, and reformulate the Paris Agreements regulating economic relations between the two parties. Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that his government strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state and that state-like entities do not succeed. Bennett also believes that no one in the region believes it is possible to go to a peace negotiation process. Sources confirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat that regional countries, along with the US administration, sent messages to Abbas stating that the current situation does not allow the launch of a political process due to the composition of the current Israeli government. As a result, Abbas decided to present an initiative based on launching negotiations or escalation. “I had a conversation this week with Gantz… and I believe in the coming days there will be an interesting meeting,” Frej told Channel 12 news. Asked if he meant another meeting between the defense minister and Abbas, Frej said the two may “meet again.” The meeting would likely deal with proposals for security and economic cooperation aimed at helping the PA govern in the West Bank and weakening the rival Hamas group. Abbas is trying to push a political solution forward, and for that, he visited Russia, Jordan, Qatar, and other countries. Abbas also requested meetings with Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid. However, it was not clear if Lapid would respond to the Egyptian request to meet Abbas and join Gantz on his visit to Ramallah. Bennett has refused to meet with Abbas so far, considering that it is useless in the current circumstances.

News article:
The Palestinian Authority’s (PA) “foreign ministry” on Wednesday expressed support for Public Security Minister Omer Barlev’s statement on “settler violence”. In a statement quoted by the Walla! Hebrew language news website, the PA called Barlev’s statement an unprecedented “official recognition” of the violence of “settlers” against Palestinian Arabs. "A step in the right direction and first official recognition by Israel of crimes committed by Jewish gangs against Palestinians, but it is not enough," said the PA statement. "We call on the centrist and left-wing ministers in the government to end their silence and declare that they condemn and oppose settler terrorism and attacks on Palestinians, which will help create trust-building measures between Palestinians and Israelis and help create a suitable atmosphere for resolving the conflict," it added. Barlev came under fire on Monday over the comments, which he made following a meeting with US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland. Commenting on the meeting on his Twitter account, Barlev said that the US official was "interested, among other things, in the settler violence and how to reduce tensions in the region and strengthen the Palestinian Authority." Barlev wrote, "I told her that increasing the work permits for Palestinians in Israel, both from Judea and Samaria and Gaza, which we are already carrying out, is a key to reducing tensions, just like implementing the plan to establish a joint industrial zone on the outskirts of Gaza and more. American assistance for such projects can help a lot." The remarks were heavily criticized by politicians from the right, including both members of the opposition as well as members of the coalition such as Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked. Responding on Tuesday to the criticism of his remarks, Barlev tweeted, "I understand that it is really difficult for some of you when a mirror is placed in front of your face about the fact that extremist settler violence crosses the entire world and foreign governments are interested in the issue. I recommend that those who have a hard time with it drink a glass of water. I will continue to fight Palestinian terrorism as if there is no extremist settler violence - and fight extremist settler violence as if there is no Palestinian terrorism." Prime Minister Naftali Bennett tweeted following Barlev’s comments, "The residents of Judea and Samaria have been suffering from violence and terrorism, every day, for decades. They are the defensive wall of us all and we must strengthen them and support them, in words and deeds." He added, "There are marginal phenomena in every public, they should be dealt with by all means, but we must not generalize an entire public." Bennett later picked up the phone and held a clarification conversation with Barlev, in which he told him that "it is not right to generalize entire sectors in an offensive manner." The conversation was held in a good atmosphere and ended with understandings.

© David Goldman/AP Background Backlash "I'm sorry for being blunt, but you are simply contemptible. Hundreds of thousands of heroic residents of Judea and Samaria [Zionist-speak for greater Palestine] absorb terrorism on a daily basis and have paid a heavy price, and you shed their blood with wretchedness and participate in a false and antisemitic campaign that defames them in order to look enlightened and please a bunch of hypocrites. Shame on you, little man." "You are confused, the settlers are the salt of the earth [...] The violence over which we must be shocked is the dozens of incidents of rock-throwing and firing on Jews that happen every day - only because they are Jews, and all this with the encouragement and support of the PA. I recommend that you talk about this violence with Ms. Nuland." Demand for resignation © Activestills Settler violence The latest drama in Israeli politics comes in the form ofover what constitutes "settler violence." As Israeli lawmaker Ofer Cassif said to me during an interview I conducted with him in Jerusalem, the vast majority of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, represents extreme right-wing Zionists.Recently a new storm brewed afterof the Labor Party met with theIn a tweet he posted after the meeting, Barlev said thathimself the son of a retired IDF colonel and former commander of the Sayeret Matkal . In the violent and hate-filled discourse that exists among Israelis, anyone who served, let alone commanded this murderous brigade, is considered a god. Among the Israeli politicians who served in this unit are two former prime ministers:Zionist settlements in the West Bank would not have been possible without the support of the Zionist Labor-Left, who were in power in the years after the 1967 conquest of the West Bank. Labor-Left Zionists were also responsible for the Zionist settlements in the larger part of Palestine that was occupied in 1948. However, for reasons beyond understanding, Labor-Left Zionists abhor the West Bank settlers while they see the pre-1967 settlers as heroes and pioneers.Barlev is a member of the Israeli Labor Party, which is part of the coalition government led by the former head of the West Bank Settlers movement, Naftali Bennett. Zionists who align themselves with the Labor or Meretz political parties, like to think of themselves as better than the settlers who are part of the more blatantly racist and violent Religious-Zionist movement.Religious-Zionist politicians and their supporters immediately came out against Barlev. The leader of the Zionist-Religious Party,tweeted:Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked also distanced herself from Minister Barlev's remarks, tweeting:An attack by Palestinian resistance fighters against Israeli settlers near the city of Nablus in the northern West Bank took place on the night of December 16 and resulted in two settlers injured and one dead. Immediately after this, West Bank settler spokespeople began a campaign of- who, as mentioned earlier, was himself the leader of the West Bank settlements at one point -They all claim that Barlev's comments condemning the violent attacks by settlers against Palestinians somehow encourage and embolden Palestinians to attack Israeli settlers.Truth be told, Palestinians do not need Barlev to motivate them to retaliate against Israeli violence. Be it by soldiers or settler gangs, Palestinians are constantly killed, their property destroyed, their lands taken away and their children detained and tortured. One has to be quite insane to expect that there would be no retribution.What is settler violence?When Barlev and his father before him served in the IDF, they were in fact doing the work of setters and colonizers by terrorizing Palestinians.and as such, they use enormous amounts of violence against a people who have never so much as possessed a tank or a warplane, let alone an actual army.If Under Secretary of State Nuland was really worried about settler violence in Palestine,such as the Palestinian-Bedouin in the Naqab whose homes are demolished at an alarming rate of 2,000 per year.in the cities of Lydd and Ramle and Yaffa to hear about the terror they endure at the hands of Zionist terror gangs.who suffer from settler violence inflicted both by soldiers and by armed Zionist gangs who wear no uniform.The hypocrisy never ends. Now that a Palestinian actually retaliated against Zionist settler violence, there will be even more violence inflicted on Palestinians.

News article:
Mahmoud Abbas held talks with Israel's Benny Gantz at the latter's residence, according to a Palestinian official. Israel said the two discussed "security and civil matters." Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Tuesday during a rare trip to Israel. It was the latest in a series of meetings between top Israeli officials and the Palestinian leader. In late August, the defense minister visited the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the West Bank for talks with Abbas — the first official meeting at such a level in several years. According to a senior Palestinian official, Tuesday's meeting marked the first time Abbas met with an Israeli official in Israel since 2010. The late-night talks took place at Gantz's home in central Israel, a senior Palestinian official said. What did they discuss? "The two men discussed security and civil matters," the Israeli Defense Ministry said in a statement. Gantz told Abbas that he intended to "continue to promote actions to strengthen confidence in the economic and civilian fields, as agreed during their last meeting," it added. Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian civil affairs minister and a key aide to Abbas, said the meeting "dealt with the importance of creating a political horizon" that leads to a political solution in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions. He said the pair discussed "the tense field conditions due to the practices of settlers," adding that the meeting dealt with "many security, economic and humanitarian issues." No ongoing peace process Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said after the meeting in August that there weren't any ongoing peace talks with the Palestinians, "and there won't be one." While the right-wing leader opposes Palestinian statehood, he has said he wants to reduce friction with the Palestinian Authority and improve living conditions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel advances plans for new settler homes To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Israeli-Palestinian relations have substantially deteriorated in recent years. Several instances of violence have been reported in the West Bank in recent weeks, including a series of Palestinian attacks on Israelis as well as a surge in violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians. Peace talks were suspended in 2014, and Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank have since expanded. The Palestinian Authority seeks an independent state that includes all of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. adi/fb (AFP, AP)

News article:
Israel's defense minister approved a raft of measures aimed at improving relations with the Palestinians on Wednesday following a rare meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Israel. Defense Minister Benny Gantz met with Abbas at his private residence in a Tel Aviv suburb late Tuesday night. It was the first time Abbas met an Israeli official inside Israel since 2010. The two discussed security coordination between Israel and Abbas' Palestinian Authority, which administers pockets of the occupied West Bank. Gantz's office said he approved 'confidence-building measures'' including the transfer of tax payments to the Palestinian Authority, the authorization of hundreds of permits for Palestinian merchants and VIPs, and approving residency status for thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel collects hundreds of millions of dollars worth of taxes on behalf of the PA as part of the interim peace agreements signed in the 1990s. The tax transfers are a key source of funding for the cash-strapped Palestinians, but Israel has withheld funds over the PA's payment of stipends to thousands of families that have had relatives killed, wounded or imprisoned in the conflict. Israel says the payments incentivize terrorism, while the Palestinians say they provide crucial support to needy families. Israel approved residency for some 9,500 Palestinians. Israel controls the Palestinian population registry, and over the years its policies have left an estimated tens of thousands of Palestinians without legal status, severely limiting their freedom of movement, even within the occupied territories. Israel granted legal status to some 4,000 Palestinians in October. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is opposed to Palestinian statehood. His government has shown no interest in reviving peace talks, which broke down more than a decade ago, but has said it wants to reduce tensions by improving living conditions in the West Bank. Recent months have seen a surge in violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank and Palestinian attacks on Israelis in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. Gantz's meeting with Abbas, the second in the six months since Bennett's coalition government took office ,drew vocal criticism from Israeli opposition lawmakers, including former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, the largest in parliament. The Palestinians seek an independent state that includes all of the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, areas Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Hamas seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007, a year after the Islamic group won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Right-wing members of Israel’s coalition government criticized Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Wednesday for meeting with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas the day before. Gantz hosted Abbas at his home in central Israel on Tuesday to discuss a number of security and civilian topics. Gantz told Abbas that he intended to continue advancing “confidence-building measures” in the economic and civilian sphere, according to a government statement. “Gantz emphasized the parties’ shared interest in deepening security coordination, maintaining regional stability and preventing terror and violence,” the statement added. Housing and Construction Minister Ze’ev Elkin said that Gantz hadn’t been given authority from the government to conduct political negotiations, “and he knows it,” Channel 12 reported. Furthermore, Gantz’s decision to host Abbas while the latter still supports terrorists demonstrates the defense minister’s “poor taste,” said Elkin. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “It would have been better if he had found another guest,” he said. Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel noted that Abbas still denies the Holocaust, and accused the Palestinian leader of playing “a very strange and double game.” “We have an interest in the Palestinian Authority being strong and stable in its field. We do not trust its people on security issues, but we have an interest in the P.A. not collapsing. If a meeting of this kind helps Gantz—it’s his decision. I personally would not do it,” he said, according to the report. This was the second meeting between Gantz and Abbas. The two met in August in what was the first high-level talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders since 2010.

Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas gave Israel one year to withdraw from occupied territory or he said he would no long recognize the Israel based on pre-1967 borders In a virtual address to the United Nations General Assembly, Abbas called on Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to "convene an international peace conference." But along with that request he also issued an ultimatum. "We must state that Israel, the occupying power, has one year to withdraw from the Palestinian territory it occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem," he said. Abbas added that the Palestinians were ready "to work throughout the year" on solving the final status of the states of Israel and Palestine "in accordance with United Nations resolutions." But "if this is not achieved, why maintain recognition of Israel based on the 1967 borders?" he said. Abbas added that the Palestinians would also go to the International Court of Justice "on the issue of the legality of the occupation of the land of the Palestinian state." The peace process to achieve a two-state solution between in the Middle East has been deadlocked for years. Israel immediately brushed aside the Palestinian leader's demands. Abbas "proved once again that he is no longer relevant," said the Israeli ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan. "Those who truly support peace and negotiations do not threaten delusional ultimatums from the UN platform as he did in his speech," he added. Search Keywords: Short link:

Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas made a rare visit to Israel Tuesday for talks with Defence Minister Benny Gantz, which the defence ministry said focused on security and civil matters. Gantz told Abbas that he intended to "continue to promote actions to strengthen confidence in the economic and civilian fields, as agreed during their last meeting," the ministry statement said. "The two men discussed security and civil matters," it added. Israeli media reported that the meeting took place at Gantz's home in the central town of Rosh HaAyin. In late August, Gantz visited the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah for talks with Abbas, the first official meeting at such a level for several years. But after those talks, hawkish Prime Minister Naftali Bennett underlined that there was no peace process under way with the Palestinians, "and there won't be one". Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Hussein al-Sheikh tweeted on Wednesday that Abbas met with Gantz. "The meeting dealt with the importance of creating a political horizon that leads to a political solution, in accordance with international resolutions," he said. The pair also discussed "the tense conditions on the ground due to the practices of settlers" as well as "many security, economic and humanitarian issues". Israel's right-wing opposition party Likud condemned the latest meeting, saying that "concessions dangerous for Israel's security were only a matter of time". Likud added a dismissive reference to Bennett's governing coalition, which includes an Israeli Arab party for the first time. "The Israeli-Palestinian government has put the Palestinians and Abbas back on the agenda... it is dangerous for Israel," Likud said. Deepens Palestinian divide Palestinian movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also condemned the visit. It went against the "national spirit of our Palestinian people", a Hamas statement read. "This behaviour by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority deepens the Palestinian political divide, complicates the Palestinian situation, encourages those in the region who want to normalise relations with the occupier, and weakens the Palestinians' rejection of normalisation," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. The Gulf Arab states Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco and Sudan, signed US-brokered normalisation deals with Israel during the presidency of Donald Trump. Relations between Israel and the Palestinians deteriorated sharply during Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu's record 12 years as prime minister, up to June this year. US-sponsored peace talks broke down in 2014 as Netanyahu oversaw an intensification of illegal Jewish settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank. Right-winger Bennett, the former head of a settler lobby group who opposes Palestinian statehood, leads a coalition of parties from the Jewish nationalist right and the left and centre. Gantz's meeting with Abbas follows a visit to the region by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. *This story was edited by Ahram Online Search Keywords: Short link:

Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas has told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Israeli raids and other acts of aggression have put the occupied West Bank on the brink of an “explosion.” Abbas told the Russian president during a telephone conversation on Thursday that Israeli settlements, land confiscation, home demolitions and "settler terrorism" are becoming a casus belli for a new revolt in the West Bank, the official Wafa news agency reported. “The continuation of these Israeli measures will lead to an explosion of the situation,” the Palestinian Authority head added. He also rejected “economic and security steps" offered by Israeli leaders, saying they are not "a substitute for the political track." The Palestinian leadership will have to take “key decisions” at an important session of the Central Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) expected to be held in the coming months, he said without elaboration. The remarks came following Abbas' rare visit to Israel on Tuesday for talks with Israeli minister of military affairs Benny Gantz that the Israelis said focused on “security and civil matters”. Abbas said in the absence of a political track, the Israeli regime continues to stifle the Palestinian economy and deduct from tax revenues. Russia is a member of the Middle East Quartet of international mediators, along with the UN, the US and European Union. The Palestinian Authority president said Israel’s endless settlement expansion, its confiscation of Palestinian lands, and its demolition of Palestinian homes and “settler terrorism” are creating an undercurrent of rage and insurrection among the Palestinians. According to figures by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, during the course of the first 10 months of 2021, Israeli settlers carried out 410 attacks against Palestinians, compared to 358 in the whole of 2020. The meeting with Gantz at his home was the first by Abbas since 2010. Months earlier, Gantz visited Abbas in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which rules over the West Bank. Since 1967, Israel has kept expanding settlements in the occupied territories of the West Bank and East al-Quds. Now more than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements, all of which are illegal under international law.

According to figures by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, during the course of the first 10 months of 2021, Israeli settlers carried out 410 attacks against Palestinians, compared to 358 in the whole of 2020. The meeting with Gantz at his home was the first by Abbas since 2010. Months earlier, Gantz visited Abbas in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which rules over the West Bank. Since 1967, Israel has kept expanding settlements in the occupied territories of the West Bank and East al-Quds. Now more than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements, all of which are illegal under international law.

News article:
As details emerged from Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz’s Dec. 28 meeting at his private residence in Rosh Ha’ayin with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, many Israelis were left in shock. According to various reports, Gantz had offered Abbas a series of “confidence-building measures” as described by the Israeli Defense Ministry, which included economic benefits to the P.A. with regard to VAT, import taxes and excise duties; a NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) loan; 1,100 entry permits for Palestinian businessmen; and dozens of VIP permits for senior P.A. officials. Gantz’s other concession to the Palestinians includes the legalization of the status of 9,500 undocumented Palestinians and foreigners living in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. The question many Israelis are asking themselves is, what confidence-building measures did Israel receive from the Palestinians in return? And why is Israel offering so many significant concessions to the Palestinians in the first place? Efraim Inbar, president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, told JNS that the meeting had “a façade of intimacy that is inappropriate.” “All Israelis, including Gantz, should not forget that Abbas is not a friend, but the enemy,” he said. “He is a Holocaust denier, pays salaries to terrorists and refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Inbar also noted that Mahmoud Abbas recently criticized United Arab Party leader Mansour Abbas, a member of Israel’s governing coalition, for admitting he lives in a Jewish state. Gantz’s office published a generic statement devoid of details, saying, “The defense minister emphasized the shared interest in strengthening security cooperation, preserving security stability, and preventing terrorism and violence.” But the details were subsequently publicized. By making these far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians – with no known Palestinian concessions in return – Gantz appears to be violating the 1994 Paris Protocol agreed to between Israel and the P.A. That agreement hammered out the details that would allow Israel to collect taxes on behalf of the P.A. and clarified what services Israel could charge for. Gantz has now made changes to the agreement without bringing any legislation to the Knesset for debate. What also makes this meeting difficult for many to understand is that Abbas is personally leading a campaign to prosecute Gantz in the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. Israeli Housing Minister Ze’ev Elkin of the coalition’s right-wing New Hope party told Radio 103FM on Wednesday, “I wouldn’t have invited to my home someone who pays salaries to murderers of Israelis and also wants to put senior IDF officers in prison in The Hague, including the host himself.” The Likud released a statement calling Bennett’s government “an Israeli-Palestinian government that is returning Abbas and the Palestinians to the agenda… Concessions that will be dangerous to Israeli security are only a matter of time.” However, the meeting was praised by the United States, which has been pushing to renew ties with the Palestinian Authority that had largely been severed under Trump. “We hope confidence-building measures discussed will accelerate momentum to further advance freedom, security and prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike in 2022,” tweeted State Department Spokesman Ned Price. According to Maurice Hirsch, head of legal strategies at Palestinian Media Watch, the aim of the meeting was ostensibly to prop up the P.A. “The problem,” he said, “is the Palestinian people hate the P.A. so much, they would vote for Hamas in a heartbeat because of the perceived and real corruption and the feeling that there is complete and utter nepotism.” By meeting with Abbas and offering such far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians without demanding any concessions in return, Gantz is feeding into the perception of corruption, possibly driving more Palestinians toward Hamas and the terror group’s jihadist ideology against Israel. Hirsch said that the NIS 100 million loan for the Palestinians is “positively going to go to terrorists. It is outrageous.” “By giving money to the Palestinians, Israel is giving up leverage,” he said. Furthermore, Hirsch noted, Gantz is making agreements with the P.A. without any real oversight and without presenting any type of legislation. “It should require a change in the law,” he said. “Gantz is doing everything he can to undermine the law,” added Hirsch. “It is unbelievable how much damage Gantz is doing under the radar and completely without the general public actually knowing what he is doing.” Inbar agreed that Israel is actively supporting the P.A., because it is “afraid of the collapse of the P.A. that serves us well in the short term, sparing Israel the responsibility for managing the lives of the Palestinians.” Additionally, Inbar said, “Abbas exploits the leverage of weakness to get away with many things. Lending the P.A. money is a euphemism for financial support as the bankrupt P.A. has no intention or means to return any loan. Ganz is appropriating funds to the Palestinians, with questionable legal and/or political authority. Ganz is using the fragility of the coalition to pursue policies that are not consensual in the government or outside it.”

Israeli policies risk triggering an “explosion” in the West Bank, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Thursday in a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Palestinian leader told Putin that Israeli settlements, home demolitions and “settler terrorism” were among factors leading to anger in the West Bank, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa said. “The continuation of these Israeli measures will lead to an explosion of the situation,” Abbas told Putin. Russia is a member of the Middle East Quartet of international mediators, along with the United Nations, the United States and European Union. Abbas spoke with Putin two days after meeting with Defense Minister Benny Gantz at his home. Abbas’s visit was the first time the Palestinian leader held official talks with a senior Israeli official inside Israel since 2010. Months earlier, Gantz had visited Abbas in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Following their meeting this week, the Defense Ministry announced “confidence-building measures” to ease the economic situation of the Palestinian Authority and reduce tensions in the West Bank. The US praised the economic measures, but Abbas told Putin they were not enough, according to Wafa. “Economic and security steps are not a substitute for the political track,” Abbas said, adding the Palestinian leadership will have to make “key decisions” at the central council of the Palestine Liberation Organization expected in the coming months. Advertisement Abbas’s conversation with Putin came amid rising tensions in the West Bank. According to the Israeli army’s annual report, 100 attacks were carried out in 2021 against Israelis in the West Bank, up from 60 a year earlier. Palestinian gunmen killed a yeshiva student in the West Bank earlier this month and a Hamas terrorist killed a tour guide in Jerusalem last month. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recorded 410 attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the first 10 months of 2021, compared to 358 in the whole of 2020. Gantz’s office said he and Abbas discussed civilian and security measures Israel can take to strengthen the PA during the meeting this week, while the Palestinian readout said the sides stressed “the importance of creating a political horizon” to end the conflict. Reporting details from the conversation on Wednesday, Israeli channels 12 and 13 quoted Abbas as telling Gantz that he would not support a return to violence in the West Bank, “even if a gun were held to my head.” However, Abbas told Gantz he was concerned about violence erupting in Jerusalem, particularly surrounding the Temple Mount. Abbas told Gantz that if there was a change to religious elements on the holy site it would lead to an “unstoppable” escalation, Channel 13 reported. Advertisement During the meeting Abbas also reportedly asked Gantz to allow greater freedom of action for Palestinian security forces in the West Bank, vowing to crack down on any violence toward Israel. He also asked for the IDF to lower its profile in the West Bank where it has been carrying out a series of raids aimed at uprooting Hamas terror cells. Gantz’s office announced several “confidence-building measures” following the meeting. These include approving the inclusion of 6,000 West Bank residents and 3,500 Gaza residents to the PA’s resident registration on a humanitarian basis; advancing the transfer of NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) in tax payments; and adding 600 BMC (businessman card) approvals for senior Palestinian businesspeople, as well as 500 permits for businesspeople with such approvals to enter Israel with their vehicles, and dozens of VIP permits for PA senior officials. Gantz and Abbas also discussed additional construction plans for Palestinian homes, the defense minister’s office said. The meeting was sharply criticized by hawkish opposition parties, as well as by right-wing members of the coalition, which spans the Israeli political spectrum and has often made policy moves opposed by some of its constituents. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is opposed to renewed peace negotiations with the Palestinians and has refused to meet with Abbas. Nevertheless, his government has pledged to strengthen the PA and its ailing economy, with Gantz spearheading the move. Gantz has said he sees Abbas’s regime as the only alternative to an empowered Hamas terror group in the West Bank. Senior representatives of the US, EU, UN and other countries hailed the rare meeting between Gantz and Abbas.

News article:
Global action offers a cure for Israel’s apartheid variant Chris Doyle Short Url https://arab.news/45a8f What to make of 2021 for Palestinians and Israelis? At many levels, huge changes have altered the political environment, yet where it counts, on the ground, the same inexorable processes have continued. It feels like an alternate reality, but at the beginning of the year, US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled the roost, albeit with both breaking every norm and numerous laws to dodge the looming exit signs. The Israeli leader amped up his arsonist-in-chief act by playing with fire over the fate of the holy sites in Jerusalem and forced dispossession of Palestinian residents. Both still seem to be yearning for their own glorious returns. Netanyahu’s legal troubles appear to be more than a trifle serious. Trump will have to wait another three years for his next tilt, but many believe he could triumph in 2024. The two leaders dominated their political universes, starving their rivals of airtime and attention. Trump, a larger-than-life figure, promised a deal of the century, effectively allowing it to be co-authored by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Netanyahu. It was a deal that was dead on arrival, but its legacy lives on as the Israel far-right’s blueprint. This Trump-Bibi bromance all fell apart when Netanyahu had the temerity to congratulate Joe Biden on his election victory. Trump has since made clear his feelings in unpublishable terms, claiming he has not spoken to Netanyahu since. Populists expect unconditional loyalty, not ideological consistency. Netanyahu used Trump and was only too happy to ignore Trump’s antisemitic remarks and support for white supremacists if it meant backing for his dream of a greater Israel. The process of normalization between Israel and Arabs states has stalled with the two leaders’ political demise. At some point it will resume, but in the meantime, Israeli leaders will bank what they have already achieved. It will not provide peace and genuine security. The Israel political scene would always appear different without Netanyahu at the helm. The new Israeli coalition — from the far right to the left and the Islamists — is for the time being united under the right-wing, pro-settler Naftali Bennett. All share a desire to remain in government and keep Netanyahu out. No one wants to bring the government down because they know the far-right parties consistently hold about 70 seats out of the 120 in the Knesset. It is convenient, too. Each coalition component can claim their own successes and blame failures on the others. It may last longer than many expect. Bennett can present a new face of Israel while using the more diplomatic Yair Lapid as foreign minister to give it a more friendly face. His “shrinking the conflict” mantra, which is nothing more than annexation and apartheid as usual, is a useful tool to calm international nerves. Relax, he is saying, we shall let them have a few more passes and jobs, and these pesky Palestinians will quieten down. Palestinians remain in their fragmented hellscape. The same leaderships are in situ. The much-debated Palestinian elections were postponed through a mix of Israeli obstinacy on denying Palestinians the right to vote and practice democracy in Jerusalem, the Palestinian leadership’s desperate attempt to cling to the pretense of power, and the fear of all parties that Hamas might triumph as it did in 2006. Many skeptics did not believe the elections would have been free or fair in any event. Gaza is still under lock and key; in fact, the walls are being reinforced. Its 2 million inhabitants had not recovered from the previous wars or Israel’s brutal put-down of the Great March of Return in 2018 and 2019 when Israel launched its 11-day carnage in May. Hamas was arguably even strengthened by that, even though the population has had to endure even more miserable conditions. Yet to focus only on the Palestinian leadership’s failings would be to ignore the extraordinary changes in Palestinian politics. The escalation in Jerusalem last April saw a powerful and broad civil society movement connecting all parts of the fragmented Palestinian body politic. Young Palestinians, as they did in the late 1980s during the first intifada, are again setting the agenda, and are fed up with the aging and feckless leaderships. Israel’s response to this has been chilling. It used brutal force to beat up Palestinian demonstrators, while Israeli far-right groups organized “death to Arab” marches in occupied East Jerusalem. At the end of October, it designated six Palestinian human rights and other nongovernmental organizations as terrorist groups. Israeli authorities provided no fresh credible evidence, according to the EU, yet European inaction meant Israel has got away with this. Expect further crackdowns. Israeli settlers were also used to undermine Palestinian resistance and resilience. Settler confidence is rooted not only in their ever-expanding size and number, with a population of over 650,000, but also from the awareness that their actions in harassing and beating up Palestinians, burning their olives and ruining their lives, is part of state-sanctioned policy. Some of the attacks, such as the one on Al-Mufakara village in November, were akin to pogroms, with one 3-year-old boy nearly killed by a stone. The aim is to create a coercive environment to ethnically cleanse Area C of the West Bank from its 300,000 Palestinians. The past 12 months could also be the year of the greatest international inaction since this conflict began. Biden’s mind was elsewhere. At best, his administration sought to put on hold the most devastating doomsday Israeli projects, such as the Atarot settlement, north of Jerusalem. The EU is now divided largely on East-West lines, with the VIsegrad states — the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia — having been successfully courted by Netanyahu. The UK’s position has gradually fallen away to the extent that it no longer seeks to hold Israel to account for its actions in any way. Like the US, Britain appears to regard Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as some internal crowd control issue, rather than one of international conflict and occupation in which it has a legal, historic and moral responsibility to engage. Yet, here again, civil society may pick up the baton. In contrast to the weak and supine international political leadership, major human rights groups are calling Israel out for its actions. For some time, the label of Israeli occupation has been insufficient to describe the appalling reality on the ground, including inside Israel. This year, the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem labelled this a regime of apartheid. Human Rights Watch did likewise and other groups will surely follow in 2022. As the world mourns the passing of the South African religious leader Archbishop Desmond Tutu, it is wise to remember that he opposed apartheid in his own country and in Palestine. It was global civil society action that brought down the South African variant of apartheid; the same may happen to the Israeli variant.

Global action offers a cure for Israel’s apartheid variant Chris Doyle Short Url https://arab.news/45a8f What to make of 2021 for Palestinians and Israelis? At many levels, huge changes have altered the political environment, yet where it counts, on the ground, the same inexorable processes have continued. It feels like an alternate reality, but at the beginning of the year, US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled the roost, albeit with both breaking every norm and numerous laws to dodge the looming exit signs. The Israeli leader amped up his arsonist-in-chief act by playing with fire over the fate of the holy sites in Jerusalem and forced dispossession of Palestinian residents. Both still seem to be yearning for their own glorious returns. Netanyahu’s legal troubles appear to be more than a trifle serious. Trump will have to wait another three years for his next tilt, but many believe he could triumph in 2024. The two leaders dominated their political universes, starving their rivals of airtime and attention. Trump, a larger-than-life figure, promised a deal of the century, effectively allowing it to be co-authored by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Netanyahu. It was a deal that was dead on arrival, but its legacy lives on as the Israel far-right’s blueprint. This Trump-Bibi bromance all fell apart when Netanyahu had the temerity to congratulate Joe Biden on his election victory. Trump has since made clear his feelings in unpublishable terms, claiming he has not spoken to Netanyahu since. Populists expect unconditional loyalty, not ideological consistency. Netanyahu used Trump and was only too happy to ignore Trump’s antisemitic remarks and support for white supremacists if it meant backing for his dream of a greater Israel. The process of normalization between Israel and Arabs states has stalled with the two leaders’ political demise. At some point it will resume, but in the meantime, Israeli leaders will bank what they have already achieved. It will not provide peace and genuine security. The Israel political scene would always appear different without Netanyahu at the helm. The new Israeli coalition — from the far right to the left and the Islamists — is for the time being united under the right-wing, pro-settler Naftali Bennett. All share a desire to remain in government and keep Netanyahu out. No one wants to bring the government down because they know the far-right parties consistently hold about 70 seats out of the 120 in the Knesset. It is convenient, too. Each coalition component can claim their own successes and blame failures on the others. It may last longer than many expect. Bennett can present a new face of Israel while using the more diplomatic Yair Lapid as foreign minister to give it a more friendly face. His “shrinking the conflict” mantra, which is nothing more than annexation and apartheid as usual, is a useful tool to calm international nerves. Relax, he is saying, we shall let them have a few more passes and jobs, and these pesky Palestinians will quieten down. Palestinians remain in their fragmented hellscape. The same leaderships are in situ. The much-debated Palestinian elections were postponed through a mix of Israeli obstinacy on denying Palestinians the right to vote and practice democracy in Jerusalem, the Palestinian leadership’s desperate attempt to cling to the pretense of power, and the fear of all parties that Hamas might triumph as it did in 2006. Many skeptics did not believe the elections would have been free or fair in any event. Gaza is still under lock and key; in fact, the walls are being reinforced. Its 2 million inhabitants had not recovered from the previous wars or Israel’s brutal put-down of the Great March of Return in 2018 and 2019 when Israel launched its 11-day carnage in May. Hamas was arguably even strengthened by that, even though the population has had to endure even more miserable conditions. Yet to focus only on the Palestinian leadership’s failings would be to ignore the extraordinary changes in Palestinian politics. The escalation in Jerusalem last April saw a powerful and broad civil society movement connecting all parts of the fragmented Palestinian body politic. Young Palestinians, as they did in the late 1980s during the first intifada, are again setting the agenda, and are fed up with the aging and feckless leaderships. Israel’s response to this has been chilling. It used brutal force to beat up Palestinian demonstrators, while Israeli far-right groups organized “death to Arab” marches in occupied East Jerusalem.

Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Monday pushed back against criticism of his recent meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, vowing to continue meeting with the PA leader. “I heard the criticism and again say, it’s the one who sends soldiers into battle who’s responsible for doing everything to prevent it,” Gantz said during a faction meeting of his Blue and White party. Gantz hosted Abbas at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin last week, the first time the PA leader met with a senior Israeli official inside Israel since 2010. It was also their second meeting since the new Israeli government was formed in June, with the first sit-down held in Ramallah. The meeting was strongly criticized by right-wing opposition parties and some hawkish members of the ruling coalition, which includes factions spanning the political spectrum and has clashed over various policy matters, including those pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “I was disappointed by cabinet ministers who preferred to speak from a political position at the expense of security needs. Behind closed doors, they sound different,” Gantz said. “For me, whenever the political interest runs into the security interest, security must always prevail.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Gantz said “the need to maintain Israel’s security” was the main focus of his meeting with Abbas, along with countering the Hamas terror group. “And this is the reason I will continue to meet with him and other elements in the region with whom discourse helps our stability, security and interests,” he said. The defense minister said he believed it was in the Palestinians’ interest “that calm create a healthy economy for them with a horizon for a better future.” Advertisement Gantz was also asked if he had sought approval from Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to meet with Abbas or had updated him about the meeting. “The prime minister was updated ahead of time,” Gantz said. “He can think as he thinks. I’m doing my job.” During a press conference Sunday, Bennett said he had given his “full approval” for last week’s meeting. “The defense minister spoke with me in advance and I didn’t see any reason to prohibit [the meeting], including the location,” he told reporters. The prime minister said Gantz and Abbas discussed security and economic matters — not political issues — and reiterated his opposition to personally meeting with the PA chief. Bennett is opposed to renewed peace negotiations with the Palestinians and has refused to meet with Abbas. Nevertheless, his government has pledged to prop up the Palestinian Authority and strengthen its ailing economy, with Gantz spearheading the move. Gantz has said he sees Abbas’s regime as the only alternative to an empowered Hamas in the West Bank. Gantz’s office announced several “confidence-building measures” following last week’s meeting. Advertisement These include approving the inclusion of 6,000 West Bank residents and 3,500 Gaza residents on a humanitarian basis in the PA’s resident registration; advancing the transfer of NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) in tax payments; and adding 600 BMC (businessman card) approvals for senior Palestinian businesspeople, as well as 500 permits for businesspeople with such approvals to enter Israel with their vehicles, and dozens of VIP permits for PA senior officials. Gantz and Abbas also discussed additional construction plans for Palestinian homes, the defense minister’s office said.

News article:
Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Monday he estimated that in the coming year Israel will be accused by the United Nations of conducting a policy of apartheid towards the Palestinians. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter In a briefing with reporters in Jerusalem, Lapid said the impact of such accusations would be felt in international sporting and cultural events and will likely result in efforts to remove Israel from international competitions. 5 View gallery Foreign Minister Yair Lapid during a cabinet meeting last month ( Photo: Gil Eliyahu ) "In my view, without a political process with the Palestinians, things will only get worse," Lapid said. The minister also said Palestinians would increase their pressure on the International Criminal Court in the Hague to launch an active investigation into Israel's conduct in the territories. This will have direct repercussions for Israeli officials, including military leaders, Lapid said. He added the Palestinian efforts will likely also be directed at ICC's chief investigator Karim Khan, who last May replaced Fatou Bensouda , considered by Israel to hold pro-Palestinian views. 5 View gallery The International Criminal Court in the Hague ( Photo: AP ) Lapid told reporters the May 2021 fighting between Israel and the Islamist factions in Gaza was being investigated by a UN commission, which has been given a broad mandate and has no less than 19 dedicated staff. The first draft of the commission's findings will be published next June and officials in Jerusalem expect that its conclusions will, among other things, name Israel an apartheid state. In comparison, he said, the Syrian civil war investigation included only 12 staff members and a much lower budget. The Palestinians also appealed to the UN commission for the prevention of discrimination on the bases of race in 2018, charging Israel was conducting a policy of apartheid towards them. That commission is due to publish its findings in the course of the year and there too, officials believe, Israel will be described as an apartheid state. Palestinians had already requested the ICC to formulate their opinion on whether Israel was racist in its West Bank policies, and although such an opinion would not be legally binding, it would provide legitimacy to such an argument. 5 View gallery A BDS rally in southern France in 2016 ( Photo: citizenside.com ) Lapid said Israel must be careful not to appear to refuse to negotiate with the Palestinians. "This would be factually wrong because the Palestinians speak of advancing a negotiation process on the one hand but appeal to the ICC in the Hague with claims against Israel, on the other." The minister added the PA was also paying stipends to convicted terrorists. "Our enemies know how to hurt us and will try to kick us out of international sporting events, which could be very effective across political lines." Lapid said, adding that accusing Israel of apartheid may become a strategic threat. The minister said the previous government neglected the fight against Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions and the campaign to delegitimize Israel, a matter the current coalition was greatly investing its efforts in. "The claim that Israel is an apartheid state is a disgusting lie. We are dealing with a bunch of anti-Semites and I do not view this lightly." During his briefing, Lapid also referred to the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna and said he believed they would ultimately end with some sort of deal. 5 View gallery World powers hold talks with Iran on a return to the 2015 JCPOA ( Photo: Reuters ) "I hardly know anyone who believes there would not be some agreement. We laid out our view of what we thought should happen if a deal is not reached, including more sanctions. We wanted our view to be on the table," he said. "It would be surprising if no deal is agreed upon," Lapid said. The Americans, he said were working towards a deal, even a partial one. "Our goal is to prevent sanctions being lifted," he said. "Israel has made it clear that if they provide humanitarian aid to Iran – they would enable the regime to divert other funds to their missile program and to terrorism," he said. "Our goal is to be in the room in order to minimize the damage or to see an agreement that we could live with. War might be necessary. "I don't want to criticize the previous government in Israel, but they were wrong to remove themselves from the room where decisions on Iran were being made," he said. The minister said that it was clear that if the Iranians decided to increase its uranium enrichment to 90%, the world would be shaken and return to full sanctions, which is why Israel's policy was to highlight the sanctions issue more than the enriched uranium. 5 View gallery Iranian rocket launched during a military drill last month ( Photo: Reuters ) "We are holding discussions to make access to money more difficult. We are also trying to highlight matters that were missing from the 2015 deal, including Iran's missile program and its support of terrorism," Lapid said. "I don't know what a future deal will include but the Chinese and Russians are leaning more to our side than in the past and we feel we have their attention. Ministry teams are in almost daily contact with the Americans," he said. Lapid said that although he did not think there would be a better nuclear agreement with Iran, as far as Israel was concerned, by participating in a conversation with world powers, Israel stands to be in a slightly better position.

Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Monday he estimated that in the coming year Israel will be accused by the United Nations of conducting a policy of apartheid towards the Palestinians. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter In a briefing with reporters in Jerusalem, Lapid said the impact of such accusations would be felt in international sporting and cultural events and will likely result in efforts to remove Israel from international competitions. 5 View gallery Foreign Minister Yair Lapid during a cabinet meeting last month ( Photo: Gil Eliyahu ) "In my view, without a political process with the Palestinians, things will only get worse," Lapid said. The minister also said Palestinians would increase their pressure on the International Criminal Court in the Hague to launch an active investigation into Israel's conduct in the territories. This will have direct repercussions for Israeli officials, including military leaders, Lapid said. He added the Palestinian efforts will likely also be directed at ICC's chief investigator Karim Khan, who last May replaced Fatou Bensouda , considered by Israel to hold pro-Palestinian views. 5 View gallery The International Criminal Court in the Hague ( Photo: AP ) Lapid told reporters the May 2021 fighting between Israel and the Islamist factions in Gaza was being investigated by a UN commission, which has been given a broad mandate and has no less than 19 dedicated staff. The first draft of the commission's findings will be published next June and officials in Jerusalem expect that its conclusions will, among other things, name Israel an apartheid state. In comparison, he said, the Syrian civil war investigation included only 12 staff members and a much lower budget. The Palestinians also appealed to the UN commission for the prevention of discrimination on the bases of race in 2018, charging Israel was conducting a policy of apartheid towards them. That commission is due to publish its findings in the course of the year and there too, officials believe, Israel will be described as an apartheid state. Palestinians had already requested the ICC to formulate their opinion on whether Israel was racist in its West Bank policies, and although such an opinion would not be legally binding, it would provide legitimacy to such an argument. 5 View gallery A BDS rally in southern France in 2016 ( Photo: citizenside.com ) Lapid said Israel must be careful not to appear to refuse to negotiate with the Palestinians. "This would be factually wrong because the Palestinians speak of advancing a negotiation process on the one hand but appeal to the ICC in the Hague with claims against Israel, on the other." The minister added the PA was also paying stipends to convicted terrorists. "Our enemies know how to hurt us and will try to kick us out of international sporting events, which could be very effective across political lines." Lapid said, adding that accusing Israel of apartheid may become a strategic threat. The minister said the previous government neglected the fight against Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions and the campaign to delegitimize Israel, a matter the current coalition was greatly investing its efforts in. "The claim that Israel is an apartheid state is a disgusting lie. We are dealing with a bunch of anti-Semites and I do not view this lightly." During his briefing, Lapid also referred to the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna and said he believed they would ultimately end with some sort of deal. 5 View gallery World powers hold talks with Iran on a return to the 2015 JCPOA ( Photo: Reuters ) "I hardly know anyone who believes there would not be some agreement. We laid out our view of what we thought should happen if a deal is not reached, including more sanctions. We wanted our view to be on the table," he said. "It would be surprising if no deal is agreed upon," Lapid said. The Americans, he said were working towards a deal, even a partial one. "Our goal is to prevent sanctions being lifted," he said. "Israel has made it clear that if they provide humanitarian aid to Iran – they would enable the regime to divert other funds to their missile program and to terrorism," he said. "Our goal is to be in the room in order to minimize the damage or to see an agreement that we could live with. War might be necessary. "I don't want to criticize the previous government in Israel, but they were wrong to remove themselves from the room where decisions on Iran were being made," he said. The minister said that it was clear that if the Iranians decided to increase its uranium enrichment to 90%, the world would be shaken and return to full sanctions, which is why Israel's policy was to highlight the sanctions issue more than the enriched uranium. 5 View gallery Iranian rocket launched during a military drill last month ( Photo: Reuters ) "We are holding discussions to make access to money more difficult. We are also trying to highlight matters that were missing from the 2015 deal, including Iran's missile program and its support of terrorism," Lapid said. "I don't know what a future deal will include but the Chinese and Russians are leaning more to our side than in the past and we feel we have their attention. Ministry teams are in almost daily contact with the Americans," he said. Lapid said that although he did not think there would be a better nuclear agreement with Iran, as far as Israel was concerned, by participating in a conversation with world powers, Israel stands to be in a slightly better position.

News article:
Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Monday that he would have no problem meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas if the political conditions justified such talks. “It’s not on the agenda, but I won’t rule it out,” he said in a Zoom briefing with Israeli reporters. “There is no justification at this stage.” At the same time, such talks would not deal with a diplomatic solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, as the current government’s policy of not holding final-status negotiations with the PA will remain in place when he becomes prime minister in August 2023, he stressed. “I don’t think that five million Palestinians will disappear, but within the current political context, even after [I rotate in as prime minister], the coalition will be obligated to adhere to already reached agreements, and I will abide by every agreement that I made with my partners,” Lapid said, indicating that part of his agreement with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett upon forming a government was that neither of them would hold peace negotiations with the Palestinians. The focus of the government in its ongoing contacts with PA officials revolves around security cooperation, improving the daily lives of Palestinians, and strengthening the Palestinian economy, he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The government is committed to not doing anything to torpedo the chances for diplomatic talks with the PA in the future, Lapid explained. Lapid’s comments came as Defense Minister Benny Gantz pushed back Monday against criticism of his recent meeting with Abbas, vowing to continue meeting with the PA leader. “I heard the criticism and again say, it’s the one who sends soldiers into battle who’s responsible for doing everything to prevent it,” Gantz said during a faction meeting of his Blue and White party. Advertisement Gantz hosted Abbas at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin last week, the first time the PA leader met with a senior Israeli official inside Israel since 2010. It was also their second meeting since the new Israeli government was formed in June, with the first sit-down held in Ramallah. The meeting was strongly criticized by right-wing opposition parties and some hawkish members of the ruling coalition, which includes factions spanning the political spectrum, and has clashed over various policy matters, including those pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gantz was also asked if he had sought approval from Bennett to meet with Abbas or had updated him about the meeting. “The prime minister was updated ahead of time,” Gantz said. “He can think as he thinks. I’m doing my job.” During a press conference Sunday, Bennett said he had given his “full approval” for last week’s meeting. “The defense minister spoke with me in advance and I didn’t see any reason to prohibit [the meeting], including the location,” he told reporters. Bennett is opposed to renewed peace negotiations with the Palestinians and has refused to meet with Abbas. Nevertheless, his government has pledged to prop up the Palestinian Authority and strengthen its ailing economy, with Gantz spearheading the move. Gantz has said that he sees Abbas’s regime as the only alternative to an empowered Hamas in the West Bank. Advertisement Gantz’s office announced several “confidence-building measures” following last week’s meeting. These include approving the inclusion of 6,000 West Bank residents and 3,500 Gaza residents on a humanitarian basis in the PA’s resident registration; advancing the transfer of NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) in tax payments; and adding 600 BMC (businessman card) approvals for senior Palestinian businesspeople, as well as 500 permits for businesspeople, with such approvals to enter Israel with their vehicles, and dozens of VIP permits for PA senior officials.

News article:
Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz must have known that hosting Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin would arouse the ire of the right. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have cloaked the outcome of his tête-à-tête last Tuesday night with the octogenarian honcho in Ramallah in typically euphemistic language. Following the meeting, Gantz tweeted that he and Abbas had “discussed the implementation of economic and civilian measures, and emphasized the importance of deepening security coordination and preventing terror and violence—for the well-being of both Israelis and Palestinians.” His office subsequently released the details of a slew of so-called “confidence-building measures,” a phony term suggesting some kind of mutual arrangement that actually means Israeli concessions. These include: VAT, import-tax and excise-duty benefits; a NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) loan; more than 1,000 permits for Palestinian businessmen entering Israel by car; dozens of VIP permits for P.A. officials; and the legalization of the status of 9,500 undocumented Palestinians and foreign nationals living in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. The above benefits are in addition to the 500-million-shekel ($160 million) “loan” that Gantz vowed to provide the P.A. after convening with Abbas in Ramallah at the end of August. Despite the left’s fantasy of a return to the misnamed “peace process” that’s been on hold since 2010, the reason for Jerusalem’s unwarranted generosity towards Ramallah over the past few months is that it’s in “Israel’s interest” to keep the financially strapped P.A. from collapsing. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories The tragic irony is that one cause of the P.A.’s dire straits is Israel’s deduction of hundreds of millions of shekels from the taxes on Palestinian imports and exports that it collects on behalf of Ramallah. Offering Abbas compensation for this move—aimed, like the Taylor Force Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 2018, to coerce the P.A. to cease its “pay-for-slay” policy—is a twisted, back-door reversal of sound Israeli legislation. Israel’s decision to undermine a measure designed to curb the incentive of Palestinians to kill Jews is counterproductive. In the first place, Abbas’s sole claim to (minimal) popularity stems from his glorification and funding of “martyrdom.” Secondly, he’s made it abundantly clear that if he had “only a single penny left, it would be paid to families of the martyrs and prisoners.” In other words, while Israel is bent on alleviating the socioeconomic woes of the Palestinians, Abbas wants the cash to maintain his well-oiled murder machine. Aware that he and his Fatah faction were bound to suffer a stinging defeat by Hamas in the P.A. legislative elections slated for last May, he canceled the vote. Attempting to garner international sympathy for the maneuver, he reverted to his default position of blaming the Jewish state, in this case by claiming that Israel was unjustly forbidding eastern Jerusalem Arabs from casting ballots. To enlist support among disgruntled members of his populace, he tried to prove that he was just as radical, if not more, than his Hamas rivals. It’s one task that the champion of Jew-killers doesn’t find terribly hard to perform. This isn’t news to Israelis of any stripe, including those on the far left. The dispute lies in whether or not Abbas has just cause for his violent agenda. You know, due to the “occupation.” Apologists point to Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and insist that harmony will reign once Israel withdraws to the pre-war borders. Abbas’s speeches in Arabic, along with the messages conveyed through the media outlets and education system that he controls, cite the nakba (“catastrophe”) of Israel’s establishment in 1948. In this respect, he is no different from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad—and their patron, Iran—which make no bones, in any language, about their intention to rid the world of the Jewish state. In fact, P.A. maps depict all of Israel as “Palestine”—and a judenrein one, at that. This brings us back to Gantz. Whatever he may have told himself and others about what took place during his latest session with Abbas, it certainly wasn’t “confidence building.” On the contrary, after the meeting, Abbas immediately proceeded to prepare for the 57th anniversary of the launch of Fatah and the organization’s first attack on Israel—the Jan. 1, 1965 attempt to blow up the country’s National Water Carrier. Never mind that this was two and a half years before the Six-Day War; Abbas realizes that his backers at the United Nations and in the current administration in Washington don’t bother doing the math. At the celebratory event on Friday, a mere three days after extracting valuable promises from Gantz, the terrorist-in-a-tie accused Israel of “hideous policies of ethnic cleansing and organized terrorism.” According to The Jerusalem Post’s Khaled Abu Toameh, Abbas declared: “The anniversary of the launch of our revolution comes under extremely critical and difficult circumstances, due to the continuation of the heinous Israeli occupation, the escalation of its repressive practices and persecution of our people, the theft of our land and natural resources, the stifling of our economy, the withholding of our tax funds and racial discrimination.” He failed, of course, to mention his meeting with the Israeli defense minister, which, according to Abu Toameh, was strongly condemned by several Palestinian factions and activists. Gantz, on the other hand, took the opportunity of the aftermath of Abbas’s visit to his house to announce: “Only those who are responsible for sending soldiers into battle know how deep the commitment is to prevent it. This is how I have always acted, and this is how I will continue to act.” In light of his silence in the face of Abbas’s belligerent remarks, we believe him.

Attempting to garner international sympathy for the maneuver, he reverted to his default position of blaming the Jewish state, in this case by claiming that Israel was unjustly forbidding eastern Jerusalem Arabs from casting ballots. To enlist support among disgruntled members of his populace, he tried to prove that he was just as radical, if not more, than his Hamas rivals. It’s one task that the champion of Jew-killers doesn’t find terribly hard to perform. This isn’t news to Israelis of any stripe, including those on the far left. The dispute lies in whether or not Abbas has just cause for his violent agenda. You know, due to the “occupation.” Apologists point to Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and insist that harmony will reign once Israel withdraws to the pre-war borders. Abbas’s speeches in Arabic, along with the messages conveyed through the media outlets and education system that he controls, cite the nakba (“catastrophe”) of Israel’s establishment in 1948. In this respect, he is no different from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad—and their patron, Iran—which make no bones, in any language, about their intention to rid the world of the Jewish state. In fact, P.A. maps depict all of Israel as “Palestine”—and a judenrein one, at that. This brings us back to Gantz. Whatever he may have told himself and others about what took place during his latest session with Abbas, it certainly wasn’t “confidence building.” On the contrary, after the meeting, Abbas immediately proceeded to prepare for the 57th anniversary of the launch of Fatah and the organization’s first attack on Israel—the Jan. 1, 1965 attempt to blow up the country’s National Water Carrier. Never mind that this was two and a half years before the Six-Day War; Abbas realizes that his backers at the United Nations and in the current administration in Washington don’t bother doing the math. At the celebratory event on Friday, a mere three days after extracting valuable promises from Gantz, the terrorist-in-a-tie accused Israel of “hideous policies of ethnic cleansing and organized terrorism.” According to The Jerusalem Post’s Khaled Abu Toameh, Abbas declared: “The anniversary of the launch of our revolution comes under extremely critical and difficult circumstances, due to the continuation of the heinous Israeli occupation, the escalation of its repressive practices and persecution of our people, the theft of our land and natural resources, the stifling of our economy, the withholding of our tax funds and racial discrimination.” He failed, of course, to mention his meeting with the Israeli defense minister, which, according to Abu Toameh, was strongly condemned by several Palestinian factions and activists. Gantz, on the other hand, took the opportunity of the aftermath of Abbas’s visit to his house to announce: “Only those who are responsible for sending soldiers into battle know how deep the commitment is to prevent it. This is how I have always acted, and this is how I will continue to act.” In light of his silence in the face of Abbas’s belligerent remarks, we believe him.

News article:
Israeli Foreign Minister on Monday called for a diplomatic dialogue with the Palestinians, citing concerns that otherwise international organizations may designate Israel and apartheid state. In a press briefing, Lapid said the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet would soon convene to discuss a scenario in which the Palestinian Authority announced it was willing to start talks with Israel. Citing an “intelligence-based assessment,” he said that Israel should expect to see a significant increase in allegations from the Palestinians and their supporters that Israel was an apartheid state. If the situation were to deteriorate, Israeli sports and cultural institutions would be the first to be impacted, he said. Lapid noted the Foreign Ministry would focus a large part of its efforts on contending with such anti-Israel campaigns in the new year. Foreign Ministry Director-General Alon Ushpiz told reporters: “In the coming year, we expect to see resolutions and processes with the potential to cause significant damage, and there is real danger an official U.N. body will determine Israel is an apartheid state.”

News article:
Israel’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid raised a concern about what he predicts will be an intensified campaign to label Israel an apartheid state. He said, “In 2022, it will be a tangible threat.” If Lapid is right, and I believe that he is, Israel will have to fight back against this threat, but simply mounting a public relations campaign to counter the accusation will not work. When one looks at Israel’s ethnic and religious diversity and at its laws and policies that do not typically discriminate against citizens based on those grounds, labelling Israel an apartheid state is not credible, especially if we compare Israel to the Arab states around it. The accusation, however, is far more credible if one considers the West Bank to be part of Israel. In that case, Israel has within it stateless Palestinian who don’t have the option of applying for Israeli citizenship and who consequently can never expect to have the same rights as the Israelis who live next to them in the West Bank. But is the West Bank part of Israel? There is overwhelming evidence that for all intents and purposes, it very much is. First, there is the fact that Israel’s population in the West Bank is at half a million and still growing, which is over 5% of Israel’s population (which is similar to the state of New York compared to the US population). By continuing to build settlements on that land, Israel is giving a not-so-subtle indication that it wants to keep it. Many settlers are even quite blunt about it. Rabbi Elishama Cohen, for example, claims, “this place is fully ours” when referring to the illegal settlement of Homesh. It is sometimes argued that almost all Israeli settlements are near the Green Line (the 1949 armistice lines) and are expected to become part of land swapped with the Palestinian state when a peace agreement is signed. However, a look at a map of the settlements indicates that the settlements are all over the West Bank. It is not reasonable to expect that a Palestinian state would be composed of many disconnected patches of land, nor is it reasonable to assume that dozens of Jewish settlements would agree to be absorbed into a Palestinian state or that the Palestinian state would agree to absorb them. In fact, as written in the Jewish Virtual Library, some settlements were created by the Israeli government in order to “solidify Israel’s hold on territory that was part of biblical and historical Israel and pre-empt the creation of a Palestinian state.” As the Jewish Virtual Library states, “The changing demographic picture in the West Bank makes the prospect of a two-state solution based on anything like the plans promoted by Clinton or Obama highly unlikely. It is hard to imagine any Israeli government that would be willing to force 90-140,000 Jews from their homes […] The situation will only become more complicated as the number of settlers continues to grow.” Israel’s own actions leave no doubt that it considers the West Bank as part of Israel. For example, Israel’s anti-BDS law passed in 2011 by the Knesset makes no distinction between boycott of Israel and boycott of the settlements. In fact, the law says, “the State of Israel, one of its institutions or an area under its control,” which includes the West Bank. Another example is that Israel insists on calling products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank as “Made in Israel”. It was even able to convince the Trump administration to go along with that policy. Some people argue that the expansion of settlements is the fault of the Arab refusal to make peace and the fault of Palestinian terrorism. After all, there were no settlements in the West Bank in 1967 when Israel won the Six Day War and indicated its willingness to negotiate peace with the Arab world, which the Arab world rejected. And there were only 200,000 settlers in the West Bank in the year 2000 when Israel negotiated a two-state solution in the form of the Clinton plan and which the Palestinians rejected. However, while the Arab refusal to make peace allowed Israel to build settlements in the West Bank, it certainly didn’t force Israel to do so. One can argue that Israel needed to maintain military presence in the West Bank due to security concerns, but that need does not extend to building settlements. In the end, however, regardless of the reasons why the settlements were built, their existence now and the way they are treated by Israel makes the West Bank part of Israel, which means that unless Israel makes dramatic changes to its policies in the West Bank, fighting against the apartheid accusation is futile. Many Israelis argue that the West Bank is in fact Judea and Samaria (roughly, Judea is the part of the West Bank that is south of Jerusalem, and Samaria is the part of the West Bank that is north of Jerusalem), which is traditional Jewish land, and that it therefore legitimately belongs to Israel. There are also legal arguments that justify such an opinion, which are explained briefly by the Jewish Virtual Library. Based on this, Israel may be justified in annexing the West Bank; however, if it does that, it knows that it would have no choice but to offer citizenship to its Palestinian residents (otherwise Israel would without a doubt be a form of apartheid state), which would significantly weaken the Jewish majority in Israel. Israel also knows that it would face stiff international condemnation for such a unilateral move. Advertisement Consequently, Israel tries to have its cake and eat it too. It treats the West Bank as if it was part of Israel while avoiding the risks and pains associated with outright annexation. One can argue that this is not a great crime, especially compared to crimes perpetrated against the Jews, including by Palestinian terrorists, but that does not weaken the apartheid accusation. In other words, Israel can either behave as if it was an apartheid state or it can credibly claim not to be an apartheid state, but it cannot do both. If Israel is serious about fighting against the threat that Lapid has identified, it must immediately and significantly change its policies in the West Bank. It must freeze settlement growth in the West Bank outside of large blocks that are reasonably expected to remain part of Israel, it must unconditionally shut down illegal outposts, and it must start planning how it will handle settlements that cannot reasonably remain part of Israel. If Israel does not take these actions, it is tacitly accepting that the West Bank is part of Israel, and therefore it is giving up on fighting the apartheid accusation. As Lapid implied, this accusation will likely cost Israel precious support internationally and most importantly among Americans. Unless it changes course in the West Bank, Israel is putting its own future at significant risk.

News article:
Foreign Minister Yair Lapid reportedly met with Palestinian Authority General Intelligence chief Majed Faraj late last month as some members of the new government continue to expand their contacts with the PA leadership. According to Hebrew media reports on Wednesday, the two discussed economic and security matters, namely the security coordination between Jerusalem and Ramallah, which has long been credited for maintaining relative calm in the West Bank. Lapid and Faraj did not discuss diplomatic affairs, Haaretz reported, citing Israeli sources. This has become a main talking point from Jerusalem after meetings with PA officials in recent months, given Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s opposition to Palestinian statehood. However, PA readouts from such sit-downs, including last month’s meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Benny Gantz, insist that the sides discussed building a horizon to end the conflict. Lapid said last week that he would have no problem meeting with Abbas if the political conditions justified such talks when he becomes prime minister under the rotation agreement in August 2023. “It’s not on the agenda, but I won’t rule it out,” he said in a Zoom briefing with Israeli reporters. “There is no justification at this stage.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms At the same time, such talks would not deal with a diplomatic solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, as the current government’s policy of not holding final-status negotiations with the PA will remain in place, he stressed. “I don’t think that five million Palestinians will disappear, but within the current political context, even after [I rotate in as prime minister], the coalition will be obligated to adhere to already reached agreements, and I will abide by every agreement that I made with my partners,” Lapid said, indicating that part of his agreement with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett upon forming a government was that neither of them would hold peace negotiations with the Palestinians. The focus of the government in its ongoing contacts with PA officials revolves around security cooperation, improving the daily lives of Palestinians, and strengthening the Palestinian economy, he said. Advertisement The government is committed to not doing anything to torpedo the chances for diplomatic talks with the PA in the future, Lapid explained. Lapid’s comments came as Gantz pushed back against criticism of his recent meeting with Abbas, vowing to continue meeting with the PA leader. Gantz hosted Abbas at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin last month, the first time the PA leader met with a senior Israeli official inside Israel since 2010. It was also their second meeting since the new Israeli government was formed in June, with the first sit-down held in Ramallah. The meeting was strongly criticized by right-wing opposition parties and some hawkish members of the ruling coalition, which includes factions spanning the political spectrum, and has clashed over various policy matters, including those pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bennett said he had given his “full approval” for Gantz’s meeting. “The defense minister spoke with me in advance and I didn’t see any reason to prohibit [the meeting], including the location,” he told reporters. Bennett is opposed to renewed peace negotiations with the Palestinians and has refused to meet with Abbas. Nevertheless, his government has pledged to prop up the Palestinian Authority and strengthen its ailing economy, with Gantz spearheading the move. Gantz has said that he sees Abbas’s regime as the only alternative to an empowered Hamas in the West Bank. Advertisement Gantz’s office announced several “confidence-building measures” following the meeting. These include approving the inclusion of 6,000 West Bank residents and 3,500 Gaza residents on a humanitarian basis in the PA’s resident registration; advancing the transfer of NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) in tax payments; and adding 600 BMC (businessman card) approvals for senior Palestinian businesspeople, as well as 500 permits for businesspeople, with such approvals to enter Israel with their vehicles, and dozens of VIP permits for PA senior officials.

Amid the segments of Israeli society that are widely known dwells a smaller population that ostensibly looks and acts like everyone else — its members pay taxes and serve in the defense of the country. They are excluded from key aspects of Israeli society, however, in an “othering” of people that has to end. The State of Israel is home to many citizens who think of themselves as Jews, but who are not considered Jewish by Jewish law (halakhah), and therefore have always officially been designated “Other” by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Specifically, the vast majority of this demographic are born to a Jewish father, but not to a Jewish mother. Of course, Arab and Druze Israelis have their own proud identities, but this population is not Arab or Druze either. Indeed, its members too often fall between the cracks. The question of how to relate to those who have Jewish ancestry and want to be part of the People of Israel, when they are not halakhically Jewish, is not a new one. In the 16th century, Rabbi Moshe Isserles, a major figure in the world of Jewish law, speculated whether a son born to a gentile mother and a Jewish father could be considered “rabbinically Jewish,” even though the rabbis thought such a person was not Jewish according to the Torah itself. More recently, Rabbi Benzion Uziel, the first Sephardi chief rabbi of the State of Israel, maintained that those who were Jewish only by “patrilineal descent” should be accepted for a streamlined process of conversion, basically fast-tracking them to join Israeli Jewish society as full-fledged members. In the current era, many Israeli immigrants from the former Soviet Union were born to Jewish fathers and non-Jewish mothers. In their countries of origin, they identified and were identified as Jews, and not always in a good way. Many only discovered that they were not considered fully Jewish upon arrival to Israel. Contrary to popular opinion, the majority of this population did not come to Israel purely for economic reasons. Many had other options, whether in Germany, Canada, or other places that welcome Jews from the former Soviet Union. They came to Israel because they felt the pull of the Jewish state, just as millions of others have since its establishment. Because of their strong Jewish identity, we need to find language that embraces and incorporates these people, and which makes them realize that Israel includes them in the Jewish nation, even if they are not, before formal conversion, fully recognized as Jewish. They are our partners, and we should use positive and inclusive language rather than the language of exclusion. I am therefore delighted that the CBS has said that, upon my request, it will end the use of the term that has been in use for this population, “Other,” and create a new category of “Extended Jewish Population.” As a Jewish state, we naturally want the identity of these people to be bound up with our national identity. We also must look to the future. The last great reservoir of potential aliyah is from North America. In the event that increasing numbers of North Americans ever seek to make aliyah, Israel will surely see an influx of those who are intermarried, or are the children of intermarriage. As statistics make abundantly clear, the majority of Jews today and the overwhelming majority of Jews in the future, will not marry other Jews. While we hope that Jewish communities will continue to flourish around the world, Israel will always keep its gates open for aliyah, and that means we need to face this reality of intermarriage, and be more inclusive, so the non-Jewish partners and children of these marriages feel a part of the Jewish state. Perhaps the steps we are taking now in Israel will open a new discussion on this issue in the Diaspora. Advertisement As an Orthodox Jew, I am strongly in favor of Jewish intra-marriage, but as a politician, it is my job to find solutions to challenges — and not ignore them in the hope that they will go away. We want to help anyone who seeks to convert, but even if those of patrilineal descent do not want to do so, we must make them feel that they have a connection to the national majority and foundational pillars of our Jewish and democratic state. We want them to feel pride in our national flag with its Star of David and the azure blue stripes, in the national symbol of the menorah, and the national anthem that talks of “the Jewish soul.” We absolutely must find a solution for those who are not Jewish, as defined by Jewish law, and yet are eligible to make aliyah under the Law of Return. For this to happen, we must employ different language that makes those of patrilineal descent feel like the extended family of the rest of the Jewish people. They are our friends, our IDF comrades, our colleagues, and people we see every day. They make up around five percent of the population and contribute in every field towards the development, progress and flourishment of our nation. Changing these people’s designation from “Other” to “Extended Jewish Population” in the Central Bureau of Statistics is the necessary first step toward increasing their feelings of inclusion.

News article:
Clashes between Israelis and Palestinians are nothing new. These episodes have been happening since the Zionist militias started the Nakba in 1948 with the violent expulsion of more than 750,000 Palestinians and the destruction of more than 140 towns and villages. This ethnic cleansing campaign made way for the Ashkenazi, Khazar and Sephardi Jews, displaced from Europe, to settle in historical Palestine. The episodes of direct confrontations in May 2021 between Palestinian resistance forces and Israel reignited the debate on the legitimacy of each and the effectiveness of a lasting peace agreement between the two parties. As usual, the mainstream media lavishly trumpeted the chant about "Israel's right to defend itself", while continuing to treat resistance forces, especially the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, as responsible for aggression and "terrorism". In January 2020, former US President Donald Trump, without the participation of Palestinians, announced an arrangement termed the "deal of the century". Trump's proposition was a unilateral initiative arising from pressure from the US Jewish lobby aimed at continuing the annexations of Palestinian territories and recognising and legalising the crimes that the Jewish state has been committing since 1948. What appeared to be an alternative to "lasting peace" was, in fact, a macabre plan to end Palestine as a nation. The colonialist plan did not end after the self-proclamation of the Jewish state nor with the massacre perpetrated during the so-called Six-Day War, or with the occupation of the Gaza Strip, Sinai (Egypt) and the Golan Heights (Syria). Israel continues to carry out the process of complete Judaisation of Palestine in all fields, adopting legislation such as the Basic Law of the Nation-State passed by the Knesset on 19 July, 2018, through which it legally became an exclusive state for Jews. As can be seen, the goal of the Israeli occupation is the complete destruction of Palestine so that there is finally the establishment of a state of Jewish supremacy in the occupied territories, without defined borders and in permanent expansion. The intention is to transform what is left of Palestine into small islands of land as if it were a mini-state – pulverised, surrounded and suffocated by the occupier on all sides. A new Hamas programme was approved in 2017 and called the General Document of Principles and Policies. It asserts that the establishment of the so-called "State of Israel" based on unilateral decisions is completely "illegal, infringes the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, and goes against their will and the will of the Nation,"[1] as it is a violation of human rights and the right to self-determination. Hamas has declared that it will not recognise Israel or anything that happened in Palestine in terms of occupation. This includes the construction of colonial settlements, the Judaisation of historical and sacred places and the change in characteristics or falsification of historical and cultural facts. It understands that Palestinian rights over their land and places will never lapse. The Hamas programme rejects a lasting solution other than the liberation of Palestine "from the river to the sea", without compromising its rejection of Israel and without abandoning any rights of the Palestinians. It agrees with the establishment of a Palestinian state along the borders of 4 June, 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital and the return of refugees and displaced people from their homes, from which they have been expelled since 1948. The leadership of Hamas has declared that it is committed to the re-establishment of relations and joint actions by Palestinian organisations based on pluralism, democracy, national partnership, acceptance of the other and the adoption of dialogue. The aim is to strengthen the unity to meet the aspirational needs of the Palestinian people, as occurred in the historic meeting of 5 September, 2020, when the main Palestinian forces came together for a joint initiative to contest the Israeli occupation. Some insist on the thesis of the alleged attempt by Hamas to delegitimise the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). However, the movement shows the recognition of the organisation in its programme, stating that it is a reference for the Palestinian people that needs to be preserved, developed and rebuilt on a democratic basis, inside and outside Palestine, to ensure the participation of all forces fighting to protect the rights of Palestinians. While Palestinians seek solutions to end the colonial apartheid of the "Jewish state", Zionist leaders deny, by all means, the most elementary rights of Palestinians. This can be seen in the statements of the current premier, Naftali Bennett, who said in 2018 that he "wouldn't give an inch of land to the Arabs" and told US magazine The New Yorker in 2013: "I will do everything in my power so that they never have their own state." For these and other reasons, Palestinians do not trust the Zionists. They do not comply with agreements, such as the Oslo Accords, which have become a dead letter without recognising the right of existence of the Palestinian state. After Oslo, Israel accelerated the expansion of the occupation, the creation of Jewish colonial settlements, the confiscation of land, the creation of quotas for exports to the Israeli market and control on the import of agricultural machinery and tools, which ended up ruining Palestinian agriculture. Despite this, there are still those who advocate the recognition of Israel by the Palestinian resistance as a pre-condition for the existence of "lasting peace agreements". There are also those who support normalisation to take effect when it is known that this arrangement is ineffective for the simple realisation that Israel will not stop the occupation at a negotiating table. Such rhetoric serves the interests of the Israeli occupation, which is aware of its inability to win new battles against the Palestinian resistance. To accept the occupier's reality is to annihilate the dream of freedom and liberation, betraying the martyrs and those who fought long and hard for freedom, self-determination and dignity. This would betray the principles of legitimate resistance to achieve what is enshrined in international law and the Charter of the United Nations. [1]TENÓRIO, Sayid Marcos.

News article:
The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas adopted a new programme in May 2017, in which it declares itself a Palestinian national, Islamic, liberation and resistance movement that aims to liberate Palestine and confront the Zionist colonial project of the so-called "Jewish State". According to the movement's programmatic definition, Palestine is the land and home of the Palestinian people. It is a holy and blessed Islamic Arab land that has a special place at the heart of the Islamic Ummah, formed from the territory that extends from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean in the west, and from Ras Al-Naqurah in the north to Umm Al-Rashrash in the south. The movement declares that the colonial occupation of historical Palestine, as well as the expulsion and banishment of the Palestinian people that began with the Nakba in 1948, does not nullify the right of the Palestinian people to the entirety of the land. At the same time, it does not recognise any right of the Jewish state over it. Would these programmatic formulations be contrary to the right of Israel to exist? For Hamas, regardless of the catastrophes that have befallen the Palestinian people since 1948, Palestinian identity will not be erased or denied due to the partition, occupation and Zionist policy of displacement and ethnic cleansing. Palestinians will never lose their national identity and rights, even if they acquire a second nationality. The movement's programme clarifies that the conflict in occupied Palestine is based on the struggle against the Zionist colonial project, and not against the Jews. The resistance understands that peace and security will not be achieved without eliminating the underlying causes of injustice and tyranny. This is because Israel is a colonialist entity that imposes an illegal occupation of Palestine and subjects the Palestinian people to oppression, siege, daily humiliation and systematic human rights violations. Against that, Hamas promises to fight hard. In the new programmatic formulation, Hamas maintains that Israel is not a normal state, but an occupation of Ashkenazi, Khazar and Sephardic Jewish settlers brought from Europe, created during the mass expulsion and expropriation of the Palestinian people. Since 1948, millions of Palestinians have continued to be victims of occupation, exile and dispersion. In this case, Hamas advocates that recognising Israel would mean legitimising all the Zionist claims and myths on which the creation of the State of Israel is based. READ: UNRWA condemns Israel's demolition of Salhiah family home in Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood The relationship between the Palestinian people and Israel is not a relationship between sovereign states. It is a relationship-driven by Israeli colonialism, military expropriation and occupation and the Palestinians' struggle for freedom and self-determination. That is the reality, and there is no way around it. Asking Palestinians to recognise Israel's occupation would be tantamount to asking black South Africans to recognise the legitimacy of the white South African apartheid regime, or to hope that the Algerians would recognise the French occupation during their war of national liberation. For Palestinians, to accept the reality of their occupier and oppressor is to abandon the dream of freedom and liberation. It would betray those who fought long and hard for their freedom, self-determination and dignity, and the very principle of the universal struggle for justice and freedom – premises enshrined in the divine treaties, international law and the United Nations Charter. The movement's leaders say that it is possible to recognise their friends, but it is rather absurd to accept the legitimacy of their enemies. They consider it ludicrous to use the recognition of Israel as a precondition for "peace agreements" or "normalisations" to take effect when it is known that Israel remains with its systematic actions of injustice and oppression against Palestinians while continuing to expand occupation. The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) recognised the "State of Israel" in 1988 and reiterated this recognition in the Oslo Accords in 1993, in addition to promoting various peace initiatives with Israel since the Madrid Conference in 1991. One must ask: what did these negotiations and this recognition give Palestinians? Israeli governments never respected the terms of the agreements. Israel has never recognised the Palestinian people's legitimate historical and political rights to land and to return, nor their moral, political and legal responsibility for the expropriation of land and the expulsion of Palestinians. On the contrary, Israel continues to attack the Palestinians militarily with massive aggressions – seizing land, building new and expanding illegal Jewish colonies, besieging Gaza and systematically violating the human rights of Palestinians. There are more than 4,600 political prisoners, including 160 children, 34 women, 547 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment, and nine members of the Palestinian Legislative Council legitimately elected in 2006 in prisons. It is estimated that since the Nakba, more than one million Palestinians of all ages have passed through Zionist prisons. OPINION: Palestinians don't need Israel investigated, they need justice Based on the experience of these "peace agreements" and other negotiations with the Zionist occupier, there is an abundance of evidence that these initiatives have failed to bring back the rights of the Palestinians, nor did they guarantee the effectiveness of the various UN resolutions that could restore these rights. The main problem is not the negotiations, but the fact that Israel does not recognise any of the Palestinian rights. Israel simply does not abide by the agreements. It continues to transgress what was agreed upon and advances even further with its aggressive colonialist policies in the Palestinian territories. From the viewpoint of the Palestinian resistance, it would be unthinkable, immoral and unfair to expect Palestinians, who are continually oppressed and subjugated by the Israeli military occupation, to capitulate to Israel's humiliating conditions. There is no precedent in modern history in which a people consented to the theft of their homeland without resisting. The people of Palestine have demonstrated for 73 years that they are no exception.

It is a holy and blessed Islamic Arab land that has a special place at the heart of the Islamic Ummah, formed from the territory that extends from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean in the west, and from Ras Al-Naqurah in the north to Umm Al-Rashrash in the south. The movement declares that the colonial occupation of historical Palestine, as well as the expulsion and banishment of the Palestinian people that began with the Nakba in 1948, does not nullify the right of the Palestinian people to the entirety of the land. At the same time, it does not recognise any right of the Jewish state over it. Would these programmatic formulations be contrary to the right of Israel to exist? For Hamas, regardless of the catastrophes that have befallen the Palestinian people since 1948, Palestinian identity will not be erased or denied due to the partition, occupation and Zionist policy of displacement and ethnic cleansing. Palestinians will never lose their national identity and rights, even if they acquire a second nationality. The movement's programme clarifies that the conflict in occupied Palestine is based on the struggle against the Zionist colonial project, and not against the Jews. The resistance understands that peace and security will not be achieved without eliminating the underlying causes of injustice and tyranny. This is because Israel is a colonialist entity that imposes an illegal occupation of Palestine and subjects the Palestinian people to oppression, siege, daily humiliation and systematic human rights violations. Against that, Hamas promises to fight hard. In the new programmatic formulation, Hamas maintains that Israel is not a normal state, but an occupation of Ashkenazi, Khazar and Sephardic Jewish settlers brought from Europe, created during the mass expulsion and expropriation of the Palestinian people. Since 1948, millions of Palestinians have continued to be victims of occupation, exile and dispersion. In this case, Hamas advocates that recognising Israel would mean legitimising all the Zionist claims and myths on which the creation of the State of Israel is based. READ: UNRWA condemns Israel's demolition of Salhiah family home in Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood The relationship between the Palestinian people and Israel is not a relationship between sovereign states. It is a relationship-driven by Israeli colonialism, military expropriation and occupation and the Palestinians' struggle for freedom and self-determination. That is the reality, and there is no way around it. Asking Palestinians to recognise Israel's occupation would be tantamount to asking black South Africans to recognise the legitimacy of the white South African apartheid regime, or to hope that the Algerians would recognise the French occupation during their war of national liberation. For Palestinians, to accept the reality of their occupier and oppressor is to abandon the dream of freedom and liberation. It would betray those who fought long and hard for their freedom, self-determination and dignity, and the very principle of the universal struggle for justice and freedom – premises enshrined in the divine treaties, international law and the United Nations Charter. The movement's leaders say that it is possible to recognise their friends, but it is rather absurd to accept the legitimacy of their enemies. They consider it ludicrous to use the recognition of Israel as a precondition for "peace agreements" or "normalisations" to take effect when it is known that Israel remains with its systematic actions of injustice and oppression against Palestinians while continuing to expand occupation. The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) recognised the "State of Israel" in 1988 and reiterated this recognition in the Oslo Accords in 1993, in addition to promoting various peace initiatives with Israel since the Madrid Conference in 1991. One must ask: what did these negotiations and this recognition give Palestinians? Israeli governments never respected the terms of the agreements. Israel has never recognised the Palestinian people's legitimate historical and political rights to land and to return, nor their moral, political and legal responsibility for the expropriation of land and the expulsion of Palestinians. On the contrary, Israel continues to attack the Palestinians militarily with massive aggressions – seizing land, building new and expanding illegal Jewish colonies, besieging Gaza and systematically violating the human rights of Palestinians. There are more than 4,600 political prisoners, including 160 children, 34 women, 547 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment, and nine members of the Palestinian Legislative Council legitimately elected in 2006 in prisons. It is estimated that since the Nakba, more than one million Palestinians of all ages have passed through Zionist prisons. OPINION: Palestinians don't need Israel investigated, they need justice Based on the experience of these "peace agreements" and other negotiations with the Zionist occupier, there is an abundance of evidence that these initiatives have failed to bring back the rights of the Palestinians, nor did they guarantee the effectiveness of the various UN resolutions that could restore these rights. The main problem is not the negotiations, but the fact that Israel does not recognise any of the Palestinian rights. Israel simply does not abide by the agreements. It continues to transgress what was agreed upon and advances even further with its aggressive colonialist policies in the Palestinian territories. From the viewpoint of the Palestinian resistance, it would be unthinkable, immoral and unfair to expect Palestinians, who are continually oppressed and subjugated by the Israeli military occupation, to capitulate to Israel's humiliating conditions. There is no precedent in modern history in which a people consented to the theft of their homeland without resisting. The people of Palestine have demonstrated for 73 years that they are no exception.

News article:
The last two words of the post reveal just what kind of “political and bilateral issues” were the focus of the talk between the powerful figure considered a possible successor to P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas and the man slated to replace Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett next year. The false P.A. claim and commonly heard mantra that Israel violates international law as an “occupying power”—chanted in anti-Zionist circles around the world—is nothing new. “I met this evening with … Lapid, and we discussed several political and bilateral issues,” tweeted al-Sheikh, head of the P.A.’s “General Authority of Civil Affairs” and member of the Fatah Central Committee. “I have highlighted the need for a political horizon between the two parties based on international legitimacy.” Nor is the often-obfuscated fact that it’s not only Hamas that refers to the illegitimacy of the Jewish state within any borders. Speaking of which, Abbas prefaced his address to the 76th session of the U.N. General Assembly three months ago by stating: “This year marks the 73rd anniversary of the nakba,” the so-called “catastrophe” of Israel’s establishment in 1948. The opening reference merely scratched the surface of the rest of his hate-filled speech, in which he reiterated, among other lies and threats, that “this colonial regime [Israel] has established on our land will disappear, regardless of how long it takes. We will not allow them to hijack our lives and kill our people’s dreams, hopes and aspirations to realize freedom and independence.” This is the same Abbas who was hosted on Dec. 28 by Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin, and presented with all kinds of “economic and civilian” goodies aimed at what Gantz called “deepening security coordination and preventing terror and violence for the well-being of both Israelis and Palestinians.” The laughable description of what went on during the get-together, in which al-Sheikh participated, was a euphemism for attempting to placate the terrorism-inciting P.A. through ill-deserved benefits of the sort that have never achieved Israel’s desired goal. On the contrary, they’ve only served to strengthen Abbas’s resolve to take advantage of Israeli weakness to step up pressure in the form of violence and appeals to the international community to delegitimize the Jewish state. The current government in Jerusalem—made up of a strong left-wing contingent and the Islamist United Arab List (Ra’am)—clearly doesn’t see it that way. Those members of the coalition who used to know better, such as Bennett himself, are engaged in an effort to preserve their rule, on the one hand, and appease the administration in Washington, on the other. While sharply criticized by right-wing oppositionists for kowtowing to Abbas, Gantz received warm accolades from the United States. “So excited to see [the Israeli] defense minister … host P.A. President Abbas at his home last night,” U.S. Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides tweeted on Dec. 29. “May this meaningful diplomacy lead to many more such confidence-building measures for the New Year. It benefits us all!” The ostensible “meaningful diplomacy” in question certainly benefited the P.A., to which Gantz promised various tax perks; a NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) loan; more than 1,000 permits for Palestinian businessmen entering Israel by car; dozens of VIP permits for P.A. officials; and the legalization of the status of 9,500 undocumented Palestinians and foreign nationals living in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. The above “ confidence-building measures ” were in addition to the 500-million-shekel ($160 million) “loan” that Gantz vowed to provide the P.A. after convening with Abbas in Ramallah at the end of August. One shudders to imagine what enticing packages Lapid offered al-Sheikh. No wonder his office has declined thus far to comment on the matter—or respond to questions about why he and his coalition partners are working so hard to help the P.A., which hasn’t even pretended to cease bolstering its “ pay-for-slay ” program with “every last penny” it receives. Anyone entertaining the notion that Ramallah is turning over a new leaf to welcome cooperation with Israel based on mutual interests is delusional. Indeed, as the research organization Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) revealed on Thursday, less than a week before Lapid had his powwow with al-Sheikh, the “Fatah Commission of Information and Culture” posted a video on Facebook in which a P.A.-directed narrator is threatening Israel with severe consequences if Palestinian terrorist Nasser Abu Hmeid isn’t granted an early release from prison. As PMW reported, Abu Hmeid, a former commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades (Fatah’s “military wing”) is serving seven life sentences and an additional 50 years for his part in the killing of seven innocent Israelis during the Palestinian suicide-bombing war, otherwise known as the Second Intifada, in 2000-02. Currently being treated in an Israeli hospital for lung cancer, Abu Hmeid is held up by the P.A. as a symbol of Zionist abuse. In the clip, Fatah vows retribution. “Armed people, get ready and prepare the rifles,” it declares. “The battle is with the settlers, the army and the Israel Security Agency [Shin Bet]. If Nasser [Abu Hmeid] goes, a revolution will ignite in the land. We’ll declare war and march, just as you marched. Warning! A warning from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ [Brigades]! Yes, this is a threat: You have experienced a few bullets, and our rifles are lethal.” The paragons of peace fail to mention how long their hero would last if removed from Israeli medical care. But that’s secondary to their using him as yet another excuse to spill Jewish blood. If catering to such voices is how Lapid is paving the way to his premiership—scheduled to begin in August 2023 if the government survives and the rotation agreement comes to fruition—heaven help Israel.

News article:
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh says Israel’s rejection of the “creation” of a Palestinian state is an incitement to more violence in the occupied territories. On January 28, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett provocatively said he would not allow any talks leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. “If there were talks with the Palestinians, there would be no government. I reject the creation of a Palestinian state. I will never allow political talks on the borders to be held,” the right-wing premier said. On Monday and at the start of the weekly Palestinian cabinet meeting held in Ramallah, Shtayyeh hit back. He said such statements from the Israeli premier “prove to us and to the world the scale of extremism of” this occupying regime “and its positions hostile to peace and political negotiations with the Palestinians, as well as its rejection and the denial of the signed agreements.” The Palestinian prime minister, whose remarks were carried by Palestine's official Wafa news agency, also said Israel’s statements and positions as well as actions “prove the validity of what we said that there is no partner on the Israeli side for peacemaking,” and that the current Israeli cabinet “is systematically destroying the possibility of establishing the State of Palestine.” Elsewhere in his remarks, Shtayyeh called on the United States and the European Union (EU) to intervene and halt Israel’s plans in occupied East al-Quds, the capital of the future Palestinian state, which are aimed at occupying most of its land for the regime’s settlement expansion. The Palestinian premier also noted that the Tel Aviv regime persists in demolishing Palestinian-owned homes in East al-Quds and displacing their residents, while many more houses and residential buildings are under the threat of demolition and their owners risk displacement. Also on January 28, member of the Hamas political bureau Ezzat Al-Rishq condemned Bennett’s provocative remarks, saying that such statements are a slap to those who keep faith in negotiations with the Israeli occupation. The Hamas official stressed that the Palestinian state could be established through resistance and steadfastness. Al-Rishq said that Bennett’s comments only “reveals the reality of our enemy and his war on our people. It proves that those who run after an occupation-given Palestinian state are just chasing after a mirage.” More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East al-Quds. All the settlements are illegal under international law as they are built on occupied land. The United Nations Security Council has condemned Israel’s settlement activities in the occupied territories in several resolutions.

News article:
RAMALLAH, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Ishtaye on Monday said that the remarks of Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state are "an incitement to violence and proof of the Israeli government's anti-peace stance." Ishtaye made the remarks in an official statement issued after the weekly meeting of the Palestinian Authority cabinet held in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Bennett was quoted by Israeli media as saying on Friday that as long as he is the prime minister of Israel, there will be no Oslo, referring to the peace agreements signed between Israelis and Palestinians in 1993. He also said that he opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state and that he wouldn't allow any political negotiations that would lead to a Palestinian state. In response, Ishtaye said rejecting to negotiate the establishment of a Palestinian state "proved to us and the world the scale of extremism of Bennett's government and its positions hostile to peace and negotiations." Ishtaye called on the United States and the European Union to intervene to put an end to Israel's settlements in East Jerusalem. Direct peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians stopped in 2014 following disputes on Israeli settlements and the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. ■

RAMALLAH, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Ishtaye on Monday said that the remarks of Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state are "an incitement to violence and proof of the Israeli government's anti-peace stance." Ishtaye made the remarks in an official statement issued after the weekly meeting of the Palestinian Authority cabinet held in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Bennett was quoted by Israeli media as saying on Friday that as long as he is the prime minister of Israel, there will be no Oslo, referring to the peace agreements signed between Israelis and Palestinians in 1993. He also said that he opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state and that he wouldn't allow any political negotiations that would lead to a Palestinian state. In response, Ishtaye said rejecting to negotiate the establishment of a Palestinian state "proved to us and the world the scale of extremism of Bennett's government and its positions hostile to peace and negotiations." Ishtaye called on the United States and the European Union to intervene to put an end to Israel's settlements in East Jerusalem. Direct peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians stopped in 2014 following disputes on Israeli settlements and the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. ■

News article:
A key state’s witness in Opposition Leader Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial testified Tuesday that the former prime minister actively pushed for the establishment of a free tabloid in order to blunt Israel’s biggest-selling newspaper, which he considered hostile to him. Nir Hefetz, a former Netanyahu confidant, told the Jerusalem District Court that the ex-premier helped enlist the late Jewish-American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to set up Israel Hayom. “Benjamin Netanyahu was involved in recruiting Sheldon Adelson to establish a paper that would take down Yedioth Ahronoth,” Hefetz said from the stand. “Netanyahu’s claims that [Yedioth publisher Arnon] Mozes was exploiting him are hypocrisy.” Hefetz is the state’s key witness in the trial against Netanyahu, who faces charges in three separate graft cases. In the so-called Case 2000, he is accused of attempting to make a deal with Mozes for softer coverage of him in Yedioth, exchange for legislation to curb Israel Hayom’s reach. Mozes also faces charges in the case. Israel Hayom, a right-wing newspaper widely considered to be a mouthpiece for Netanyahu, started operating in 2007 under Adelson, who died earlier this year. It quickly overtook Yedioth Ahronoth in circulation, thanks to its aggressive dissemination and free distribution. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hefetz told the court there were times when Netanyahu demanded that Israel Hayom go after Mozes. “I was witness to conversations in which Netanyahu demanded that Israel Hayom go full force after [Arnon] Mozes personally,” Hefetz said under cross-examination. He alleged Netanyahu threatened Mozes by saying that he had “personal information” about him, but was never privy to what information the former prime minister supposedly had. Advertisement Hefetz also recalled being told by Natan Eshel, once the bureau chief at the Prime Minister’s Office, that he had been dispatched by Netanyahu to warn Mozes ahead of Israel Hayom’s establishment. “He warned him that if [Yedioth] doesn’t stop being a hostile newspaper toward Netanyahu, this thing owned by Sheldon will be set up and eliminate Yedioth,” Hefetz testified. According to Hefetz, Eshel warned Mozes that Israel Hayom would begin printing “if this newspaper doesn’t get in line.” He said Adelson would also make threats against Mozes, including personal ones. “The personal threats were nonsense. The real threat was to smash the Yedioth Ahronoth group, to bring it down,” Hefetz said of Netanyahu’s alleged comments. He also said there was no economic logic in founding Israel Hayom and that “it was likely established for an ideological reason.” Advertisement “This newspaper loses tens of millions a year in a best-case scenario, and it is given out free to unequivocally destroy what Arnon Moses sees not only as his life’s work, but almost as his entire being,” Hefetz said. Regarding Yedioth, Hefetz argued the newspaper had no clear agenda beyond maintaining as large a readership as possible. During questioning by Mozes’s defense attorney, Hefetz said the Yedioth publisher never asked him to relay messages to Netanyahu, and that it was the former premier who initiated contacts. “[Mozes] told me that he doesn’t believe a word of [Netanyahu’s],” he said. The cross-examination of Hefetz was expected to wrap up on Wednesday. During Monday testimony, Hefetz detailed the animosity between Netanyahu and Mozes, saying the former premier viewed the Yedioth publisher as “his true opposition.” Netanyahu faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in Case 4000. In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site owned by Elovitch. Advertisement In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. Netanyahu denies all allegations against him, and says the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the media.

News article:
Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been ordered to return some 30 gifts given to him during his 12-year term as premier, as they rightfully belong to the State of Israel. But during a recent sitdown with the Prime Minister’s Office legal adviser, Shlomit Barnea Farago, Netanyahu’s lawyers said they could not return the gifts because “some were broken and some were lost.” Channel 13 news reported Thursday that Barnea Farago was apparently not convinced by the lawyer’s explanations, and she is expected to notify Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who will then decide whether or not to probe the matter. “The lawyers presented a detailed account, according to which some of the gifts were found, others were lost or broken years ago, and others were taken by staff at the Prime Minister’s Office, during a major renovation of the office,” according to a statement issued on behalf of Netanyahu. Earlier this month, a good governance group pressed Mandelblit to open a probe into the whereabouts of the gifts. “On the face of it, and as long as the gifts are not in the possession of the Netanyahu family, there is a fear that the gifts were stolen from the prime minister’s residence, or transferred to the possession of those who are not authorized to hold them,” the Movement for Quality Government wrote. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The letter stated it is a “known fact” that the items were on display at the prime minister’s residence and that after Netanyahu ended his term and moved out “they disappeared” from the building. The Netanyahu family moved out of the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem on July 10, almost a month after Naftali Bennett succeeded him. The items in question are not related to the allegations made in what is dubbed Case 1000, one of the three corruption cases for which Netanyahu is on trial, which deals with alleged expensive gifts he and his family received from wealthy benefactors. Advertisement Among the items not yet returned are two gilded eagles Netanyahu got from then-United States president Barak Obama; a copy of the Bible with the first commentary by Rashi, given by Russian President Vladimir Putin; and a framed copy of documents then-US president Donald Trump signed ordering the transfer of the US Embassy to Jerusalem. In addition, a porcelain jug and tea set Netanyahu received from then-chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel has not been returned, nor has a decorated box he received from then-US first lady Melania Trump.

News article:
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been holding talks with a publishing house about releasing a new book, after failing to return the advance for a previous work that was shelved, a newspaper report said Monday. According to the Haaretz daily, the book Netanyahu is discussing with Yedioth Books would include autobiographical details, and, along with an Israeli release, would also likely be published in English for an overseas audience. Yedioth Books is a division of the Yedioth Ahronoth Group, whose publisher, Arnon Mozes, has notoriously acrimonious ties with Netanyahu. Despite their frosty relationship, the two have been indicted for allegedly trying to reach a quid pro quo in which Netanyahu would have received positive media coverage from the Yedioth Ahronoth daily, in exchange for legislation weakening rival newspaper Israel Hayom. Both deny wrongdoing in the case, one of three corruption probes that Netanyahu is currently standing trial for. The former prime minister has published books through Yedioth in the past, and was set to release another he wrote when serving as finance minister from 2003-2005 and during an earlier stint as opposition leader, before he reclaimed the premiership in 2009. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Dov Eichenwald, the CEO of Yedioth Books, told investigators in 2017 that the planned publication of the book was frozen upon Netanyahu’s return to the Prime Minister’s Office, attributing the move to Netanyahu not wanting to highlight the policies he pushed when serving as finance minister. “He adopted a very tough and cruel economic policy…. When he was elected prime minister, to present this in a book… is very uncomfortable,” Eichenwald said at the time, according to Haaretz. Though the book was shelved, Netanyahu never returned the advance, which Eichenwald estimated was worth NIS 140,000 ($45,000). Advertisement “I told him, ‘You know what, do a biography for us after you are done as prime minister,” Eichenwald was quoted as saying. “I met with him and told him, ‘Listen, every Sunday, for about half an hour, write down your impressions.'” However, Eichenwald said Netanyahu never formally committed to releasing a biography with Yedioth, leading him to approach David Shimron, the ex-premier’s lawyer and cousin, about getting the advance back. According to Eichenwald, Shimron told him he would try to find another publisher to purchase the rights to the book, though no buyer was found and the advance was not returned. Neither Eichenwald nor Netanyahu responded to the newspaper’s request for comment. The report also said that in addition to his talks with Yedioth, Netanyahu was considering publishing the new book independently. It noted that he could also decide to release the previously shelved book through Yedioth or return the advance. In September, the Walla news site reported that Netanyahu had been working on a new book about his time in office and worldview. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, authored several books in the 1980s and 1990s. Advertisement He has remained active in politics since losing power when the new government took office in June, and now, as opposition leader, is vowing to unseat the Naftali Bennett-led coalition that ousted him. He also continues to stand trial on the corruption charges, which he denies.

Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu was reprimanded Sunday by a judge who rejected his request to delay the time of a hearing in his lawsuit against fellow former prime minister Ehud Olmert. In May, Netanyahu’s family filed a defamation lawsuit against Olmert for calling the then-prime minister, his wife Sara, and eldest son Yair “mentally ill” in interviews. The suit seeks NIS 837,000 (some $257,000) in damages for Olmert’s “obsessive efforts to harm their good name in public, out of jealously and deep frustration.” On Sunday, Netanyahu requested that the first hearing in the case — scheduled for Monday — be pushed off from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. in order to account for delays due to security.

Former Israeli Prime Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Olmert yesterday refused a settlement offer by a court in a defamation lawsuit brought by the Netanyahu family against Olmert. The Hebrew language Walla news site reported that Netanyahu had demanded 837,000 shekels ($269,000) in damages following comments Olmert made in two Israeli media interviews last year that Netanyahu, his wife and son were mentally ill. Netanyahu described Olmert's remarks as "ugly and blatant lies that slandered his family." The settlement was offered during a hearing session, during which the judge suggested that Olmert state that his comments about the family's mental health were "only an opinion rather than a fact." There was no immediate comment from Olmert. During the session, Netanyahu was accompanied by his wife Sara and their son Yair.

News article:
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu and prosecutors discussed a potential plea deal in his graft trial, but the secret talks broke down, according to a report Wednesday. The Maariv daily, based on information from what it said were sources familiar with the details, reported that the talks failed due to Netanyahu’s refusal to budge in his demand that the agreement include neither an admission of moral turpitude nor, by implication, a prison sentence. The report said that talks began because Netanyahu believed that Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit would be interested in ending his term with a “clean sheet,” and that the short timeframe before his retirement could bring to bear the pressure needed for a deal to be brokered. Mandelblit retires on February 1, after six years in office, and has ruled out extending his tenure despite the lack of a replacement. The report said that the discussions between representatives of both sides were held under strict secrecy, and went on for a number of weeks. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The discussions reportedly began after it was ascertained that Mandelblit was willing to hear a proposal, but quickly ended when it became clear that the attorney general would require a full admission of guilt and moral turpitude, as well as a suspended sentence with a substantial fine. Netanyahu was not willing to entertain an admission of moral turpitude, and the talks quickly ended. Such an admission would leave the former prime minister ineligible to hold office for several years, and could end his political career. Responding to Maariv, the State’s Attorney Office said it would not comment specifically on the matter. Advertisement “As a policy, we do not respond to questions about conversations with defense attorneys, whether they have occurred or not. This does not confirm or deny anything of what has been alleged,” the statement read. Wednesday’s report was the first indication of discussions for a potential plea deal, but it is not the first time that Netanyahu has reportedly tried to reach some kind of agreement to prevent or end his trial. In 2019, he was said to have sought a presidential pardon whereby he would be granted clemency by the next prime minister were he to leave office and the political scene. Netanyahu denied the report. Netanyahu faces charges in three separate graft cases: fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in Case 4000. In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site, owned by Elovitch. In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. Netanyahu denies all allegations against him, and says the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the media.

News article:
Prosecutors are reportedly fuming over reports that former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been holding secret talks with the attorney general over a plea deal in his corruption trial, which is now said to be just awaiting Netanyahu’s final approval. Meanwhile, political forces believe a plea deal that removes Netanyahu from the political sphere could cause the speedy collapse of the current, ideologically splintered governing coalition. Netanyahu, the opposition leader, is on trial in three separate graft cases, after being indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and bribery. News broke earlier this week that the former prime minister was conducting secret negotiations with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit over a potential plea deal. While initial reports indicated that the negotiations had hit a dead end, TV networks reported on Thursday that the two sides are very close to signing a deal, although one major sticking point remains. According to Channel 13 news, prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude and community service for Netanyahu. If his actions are found to have carried moral turpitude, a guilty plea would bar Netanyahu from public service for seven years, likely ending the 72-year-old’s political career for good. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The secret talks were reportedly initiated by Netanyahu’s attorney Boaz Ben Zur, and state prosecutors made clear that there would be no compromise on the conviction of moral turpitude. Channel 13 indicated Thursday night that the state prosecution’s insistence on the moral turpitude designation was the key sticking point preventing a deal. According to a Thursday night report on Channel 12, however, the side were at odds only over the question of when Netanyahu would resign from the Knesset, and therefore who would have the authority to determine if the charges amount to moral turpitude. Advertisement If he resigns before a final verdict, it would fall to the Supreme Court judge who heads the Central Elections Committee to make a decision before the next election to the Knesset. If, however, Netanyahu remains in office until a verdict is in place — Mandelblit’s purported preference — then the judges will make the ultimate decision on whether his actions amount to moral turpitude. It was not immediately clear why this was a significant issue, however, since the same TV report indicated that in both scenarios, the crimes would likely be designated as constituting moral turpitude. Netanyahu — who has long publicly proclaimed that his innocence would be proven in court, and previously vowed not to accept any plea deal — is reportedly consulting with aides about moving forward with a deal. Reports have indicated that Mandelblit may be eager to wrap things up before his term ends at the end of the month. Channel 12 news noted that it is possible Netanyahu is not really interested in a plea deal at all, and may simply be trying to depict the cases publicly as weak, pointing to the prosecution’s readiness to compromise. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu started considering a plea deal after receiving a legal assessment that key state’s witness Nir Hefetz’s recent testimony was effective for the prosecution’s case, and amid concerns that the upcoming testimony of another state’s witness, Shlomo Filber, could also be damaging. Top state prosecution officials were unaware of the negotiations for a plea deal with Netanyahu until Wednesday, Channel 13 reported. According to the TV network, Mandelblit held the talks secretly and only notified top figures tied to the case on Wednesday. Officials were outraged when they found out, the report said. Netanyahu faces charges in three separate graft cases: fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in Case 4000. Advertisement In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site, owned by Elovitch. In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. In Case 2000, he is accused of attempting to make a deal with Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes for softer coverage of him in exchange for legislation to curb the reach of rival daily Israel Hayom. According to the TV networks, the details of the plea agreement that have already been agreed to would include dropping the bribery charge in Case 4000, as well as the entire Case 2000, and seeing Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in both Cases 4000 and 1000. The sides have reportedly agreed that Netanyahu will not see prison time, and would be sentenced to three to six months of community service. Some officials in the prosecution do not want to close Case 2000 against the premier, Channel 13 reported. Either way, analysts have noted, the Supreme Court justices are not a rubber stamp for plea deals, and would have to sign off on the details of the agreement before it can be finalized — and could potentially reject it. Meanwhile, political analysts and insiders have already been assessing the potential fallout of such a deal. If Netanyahu’s political career is effectively over, many observers believe it would spell the end of the current government coalition. With Netanyahu out as head of Likud, the coalition’s right-wing parties — which refused to sit together with Likud only as long as Netanyahu headed it — are likely to jump ship and easily form a right-wing government. Advertisement Channel 12 noted that it is possible Netanyahu could stay on as chairman of Likud even if he is no longer a member of Knesset — similar to Shas leader Aryeh Deri, who recently signed his own plea deal on tax offenses. But sources in Likud have said privately that they would oppose Netanyahu attempting to stay on as leader of the party after he resigns. And many in the party are now ramping up the quiet and not-so quiet preparations for the future of the party in the post-Netanyahu era.

Channel 13 says prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude and community service for Netanyahu.

Channel 12’s Guy Peleg notes that Netanyahu may not be interested in a plea deal at all, and may simply be trying to depict the cases publicly as weak, hence the prosecution’s readiness to compromise. He also notes that courts are not a rubber stamp for plea bargains, and could feasibly reject one even if the sides agree to it. Channel 13 also cites an unnamed senior official in the government saying that if a deal is signed, it will present “an immediate danger to the stability of the coalition.” This is because if Netanyahu departs politics as part of a plea deal, it will be much easier for the right to form a coalition with Likud.

News article:
Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu attempted to reach a plea deal in his three criminal cases some two years ago, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister-site Zman Yisrael reported Friday, but the proposal was vetoed by Netanyahu’s wife Sara. According to the report, the offer discussed between a top Netanyahu attorney and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit at the start of 2020 was very similar to the one the sides are now reported to be negotiating: Bribery charges would be removed from the indictment against Netanyahu and he would admit to charges of fraud and breach of trust. In return, he would then receive a mild sentence of community service and be convicted of “moral turpitude” — ejecting him from public life for at least seven years and likely ending his political career. According to Zman Yisrael, Sara Netanyahu rejected the proposal out of hand. Netanyahu, the opposition leader, is on trial in three separate graft cases, after being indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and bribery.

Netanyahu — who has long publicly proclaimed that his innocence would be proven in court, and previously vowed not to accept any plea deal — is reportedly consulting with aides about moving forward with a deal. Reports have indicated that Mandelblit may be eager to wrap things up before his term ends at the end of the month. Channel 12 news noted that it is possible Netanyahu is not really interested in a plea deal at all, and may simply be trying to depict the cases publicly as weak, pointing to the prosecution’s readiness to compromise. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu started considering a plea deal after receiving a legal assessment that key state’s witness Nir Hefetz’s recent testimony was effective for the prosecution’s case, and amid concerns that the upcoming testimony of another state’s witness, Shlomo Filber, could also be damaging. Top state prosecution officials were unaware of the negotiations for a plea deal with Netanyahu until Wednesday, Channel 13 reported. According to the TV network, Mandelblit held the talks secretly and only notified top figures tied to the case on Wednesday. Officials were outraged when they found out, the report said. Netanyahu faces charges in three separate graft cases: fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000. Advertisement In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit from the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site, owned by Elovitch. In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. In Case 2000, he is accused of attempting to make a deal with Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes for softer coverage of him in exchange for legislation to curb the reach of rival daily Israel Hayom. According to the TV networks, the details of the plea agreement that have already been agreed to would include dropping the bribery charge in Case 4000, as well as the entire Case 2000, and seeing Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in both Cases 4000 and 1000. The sides have reportedly agreed that Netanyahu will not see prison time, and would be sentenced to three to six months of community service.

News article:
Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu attempted to reach a plea deal in his three criminal cases some two years ago, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister-site Zman Yisrael reported Friday, but the proposal was vetoed by Netanyahu’s wife Sara. According to the report, the offer discussed between a top Netanyahu attorney and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit at the start of 2020 was very similar to the one the sides are now reported to be negotiating: Bribery charges would be removed from the indictment against Netanyahu and he would admit to charges of fraud and breach of trust. In return, he would then receive a mild sentence of community service and be convicted of “moral turpitude” — ejecting him from public life for at least seven years and likely ending his political career. According to Zman Yisrael, Sara Netanyahu rejected the proposal out of hand. Netanyahu, the opposition leader, is on trial in three separate graft cases, after being indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and bribery. News broke earlier this week that the former prime minister was conducting secret negotiations with Mandelblit over a potential plea deal. TV networks reported on Thursday that the two sides are very close to signing a deal, although one major sticking point remains. According to Channel 13 news, prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude and community service for Netanyahu. Netanyahu is said to be trying to avoid the moral turpitude designation in order to have a chance at returning to politics. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The secret talks were reportedly initiated by Netanyahu’s attorney Boaz Ben Zur, and state prosecutors made clear that there would be no compromise on the conviction of moral turpitude. According to a Thursday night report on Channel 12, the sides were at odds only over the question of when Netanyahu would resign from the Knesset — and therefore who would have the authority to determine if the charges amount to moral turpitude. If he resigns before a final verdict, it would fall to the Supreme Court judge who heads the Central Elections Committee to make a decision before the next election to the Knesset. If, however, Netanyahu remains in office until a verdict is in place — Mandelblit’s purported preference — then the trial judges will make the ultimate decision on whether his actions amount to moral turpitude.

News article:
Two top ministers said Friday that the government will vote on Sunday on the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the so-called “submarine affair,” a murky deal between Israel and a German shipbuilder for naval vessels that has already resulted in multiple indictments. The upcoming vote was announced Friday by the offices of Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid and Defense Minister Benny Gantz. However, a report on Channel 12 news cast doubt on their assertion. The unsourced report said Prime Minister Naftali Bennett does not plan to bring the matter to a vote yet. It said Bennett wishes to finalize an agreement with Germany on the purchase of Dolphin-type submarines before making any move on the inquiry commission. In October 2018, Germany approved a memorandum of understanding with Israel for the construction of three Dolphin-type submarines to be added to Israel’s fleet of six submarines, after the purchase stalled during an Israeli investigation into alleged corruption and bribes to seal the deal. Reports at the time indicated that the agreement included a clause according to which the deal would not advance further while the corruption investigation was ongoing. It also gave Germany the right to withdraw from the deal regardless of whether any criminal conduct was ultimately uncovered by police in the purchase. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In his statement Friday, Gantz said that “the formation of a commission of inquiry is a necessary step to safeguard Israel’s security.” Lapid added: “The submarine affair is the most serious case of defense corruption in Israeli history, and we must leave no stone unturned to reach the truth.” The scandal came to be known as the “submarine affair,” or Case 3000, and revolved around the allegations of a massive bribery scheme in Israel’s multi-billion-shekel purchase of naval vessels — submarines and large missile ships — from German shipbuilder Thyssenkrupp. Several of those involved in the agreement have been indicted over the affair, including close confidants of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called for the procurement, though not the ex-premier himself. Advertisement The scandal also involved the sale of two Dolphin-class submarines and two anti-submarine warships by Germany to Egypt, allegedly approved by Netanyahu without consulting or notifying then-defense minister Moshe Ya’alon and then-IDF chief of staff Gantz. Israel had long been granted an unofficial veto over such sales by Germany. While several of Netanyahu’s close associates have been indicted in the case, which involves suspicions Israeli officials were bribed to ensure Thyssenkrupp won the contract, the former premier has not been directly implicated and the attorney general has said he is not a suspect. In October, the state prosecution told the High Court of Justice that it believed there was no justification to open a criminal probe into Netanyahu over the matter. He is already on trial for fraud and breach of trust in three other cases, and bribery in one of them. He denies any wrongdoing and claims to be a victim of an attempted political coup involving the police, prosecutors, left-wing opposition and the media. Gantz, now defense minister, submitted a formal request for a government inquiry back in October, after Sa’ar had indicated he would support the move. The probe also has the support of Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman. Though there have long been calls for a government investigation into the affair by opponents of Netanyahu, his supporters have claimed that such a probe would be politically motivated, an allegation that Gantz has rejected. “The formation of the commission is critical for the defense establishment and the State of Israel — if we do not uncover the truth, we will not be able to learn lessons for the future,” Gantz said in October. Advertisement His proposal called for NIS 9 million ($2.85 million) to be budgeted for the commission of inquiry, with NIS 7 million ($2.22 million) coming from his Defense Ministry and NIS 2 million ($630,000) from the Justice Ministry. Though Gantz said the probe was meant to ensure Israeli citizens’ trust in the country’s defense apparatus, under his proposal the details of the inquiry would be kept almost entirely secret. Since the affair came to light in 2016, there have been multiple attempts to form a state inquiry of commission into the deal, including one by Gantz in 2020, when he attempted to probe the purchase with an internal Defense Ministry investigation. That effort was thwarted by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who said it would interfere with his own criminal probe into the affair.

In excerpts from a book he wrote in the early 2000s but never published, former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls corruption “a cancer that grows in the dark” The excerpts were published on Friday by the Haaretz newspaper, which did not say exactly when the book, “The Israeli Leopard,” was written, though it was done somewhere between the end of his stint as finance minister in 2005 and his reelection as prime minister in 2009. Netanyahu, now leader of the opposition, evidently decided to freeze it when he returned to the Prime Minister’s Office in 2009. The quotes, which rail against corruption, bloated governments and the dangers of over-concentration of centralized power, are especially relevant as Netanyahu is currently on trial in three corruption cases, after being indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and bribery — largely revolving around his alleged efforts to secure better media coverage as he tried to maintain power during his decade-long stint as prime minister. He is now reported to be nearing a plea bargain. The book dealt mostly with his actions as finance minister in 2003-2005, and in it, he detailed his neo-liberal agenda and worldview, but also touched on corruption. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “Corruption is like cancer that grows in the darkness. It distorts competition, hurts citizens’ morale, and discourages them because it signals that the path to material progress is not dependent on effort and talent, but on bribery,” Netanyahu wrote. “In Israel, corruption bubbles up from a single source: concentration of power. For years immense financial power has been concentrated in the government, the labor federation and the parties,” wrote Netanyahu who played a key role in liberalizing Israel’s economy. “A hundred years ago Lord Acton warned against the corrupting effect of absolute power. The way to prevent corruption in the political system is to decentralize or limit the government’s economic power,” he said. Advertisement He also railed against moguls who monopolize the Israeli economy. “There are moguls who have become accustomed to a ‘regulated’ market, meaning a private sector working in large monopolies and duopolies whose heads enjoy government sponsorship and are protected by politicians,” he said. Later has was charged with colluding with one. In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site, owned by Elovitch. In Case 2000, he is accused of attempting to make a deal with Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes for softer coverage of him in exchange for legislation to curb the reach of rival daily Israel Hayom. In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. Advertisement The publication of the excerpts comes amid a series of reports that Netanyahu is currently trying to negotiate a plea deal with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. Netanyahu — who has long publicly proclaimed that his innocence would be proven in court, and previously vowed not to accept any plea deal — is reportedly consulting with aides about moving forward with a deal. Reports have indicated that Mandelblit may be eager to wrap things up before his term ends at the end of the month. The book also contains advice on maintaining a small government that Netanyahu himself quickly jettisoned on becoming prime minister again. “A government of 18 ministers is too big for the management of a small country, and in fact any country. The truth must be said: Most government ministries are bloated far beyond their desirable size. Any person who has worked one day in a ministry knows this.” During his terms in officer Netanyahu frequently oversaw governments with many more ministers and deputy ministers as he doled out positions and even set up new ministries in a bid to appease his coalition partners. According to reports, the details of the plea agreement that have already been agreed to would include dropping the bribery charge in Case 4000, as well as the entire Case 2000, and seeing Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in both Cases 4000 and 1000. The sides have reportedly agreed that Netanyahu will not see prison time, and would be sentenced to three to six months of community service. The main sticking point said to be that prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude, which would see him barred from office for seven years. Netanyahu is said to be trying to avoid the moral turpitude designation in order to have a chance at returning to politics.

In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. Advertisement The publication of the excerpts comes amid a series of reports that Netanyahu is currently trying to negotiate a plea deal with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. Netanyahu — who has long publicly proclaimed that his innocence would be proven in court, and previously vowed not to accept any plea deal — is reportedly consulting with aides about moving forward with a deal. Reports have indicated that Mandelblit may be eager to wrap things up before his term ends at the end of the month. The book also contains advice on maintaining a small government that Netanyahu himself quickly jettisoned on becoming prime minister again. “A government of 18 ministers is too big for the management of a small country, and in fact any country. The truth must be said: Most government ministries are bloated far beyond their desirable size. Any person who has worked one day in a ministry knows this.” During his terms in officer Netanyahu frequently oversaw governments with many more ministers and deputy ministers as he doled out positions and even set up new ministries in a bid to appease his coalition partners. According to reports, the details of the plea agreement that have already been agreed to would include dropping the bribery charge in Case 4000, as well as the entire Case 2000, and seeing Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in both Cases 4000 and 1000. The sides have reportedly agreed that Netanyahu will not see prison time, and would be sentenced to three to six months of community service. The main sticking point said to be that prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude, which would see him barred from office for seven years. Netanyahu is said to be trying to avoid the moral turpitude designation in order to have a chance at returning to politics.

News article:
A cabinet vote on Sunday on establishing a state commission of inquiry into the so-called “submarine affair” will not take place as planned and will be delayed by at least a week, according to Hebrew media reports. Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid announced on Friday that the long-promised vote on investigating a murky deal between Israel and a German shipbuilder for naval vessels that has already resulted in multiple indictments would occur on Sunday. But the Globes business daily reported on Saturday that the vote will not be on the cabinet’s agenda this week after all. According to the report, government ministers are waiting to see what will happen with the purported plea deal being arranged between the state and former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial. Netanyahu has long been linked to the submarine affair, and his associates have been indicted over their role, but the former prime minister has never been charged with wrongdoing in the incident and the attorney general has said he is not a suspect. The now-opposition leader is currently on trial on three unrelated and separate corruption charges, although he is reportedly close to inking a plea deal in those cases. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms But according to the Haaretz newspaper, the delay in the vote is due to the government’s ongoing negotiations to purchase submarines from Germany, in a deal that may be signed as early as this week. In October 2018, Germany approved a memorandum of understanding with Israel for the construction of three Dolphin-type submarines to be added to Israel’s fleet of six submarines, after the purchase had stalled during an Israeli investigation into alleged corruption and bribes to seal the deal. Reports at the time indicated that the agreement included a clause according to which the deal would not advance further while the corruption investigation was ongoing. It also gave Germany the right to withdraw from the deal regardless of whether any criminal conduct was ultimately uncovered by police in the purchase. Advertisement The scandal came to be known as the “submarine affair,” or Case 3000, and revolved around the allegations of a massive bribery scheme in Israel’s multi-billion-shekel purchase of naval vessels — submarines and large missile ships — from German shipbuilder Thyssenkrupp. Several of those involved in the agreement have been indicted over the affair, including close confidants of Netanyahu, who called for the procurement, though not the ex-premier himself. The scandal also involved the sale of two Dolphin-class submarines and two anti-submarine warships by Germany to Egypt, allegedly approved by Netanyahu without consulting or notifying then-defense minister Moshe Ya’alon and then-IDF chief of staff Gantz. Israel had long been granted an unofficial veto over such sales by Germany. In October, the state prosecution told the High Court of Justice that it believed there was no justification to open a criminal probe into Netanyahu over the matter. Gantz and Lapid have both promised in the past to establish a formal government investigation of the submarine affair. In the Friday statement, Gantz said that “the formation of a commission of inquiry is a necessary step to safeguard Israel’s security.” Lapid added: “The submarine affair is the most serious case of defense corruption in Israeli history, and we must leave no stone unturned to reach the truth.” Gantz submitted a formal request for a government inquiry back in October, after Justice Minister Gideon Sa’ar had indicated he would support the move. The probe also has the support of Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman. Advertisement Though there have long been calls for a government investigation into the affair by opponents of Netanyahu, his supporters have claimed that such a probe would be politically motivated, an allegation that Gantz has rejected. “The formation of the commission is critical for the defense establishment and the State of Israel — if we do not uncover the truth, we will not be able to learn lessons for the future,” Gantz said in October. His proposal called for NIS 9 million ($2.85 million) to be budgeted for the commission of inquiry, with NIS 7 million ($2.22 million) coming from his Defense Ministry and NIS 2 million ($630,000) from the Justice Ministry. Since the affair came to light in 2016, there have been multiple attempts to form a state inquiry of commission into the deal, including one by Gantz in 2020, when he attempted to probe the purchase with an internal Defense Ministry investigation. That effort was thwarted by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who said it would interfere with his own criminal probe into the affair.

News article:
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed his lawyers to press ahead with talks with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit on a plea deal in his criminal corruption trial, Hebrew media reported early Monday. Netanyahu and his family met Sunday with his lawyers to decide whether to accept a plea deal. According to Channel 12 news, Netanyahu was accompanied by his wife Sara and sons Yair and Avner for the meeting at the home of his lawyer Boaz Ben Zur. Also said to be present were another of Netanyahu’s attorneys, Amit Hadad, family lawyer Yossi Cohen, and longtime confidant Natan Eshel. Following the four-hour meeting, reports said that despite misgivings from his family, he had asked his lawyers to move forward with the deal. “In the end, it’s up to one person — Netanyahu,” Channel 12 quoted a source involved in the talks as saying. “During the meeting, it was decided to move forward toward a deal.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Ynet news site said Netanyahu’s lawyers would approach Mandelblit on Monday with a view to moving forward as soon as possible with the deal. However, the reports noted that the Netanyahu family was concerned about public opposition to the deal. Dozens of activists gathered outside Ben Zur’s home, chanting slogans against a plea deal. Advertisement Earlier, TV reports said that Sara Netanyahu had reversed her position and was now opposed to a plea deal, as were Netanyahu’s sons. A separate report carried by Channel 13 news said Sara Netanyahu was the biggest opponent of a plea deal, believing it was illegitimate that a “bureaucrat” like Mandelblit would decide on the matter. That report also said she saw no reason for her husband to accept a deal requiring him to leave politics, as she maintains that he committed no wrongdoing. Netanyahu’s lawyers, on the other hand, reportedly were in favor of the agreement and were seeking to convince the former premier to sign it, calling it “an excellent deal.” לקראת הסדר טיעון | נתניהו יצא מביתו של הסנגור בועז בן צור, לקול קריאות מפגינים: "הוא פחדן"@ittaishick pic.twitter.com/pHL5p9bbkv — כאן חדשות (@kann_news) January 16, 2022 Advertisement At the same time, multiple reports Sunday night indicated the prospects of a deal being sealed before Mandelblit’s term ends at the end of January were low. Citing unnamed sources close to Mandelblit, Channel 13 said the chance a deal would be reached was “tiny,” as it would require agreements on amending the indictment against Netanyahu and having him admit that a suspect in one of the three cases he was charged in did try to bribe him. The sources said that even if Netanyahu were to agree his actions carried a designation of “moral turpitude” — which would bar him from public office for seven years — the gaps between the two sides were too great to bridge before Mandelblit steps down. Sources close to Mandelblit also told the Haaretz daily that the chance of reaching a deal in the coming weeks was “negligible,” with too many details left to hash out, even if Netanyahu agreed to the “moral turpitude” clause and admitted to fraud and breach of trust. State prosecutors also cast doubt on the prospect of wrapping up a plea agreement before Mandelblit leaves office. “The chance that there’ll be an agreement with Mandelblit is very small, even weak. The media is going much further than the reality. Practically speaking, there’s almost no time, even if the defense accepts the attorney general’s terms,” a source in the State Attorney’s Office was quoted as saying by Channel 12 news. Additionally, the network said there were currently no negotiations taking place, with Mandelblit still waiting for Netanyahu to accept the basic terms for an agreement, including the “moral turpitude” designation. It also said some prosecutors want Netanyahu to formally retract his broadsides against police and prosecutors, and say there was no basis for his claims of bias and that he was the victim of a witch hunt. Advertisement The latest reports came after media outlets reported in recent days that Netanyahu has been resisting an agreement so far primarily due to Mandelblit’s demand that he agree that his actions involved “moral turpitude.” According to reports Saturday, Netanyahu and Mandelblit may agree to leave that decision up to the judges hearing the case. Even if Netanyahu signs a plea deal with state prosecutors, it will still need to be approved by the court. Netanyahu is on trial in three separate graft cases: for fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000. He denies all allegations against him, and says the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the leftist media.

Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit’s demand that a plea deal in his criminal trial include a clause banning him from public office for seven years, Israeli television reported Monday. “Netanyahu decided to go for a deal and accept the attorney general’s bottom line,” an unnamed associate of the former prime minister told Channel 12 news, referring to the “moral turpitude” designation. According to Channel 13 news, though Netanyahu is ready to agree to “moral turpitude,” he has not yet informed Mandelblit, as he is not sure the attorney general is prepared for a plea deal. The network also said that Mandelblit, senior prosecutors and Netanyahu’s legal team had been meeting for hours on Tuesday afternoon and evening regarding the potential plea bargain. Following the reports, Netanyahu’s spokesman released a statement that quoted his lawyers saying the former prime minister “has not announced he agrees to moral turpitude.” Pundits noted the statement’s use of the word “announced,” rather than a full denial.

He denies all the allegations. The reports followed a meeting Netanyahu and his family held Sunday with his lawyers to decide whether to accept a plea deal. Channel 12 on Monday reported the aim of that meeting was to convince Netanyahu’s relatives to accept the decision he has already made, with those present told it was the best agreement for the ex-premier that his lawyers could achieve. “It’s a good deal that has to be accepted,” Netanyahu’s lawyer Boaz Ben Zur was quoted as saying by Channel 13, vowing to “battle over every detail” in an amended indictment. The network also quoted Netanyahu’s wife Sara expressing reservations over accepting a plea deal. “The prosecution is toying with us. They’ll show everyone that Bibi is prepared to admit to crimes, and then they’ll drop the deal. Mandelblit cannot be trusted,” she reportedly said. Advertisement The report said others at the meeting called Deputy State Attorney Liat Ben-Ari, the lead prosecutor in Netanyahu’s case, a liar and said she cannot be trusted. According to Channel 13, Ben-Ari has cooled toward a potential deal. However, Channel 12 said both she and State Prosecutor Amit Aisman back an agreement while Mandelblit, who is due to step down at the end of this month, has become less enthusiastic about a deal, given the public criticism. Additionally, Channel 12 noted both sides were aware that ultimately the devil is in the details: If the terms of a deal are too lenient, the court may end up refusing to accept it, and if the charges are too severe, the court may demand a harsher sentence than the sides agree to. It also remains unclear if a deal can be reached before Mandelblit’s term ends, with sources close to Mandelblit and in the State Attorney’s Office casting doubt on such a prospect. On Monday, Channel 13 said prosecutors remain doubtful that a deal is achievable before Mandelblit steps down. Earlier Monday, Netanyahu made his first public comments since reports broke that he had instructed his lawyers to press ahead with talks on a plea deal, thanking supporters who donated money as part of a crowdfunding effort to help cover the costs of his defense. “Thank you to the multitudes of Israeli citizens for their tremendous support and wonderful love in recent days,” he tweeted. “The warmth of your hearts has touched my family and myself in an unparalleled way.” Netanyahu tweeted the statement alongside a 2016 family photo of himself, his wife Sara and his two sons, Avner and Yair. The fundraising campaign started by the former prime minister’s supporters has so far raised over NIS 2.6 million (some $835,000). It is unlikely that he would be able to accept the funds as a serving lawmaker. Advertisement Netanyahu is one of Israel’s richest politicians, with Forbes reporting in 2019 he was worth NIS 50 million ($13.8 million). Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid pushed back against recent reports that a potential plea deal for Netanyahu could bring down the coalition that was formed to oust the longtime premier. Some analysts believe that if Netanyahu signs a plea deal and withdraws from political life, the government’s right-wing factions could break away and form a coalition with the Likud party under new leadership. “The government will last, it is not dependent on Netanyahu. It depends on joint action and depends on the fact that we have formed a government that unites Israeli society instead of all the splits, rifts and incitement,” Lapid said. Netanyahu is on trial in three separate graft cases: for fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000.

News article:
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit’s demand that a plea deal in his criminal trial include a clause banning him from public office for seven years, Israeli television reported Monday. “Netanyahu decided to go for a deal and accept the attorney general’s bottom line,” an unnamed associate of the former prime minister told Channel 12 news, referring to the “moral turpitude” designation. According to Channel 13 news, though Netanyahu is ready to agree to “moral turpitude,” he has not yet informed Mandelblit, as he is not sure the attorney general is prepared for a plea deal. The network also said that Mandelblit, senior prosecutors and Netanyahu’s legal team had been meeting for hours on Tuesday afternoon and evening regarding the potential plea bargain. Following the reports, Netanyahu’s spokesman released a statement that quoted his lawyers saying the former prime minister “has not announced he agrees to moral turpitude.” Pundits noted the statement’s use of the word “announced,” rather than a full denial.

If there’s something to update, I’ll update,” a statement quoted him as telling MKs in his Likud party. Related: It’s all about ‘turpitude’: Making sense of the Netanyahu plea bargain reports Advertisement Netanyahu is on trial for fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases, and bribery in one of them. He denies all the allegations. The reports followed a meeting Netanyahu and his family held Sunday with his lawyers to decide whether to accept a plea deal. Channel 12 on Monday reported the aim of that meeting was to convince Netanyahu’s relatives to accept the decision he has already made, with those present told it was the best agreement for the ex-premier that his lawyers could achieve. “It’s a good deal that has to be accepted,” Netanyahu’s lawyer Boaz Ben Zur was quoted as saying by Channel 13, vowing to “battle over every detail” in an amended indictment. The network also quoted Netanyahu’s wife Sara expressing reservations over accepting a plea deal. “The prosecution is toying with us. They’ll show everyone that Bibi is prepared to admit to crimes, and then they’ll drop the deal. Mandelblit cannot be trusted,” she reportedly said. Advertisement The report said others at the meeting called Deputy State Attorney Liat Ben-Ari, the lead prosecutor in Netanyahu’s case, a liar and said she cannot be trusted. According to Channel 13, Ben-Ari has cooled toward a potential deal. However, Channel 12 said both she and State Prosecutor Amit Aisman back an agreement while Mandelblit, who is due to step down at the end of this month, has become less enthusiastic about a deal, given the public criticism. Additionally, Channel 12 noted both sides were aware that ultimately the devil is in the details: If the terms of a deal are too lenient, the court may end up refusing to accept it, and if the charges are too severe, the court may demand a harsher sentence than the sides agree to. It also remains unclear if a deal can be reached before Mandelblit’s term ends, with sources close to Mandelblit and in the State Attorney’s Office casting doubt on such a prospect. On Monday, Channel 13 said prosecutors remain doubtful that a deal is achievable before Mandelblit steps down. Earlier Monday, Netanyahu made his first public comments since reports broke that he had instructed his lawyers to press ahead with talks on a plea deal, thanking supporters who donated money as part of a crowdfunding effort to help cover the costs of his defense. “Thank you to the multitudes of Israeli citizens for their tremendous support and wonderful love in recent days,” he tweeted. “The warmth of your hearts has touched my family and myself in an unparalleled way.” Netanyahu tweeted the statement alongside a 2016 family photo of himself, his wife Sara and his two sons, Avner and Yair. The fundraising campaign started by the former prime minister’s supporters has so far raised over NIS 2.6 million (some $835,000). It is unlikely that he would be able to accept the funds as a serving lawmaker. Advertisement Netanyahu is one of Israel’s richest politicians, with Forbes reporting in 2019 he was worth NIS 50 million ($13.8 million). Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid pushed back against recent reports that a potential plea deal for Netanyahu could bring down the coalition that was formed to oust the longtime premier. Some analysts believe that if Netanyahu signs a plea deal and withdraws from political life, the government’s right-wing factions could break away and form a coalition with the Likud party under new leadership. “The government will last, it is not dependent on Netanyahu. It depends on joint action and depends on the fact that we have formed a government that unites Israeli society instead of all the splits, rifts and incitement,” Lapid said. Netanyahu is on trial in three separate graft cases: for fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000. In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site, owned by Elovitch. In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. Advertisement In Case 2000, he is accused of attempting to make a deal with Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes for softer coverage of him in exchange for legislation to curb the reach of rival daily Israel Hayom. According to reports in recent days, the details of a plea agreement that have already been agreed would include dropping the most serious charge against him, for bribery Case 4000, as well as the entire Case 2000, and seeing Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in both Cases 4000 and 1000. The sides have reportedly agreed that Netanyahu will not see prison time, and would be sentenced to three to six months of community service. Netanyahu denies all allegations against him, and says the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the leftist media.

News article:
(JTA) — Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly negotiating a plea deal with prosecutors in his ongoing corruption cases that could bar him from politics for several years and further reshape Israel’s political landscape. Although various Israeli media reports have swirled inconclusively for several days — including some that claim momentum for a deal is slowing — all allege that Netanyahu has laid the groundwork for a possible deal that would dismiss some of the charges against him while having him confess to “moral turpitude” in a series of corruption cases. According to Israeli law, a moral turpitude conviction would see him banned from Israeli politics for at least seven years. Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history, is currently the leader of Israel’s opposition after being ousted from power last year. In 2020, he became the country’s first sitting prime minister to be indicted, for a series of cases involving bribery and inappropriate political gifts. In one, he allegedly sought to harm a leading Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverage in another. The attorney general who indicted Netanyahu, Avichai Mandelblit, is retiring at the end of January, spurring some to speculate whether he wants to end his tenure with an explosive bang. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside of Mandelblit’s house on Saturday, urging him to dismiss a plea deal and work towards convicting Netanyahu on all accounts he is charged with. In addition to shaking up his Likud party, Netanyahu’s potential plea deal could rattle the Israeli parliament’s coalition, which has been held together by a historically diverse set of parties by the slimmest of margins since last June. If one party is forced to reshuffle its leadership in turmoil, it could break down the coalition and trigger new elections.

News article:
As reports — many unsourced and contradictory — have swirled in recent days claiming opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu may be nearing a plea deal in his graft trial, experts from the Israel Democracy Institute explain the legal standing of such agreements, and what the potential ramifications could be for the former prime minister. What is a plea bargain? A “plea bargain” is an agreement between a defendant and the prosecution in which the defendant confesses (in part or entirely) to having committed certain offenses, usually after the facts stated in the indictment have been amended and the severity of the alleged offenses reduced. The prosecution, for its part, agrees to drop some of the charges or to a lesser penalty, in keeping with the amended indictment. What are the rationales underlying plea bargains? First of all, plea bargains save the time and resources of the courts and the prosecution and reduce the duration of a delay of justice. They limit the potential risk to both parties (of, for example, an acquittal because of some minor flaw in the evidence, or imposition of too harsh a sentence). Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Given its current resources, the criminal justice system would not be able to function if every case had to be tried in full. In extremely complex cases, an evidentiary trial may drag out for years; the delay erodes the public interest and diminishes the impact of the verdict and sentence. When dealing with crimes against individuals, a plea bargain can spare the victim a difficult and traumatic experience that may include testifying and undergoing cross-examination. In addition, the very fact that the defendant confesses constitutes taking responsibility for the action and acknowledgment that the victim spoke the truth. Advertisement In a public case, such as that against Netanyahu, a confession would be valuable as a de facto acknowledgment that he was not being “framed” and unjustly persecuted. What are the arguments against plea bargains? To begin with, a plea bargain may deal a blow to justice: the penalty imposed generally fails to reflect the full severity of the offense and may be harmful to future deterrence. On the other hand, a plea bargain that is especially attractive may lead to false confessions, because the defendant will wish to put an end to a proceeding that is — in his or her eyes — expensive and difficult to bear. What is more, a plea bargain can undermine public confidence in the courts and the prosecution, by creating an image of legal proceedings as a haggling process (rather than one aimed at uncovering the truth and doing justice). With regard to uncovering the truth, in a public case such as that before us, the public has the right to know whether a crime was committed and what exactly took place. A plea bargain leaves these questions open and deprives the public of its right to get the answer in the court’s verdict. Advertisement What is “moral turpitude”? Is it part of every conviction? According to the Supreme Court, “moral turpitude” is a severe moral defect characterizing the person who committed a crime under the specific circumstances of its commission. A number of laws limit a person’s eligibility to hold a public position if he or she has committed a crime that carries with it moral turpitude. Sometimes the law grants the court explicit or implicit authority to determine that the crime is one of moral turpitude. Other statutes authorize certain officials, such as the Chair of the Central Elections Committee and the Attorney General, to decide whether, under specific circumstances, an offense carries with it moral turpitude. Moral turpitude is not a punishment, but rather a classification of an offense committed; its purpose is to ensure that only honest persons serve in positions that require public probity. What are the implications if Netanyahu is found guilty of offenses of moral turpitude? The Basic Law: The Knesset disqualifies a person from election to public office if sentenced to a prison term exceeding three months (including one served by means of community service) when, on the day of submission of the candidate lists, seven years have not elapsed from the completion of serving the sentence. This may be waived if the Chair of the Central Elections Committee determines that, under the specific circumstances, no moral turpitude is attached to the offense of which the person was convicted. If, however, the court’s verdict does attribute moral turpitude to the offense, the CEC chair cannot intervene. What is more, according to the Basic Law: The Knesset, if a Knesset member is convicted of a crime and the court’s verdict, of its own accord or at the request of the attorney general, rules that the offense is one of moral turpitude, the offender ceases to be a member of the Knesset on the day that the verdict becomes final. So if, in the present case, the court convicts Netanyahu and determines that his offense was one of moral turpitude, he will be expelled from the Knesset; and if he is sentenced to more than the minimum penalty, he will not be able to run for the Knesset for seven years — and, ipso facto, will not be able to form a Government. Advertisement If Netanyahu will resign from the Knesset before that, the determination of moral turpitude and his ability to run in future elections would probably be made during those future elections by the CEC chair. Is it possible to amend the ban on running for office if one has been judged guilty of moral turpitude? Theoretically, because Israel’s Basic Laws do not have protected status (some of them can be amended by a bare majority of 61 Knesset members), it might indeed be possible to cancel or modify the moral turpitude restriction on eligibility for office. This must be done by the passage of Basic Law legislation. We may assume that if this applies to past convictions as well, there will be those who will argue that the procedure is improper because of its retroactivity and its personalization (as was charged with regard to the proposal to bar a person facing criminal charges, here Netanyahu, from forming a government). Would Attorney General Mandelblit’s signature on a plea bargain agreement, or his verbal assent, be binding on the acting attorney general who will replace him in another two weeks? The Attorney General’s signature on a plea bargain agreement would bind his successor. But as long as there are only proposals on the table and negotiations, they have no legal force and the next attorney general would not be bound by them, although he or she should give due weight to his predecessor’s position and be fair to defendants who negotiated with him. Assuming that the sides reach an agreement — what procedure is required to revise the new charges to coincide with those against the other defendants? If the new charge sheet modifies the presentation of the facts in the original indictment (to be compatible with lesser offenses), while, of course, preserving the core of the allegations, it will be necessary to amend the indictments against the other defendants as well, insofar as the issues apply to them, so that they coincide with the facts that have been agreed upon. If there is no deal in the end, can the fact that negotiations were conducted have any effect on the continuation of the criminal trial? The negotiations are not supposed to have any impact on the case. This is demonstrated by the fact that after former president Moshe Katsav withdrew his consent to a very lenient deal, the prosecution took its case to court, and he was convicted of rape. Advertisement The mere conduct of negotiations should have no impact, neither weakening the charges nor as evidence that the defendant had been willing to confess. Is it possible to tie up all the loose ends in the two weeks that remain until the end of Mandelblit’s term? It is true that only a few days are left, but this does not rule out an agreement. This is a matter of goodwill on both sides and a willingness to invest maximum effort. Can the court decline to accept a plea bargain agreement? Yes. In rare cases, the court can refuse to approve the plea bargain. Especially when it comes to the sentence, it can deviate from the terms of the agreement, notably when the penalty proposed is unreasonably lighter than what it sees as appropriate and in keeping with the amended charges of which the defendant is convicted. Thus, it is likely that the indictment will be amended in good time, with regard both to the charges and the account of the actions, while maintaining the core of the charges based on them. Can the High Court of Justice intervene in a plea bargain? The High Court of Justice is empowered to conduct judicial review of a plea bargain if it finds a substantive flaw in it. But here the judicial review power is extremely limited, in view of the broad professional discretion allowed the Attorney General, and would be exercised only if there is a clear and substantive deviation from the professional discretion granted him. The court has ruled, for example when it rejected applications against the plea bargain with Katsav, that it will not seek to fill the Attorney General’s shoes and weigh the issues (such as the validity of the evidence) in his place, but will consider only whether his decision was reasonable.

News article:
Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit initially offered former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a far more lenient plea deal in his corruption trial than the one currently being discussed, but backed away due to a flood of pressure from key figures in the prosecution, Channel 12 reported Friday. According to the report, Netanyahu, 72, the current opposition leader, would only have had to commit to stepping away from public life for two years, with the charges also being significantly lowered in two of the cases against him and dismissed in the third. Since reports of the negotiations emerged last week, they have generally said that Mandelblit has been demanding that any plea deal with Netanyahu include a clause of “moral turpitude” — which would bar the former prime minister from public office for seven years. This requirement was underlined on Thursday by Deputy State Attorney Shlomo Lamberger, who made the first public remarks by a senior justice official on the offer, telling a conference held by the Israel Bar Association that it would be “inconceivable” for a plea deal not to include the clause. “Anyone who understands moral turpitude understands that with such acts it is inconceivable there isn’t moral turpitude,” Lamberger said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu is on trial in three separate graft cases: for fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000. Under the currently reported potential deal, the bribery charge in Case 4000 would be dropped, and Case 2000 would be closed altogether. The reports have listed Mandelblit’s current conditions for an agreement as follows: Netanyahu admits to fraud and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 4000; he accepts the designation of moral turpitude; he will be sentenced to seven to nine months of community service; and he admits to having instructed former Communications Ministry director Shlomo Filber to provide benefits to the controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company, Shaul Elovitch — the main accusation against the former premier in case 4000. However, the Channel 12 report Friday said that Mandelblit had previously agreed to Netanyahu stepping away from public office for just two years. It also said that the proposed agreement could have had included a suspended jail sentence, as opposed to the community service and suspended sentence currently on offer. Advertisement In addition, the AG was prepared to not only drop Case 2000 and the bribery charges, but also to reduce the fraud and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 4000 to “a lower level.” Mandelblit was forced to change course due to a deluge of criticism over the lenient terms from senior justice officials and the prosecution, the report said, adding that many of these officials, including some working directly on the Netanyahu trial, were not told of the negotiations. The TV report also accused the AG’s office of duplicity, saying it has tried to present the negotiations as though they are a recent development, when in fact talks have been going on formally, but in secret, for at least five months, and possibly since last July, with at least five meetings between the sides. There has been no formal confirmation of the talks from either side. Friday night reports on Channel 12 and 13 claimed both sides now believe that there will not be an agreement before Mandelblit steps down as attorney general at the end of the month. The gaps between the sides appear to be too wide to be bridged in the short time left in Mandelblit’s tenure, the reports said, though Channel 12 said some in the prosecution believe it could yet be feasible in the next week, provided Netanyahu agrees to the terms. Netanyahu and his lawyers are reported to be wary of accepting the terms unless or until they are certain Mandelblit will finalize the deal; Sara Netanyahu was quoted earlier in the week saying the outgoing attorney general cannot be trusted. Advertisement Both TV channels suggested that the sides could seek “criminal arbitration” by the head of the Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court, with any final deal only likely to be reached once a new attorney general is appointed. According to the network, State Attorney Amit Aisman — who will be filling in the attorney general post until a permanent candidate is selected — has said he would not touch the plea deal negotiations at all. It is not yet clear when a new permanent attorney general will be appointed, but the process is likely to last at least a few weeks into February. Veteran Channel 12 political commentator Amnon Abramovich said Netanyahu was the one pushing for a deal as he wanted to leave politics and go and “make money.” “Netanyahu wants to quit. He wants to make money. That’s what he’s also told his family. He told me a few years ago, ‘I can make $300,000 a month easily,'” Abramovich said. Abromovich said Netanyahu was only remaining as opposition leader as a bargaining chip to use in the negotiations. Both Channel 12 and 13 said that it was likely a deal would eventually be reached, noting that politicians in both camps were already gearing up for the post-Netanyahu era. Several prominent Likud members have declared their intention to try and succeed Netanyahu, who has been party head for almost two decades. Advertisement Channel 13 said that, within Likud, former Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat and ex-finance minister Israel Katz were already campaigning. Former culture minister Miri Regev has also declared her candidacy if Netanyahu leaves, but has slammed her colleagues, particularly Katz, who has been reported to have begun moves to set up an alternative coalition under his leadership. “If he is doing that it’s a very big mistake,” Regev told Channel 12 on Friday. “I suggest we let Netanyahu make his decision; it’s not honorable to preempt it.” “Netanyahu needs to take his time with this difficult decision. To already start dividing up the spoils is not the right thing to do,” Regev said. “The day after, we will act according to the Likud charter. Of course, Israel Katz won’t be the only candidate to head the Likud.” Netanyahu denies all allegations against him, and claims the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the leftist media.

Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit initially offered former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a far more lenient plea deal in his corruption trial than the one currently being discussed, but backed away due to a flood of pressure from key figures in the prosecution, Channel 12 reported Friday. According to the report, Netanyahu, 72, the current opposition leader, would only have had to commit to stepping away from public life for two years, with the charges also being significantly lowered in two of the cases against him and dismissed in the third. Since reports of the negotiations emerged last week, they have generally said that Mandelblit has been demanding that any plea deal with Netanyahu include a clause of “moral turpitude” — which would bar the former prime minister from public office for seven years. This requirement was underlined on Thursday by Deputy State Attorney Shlomo Lamberger, who made the first public remarks by a senior justice official on the offer, telling a conference held by the Israel Bar Association that it would be “inconceivable” for a plea deal not to include the clause. “Anyone who understands moral turpitude understands that with such acts it is inconceivable there isn’t moral turpitude,” Lamberger said.

Under the currently reported potential deal, the bribery charge in Case 4000 would be dropped, and Case 2000 would be closed altogether. The reports have listed Mandelblit’s current conditions for an agreement as follows: Netanyahu admits to fraud and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 4000; he accepts the designation of moral turpitude; he will be sentenced to seven to nine months of community service; and he admits to having instructed former Communications Ministry director Shlomo Filber to provide benefits to the controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company, Shaul Elovitch — the main accusation against the former premier in case 4000. However, the Channel 12 report Friday said that Mandelblit had previously agreed to Netanyahu stepping away from public office for just two years. It also said that the proposed agreement could have had included a suspended jail sentence, as opposed to the community service and suspended sentence currently on offer. Advertisement In addition, the AG was prepared to not only drop Case 2000 and the bribery charges, but also to reduce the fraud and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 4000 to “a lower level.” Mandelblit was forced to change course due to a deluge of criticism over the lenient terms from senior justice officials and the prosecution, the report said, adding that many of these officials, including some working directly on the Netanyahu trial, were not told of the negotiations. The TV report also accused the AG’s office of duplicity, saying it has tried to present the negotiations as though they are a recent development, when in fact talks have been going on formally, but in secret, for at least five months, and possibly since last July, with at least five meetings between the sides.

Even after the disclosure of his clandestine dialogue with Benjamin Netanyahu and his willingness to reach a deal with him, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit is convinced that if a plea bargain isn’t signed, the former prime minister’s trial will end with a sentence that puts him behind bars. However, Mendelblit would not like to see Netanyahu in orange prison garb. He fully realizes what could happen if and when the adored leader of masses finds himself in wing 10 of Maasiyahu Prison. Still, Mendelblit insists that this was not the reason that impelled him to promote on the eve of his departure a deal that would enable the accused to avoid such a bitter end.

The government approved on Sunday the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the so-called submarine affair , which revolves around allegations of a bribery scheme in the purchase of German ships six years ago. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The graft scandal surrounds a possible conflict of interest and bribery involving a $2 billion purchase of naval vessels from Germany's Thyssenkrupp that implicated some of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest associates. The former prime minister was questioned, but not named as a suspect, in the scandal, referred to as "Case 3000." 3 View gallery Naval vessels from Germany's Thyssenkrup ( Photo: The IDF Spokesperson's Unit ) Twenty six ministers voted for the establishment of a state investigation into the case, while Prime Minister Naftali Bennett abstained. He said, however, he has abstained as an act of solidarity with his Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked, who opposes a probe that would investigate the previous government, but added he agree with his coalition partners on the importance of "cleansing the corruption" from government. "Our sole consideration is the security of Israel," said Bennett. "The processes for defense acquisitions in this government are clean of outside considerations. And I'm very happy that an issue that has been unresolved for almost a decade, we've resolved in eight months. We've secured Israel for the next 50 years." The issue was supposed to be discussed at the cabinet meeting last week, but in the end, the discussion was postponed and was held on Sunday afternoon. 3 View gallery Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Defense Minister Benny Gantz ( Photo: Mark Israel Sellem, Alex Kolomoisky, IDF Spokesperson's Unit ) Back in October 2020, Defense Minister Benny Gantz examined the possibility of forming a committee to investigate the alleged submarine graft case following leaks alleging Netanyahu's involvement. The deal to procure the submarines for the Navy was signed in 2016 and involved former Netanyahu, personally. Case 3000 allegedly saw Israeli officials advocating for the purchase of submarines and patrol boats from the German shipbuilder in return for kickbacks. Netanyahu is also accused of approving Thyssenkrupp's sale of submarines and anti-submarine warships to Egypt. After the vote, Gantz said: "We promised and kept our promise, the government approved my proposal for the establishment of an inquiry committee into the submarine vessel affair. And this investigation is of the highest security necessity, and a clear message that you cannot play with Israel’s defense.” Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said the government investigation “is a critical step in the fight against corruption and is essential for the defense establishment.” 3 View gallery Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu inside a submarine ( Photo: Reuters ) Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday called the matter “the most serious corruption scandal in Israel’s history.” Anti-Netanyahu protesters who demonstrated outside his Jerusalem residence until his ouster from office last year had called for an investigation into his role in the submarine scandal. Last week Israel signed an agreement with Germany to purchase three top-of-line submarines from Thyssenkrupp for three billion euros ($3.4 billion) to replace older ships retiring at the end of the decade. The Defense Ministry said they were not part of the state investigation.

News article:
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu publicly declared Monday that he has not agreed to acknowledge “moral turpitude” as part of a potential plea bargain that would end his corruption trial, and said he had no intention of leaving politics. He issued the video statement, his first public reference to two weeks of reports on behind-the-scenes negotiations on a possible deal, in an apparent response to the collapse of the talks with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. The former prime minister vowed to remain the leader of his Likud party and of the right-wing political camp, and to eventually return to power and lead the country. Soon after the video was posted to his social media accounts, a spate of Hebrew media reports said Mandelblit, whose term ends in a week, had earlier in the day informed Netanyahu’s attorneys that negotiations on a deal would have to wait until a new attorney general takes office. Channel 13 claimed, without citing sources, that Netanyahu recorded the video last week and decided to publish it after Mandelblit informed his lawyers that negotiations would not be completed during his term. Sources familiar with the talks told the network that Netanyahu had in fact agreed to a moral turpitude plea, but then stepped back after Mandelblit’s notification. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “In recent days, there were mistaken claims made in the media on things that I allegedly agreed to, such as the claim that I agreed to moral turpitude,” Netanyahu said. “That is simply not correct.” “I will continue to lead the Likud and the national camp in order to lead Israel, on your behalf,” he promised. Netanyahu also thanked his “millions” of supporters and reiterated his accusation that he is being mistreated by law enforcement officials and the justice system, declaring that “the entire public can see what is happening in the courthouse and how the investigation against me was handled.” Advertisement He insisted that the proper course of action was to simply close the cases against him, “but that still hasn’t happened.” Netanyahu had reportedly been hoping to seal a deal with Mandelblit, believing that the latter — a Netanyahu appointee — wanted to end his six-year term with a clean slate. However, media reports have increasingly indicated that the talks were proceeding too slowly, and the mistrust between the sides was too great, for a deal to be finalized before Mandelblit retires. Since reports of the negotiations emerged earlier this month, they generally said Mandelblit was demanding that any plea deal with Netanyahu include a clause of “moral turpitude” — which would bar Netanyahu from public office for seven years. Some reports said that a period of just two years was also discussed in the plea bargain, and that Mandelblit backtracked after agreeing to this. In addition, the reports said that other charges would be significantly lowered in two of the cases against the former premier, and dismissed in the third. The requirement for moral turpitude was underlined last Thursday by Deputy State Attorney Shlomo Lamberger, who made the first public remarks by a senior justice official on the offer, telling a conference held by the Israel Bar Association that it would be “inconceivable” for a plea deal not to include such a clause. Both the Channel 12 and Channel 13 news stations assessed that Netanyahu’s relatively mild rhetoric in Monday’s video statement still leaves an opening for him to continue plea negotiations in the future. Netanyahu was reported last week to be prepared to agree to moral turpitude but not as an opening commitment, in part because of his mistrust of Mandelblit and concern that a deal would fall apart. Advertisement Reacting to the developments, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told Channel 13 later Monday evening that Netanyahu’s video was “proof” of the need to pass a law he previously initiated as head of the opposition, which would bar anyone convicted of moral turpitude from serving as prime minister, minister, Knesset member or mayor. Lapid said he suggested that law “precisely to prevent these kinds of phenomena. We must let the judicial process take its course.” While refusing to say whether he supports a plea deal for Netanyahu, Lapid said the opposition chief “is damaging the political system and the State of Israel. He causes more rifts and divisions than anybody else. The most important thing for us [in the coalition] is to enable some kind of unity among the people of Israel. You can’t do that when someone keeps adding fuel to the fire. He causes damage.” The message Mandelblit reportedly sent to Netanyahu’s legal team on Monday marked an acknowledgment by the attorney general that he would not personally be able to see out the biggest case of his tenure. Netanyahu, 72, is on trial in three separate graft cases: for fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000. Under the reported potential deal, the bribery charge in Case 4000 would have been dropped, and Case 2000 closed altogether. Mandelblit was said to have demanded that Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 4000; accept the designation of moral turpitude; be sentenced to seven to nine months of community service; and admit to having instructed former Communications Ministry director Shlomo Filber to provide benefits to the controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company, Shaul Elovitch — the main accusation against the former premier in case 4000.

News article:
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu publicly declared Monday that he has not agreed to acknowledge “moral turpitude” as part of a potential plea bargain that would end his corruption trial, and said he had no intention of leaving politics. He issued the video statement, his first public reference to two weeks of reports on behind-the-scenes negotiations on a possible deal, in an apparent response to the collapse of the talks with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. The former prime minister vowed to remain the leader of his Likud party and of the right-wing political camp, and to eventually return to power and lead the country. Soon after the video was posted to his social media accounts, a spate of Hebrew media reports said Mandelblit, whose term ends in a week, had earlier in the day informed Netanyahu’s attorneys that negotiations on a deal would have to wait until a new attorney general takes office. Channel 13 claimed, without citing sources, that Netanyahu recorded the video last week and decided to publish it after Mandelblit informed his lawyers that negotiations would not be completed during his term. Sources familiar with the talks told the network that Netanyahu had in fact agreed to a moral turpitude plea, but then stepped back after Mandelblit’s notification.

Netanyahu also thanked his “millions” of supporters and reiterated his accusation that he is being mistreated by law enforcement officials and the justice system, declaring that “the entire public can see what is happening in the courthouse and how the investigation against me was handled.” Advertisement He insisted that the proper course of action was to simply close the cases against him, “but that still hasn’t happened.” Netanyahu had reportedly been hoping to seal a deal with Mandelblit, believing that the latter — a Netanyahu appointee — wanted to end his six-year term with a clean slate. However, media reports have increasingly indicated that the talks were proceeding too slowly, and the mistrust between the sides was too great, for a deal to be finalized before Mandelblit retires. Since reports of the negotiations emerged earlier this month, they generally said Mandelblit was demanding that any plea deal with Netanyahu include a clause of “moral turpitude” — which would bar Netanyahu from public office for seven years. Some reports said that a period of just two years was also discussed in the plea bargain, and that Mandelblit backtracked after agreeing to this. In addition, the reports said that other charges would be significantly lowered in two of the cases against the former premier, and dismissed in the third. The requirement for moral turpitude was underlined last Thursday by Deputy State Attorney Shlomo Lamberger, who made the first public remarks by a senior justice official on the offer, telling a conference held by the Israel Bar Association that it would be “inconceivable” for a plea deal not to include such a clause. Both the Channel 12 and Channel 13 news stations assessed that Netanyahu’s relatively mild rhetoric in Monday’s video statement still leaves an opening for him to continue plea negotiations in the future. Netanyahu was reported last week to be prepared to agree to moral turpitude but not as an opening commitment, in part because of his mistrust of Mandelblit and concern that a deal would fall apart. Advertisement Reacting to the developments, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told Channel 13 later Monday evening that Netanyahu’s video was “proof” of the need to pass a law he previously initiated as head of the opposition, which would bar anyone convicted of moral turpitude from serving as prime minister, minister, Knesset member or mayor. Lapid said he suggested that law “precisely to prevent these kinds of phenomena. We must let the judicial process take its course.” While refusing to say whether he supports a plea deal for Netanyahu, Lapid said the opposition chief “is damaging the political system and the State of Israel. He causes more rifts and divisions than anybody else. The most important thing for us [in the coalition] is to enable some kind of unity among the people of Israel. You can’t do that when someone keeps adding fuel to the fire. He causes damage.” The message Mandelblit reportedly sent to Netanyahu’s legal team on Monday marked an acknowledgment by the attorney general that he would not personally be able to see out the biggest case of his tenure. Netanyahu, 72, is on trial in three separate graft cases: for fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000. Under the reported potential deal, the bribery charge in Case 4000 would have been dropped, and Case 2000 closed altogether. Mandelblit was said to have demanded that Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 4000; accept the designation of moral turpitude; be sentenced to seven to nine months of community service; and admit to having instructed former Communications Ministry director Shlomo Filber to provide benefits to the controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company, Shaul Elovitch — the main accusation against the former premier in case 4000. Netanyahu denies all allegations against him, and claims the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the leftist media.

News article:
In the seven months since the government’s establishment, ministers have conducted at least 46 flights and trips abroad, at a cost of NIS 10-16 million ($3-5 million), according to a report Monday. The report was published following a query to Knesset by the opposition’s Likud MK Yariv Levin on the matter. According to Walla news, the data was based on reports by the ministers themselves and not by the government’s accountant general. Some responded to the query without detailing the travel costs, and some forwarded incomplete reports, omitting the security costs or not including trips that were made after the query’s filing date. The calculation of the total costs is only an estimate and is also based on estimates from conversations with government officials. At the same time, the summary of answers provides rare data regarding government spending on flights and travel in the first half-year of its existence. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Topping the list of frequent fliers were Defense Minister Benny Gantz, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett — who has made six official trips abroad since coming into office in June. Bennett flew twice to the United States — to meet with US President Joe Biden at the White House and speak at the UN General Assembly in New York. In August he visited Sharm el-Sheikh to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. In October he went to Sochi, Russia, for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, later that month flying to Glasgow, Scotland, to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference. In December, he flew to the UAE, the first public visit by an Israeli premier to the Gulf state. The Prime Minister’s Office wrote in response to Levin’s query that it would only list visits “that can be detailed in this framework,” implying Bennett has made additional secret trips during this period. Advertisement According to the report, the total cost of the six visits came to NIS 5,740,017 ($1,806,235). This does not include lodging, security and other expenses, which add another 20%-30% to the total costs. For comparison, former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made 14 official trips in 2017 and 16 in 2018. A Freedom of Information request in 2018 showed that the trips cost around NIS 85 million ($26,747,647). According to Walla, the reports given by Gantz and Lapid were less detailed. The foreign minister’s office said the top diplomat took eight “important policy trips,” without specifying to which countries, and said they cost NIS 3 million ($944,102) — about half of the Foreign Ministry’s annual budget for the minister’s travel. In line with his role, Lapid has since taking office visited the United States, Russia, the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, the European Union’s headquarters in Brussels, Italy, Paris and London. Since the submission of the query, Lapid has had another one-day trip to Egypt in December, where he met with Sissi. Gantz provided a list of trips that took place during the previous and current government, without addressing the question of costs at all. Advertisement He reported five trips he has made as defense minister in the current government: to France, Singapore, Morocco, the United States and Jordan. Two other ministers who refused to detail their trips’ costs were Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel and Eli Avidar, a minister in the Prime Minister’s Office. Seven ministers have not traveled anywhere since the government was formed: Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman, Justice Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Education Minister Yifat Shasha-Bitton, Interior Security Minister Omer Barlev, Minister in the Finance Ministry Hamad Amar, and Social Equality Minister Meirav Cohen.

News article:
Israeli cabinet ministers on Sunday bade farewell to Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who will end six years in office on Monday night. In his parting remarks, Mandelblit took a thinly veiled swipe at the man he put on trial for corruption: former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who in his latter years of office repeatedly attacked the police, the state prosecutors and the judiciary. “There were those who tried to present the harm [they sought to cause] to the rule of law as an ideological move, under the pretext of ‘governance,’” he said. “But time and time again, we saw that what really stood behind these moves was a desire to advance personal interests, severely damaging the principle of fidelity to the public.” During the initial probe into now-opposition leader Netanyahu, Mandelblit was assailed by voices from the left who accused him of dragging out the investigation. Then, after he eventually pressed charges in three cases for which Netanyahu is currently on trial, he faced a relentless barrage of accusations from Netanyahu and his supporters on the right claiming the charges were a conspiracy by police, the justice system and a left-leaning media aiming to see the prime minister replaced. Netanyahu, who appointed Mandelblit as attorney general in 2016, was eventually ousted last year by a diverse coalition led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, following a run of four inconclusive elections within the space of some two years. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The rule of law is not the attorney general’s personal property. It’s a fundamental component of a democratic country, which the government is obligated to safeguard for the citizens and for the public interest,” Mandelblit told cabinet ministers. “A government that works to weaken the rule of law or, God forbid, acts against the rule of law, is harming the public,” he said. At the farewell session, Bennett praised Mandelblit’s work in defending Israel on the international stage, while other cabinet members highlighted his tenacity in indicting Netanyahu. Advertisement Bennett said of Mandelblit that “in the months since the government was established, we have worked together in the face of very complicated national challenges. “Hardly a day goes by in which the State of Israel is not challenged in the international legal sphere. Our enemies are using every possible tool against us, even legal persecution and delegitimization in international forums,” Bennett said, appearing to refer to Palestinian effort to try Israelis at the International Criminal Court. “The role that you have fulfilled, Avichai Mandelblit, in defending the State of Israel, its soldiers and its citizens, in the international arena… is great and significant. We all owe you a debt of gratitude,” he said. “On behalf of the government of Israel, I would like to thank you, Avichai, for many dedicated years of service to the State of Israel.” Justice Minister Gideon Sa’ar, who was not able to attend the meeting in person as he has been diagnosed with COVID-19, said that Mandelblit had withstood “an open, long, continuous and unstoppable attack for about two years, by the government itself and led by the [former] prime minister.” “You played a key role in maintaining the democratic regime in Israel, and when the dust settles, this is how you will be remembered. You did the job honestly, fairly, and with humanity,” Sa’ar said. Similar praise came from Diaspora Minister Nachman Shai, who said following the meeting, “With his help, among other things Israeli democracy survived the difficult days and resumed functioning. Despite the criticism from the right and left, he courageously and consistently maintained the rule of law in Israel,” Shai said. Advertisement Some, however, were happy to see him go. Far-right Religious Zionism MK Itamar Ben-Gvir welcomed the end of Mandelblit’s term, saying the attorney general had left “scorched earth behind him.” Mandelblit, he charged, had prevented Jews identified with his extremist Otzma Yehudit faction from running for Knesset, protected terrorists, and “cooked up cases against former prime minister Netanyahu.” “It is good that he has gone,” Ben-Gvir said. Netanyahu, who also employed Mandelblit as his cabinet secretary for three years before appointing him attorney general, did not immediately post any remark about the cabinet session on his social media channels. Mandelblit officially ends his term on Tuesday, but so far no replacement for him has been selected. Media reports have indicated that the leading candidate is former Tel Aviv district attorney Gali Baharav-Miara. He leaves office after reported negotiations for a plea bargain with Netanyahu to end his trial fell apart last week, with the possibility they’ll be renewed under Mandelblit’s successor. The alleged negotiations have drawn protests against Mandelblit from those who want to trial to continue. A search committee for Mandelbit’s replacement is reportedly expected to provide Sa’ar with a shortlist of candidates on Sunday evening. The panel is expected to send three candidates to Sa’ar, who will then appoint one of them attorney general, pending cabinet approval

News article:
The free daily newspaper Israel Hayom has announced that Boaz Bismuth is stepping down as editor-in-chief, thereby opening the bidding to the right-wing leadership. It was Bismuth who placed the newspaper at the disposal of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and turned him into the editor-in-chief in practice. Netanyahu dictated the newspaper’s headlines and policy, and for years conducted his relationships with his rivals on the pages of the newspaper. Now, when Netanyahu is the chairman of the opposition and is engaged in contacts for obtaining a plea bargain that will distance him from the political arena, the paper’s controlling shareholder, Miriam Adelson, is seeking a somewhat different policy – right-wing but less Bibi-ist. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett will benefit from the change, but senior Likud officials who are interested in the leadership of the country will also receive preferential treatment. The newspaper was a right-wing publication from the outset and will remain so, but that’s not the problem. What’s the problem? Israel Hayom played a decisive role in Netanyahu’s criminal entanglements. The newspaper provided him with the dream of every politician: unbounded admiration and affection without criticism, total support on every issue, as well as a bonus of aggrandizement for him and his family. But this service turned out to be intoxicating and addictive. It wasn’t enough for Netanyahu, and he took steps to get it from other media outlets too. That’s how he ended up in relationships and incriminating discussions with Arnon Mozes, the editor of Yedioth Ahronoth, and with Shaul Elovitch, the former controlling shareholder of Bezeq/Walla. Netanyahu’s desire to duplicate the treatment he received from Israel Hayom with other media outlets is understandable, but it’s hard to understand how such a cautious, suspicious, intelligent person was carried away by this desire to the point of crossing red lines, which led him into investigations and indictments. His desperate need for friendly, ego-stroking media drove him crazy and destroyed all his supposed precautions. He had a mafia-style conversation with Mozes even while knowing it was being recorded; he planned blatant quid pro quo transactions with Shaul Elovitch, and in two instances he was willing to sell out the public interest for his personal benefit. That was the case when he conveyed to the owners of Israel Hayom Mozes’ demand to curb the competition from the free newspaper and cut back on its distribution, and that was the case when he instructed Shlomo Filber, then-director general of the Communications Ministry and now a state witness, to restrict the reduction of Bezeq fees. In both cases the main victims were the lower-income population. At the starting line for leadership of the right on the day after Netanyahu, in addition to Bennett there are other players like Ayelet Shaked, Nir Barkat, Yisrael Katz, Yuli Edelstein, Miri Regev and perhaps a few other political figures. At the winner’s disposal will be a newspaper that is willing to grant him or her strong backing like Netanyahu received. But the competitors would do well to remember the cost of the newspaper’s unreserved support. There is something intoxicating and addictive about it. It’s deceptive, it feeds the ego and it increases one’s appetite to get more and more of it. Israel Hayom gave Netanyahu the most precious gift he ever received. The newspaper played a part in his success in becoming Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. But the newspaper also played a part in distorting his thinking when it came to his preoccupation with media outlets. He concealed his friendly ties with Elovitch, he intervened and tried to find buyers for Yedioth Ahronoth, he tried to organize the TV market and bring in players who would support him, and of course he also behaved as he did toward Yedioth Ahronoth, Walla and Army Radio. Whoever wins the leadership of the right must be aware of the course of events that dragged Netanyahu from a minor addiction to a newspaper that supported him unreservedly to an unbridled obsession with engineering the communications market for the benefit of his own status and personal interests.

He concealed his friendly ties with Elovitch, he intervened and tried to find buyers for Yedioth Ahronoth, he tried to organize the TV market and bring in players who would support him, and of course he also behaved as he did toward Yedioth Ahronoth, Walla and Army Radio. Whoever wins the leadership of the right must be aware of the course of events that dragged Netanyahu from a minor addiction to a newspaper that supported him unreservedly to an unbridled obsession with engineering the communications market for the benefit of his own status and personal interests.

Foriegn Minister Yair Lapid says as the government decides on what sort of commission to establish to examine the NSO police spying scandal, those at the top should not think they are immune. Those who used to be at the top, at least. Lapid says the first one investigated by the commission should be Likud MK Amir Ohana, who was justice minister from June 2019 to May 2020 and then public security minister until June of last year. Notably, all other justice ministers aside from Ohana in the last seven years have been figures in parties aligned with Lapid’s government. Gilad Erdan, who Lapid has kept on as UN ambassador, was public security minister before Ohana. He says it will take a week for the government to decide whether to establish a government inquiry or a state commission which would have wider powers. He also defends the police, saying “only criminals will be happy if they are dismantled,” echoing rhetoric in the US against calls to defund law enforcement there. “But along with that, gatekeepers of the law need to be the ones who keep the rules better than anyone. Nobody is immune from investigation,” he says. The scandal “clouds Israeli democracy,” he adds.

News article:
The judges in former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial on Monday cancelled a scheduled court hearing for the next day, as they await answers about swirling police phone spying allegations. The Jerusalem District Court gave prosecutors until 2 p.m. Tuesday to respond to questions regarding the illicit phone spying. The judges will convene Wednesday to discuss how to proceed, the court said. The decision came after the court had earlier rejected a request for a delay by attorneys for Netanyahu and other defendants. The attorneys filed the petition calling for a pause following an explosive report Monday morning that said the Israel Police used the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to hack into the phones of a wide range of public figures — including associates and family members of Netanyahu as well as multiple people currently involved in the trial — without any judicial oversight or approval. According to the report, which was unsourced, police hacked the phones, among others, of former Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua; former Communications Ministry directors general Shlomo Filber and Avi Berger; Iris Elovitch, the wife of Shaul Elovitch, the former controlling shareholder of Bezeq, both of whom are defendants in the Netanyahu trial; former Bezeq CEOs Dudu Mizrachi and Stella Hendler; former Walla editor-in-chief Aviram Elad, and other journalists at Walla. The abuse use of the spyware reportedly extended far beyond people involved in the Netanyahu investigation and trial, with those illicitly targeted also said to include activists and demonstrators (including against Netanyahu), mayors, ministry director-generals, journalists and others. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In Case 4000, one of the three graft cases for which the former prime minister is on trial, Netanyahu is alleged to have advanced regulatory decisions as communications minister and prime minister that immensely benefited Elovitch, in exchange for editorial control over the Walla news site. The former premier denies the charges against him. Yeshua, the first witness to testify in the corruption trial, appeared in court repeatedly over a period of several months. Elad and Berger have also testified, and Filber had been slated to take the stand in the coming weeks. Jack Chen, an attorney for the Elovitches, said Monday that “for years we have been warning against a flawed and tendentious investigation that crossed all boundaries.” Today, he said, in light of the reports, “nobody can keep saying that we exaggerated.” Advertisement Chen said “the most urgent thing to do for all of our sakes is to stop, conduct an independent investigation of what happened, understand its significance and then start making corrections.” The report published Monday, weeks after Calcalist first reported on the alleged police use of such tactics, also said that Avner Netanyahu, the son of the former prime minister, and Netanyahu advisers Yonatan Urich and Topaz Luk had been targeted. Avner Netanyahu’s phone was said to have been hacked due to police suspicions that his mother, Sara, used it. News that Filber was targeted by police spying first broke last week, though the Kan public broadcaster reported that so far, prosecutors believe any improper use of spyware technology was not tied to evidence used in the Netanyahu case. On Friday, the Jerusalem District Court gave state prosecutors until Tuesday to answer questions from the defense about police use of spyware in the investigation into the former premier. Attorneys for Netanyahu and other defendants in the case have demanded to know exactly what data was obtained, how it was used and whether others involved in the trial were also targeted in the operation, among other questions. Prosecutors have said they are examining the matter.

Former attorney general Avichai Mandelblit blocked police requests to tap into the phones of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son and wife, Ynet reports. An unnamed former senior police investigator tells the website that as part of the criminal investigations into Netanyahu, cops asked to wiretap Yair and Sara Netanyahu. “We had zero access to electronic media, at the office and at home. Mandelblit didn’t authorize it,” the unnamed ex-cop says. “We asked to listen in — the attorney general blocked it.” “We kept saying that Sara is clobbering us in the questioning, and we can’t even check her phone, to see if she said what she claims, or wrote what she claims, in areas tied to the probe,” the official says. “We did not get permission to request court orders to wiretap them, and we kept complaining that we were being handicapped and our hands were being tied.”

News article:
State prosecutors said Sunday in an interim statement that a police check turned up no evidence that officers wiretapped phones without a warrant during their investigation of alleged misdeeds by former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, the prosecution, in a letter to the Jerusalem District Court, did not comment on how and how many warrants were executed and, critically, whether spyware had been employed against the subjects of investigations. Prosecutors relied on “information provided by competent authorities within the Israel Police” to check about 1,500 phone numbers associated with parties investigated in the three graft cases against Netanyahu, known as cases 1000, 2000, and 4000. The check focused on both standard wiretapping and the use of more “advanced” technologies, according to the prosecution’s update to the court. The list of 1,500 numbers was compiled from the list of existing search orders, as well as phone numbers belonging to parties followed in the investigation. No information was provided on the subset of phones within the 1,500 that were searched or listened to, only to say that the police confirmed that all phones touched by the investigation had a court order attached to them. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “No actions were taken when there was no court order,” the prosecution told the court, which last week ordered a hiatus in the trial proceedings in order to investigate claims of widespread illicit hacking by police using NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus software, among other advanced technologies. The prosecution requested three more days to complete its check, which is expected to answer questions “related to the manner in which the [court] orders issued were used,” according to the prosecution’s letter to the court. In a statement following the state prosecution’s announcements, the defense attorneys in the trial said that “the prosecution admits that it spied on civilians. No order authorized the police to use spyware. The prosecution has not yet provided the required information — who was hacked and to what extent.” Advertisement Meannwhile heads of the Knesset’s opposition parties rejected the prosecution’s statement, calling it an “attempt to silence the scandal regarding the spying on Israeli citizens,” and called for the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the affair. An ongoing separate investigation, headed by Deputy Attorney General Amit Marari, along with former officials from the Shin Bet and Mossad and input from the NSO Group, is looking into whether the police made use of spy software to break into the phones of 26 people named last week in an explosive, unsourced report by the Calcalist newspaper. Some of the names listed in that report were also checked ahead of the latest update to the court, because they were involved in the police investigation into Netanyahu. Figures listed in the Calcalist report associated with the trial are Ilan Yeshua, the former CEO of Walla and currently a top witness in Case 4000 against Netanyahu; Avner Netanyahu, the son of the former prime minister; Shlomo Filber, a former Communications Ministry director general; Iris Elovitch, the wife of Shaul Elovitch, the former controlling shareholder of Bezeq (both are defendants in Case 4000); former Bezeq CEOs Dudu Mizrachi and Stella Hendler; former Walla editor-in-chief Aviram Elad, and other journalists at Walla. In that case, one of the three graft cases for which the former prime minister is on trial, Netanyahu is alleged to have advanced regulatory decisions as communications minister and prime minister that immensely benefited Elovitch. In exchange, Netanyahu allegedly was given what amounted to editorial control over Elovitch’s Walla news site. The former premier denies the charges against him. The Jerusalem District Court postponed two hearings last week to allow investigators to look into the hacking claims, and Netanyahu’s attorneys filed a petition last week calling for a pause in the trial. Advertisement Judges are set to deliberate over when to resume proceedings in the case. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

Tel Aviv - Asharq Al-Awsat The Jerusalem District Court announced on Sunday that all planned sessions this week in former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial will be postponed to Feb 21. The former premier, now opposition leader, is on trial for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. A high-level Israeli inquiry into alleged warrantless wiretaps by police is examining a database provided by NSO Group, the manufacturer of the powerful hacking tool Pegasus, the Justice Ministry said on Sunday. NSO, which has denied wrongdoing amid months of spiraling reports in Israel and abroad of privacy violations by government clients using Pegasus, has said its “audit log’ database provides accurate information on phones infected by the spyware. Israel’s Calcalist newspaper, in an unsourced report last week, said police had used Pegasus without judges' warrants against public figures including a son and two of Netanyahu’s close aides. The report prompted the court to cancel a hearing in Netanyahu’s trial scheduled for Tuesday. It instructed prosecutors to answer questions from the former premier’s lawyers about the extent of the espionage. The lawyers submitted their questions last week after multiple Israeli broadcasters reported that police may have used spyware on Shlomo Filber, a former Netanyahu ally turned state witness. Prosecutors in the Netanyahu trial requested that Jerusalem District Court give them until Wednesday to deliver a fuller response, citing a need to declassify materials first, the Ministry statement added. They said that the police have found no unlawful use of phone surveillance technology against witnesses in the trial. Police and prosecutors insist that this is a side case and that Netanyahu will not be acquitted. However, the court insists to carry on the inquiry to determine whether this claim is valid.

Prosecutors in former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial told the court on Wednesday that spyware was used by police to hack the phone of one witness in the case but that no material discovered was used and that proceedings should continue as scheduled. State prosecutors told the Jerusalem District Court that the only person connected to the case who was spied on with the NSO Group’s Pegasus software was Shlomo Filber, the former director of the Communications Ministry and a key witness. Prosecutors claim that the spyware was activated on his phone for about a day but that no material relevant to the case was found. The prosecutors’ submission was based on a police probe that included an examination of records involving 1,500 phone numbers associated with parties investigated in the three graft cases against Netanyahu, known as cases 1000, 2000 and 4000. Lawyers for the defendants and associates of Netanyahu rejected the state prosecutors’ claims and demanded a state commission of inquiry.

This week’s scheduled sessions in the trial were postponed amid the controversy to allow for state prosecutors to complete an investigation into the claims. Reports have swirled over the past two weeks that the Israel Police used spyware without judicial approval to target many activists and public officials, including figures central to Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial. Supporters of Netanyahu argue that the allegations are a reason to toss out the entire case against him. Advertisement Figures listed in a report in the Calcalist business daily who are associated with the trial and supposedly had their phones hacked are: Ilan Yeshua, the former CEO of Walla and currently a top witness in Case 4000 against Netanyahu; Avner Netanyahu, the son of the former prime minister; Filber, a former Communications Ministry director-general and a key state’s witness; Iris Elovitch, the wife of Shaul Elovitch, the former controlling shareholder of Bezeq (both are defendants in Case 4000); former Bezeq CEOs Dudu Mizrachi and Stella Hendler; former Walla editor-in-chief Aviram Elad; and other journalists at Walla. In Case 4000, Netanyahu is alleged to have advanced regulatory decisions as communications minister and prime minister that immensely benefited Elovitch. In exchange, Netanyahu allegedly was given what amounted to editorial control over Elovitch’s Walla news site. The former premier denies the charges against him. “We completely reject the claims of the prosecution and the police,” Netanyahu associates said in a statement released to Israeli media. “It seems that this is the tip of the iceberg for police spying against innocent Israelis. Therefore, only a state commission of inquiry can reveal the scope of the illegal police spying and produce a true investigation,” they said. Elovitch’s lawyer Jacques Chen released a statement saying that the prosecution admitted the police illegally spied on a major figure in the case and tried to do so against Elovitch. “These actions were hidden not just from the defenses, but also from the district court and the Supreme Court, which discussed the defense’s request to make the investigation materials public,” Chen said. Advertisement “Because the police knew of this grave matter the entire time and it was not disclosed to the defense nor the prosecution, we cannot trust anything else ‘submitted’ to the prosecution from the police regarding the investigation that it conducted and in which it was involved,” he added. Netanyahu’s defense lawyers are expected to argue next week in court that the police report the prosecutors relied upon is not credible and that the trial should be delayed until a more in-depth probe into the allegations. An ongoing separate investigation, headed by Deputy Attorney General Amit Marari, along with former officials from the Shin Bet and Mossad and input from the NSO Group, is looking into whether police made use of spy software to break into the phones of the 26 people named last week in the explosive, unsourced report by the Calcalist newspaper. This investigation has found that many of the allegations in the original Calcalist news story were false, a Wednesday report said. Channel 12 news reported that the probe headed by Marari has found that NSO’s Pegasus spyware was not used against three former directors of government ministries: Shai Babad, Keren Terner and Emi Palmor. The allegation that police used spyware to target the three former senior civil servants — none of whom is suspected of any criminal activity — was among the most incendiary elements of the Calcalist report. The prime minister’s son, Avner Netanyahu, also named in the Calcalist report, was also not spied on, the Marari probe has reportedly established. According to Channel 12, there were some individuals named by Calcalist who were subjected to police phone hacking via spyware, but they were suspected of criminal activity and the use of spyware was given judicial approval. The Marari team is expected to present its findings to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Public Security Minister Gideon Sa’ar and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara later this week.

State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman on Thursday confirmed he is carrying out an “in-depth” investigation into bombshell claims that Israel Police spied on Israeli citizens. “Maintaining privacy is a cornerstone of a democratic state,” Englman said during a conference in Jerusalem. “We will carry out an in-depth examination of all the conduct of law enforcement agencies through technological means.” Englman announced last month that he would probe claims that police used the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to hack into the phones of private citizens who were not suspected of crimes without any warrant or judicial oversight. Current and former senior police officers have denied the claims, made in unsourced reports in the Calcalist daily, and initial investigations by the police and the deputy attorney general have reportedly found no such abuse. The police have acknowledged hacking the phone of Shlomo Filber, a state’s witness in the trial of Benjamin Netanyahu, and say they have targeted the phones of criminal suspects with judicial authorization. Englman said his probe will involve a series of internal and external experts as well as individuals who previously served in intelligence positions. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “Our investigation will examine a number of aspects, including the use of technological means by law enforcement agencies — whether there was a deviation from authority and whether legislation and regulation in Israel are prepared to deal with technological progress. And — what are the procedures for using these means on citizens’ phones. We will also check the information security of data collected by the police — whether [the data are] protected against possible leaks,” he said. Englman said he respected the current investigation being overseen by Deputy Attorney General Amit Marari, but said “it is important that there be an audit by the State Comptroller, which is an independent body.” Marari’s ongoing investigation, aided by former officials from the Shin Bet and Mossad and with input from the NSO Group, is looking into whether police made illicit use of spy software to break into the phones of 26 people named earlier this month by the Calcalist newspaper. Advertisement This investigation has found that most of those named in the newspaper report were not targeted, a Wednesday report said. Channel 12 news said Marari’s probe has established that NSO’s Pegasus spyware was not used, among others, against three former directors of government ministries: Shai Babad, Keren Terner Eyal and Emi Palmor.

The Marari team is expected to soon present its findings to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Public Security Minister Gideon Sa’ar and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. NSO’s Pegasus is considered one of the most powerful cyber-surveillance tools available on the market, giving operators the ability to effectively take full control of a target’s phone, download all data from the device, or activate its camera or microphone without the user knowing. Advertisement The company has been involved in numerous scandals in recent years and has faced a torrent of international criticism over allegations it allows governments, including dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, to spy on dissidents and rights activists. It was blacklisted by the US last year along with several other firms. On Tuesday, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), an independent EU watchdog on privacy concerns, called for a ban on Pegasus spyware within the European Union. “A ban on the development and deployment of spyware with the capability of Pegasus in the EU would be the most effective option,” the EDPS wrote in a new report. The organization says that the spyware, which infiltrates smartphones and can access all data available on the phone, is “incompatible with our democratic values.” Spyware like Pegasus “has the potential to cause unprecedented risks and damages not only to the fundamental freedoms but also to democracy and the rule of law,” EDPS said. NSO has insisted that its software is intended for use only in fighting terrorism and other crimes, that it bars sales to those it believes will abuse it and halts contracts if it discovers abuse. Its CEO said in a recent interview that NSO’s presence on the US blacklist was “an outrage.”

The Israeli journalist who has led reporting on the police’s alleged illicit use of spyware on civilians defended his reporting on Saturday, amid growing doubts about its veracity. The Calcalist business daily has made bombshell allegations about Israeli police using spyware without proper oversight, which were initially met with calls from across the political spectrum for investigations.

The hearings slated for this week in the ongoing corruption trial of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu are canceled after Judge Moshe Bar-Am tests positive for COVID. Earlier today, the court canceled tomorrow’s hearing when it found out that Bar-Am had come in contact with a positive COVID case. Now, it cancels the hearings for the rest of the week, since Bar-Am will have to remain in quarantine. The judges in the trial were slated to deal this week with the fallout from the police spying affair incident. Prosecutors have claimed that allegations that Israel Police illegally spied on witnesses in the case should have no bearing on the trial. But lawyers for Netanyahu have demanded that prosecutors turn over to the court any information found on the phone of state witness Shlomo Filber, whom police have admitted to hacking.

Members of Israeli border police patrol near the scene of a security incident at an Israeli military base near Jenin in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, May 7, 2021. REUTERS/Raneen Sawafta Asharq Al-Awsat Eight Palestinians died on Thursday when the van they rode in collided with a cement truck in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian official media said. The two vehicles slammed into each other at a junction on Route 90, which runs up the Jordan Valley and is under Israeli security control near the northern West Bank village of Fasayil, according to the Wafa news agency. A medic with the Magen David Adom Israeli rescue services said in a statement that the scene at the crash site was "shocking". "We saw a truck and a private vehicle crushed on the side of the road," he said. The victims were not officially identified but local news outlets reported they were teenagers between 14 and 17 years old. AFP was not able to verify this. Wafa said that Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas declared a day of mourning to be observed on Friday across the Palestinian territories in honor of the victims. Medics declared seven people dead at the scene, and Wafa later reported an additional victim. Three injured people were evacuated to Israeli hospitals via helicopter. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz issued a note of sympathy published in Arabic and Hebrew. "I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to the Palestinian families who lost eight of their loved ones today" in the crash, he said. Neighboring Jordan also expressed condolences. Palestinian police told AFP that the victims were workers from the town of Aqraba, near Nablus.

Clashes erupted in the West Bank city of Jenin in the pre-dawn hours of Saturday morning after Palestinian Authority security forces arrested three people, including the son of a terror leader who broke out of an Israeli prison last year. PA security forces forcibly arrested Muhammad Zubeidi, son of Zakaria Zubeidi, a terror convict who broke out of Israel’s Gilboa prison and went on the lam for a week before being recaptured. The Palestinian officers also arrested two other individuals, Haaretz reported. The reason for the arrests was unclear. Video clips that were said to show officers arresting younger Zubeidi and roughing him up circulated online, sparking furor in the restive city. Dozens of armed Jenin residents confronted the PA security forces to oppose the arrests. Arabic media reports said protesters fired live bullets at the PA’s headquarters in the city in a gun battle with security forces.

Officials from Ramallah were attempting to calm the waters in the city early Saturday morning. The northern West Bank city has seen a string of violent incidents in recent months, including other shootings directed at the municipality building, and the PA has vowed to crack down on the perpetrators. Saturday morning’s events were seen as particularly severe. The city is widely seen as a hotbed of activity for the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terror groups. Jenin’s governor told The Times of Israel in November that illegal weapons have spread widely in the area and shootings had also increased, spurring a government response. In late November, the PA launched a series of crackdowns in Jenin but denied they were targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, saying instead that it was a law and order operation. Advertisement Israeli soldiers entering the area to conduct arrests have also repeatedly been met with gunfire. In late September, Islamic Jihad member Osama Soboh was killed during a shootout with Israeli troops near Jenin. Another four Palestinians, including two members of the PA security forces, were killed during a gun battle with Israeli soldiers in August. A report last week said the IDF had been poised to launch a large-scale operation in Jenin in recent months, but halted the raid after PA forces were pressured into acting. The Channel 12 report cited a conversation between IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi and confidants. Kohavi reportedly said the ability to get the PA to act in the city was a result of the close security cooperation between Israel and the PA. The security cooperation was a central theme of recent talks when PA President Mahmoud Abbas met with Defense Minister Benny Gantz at his home, the first time the Palestinian leader has held talks with a senior Israeli official in Israel since 2010. The Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank, is dominated by the nationalist Fatah movement. Fatah and Hamas have long fought one another; a bloody 2007 civil war between the two parties saw Hamas expel their rivals from the Gaza Strip.

News article:
A cleaner who was paralyzed after falling down an unfenced elevator shaft at a construction site bears no blame for the accident and is therefore entitled to full compensation, the Supreme Court has ruled. The justices said they made this decision due to the inherent imbalance of power between the worker and his employer, and also because another worker at the site had previously warned of the danger. They thereby overturned the Haifa District Court’s ruling that the worker also shares some of the blame. ‘I hope we won’t need it’: Israel’s doomsday option against Iran. LISTEN The worker, a Palestinian whose name is under a gag order, was paralyzed from the waist down after falling four stories down the shaft in 2014. He was working in a building at a construction site in Beit Shemesh run by the Stern Group. “It’s hard to expect a worker to stand up to his employer and refuse to continue working due to dangers of some kind when his daily bread lies in the balance,” Justice Neal Hendel wrote in a verdict issued late last month. Justices Ofer Grosskopf and David Mintz concurred. Open gallery view Construction workers in Tel Aviv. “Work safety regulations weren’t intended to examine whether the worker is complying with their implementation,” Hendel continued. “Therefore, once his employer failed to strictly comply with safety regulations ... he should not be allowed to point the finger of blame at the worker for failing to demand this.” Even though the worker never complained to his managers about the lack of fencing around the elevator shaft, Hendel added, it’s not clear whether he was ever given any training about safety. The district court had ruled that the company owed the worker some compensation, since it failed to fence off the elevator shaft and provided the worker with no protective equipment. Nevertheless, it added, the worker is guilty of “contributory negligence,” because he had experience in the construction industry in general and with this building site in particular, and therefore knew the shaft wasn’t fenced. The lower court’s ruling also cited the worker’s failure to complain about the lack of fencing and the fact that he continued working at the site despite the danger of falling. It set his share of the blame at 15 percent of the total damages. The Supreme Court agreed that there are times when a worker takes unreasonable risks, or ignores such risks, and thereby contributes to his own injury. But there are also cases in which the worker simply makes a mistake or gets caught up in his work, and that is not sufficient to warrant assigning him a share of the blame, it continued. The current case, it added, belongs in the latter category. “This is a precedent-setting ruling,” the worker’s lawyers, Uri Gilboa and Amit Uria, said in a statement. “We’re certain that if it reverberates, it will affect change, because the understanding that ordinary workers can’t be blamed for the failures of the employer, who could prevent the accident with a minimal investment, will gradually seep in.”

A cleaner who was paralyzed after falling down an unfenced elevator shaft at a construction site bears no blame for the accident and is therefore entitled to full compensation, the Supreme Court has ruled. The justices said they made this decision due to the inherent imbalance of power between the worker and his employer, and also because another worker at the site had previously warned of the danger. They thereby overturned the Haifa District Court’s ruling that the worker also shares some of the blame. ‘I hope we won’t need it’: Israel’s doomsday option against Iran. LISTEN The worker, a Palestinian whose name is under a gag order, was paralyzed from the waist down after falling four stories down the shaft in 2014. He was working in a building at a construction site in Beit Shemesh run by the Stern Group. “It’s hard to expect a worker to stand up to his employer and refuse to continue working due to dangers of some kind when his daily bread lies in the balance,” Justice Neal Hendel wrote in a verdict issued late last month. Justices Ofer Grosskopf and David Mintz concurred. Open gallery view Construction workers in Tel Aviv. “Work safety regulations weren’t intended to examine whether the worker is complying with their implementation,” Hendel continued. “Therefore, once his employer failed to strictly comply with safety regulations ... he should not be allowed to point the finger of blame at the worker for failing to demand this.” Even though the worker never complained to his managers about the lack of fencing around the elevator shaft, Hendel added, it’s not clear whether he was ever given any training about safety. The district court had ruled that the company owed the worker some compensation, since it failed to fence off the elevator shaft and provided the worker with no protective equipment. Nevertheless, it added, the worker is guilty of “contributory negligence,” because he had experience in the construction industry in general and with this building site in particular, and therefore knew the shaft wasn’t fenced. The lower court’s ruling also cited the worker’s failure to complain about the lack of fencing and the fact that he continued working at the site despite the danger of falling. It set his share of the blame at 15 percent of the total damages. The Supreme Court agreed that there are times when a worker takes unreasonable risks, or ignores such risks, and thereby contributes to his own injury. But there are also cases in which the worker simply makes a mistake or gets caught up in his work, and that is not sufficient to warrant assigning him a share of the blame, it continued. The current case, it added, belongs in the latter category. “This is a precedent-setting ruling,” the worker’s lawyers, Uri Gilboa and Amit Uria, said in a statement. “We’re certain that if it reverberates, it will affect change, because the understanding that ordinary workers can’t be blamed for the failures of the employer, who could prevent the accident with a minimal investment, will gradually seep in.”

An 80-year-old Palestinian man died of a heart attack on Wednesday after being detained overnight by Israeli forces in the Ramallah area, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. According to the ministry's statement, Omar Abdalmajeed As'ad was "assaulted" and beaten by Israeli soldiers, who stopped him on his way home, in the village of Jiljilya, and handcuffed him. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said that As'ad was a dual U.S. citizen. As'ad and the zip tie allegedly used to handcuff him. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price expressed condolences over the death on Wednesday at a news briefing, and said he had asked for clarification from Israel regarding the death of the man, who is a U.S. citizen. The Israeli military confirmed he had been held by soldiers "after resisting a security inspection," but said he was then released and only later, in the morning, found dead near his village. Jiljilya village council head Fouad Qattoum said As'ad was returning home after visiting relatives when Israeli soldiers stopped his car, bound him, blindfolded him and led him away to a building still under construction. Another villager said he saw Israeli soldiers walking As'ad away around 3 A.M. As'ad's body was found more than an hour later, according to vegetable seller Mamdouh Elaboud, who said he was himself detained for 20 minutes, then released. As'ad's family said he was taken to a hospital in Ramallah, where he was pronounced dead. His brother said that As'ad was "an elderly man who suffered from respiration and heart problems." "I don't understand how a man that age can be considered a danger," the brother added. "They handcuffed him and shoved him. That's abuse... I have no doubt what he went through caused his death." The Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned "the killing" of As'ad, adding that "this crime serves as an example of the occupation's brutality and aggression against Palestinians, along with raids, arrests and intimidation of civilians, including women and children." The ministry added that it will "file complaints to all international bodies, including the international court." Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said that As'ad was "lynched by occupation soldiers," and that his death was "a crime arising from the terror agenda" carried out by Israeli soldiers and settlers. Israel's military police have launched an investigation into the incident. Reuters contributed to this article.

Men stand next to a poster of Palestinian Omar Abdalmajeed As'ad, 80, in Jiljilya village in the Israeli-occupied West Bank January 12, 2022. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat An 80-year-old Palestinian man, described by his family as a US citizen, was found dead after being detained and handcuffed during an Israeli raid on a village in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials and relatives said on Wednesday. The body of Omar Abdalmajeed As'ad was found in Jiljilya in the early hours of the morning with a plastic zip-tie still around one wrist, villagers told Reuters. The Israeli military confirmed that it had carried out an overnight operation in the village, and that a Palestinian was "apprehended after resisting a check." It said he was alive when the soldiers released him. "The Military Police Criminal Investigation Division is reviewing the incident, at the end of which the findings will be transferred to the Military General Advocate Corps," it said in a statement. As'ad's brother told Reuters As'ad was an American citizen, a former Milwaukee, Wisconsin resident, who had lived in the United States for decades and returned 10 years ago. The US Embassy declined to comment. As'ad's family delayed the funeral until Thursday to allow a post-mortem. Islam Abu Zaher, a local doctor who said he had tried to resuscitate As'ad but found no pulse, said there were no obvious signs of injury and the cause of death was unclear. "It is possible that he suffered a heart attack or some form of panic," Abu Zaher told Reuters, noting that As'ad had previously undergone open heart surgery and cardiac catheterisation. "We would need to perform an autopsy." Jiljilya village council head Fouad Qattoum said As'ad was returning home after visiting relatives when Israeli soldiers stopped his car, bound him, blindfolded him and led him away to a building still under construction.

"He was lying face down on the ground and when we turned him over we found an elderly man with no sign of life." In a post on Facebook page, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh blamed Israeli forces for the man's death, calling it a "crime." Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Amnon Shefler said the military "will investigate this event in a thorough and professional manner, acting in line with our values and protocols."

News article:
An 80-year-old Palestinian was found dead in a village in the occupied West Bank early Wednesday, his body still handcuffed after an Israeli arrest raid, its mayor said. The Israeli army had no immediate comment when contacted by AFP. Around 30 to 40 Israeli troops took part in the pre-dawn operation in the village of Jiljiliya, north of Ramallah, mayor Fuad Moutee told AFP. Omar Abdulmajeed Asad and other family members were returning from visiting relatives when they were stopped by the soldiers, Moutee said. "They stopped the cars in the village centre and arrested the passengers inside and handcuffed them," he said. After the troops withdrew, villagers found Asad's body in a building under construction. In a brief statement, the Palestinian health ministry confirmed the mayor's version of events, adding that Assad had died of a "heart attack". His death comes after clashes between troops and students on Tuesday at Birzeit University, near Ramallah, as well as as an attempted car ramming attack in which an Israeli soldier was injured near a Jewish settlement. Clashes break out frequently in Palestinian population centers in the West Bank when Israeli troops mount incursions to carry out arrests. Israel has occupied the territory since the Six-Day War of 1967. Excluding annexed east Jerusalem, some 475,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank regarded as illegal under international law, alongside more than 2.9 million Palestinians.

An 80-year-old Palestinian was found dead in a village in the occupied West Bank early Wednesday, his body still handcuffed after an Israeli arrest raid, its mayor said. The Israeli army had no immediate comment when contacted by AFP. Around 30 to 40 Israeli troops took part in the pre-dawn operation in the village of Jiljiliya, north of Ramallah, mayor Fuad Moutee told AFP. Omar Abdulmajeed Asad and other family members were returning from visiting relatives when they were stopped by the soldiers, Moutee said. "They stopped the cars in the village centre and arrested the passengers inside and handcuffed them," he said. After the troops withdrew, villagers found Asad's body in a building under construction. In a brief statement, the Palestinian health ministry confirmed the mayor's version of events, adding that Assad had died of a "heart attack". His death comes after clashes between troops and students on Tuesday at Birzeit University, near Ramallah, as well as as an attempted car ramming attack in which an Israeli soldier was injured near a Jewish settlement. Clashes break out frequently in Palestinian population centers in the West Bank when Israeli troops mount incursions to carry out arrests. Israel has occupied the territory since the Six-Day War of 1967. Excluding annexed east Jerusalem, some 475,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank regarded as illegal under international law, alongside more than 2.9 million Palestinians.

The Biden administration is seeking clarification from Israel after an 80-year-old Palestinian-American died of a heart attack he suffered following his arrest by Israeli soldiers near Ramallah on Wednesday morning. According to Omar Abd al-Majid As’ad’s family, Israeli soldiers tied his hands and beat him after the arrest in his hometown of Jiljilya, before apparently releasing him from detention. Before As’ad’s arrest, the Israeli army had conducted intensive patrols and random stops in the village over the past two days, culminating in a predawn raid on Wednesday morning, Jiljilya mayor Fouad Qattum said in a phone call. “More than 50 soldiers entered the village early this morning, patrolling around the village and between the homes. Amr As’ad, the martyr, was returning home from his relatives and they dragged him out of his car,” Qattum said. After being detained in an empty house, As’ad, who suffered from diabetes and other chronic conditions, apparently suffered a heart attack, Qattum said. It was not clear if the soldiers were present when he collapsed.

He was taken to a local Palestinian health clinic before being transferred to the Palestine Medical Center in Ramallah, where he died, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said in a statement. The Israel Defense Forces said Military Police opened an investigation into As’ad’s death. In a statement, the military confirmed that As’ad was arrested overnight, but did not comment on the Palestinian allegations of violence. “The Palestinian was arrested during an operation by IDF troops after he refused a security search. The detainee was released later that night,” the military said. Asked for comment on the matter during the daily press briefing, US State Department spokesman Ned Price began by confirming that As’ad was an American citizen. “We have been in touch with Mr. As’ad’s family to express our condolences about this tragedy. We’re providing all of the consular assistance to the family at this time,” he said.

The military conducts arrest operations on a nightly basis, often arresting tens or dozens of Palestinians on suspicion of involvement in terror activity. Tensions have been rising between Israel and the Palestinians across the West Bank and Gaza over the past month, including a wave of terror attacks that so far have taken the lives of two Israeli civilians and wounded several others.

Israeli forces fire tear gas amid clashes with Palestinian protesters following a demonstration against settlements in the village of Beita in the occupied West Bank, on January 7, 2022 JAAFAR ASHTIYEH AFP/File Asharq Al-Awsat The United States on Wednesday urged an investigation after an 80-year-old Palestinian-American was found dead in the occupied West Bank following arrest by Israel. The mayor of the village of Jiljiliya, north of Ramallah, told AFP that Omar Abdulmajeed Asad's body was still in handcuffs after his death.

Mourners took Thursday a last look at the body of Omar Asaad, 80, in the family house, during his funeral in the West Bank village of Jaljulia, north of Ramallah. Asaad, an 80-year-old Palestinian with U.S. citizenship, died of a heart attack after being detained by Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank. He was detained by Israeli forces while returning from a relative's home in Jaljulia, his hometown . He was brought to a hospital hours later, dead from a heart attack, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The State Department said it was in touch with the Israeli government to seek "clarification" about the incident, which occurred early Wednesday, and that it supports a "thorough investigation." Jaljulia Mayor Fouad Qattum, citing witnesses, said the soldiers stopped Asaad's vehicle and removed him by force shortly before dawn. He said they took Asaad, bound and blindfolded, to an abandoned building nearby. Later, they detained a number of young men from the surrounding area in the same building. Qattum said the other detainees did not know Asaad was there because it was dark and he didn't make a sound. They only found him later, after the army had withdrawn, lying on his stomach with his jacket draped over him. They administered first aid and called an ambulance, but the medics were unable to revive him. It's unclear when he died. "The other young men who were detained didn't know he was there. If he had been alive he would have said something," Qattum said. The Israeli military said in a statement Wednesday that Asaad was arrested "after resisting a check" and was released later that night, implying he was alive. It said the military police are reviewing the incident. Israel says it thoroughly investigates incidents in which Palestinians are killed by Israeli troops. But rights groups say those investigations rarely lead to indictments or convictions, and that in many cases the army does not interview key witnesses or retrieve evidence.

News article:
Mourners took Thursday a last look at the body of Omar Asaad, 80, in the family house, during his funeral in the West Bank village of Jaljulia, north of Ramallah. Asaad, an 80-year-old Palestinian with U.S. citizenship, died of a heart attack after being detained by Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank. He was detained by Israeli forces while returning from a relative's home in Jaljulia, his hometown . He was brought to a hospital hours later, dead from a heart attack, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The State Department said it was in touch with the Israeli government to seek "clarification" about the incident, which occurred early Wednesday, and that it supports a "thorough investigation." Jaljulia Mayor Fouad Qattum, citing witnesses, said the soldiers stopped Asaad's vehicle and removed him by force shortly before dawn. He said they took Asaad, bound and blindfolded, to an abandoned building nearby. Later, they detained a number of young men from the surrounding area in the same building. Qattum said the other detainees did not know Asaad was there because it was dark and he didn't make a sound. They only found him later, after the army had withdrawn, lying on his stomach with his jacket draped over him. They administered first aid and called an ambulance, but the medics were unable to revive him. It's unclear when he died. "The other young men who were detained didn't know he was there. If he had been alive he would have said something," Qattum said. The Israeli military said in a statement Wednesday that Asaad was arrested "after resisting a check" and was released later that night, implying he was alive. It said the military police are reviewing the incident. Israel says it thoroughly investigates incidents in which Palestinians are killed by Israeli troops. But rights groups say those investigations rarely lead to indictments or convictions, and that in many cases the army does not interview key witnesses or retrieve evidence.

A Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces on Monday in an alleged knife attack in the occupied West Bank, according to the Israeli army, and reported by Anadolu News Agency. A military statement said the Palestinian attempted to stab an Israeli soldier at Gush Etzion junction north of Hebron. The army said an Israeli soldier opened fire and neutralised the assailant. No injuries were reported among Israeli soldiers. The Palestinian Health Ministry identified the dead Palestinian as Faleh Jaradat from Sa'ir town, northeast of Hebron city. Dozens of Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in recent months for allegedly attempting to carry out stabbing or car-ramming attacks. Palestinian rights groups, meanwhile, accuse the Israeli forces of deliberately killing Palestinians with no risk to their lives.

Israeli forces on Monday shot dead a Palestinian man who they claimed \was trying to stab a soldier in the West Bank, Israel's army said, in the latest unrest in the occupied territory. A statement from Israel's army said the alleged assailant had arrived in a vehicle at the Gush Etzion Junction, which is part of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank. "The assailant, armed with a knife, got out of the vehicle and attempted to stab a (Israeli) soldier. The soldier fired towards the assailant and neutralised him," the army statement said. A military spokesperson told AFP the suspect had been killed. The Palestinian health ministry identified the man killed as Faleh Musa Jaradat, who lived south of Hebron. Knife attacks by Palestinians targeting Israeli occupied forces are common in the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel's army since the Six Day War in 1967. Nearly 475,000 Jewish settlers have since moved into the territory, living in communities that are widely regarded as illegal under international law. Tension and violence between settlers and Palestinians is common in the West Bank, which Palestinian claim as a key part of their future state. Search Keywords: Short link:

A tow truck driver who two weeks ago ran over and fatally injured a Palestinian man in the West Bank has yet to be questioned by the police. The Palestinian, 65-year-old Suleiman Hathalin, died of his injuries on Monday. The police said that the driver has been summoned for questioning in the death of al-Hathalin, who had attempted to block the truck’s path. Iran’s bizarre but worrying espionage campaign against Israel: LISTEN The driver was working on behalf of the police at the time of the incident, removing unlicensed vehicles that had been taken off the road as unroadworthy. Hathalin was a well-known protester in the area. Palestinian witnesses to the incident in the village of Umm al-Kheir in the South Hebron Hills have also yet to be questioned. Thousands attended Hathalin's funeral in the village on Tuesday. Hathalin’s son Moutasim said that he went to the Israeli police station in the settlement of Kiryat Arba two days after the incident to file a complaint against the tow truck driver. The son said that the police refused to accept the complaint and told him to file it with the Justice Ministry’s police misconduct unit, although the driver was a civilian and not a policeman. Qamar Mashraqi, a lawyer from the Haqel nonprofit group, who represents the family, said that she had arranged the son’s visit to the police station in advance.

Credit: Nasser Nasser/AP A photo of the scene taken by Palestinians minutes before Hathalin was run over shows a policeman with a body camera. However, replying to a Haaretz inquiry about footage of the incident, the police said the police had not had cameras at the time. About an hour prior to the incident, the driver posted a video on his Facebook page that appears to have been taken from a dashboard-mounted camera from the truck. The police are yet to issue a response whether the driver has photos of the incident. The police have also not responded to Haaretz’s question regarding whether police officers at the scene of the incident would be questioned.

Hathalin was well-known in the South Hebron Hills and regularly attended protests in the area. Following the incident, the tow truck and a police vehicle fled the scene without coming to Al-Hathalin’s assistance. According to the police, the Israelis at the scene did not offer assistance because of the threat that they faced from Palestinian stone-throwing. Hathalin was hospitalized in Hebron, on a respirator and under sedation, until his death on Monday. “His absence in the village will be great,” his brother Odeh said. “Everyone will miss him. He was a symbol who placed himself on the frontline facing off against the police and the army as part of the non-violent resistance.” The police said they are investigating the incident with input from the State Prosecutor’s Office. They added that the probe is also looking into stone-throwing by Palestinians at the Israelis at the scene in addition to the injuries that Hathalin sustained.

News article:
Palestinians have held a funeral procession for a 57-year-old man who died of tear gas inhalation during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp north of the city of al-Quds. The victim, identified as Fahmi Hamad, was one of the three Palestinians hospitalized after the Israeli forces stormed the Qalandiya camp on Monday. Local medical sources said the Israeli soldiers fired a barrage of gas bombs and rubber-coated steel bullets at Palestinians, who protested the raid, as well as a clinic run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The occupation forces, they added, also ransacked several Palestinian houses and shops. Hamad suffered from severe effects of tear gas inhalation while inside the UNRWA clinic and was rushed to a hospital in the occupied West Bank city Ramallah, but he succumbed to his wounds, according to the medical sources. One of Hamad’s relatives said the man had chronic health issues, such as kidney failure and diabetes, and constantly visited the clinic for medical treatment. Israeli forces frequently storm Palestinian neighborhoods in the occupied territories. They often use live fire and tear gas to crack down on any act of protest against their presence. The atrocities committed by the Tel Aviv regime have resulted in many Palestinian deaths and injuries. ‘West Bank situation nearing boiling point’ In a separate development on Monday, an Israeli research institute and think tank affiliated with Tel Aviv University presented its annual assessment to the regime’s president. The Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) warned that the absence of a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “poses a serious threat” to Tel Aviv’s status on the international stage. “The security situation in the West Bank is nearing a boiling point due to the weakness of the Palestinian Authority in the face of united opposition from various factions and street gangs,” it said. “Internationally, there is growing criticism of Israel, which in fact works to thwart the chances of implementing” the so-called two-state solution and “intensifies the danger of legal moves against Israel and its definition as an apartheid state.” The INSS also asserted that in the besieged Gaza Strip, “Israel currently faces the same complex and long-lasting dilemma: the need for an urgent response to the humanitarian situation, while avoiding security escalation.”

News article:
Palestinian Omar As’ad, 78, likely perished from a stress-induced heart attack caused by the circumstances of his detention by Israeli soldiers, according to an official Palestinian Authority autopsy whose results were released on Wednesday. Israel has come under American pressure to investigate the death of As’ad, who was also a United States citizen. The Palestinian retiree was found dead with a zip-tie around one of his hands and a blindfold over his eyes shortly after troops finished a routine patrol in the central West Bank village of Jiljilya earlier this month. A team of Palestinian doctors commissioned by Ramallah’s public prosecutor wrote that As’ad’s death was caused by “stress-induced cardiac arrest due to external injuries.” The autopsy listed several such injuries, including “bruises and abrasions” caused by the elderly As’ad having been bound and blindfolded. As’ad was detained by Israeli soldiers as he drove through his hometown at 3 a.m. on a frigid January night. According to the army, he “resisted a security check.” As’ad had previously undergone open-heart surgery and was in poor health, according to his family. Soldiers tied As’ad’s hands and blindfolded him, according to a Palestinian witness. An hour later, after Israeli troops had left the scene, he was found dead of a heart attack in a half-constructed building.

The military says he was released before he died. The army’s Military Police division has opened an investigation into the incident. According to a report leaked widely in Hebrew media, investigators believe that the nighttime cold may also have played a role in As’ad’s sudden passing. Palestinians and left-wing groups have long been critical of Israeli military investigations, which they say rarely bring results. According to a report by the B’Tselem rights group, just three percent of cases where the nonprofit suspected wrongdoing by Israeli troops resulted in an indictment between 2000 and 2015. Advertisement As’ad hailed from the quiet, well-heeled town of Jiljilya in the central West Bank north of Ramallah. In 1969, as newlyweds, he and his wife Nazmiya moved to the United States, where they spent over four decades raising their children and managing a number of grocery stores. In 2010, they returned to Jiljilya to live out their retirement together. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters earlier this month that Washington would ask for “clarification” from Israel over As’ad’s death. Several US representatives also issued condemnations and called for an investigation. “We support a thorough investigation into the circumstances of this incident,” Price said.

News article:
An elderly Palestinian-American who was found dead after being detained by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank suffered sudden cardiac arrest caused by the stress of being manhandled, according to a Palestinian autopsy released Wednesday, and reported by Reuters. A brother of Omar Abdalmajeed As'ad said the report – which also noted that the 78-year-old had a history of heart problems – showed Israel bore responsibility for his death, two weeks ago. Details of As'ad's pre-dawn detention on 12 January in his hometown of Jiljilya, and the post-mortem examination, "lead us to deduce that the death happened as a result of sudden cardiac arrest stemming from the stress of external violence", said the report, issued by the Palestinian Justice Ministry. The Israeli military said on Wednesday that it had no immediate comment on the findings. An Israeli military statement on 12 January said that its forces carried out an overnight operation in the village, and that a Palestinian was "apprehended after resisting a check". READ: Israel soldiers will not be prosecuted after death of elderly US-Palestinian The statement said he was alive when the soldiers released him, but that the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division was reviewing the incident. As'ad was found with a plastic zip-tie around one wrist. A former Milwaukee, Wisconsin resident, he had lived in the United States for decades and returned to the West Bank 10 years ago, his brother Amer told Reuters. "I received the autopsy report; I contacted the lawyer to pursue the case and I will contact the American consulate to follow up as well," he said. "Israel bears responsibility for his death." After As'ad's death, the US State Department said that he was a US citizen and that it had sought clarification on the case from Israel.

News article:
Israeli forces have injured dozens of Palestinians taking part in protests against Israeli settlements in several areas across the occupied West Bank. On Friday, Israeli forces suppressed a weekly anti-settlement rally in Kafr Qaddum, using rubber bullets and tear gas. Palestine's WAFA news agency cited Murad Shteiwi, a media spokesman in the Qalqilya region, as saying that four Palestinians, including a child and a journalist, were hit by rubber bullets during the attack. According to the report, tens of protesters also suffered breathing difficulties due to inhaling tear gas fired by the Israeli forces. Also on Friday, dozens of Palestinians suffered breathing difficulties as Israeli troops fired tear gas during clashes on Sobeih Mountain in the town of Beita, south of Nablus. Since May, Beita has seen intensified clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians protesting against a settlement outpost that has been established on Sobeih Mountain by settlers under the protection of Israeli forces. To the east of Nablus, several injuries were also reported as Israeli forces attacked Palestinians taking part in a peaceful anti-settlement protest in the village of Beit Dajan on Friday. Palestinian media outlets cited the Palestine Red Crescent ambulance service as saying that 15 Palestinians were hit by rubber bullets, including a volunteer with the Red Crescent, during the attack, adding that nine others suffered breathing difficulties due to the tear gas fired by Israeli troops. Meanwhile, clashes erupted in the area of Bab a-Zawiyah in the center of al-Khalil (Hebron) on Friday as the Israeli forces stationed at a military checkpoint at the entrance of al-Shuhada Street fired rubber bullets, sound bombs, and tear gas at Palestinians. The report added that tens of Palestinians suffered breathing difficulties due to the toxic fumes. Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — territories the Palestinians want for a future state — during the Six-Day Arab-Israeli War in 1967. It later had to withdraw from Gaza. More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank. All the settlements are illegal under international law. The United Nations Security Council has condemned the settlement activities in several resolutions.

News article:
A military investigation into the death of an 80-year-old Palestinian, who died after being detained by Israeli soldiers earlier this month, shows a grave "moral lapse" by the soldiers involved in the incident. Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi received Sunday the findings of the investigation into the death of Omar Abdalmajeed As’ad who was detained by soldiers belonging to the Netzah Yehuda battalion. The arrest and death of Omar Abdalmajeed As'ad 3 A.M. Omar Abdalmajeed As'ad is stopped by Israeli soldiers on his drive home, after spending time with friends. 3:05 A.M. The soldiers demand that As'ad step out of his vehicle, and argue with him for 15 minutes. 3:20 A.M. The soldiers walk As'ad to an abandoned yard, where they handcuff him, lay him on the ground, gag him and blindfold him. 3:35 A.M. Soldiers lead two more detainees to the yard. One of them notices As'ad is lying still on his stomach. 3:45 A.M. Two more detainees are brought to the yard. No one is handcuffed apart from As'ad. 4:00 A.M. The soldiers free one of As'ad's hands and leave the yard. 4:09 A.M. One of the detainees calls a doctor after noticing As'ad is unresponsive and his face had turned blue. 4:10 A.M. A doctor arrives at the yard from a nearby clinic and tries to resuscitate As'ad. 4:20 A.M. As'ad is brought to the clinic and medics continue to treat him with life sustaining measures. 4:40 A.M. The doctor pronounces As'ad's death. As’ad, who was also a U.S. citizen, was detained three weeks ago at a checkpoint north of Ramallah. He apparently died after being handcuffed, gagged and forced to lie on his stomach in the cold while in custody, allegedly without any attempt at medical intervention by the soldiers guarding him. After Kochavi was shown the report, IDF representatives forwarded the findings to the American military attaché in Israel. The United States had demanded clarifications from Israel regarding the incident and the circumstances of As’ad’s death. On Monday, two members of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation asked the Biden administration to also investigate the death of As'ad, who lived in Milwaukee before moving back to his home village in the West Bank. Israeli defense officials said they felt embarrassment in their conversation with the Americans because of the soldiers’ conduct and “lack of humanity” towards As’ad and the other Palestinians they had detained. The report, released late Monday night, stated that the investigation found that As’ad had been stopped while driving as part of an anti-terror operation to find weapons, and that he had refused to be checked. A fabric strap was tied around his mouth and his hands were cuffed, it stated. No other force was used on him and the soldiers did not see signs of distress, it said in its statement. After the operation, about half an hour later, the soldiers freed As’ad and the other detainees from their handcuffs. Based on his behavior, the soldiers believed he was asleep and did not try to wake him. “The investigation found the incident to be serious and unfortunate. It indicates a moral failure and a failure of judgment and severely harms human dignity,” the statement said. According to the report, Kochavi stated that the soldiers’ decision to leave As’ad without checking on him goes against the IDF’s moral obligations. IDF officials said the officers had created an “enabling atmosphere” for such incidents to occur and failed to enforce discipline. The commander of the Netzah Yehuda battalion will be rebuked, and two subordinate company and platoon commanders will be immediately dismissed, but the soldiers involved are not likely to be held directly responsible for As’ad’s death. The section of the report dealing with suspicions against the soldiers and commanders holds them responsible for “the circumstances behind the death of Omar Abdalmajeed As’ad.” Still, at this stage of the investigation army prosecutors believe, based on evidence gathered by the military police, that the conduct of the Netzah Yehuda soldiers contributed to As’ad’s death. The soldiers told military police investigators and the report's authors that after they had completed their mission, which lasted about an hour, they returned to the abandoned building where they had left As’ad handcuffed and with a cloth over his face, along with three other Palestinian detainees who were also handcuffed. The soldiers said they told all the detainees they were free to leave but that after the other three departed they found As’ad still lying on the ground. Though he was 80 years old and it was very cold, the soldiers thought nothing of the fact that he was lying motionless, deciding to leave him in the abandoned building. According to them, they assumed he was asleep and left without seeking medical aid. Open gallery view The funeral for Omar Abdalmajeed As'ad, in Jaljalia village, in the West Bank. Credit: Nasser Nasser/AP Three soldiers involved in the incident, and their platoon commander, are expected to be questioned on Tuesday by military police. To date, several soldiers and commanders have been questioned under warning, including the company commander. The Israeli army said that “according to partial findings from the autopsy report, submitted by the Palestinians, As'ad died from a heart attack.” Last week, three Palestinian doctors who conducted the autopsy determined that As'ad's heart attack was caused by stress, after he was subjected to “external violence,” according to reports. Senior officers who learned the details of the incident expressed shock at the soldiers' behavior. “They didn't see a human being in front of them,” the officers told Haaretz. “They delayed him during a routine activity, without sufficient cause. They lay him down and tied him up in the freezing cold, in almost zero degrees.” “When other Palestinians alerted the soldiers to his condition, the soldiers removed them and did not let them approach As'ad. And then the soldiers just left. This is not murder, but it's an appalling incident. And it's not just low-ranking soldiers. This was a platoon commander and a company commander.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

News article:
Jerusalem: Israel’s military said on Monday it was dismissing two officers and would reprimand a battalion commander over the death of an elderly Palestinian earlier this month that it said resulted from “a moral failure and poor decision-making.” Omar Abdalmajeed As’ad, 78, who was also a US national, was found dead after being detained by Israeli troops in Jiljilya village in the occupied West Bank on Jan. 12. A Palestinian autopsy found As’ad, who had pre-existing heart conditions, had suffered sudden cardiac arrest caused by the stress of being manhandled. The military at the time said As’ad was alive when the soldiers left him. In a summary of its investigation on Monday, the military said it found that As’ad had refused to cooperate with troops operating in the area and that “his hands were tied and he was gagged for a short time.” After being detained for half an hour, As’ad and three others were released. “The soldiers did not identify signs of distress or other suspicious signs concerning As’ads health. The soldiers assessed that As’ad was asleep and did not try to wake him,” according the military statement. “The investigation concluded that the incident was a grave and unfortunate event, resulting from a moral failure and poor decision-making on the part of the soldiers,” it said. A core value of the Israeli military — to protect human life — had been violated, it said. “It was further determined that there was no use of violence during the incident apart from when Assad was apprehended after refusing to cooperate,” it said. “The soldiers failed in their obligations by leaving Assad lying on the floor without the required treatment and without reporting the incident back to their commanders.” After the autopsy, a US embassy spokesman in Jerusalem said it was “deeply saddened” by As’ad’s death and it supported “a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the incident.” Palestinian leaders have called for the soldiers involved to be prosecuted in an international court. As’ad was a former Milwaukee, Wisconsin, resident who lived in the United States for decades and returned to the West Bank 10 years ago, his brother told Reuters.

News article:
The head of the military’s Central Command on Tuesday condemned soldiers for leaving an elderly Palestinian man on the ground at a construction site, where he subsequently died of heart failure, after they detained him in the middle of the night, but said they did so due to over-dedication to their mission rather than a desire to harm him. Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs described the incident as an “extremely grave ethical failure” and said the officers involved should have used greater discretion in deciding to detain the 78-year-old man, Omar As’ad, in the first place as well as to then leave him unconscious in a half-constructed building. IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi similarly denounced the soldiers’ actions on Tuesday in remarks made to officers preparing to become company and battalion commanders. “The way they left that man on the ground was grave and unethical. There’s no contradiction between focusing on the mission and preserving the IDF’s values. IDF soldiers and commanders have the tools to handle that complexity,” Kohavi said. “I expect every soldier and commander to conduct their mission with determination, to know how to fight, but also to respect human life and respect the IDF’s values,” he added. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms According to an Israel Defense Forces probe presented to IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi on Monday, a group of some 30 soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion, which operates solely in the West Bank and has long been plagued by allegations of brutality and abuse against Palestinians, set up an impromptu checkpoint in the central West Bank village of Jiljilya on January 12, stopping cars and checking the identification documents of people inside. The first to pass through the checkpoint was As’ad, who refused to identify himself when asked and yelled at the soldiers. According to the probe, they tackled him to the ground and bound his hands with zipties, then moved him to a nearby construction site, where he was left on the ground in the near-freezing January night. In order to prevent him from calling out and telling others about the checkpoint, the soldiers also gagged him, first with their hands and then by tying a strip of fabric over his mouth, the probe found. According to Fuchs, the gag was only left in place for a short amount of time. Three other Palestinians were brought to the same building. When the Netzah Yehuda soldiers decided to pack up the checkpoint roughly half an hour later, they untied the four Palestinians and let them go, according to the investigation. Advertisement By that time, As’ad was unresponsive. The soldiers left him in the building without “realizing the signs of distress or other suspicious signs regarding his health. In light of his behavior, the soldiers assumed he was sleeping and didn’t try to wake him,” the IDF said. As’ad, an American citizen who had lived in the US for many years, was found dead a few hours later with one ziptie still around one of his hands and a blindfold over his eyes. An autopsy conducted by the Palestinian Authority determined that he had died of a stress-induced heart attack, brought on by being bound and gagged. As’ad had previously undergone open-heart surgery and was in poor health, according to his family. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning, Fuchs said the decision to leave As’ad on the ground when the soldiers took down their checkpoint was mistaken. “You don’t leave a man lying on the ground. They should have woken him up and put him in his car,” Fuchs said. “The soldiers showed callousness and lack of compassion in terms of respect for human life.” The Central Command chief said their decision to leave him, unconscious on the ground in the middle of a near-freezing winter night, was not made out of malice, but because “they cared more about completing their mission” than about ensuring As’ad’s well-being. Fuchs also spoke out in support of the Netzah Yehuda Battalion, which has a long history of abuse and unnecessary violence toward Palestinians and Arab Israelis. Asked to respond to criticism of the unit from within the army, with some IDF officers describing the detachment as an independent militia, like the Phalangists in Lebanon or the so-called “hilltop youth,” young far-right extremist settlers who populate illegal outposts on West Bank hilltops, Fuchs said the unit has been instrumental in the military’s counter-terrorism efforts in the West Bank. Advertisement “Netzah Yehuda are not Phalangists,” he said. The battalion was initially formed as an ultra-Orthodox detachment, giving such soldiers the opportunity to serve in a unit with limited contact with female soldiers and with dedicated time for prayer and religious study, but it has expanded to be a more generally religious unit, though it still has some ultra-Orthodox members. The unit serves solely in the West Bank — unlike other combat units, which also serve on the country’s borders — and has a reputation of attracting far-right recruits. Fuchs acknowledged the unit’s issues but said that in recent years efforts have been made to address them. “Most of the events that the battalion had problems with recently were reported [to authorities] from within the battalion,” he noted. However, Fuchs said that while for now the Netzah Yehuda Battalion would continue to operate solely within the West Bank for the immediate future, the military was planning on moving the unit between different parts of the territory in order to prevent boredom, which has been found to increase the likelihood of abuse. Fuchs said that he did not oppose deploying the battalion to other areas besides the West Bank and that the military ought to consider doing so. In the wake of the probe, two junior officers were dismissed from their positions and barred from command roles for the next two years, and the commander of the Netzah Yehuda Battalion will be formally censured. Fuchs defended the decision to not take disciplinary action against the soldiers involved in As’ad’s death, saying the responsibility was ultimately the commanders’. Advertisement “This was an extremely grave ethical failure,” Fuchs said. “I don’t think anyone intended to do this. But it’s our responsibility as the military. We will learn from this event.” He also took issue with the initial decision to violently detain the man in the first place. “They could have done any number of things besides that. They could have just released him. They could have detained him but left him in his car. This was an entirely insensitive thought process,” Fuchs said, adding that he expects officers to use discretion in these types of events. However, he added that just because As’ad was nearly 80 years old did not mean he was immune to detention. There is, as well, an ongoing Military Police investigation into the incident, which may find individual soldiers culpable, he noted. Fuchs also defended the decision to set up an impromptu checkpoint inside the village, saying the practice, which many human rights activists decry as a method of intimidation and collective punishment, has allowed soldiers to arrest terrorist operatives, find weapons and otherwise prevent attacks. However, Fuchs said that the way in which the soldiers conducted the checkpoint was generally not in line with military standards, in terms of where it was set up and how it was run from a safety standpoint, which he said was a separate issue from As’ad’s death. Advertisement “We have a protocol for how to do a checkpoint. They didn’t do it that way. It doesn’t have anything to do with the elderly man’s death. But they planned it incorrectly in terms of professional standards,” Fuchs said. “These types of checkpoints are important, but we have a responsibility to do these things professionally and ethically,” he added. Fuchs denied any connection between the fact that As’ad was an American citizen — leading to inquiries and criticism from US officials — and the military’s decision to launch a probe into his death and punish the officers involved. “The investigation began before we knew he was an American citizen,” he said.

Asked to respond to criticism of the unit from within the army, with some IDF officers describing the detachment as an independent militia, like the Phalangists in Lebanon or the so-called “hilltop youth,” young far-right extremist settlers who populate illegal outposts on West Bank hilltops, Fuchs said the unit has been instrumental in the military’s counter-terrorism efforts in the West Bank. Advertisement “Netzah Yehuda are not Phalangists,” he said. The battalion was initially formed as an ultra-Orthodox detachment, giving such soldiers the opportunity to serve in a unit with limited contact with female soldiers and with dedicated time for prayer and religious study, but it has expanded to be a more generally religious unit, though it still has some ultra-Orthodox members. The unit serves solely in the West Bank — unlike other combat units, which also serve on the country’s borders — and has a reputation of attracting far-right recruits. Fuchs acknowledged the unit’s issues but said that in recent years efforts have been made to address them. “Most of the events that the battalion had problems with recently were reported [to authorities] from within the battalion,” he noted. However, Fuchs said that while for now the Netzah Yehuda Battalion would continue to operate solely within the West Bank for the immediate future, the military was planning on moving the unit between different parts of the territory in order to prevent boredom, which has been found to increase the likelihood of abuse. Fuchs said that he did not oppose deploying the battalion to other areas besides the West Bank and that the military ought to consider doing so. In the wake of the probe, two junior officers were dismissed from their positions and barred from command roles for the next two years, and the commander of the Netzah Yehuda Battalion will be formally censured. Fuchs defended the decision to not take disciplinary action against the soldiers involved in As’ad’s death, saying the responsibility was ultimately the commanders’. Advertisement “This was an extremely grave ethical failure,” Fuchs said. “I don’t think anyone intended to do this. But it’s our responsibility as the military. We will learn from this event.” He also took issue with the initial decision to violently detain the man in the first place. “They could have done any number of things besides that. They could have just released him. They could have detained him but left him in his car. This was an entirely insensitive thought process,” Fuchs said, adding that he expects officers to use discretion in these types of events. However, he added that just because As’ad was nearly 80 years old did not mean he was immune to detention. There is, as well, an ongoing Military Police investigation into the incident, which may find individual soldiers culpable, he noted. Fuchs also defended the decision to set up an impromptu checkpoint inside the village, saying the practice, which many human rights activists decry as a method of intimidation and collective punishment, has allowed soldiers to arrest terrorist operatives, find weapons and otherwise prevent attacks. However, Fuchs said that the way in which the soldiers conducted the checkpoint was generally not in line with military standards, in terms of where it was set up and how it was run from a safety standpoint, which he said was a separate issue from As’ad’s death. Advertisement “We have a protocol for how to do a checkpoint. They didn’t do it that way. It doesn’t have anything to do with the elderly man’s death. But they planned it incorrectly in terms of professional standards,” Fuchs said. “These types of checkpoints are important, but we have a responsibility to do these things professionally and ethically,” he added. Fuchs denied any connection between the fact that As’ad was an American citizen — leading to inquiries and criticism from US officials — and the military’s decision to launch a probe into his death and punish the officers involved. “The investigation began before we knew he was an American citizen,” he said.

The US said Tuesday that it expects Israel to fully probe the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man who suffered a lethal heart attack after being bound, gagged and abandoned at a construction site in the middle of winter by Israeli soldiers last month, calling for those responsible to be held fully accountable. The US statement was issued a day after the Israeli military published the findings of its internal investigation into the January 12 incident, which concluded that the soldiers “showed a clear lapse of moral judgment” and a failure to “protect the sanctity of any human life” in the death of Omar As’ad. “The United States expects a thorough criminal investigation and full accountability in this case, and we welcome receiving additional information on these efforts as soon as possible,” the statement said. “We continue to discuss this troubling incident with the Israeli government.” The State Department noted that disciplinary action was being taken by the Israeli army against the battalion commander and other officers responsible for the unit involved.

Once complete, the findings will be passed to the Military Advocate General, who will decide whether criminal charges should be filed. According to the initial IDF probe, As’ad was detained by soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion who set up an impromptu checkpoint in the central West Bank village of Jiljilya, stopping cars and checking the identification documents of people inside. The investigation found that As’ad — who refused to identify himself when asked and yelled at the soldiers — was tackled by the troops, who then bound his hands with zip ties. They then moved him to a nearby construction site, where he was left on the ground in the near-freezing January night. In order to prevent him from calling out and telling others about the checkpoint, the soldiers also gagged him, first with their hands and then by tying a strip of fabric over his mouth for a short amount of time, the probe found. Three other Palestinians were brought to the same building. When the Netzah Yehuda soldiers decided to pack up the checkpoint roughly half an hour later, they untied the four Palestinians and let them go, according to the investigation. Advertisement By that time, As’ad was unresponsive. The soldiers left him on the ground at the construction site. They later told military investigators they thought he was asleep. As’ad, an American citizen who had lived in the US for many years, was found dead a few hours later with one zip tie still around one of his hands and a blindfold over his eyes. An autopsy conducted by the Palestinian Authority and reviewed by the IDF determined that he had died of a stress-induced heart attack, brought on by being tackled to the ground, bound and gagged. As’ad had previously undergone open-heart surgery and was in poor health, according to his family. The US was quick to react to the incident shortly after it occurred, with State Department spokesman Ned Price telling reporters hours after As’ad’s death that US authorities had been in touch with his family to express condolences and offer consular assistance while also reaching out to Israel to demand clarification over what had happened. A group of Democratic lawmakers have also sounded off on As’ad’s death, demanding an investigation and expressing concern over Israeli military practices in the West Bank more broadly.

Defense Minister Benny Gantz expressed sorrow at the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian man who suffered heart failure after being bound, gagged and abandoned at a construction site in the middle of winter by Israeli soldiers last month, saying on Tuesday that the Israel Defense Forces would take action against any “deviations” from its values. Gantz was the latest Israeli defense official to condemn the incident, joining IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohai and head of the IDF Central Command Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs, who denounced the soldiers’ actions earlier on Tuesday, after the military’s initial probe of Omar As’ad’s death was completed. “Along with the full support that we give to the IDF to carry out its mission — we will act against any deviations from the norms of IDF values, as we saw in the death of Omar As’ad.

Advertisement The past year saw a major rise in violent attacks by Israeli extremists against Palestinians and, to a lesser extent, against Israeli left-wing activists and security forces. Gantz has called for the military and law enforcement to take a harsher stance against this violence. “The IDF, police and Shin Bet are expanding their efforts, and we will ensure that all of the necessary forces are prepared for the mission. This is a fight that is important for our security and no less important for our ethical character,” Gantz said. During the visit, Gantz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and the head of the police’s West Bank division, Uzi Levi, in order to receive an update on the ongoing joint effort to combat “nationalistic crime,” his office said.

As the military maintains a far larger physical presence in the West Bank than the police, Public Security Minister Omer Barlev has called for the IDF to directly intervene when Israelis attack Palestinians, detaining those involved until they can be handed over to the police. The IDF, however, generally tries to limit its confrontation with Israeli civilians, particularly with Israeli settlers, in a bid to maintain positive relationships with the Israelis living in West Bank settlements, which the military is charged with protecting.

News article:
Two members of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation asked the Biden administration Monday to investigate how a Palestinian-American who lived in Milwaukee before moving back to his home village died at a West Bank checkpoint. Omar As’ad, 78, died after Israeli troops stopped him at a checkpoint in his native village of Jiljilya during the early morning hours of Jan. 12, according to family members and media reports. As’ad’s nephew, Assad Assad, said others who were detained at the checkpoint told family members that the soldiers dragged As’ad out of his car, threw him to the ground and shackled his hands and feet with zip ties, then fled after he died on the spot. The request came the same day that the Israeli military completed an internal probe that ruled that two officers will be removed from their positions immediately and a third will be formally censured over the death. The IDF’s disciplinary probe found “an ethical failure by the soldiers and a mistake in their thought process, alongside a severe violation of the value of respecting people,” the military said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The punishments against the commanders are the result of an internal disciplinary probe. A Military Police investigation into the case is ongoing, which will determine if charges will be filed against the soldiers involved. As’ad was born in Jiljilya but spent about 40 years in the United States. He became a US citizen before he returned to his home village in 2009 to retire with his wife, Nazmia, his nephew told The Associated Press. US State Department officials have said they’re seeking clarification about the events leading up to As’ad’s death. Advertisement US Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Rep. Gwen Moore sent a letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking him to launch an investigation into Assad’s death and whether the soldiers involved used equipment procured with American aid. “We strongly support human rights and the rule of law as the foundation of United States foreign policy,” Baldwin and Moore wrote. “As a Palestinian American, Mr. As’ad deserves the full protections afforded US citizens living abroad and his family deserves answers.” State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday that he hadn’t seen the request from Baldwin and Moore and the agency hasn’t seen a final report from Israeli officials. “We continue to support an investigation that is thorough and comprehensive into the circumstances of the incident and we welcome receiving additional information as soon as possible,” Price said. Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six Day War in 1967. Assad Assad said his uncle and aunt left Jiljilya for Chicago in 1969 in hopes of finding jobs. They moved to Milwaukee in 1974 and prospered, opening convenience stores and a restaurant, he said. They were among dozens of Jiljilya residents who have returned to the village over the years to build retirement homes, Assad Assad said. Advertisement “They built mini-castles to retire in,” he said. “Very quiet, all you see is olive trees. At night, because we’re high in the mountains, you smell the orchards of oranges.” Omar As’ad’s nephew and his son, Hane As’ad, both described Omar as a philanthropist who was the life of the party. Hane As’ad told the AP his father would often hand out money to the poor. “He just loved everybody, no matter what race you were, what culture you came from,” he said. “He just saw you as a human being.” His favorite pastimes were eating — his favorite dish was maqluba, a mix of rice and meat — and playing cards, Assad Assad said. He was coming home from playing cards with a cousin when the soldiers stopped him, he said. Hane As’ad said his mother and father were set to visit him at his home in Chesapeake, Virginia, before his father died. The family is frustrated by a lack of clear answers from the Israeli military, although they don’t expect any. Assad said his father was too old and weak to fight anyone, let alone a group of soldiers. “He was very weak,” Hane Assad said. “He walked with a cane. It takes him five minutes to get to the car, the way he walks. He doesn’t have the power of 30 soldiers . . . The military said ‘we left and he was fine.’ It doesn’t make sense.” As’ad said he’s always afraid when he returns to Jiljilya because the Israelis who operate the checkpoints are rude and disrespectful. He said he was once detained for four hours on the way to his grandmother’s funeral. The troops laugh at his American citizenship, he said. “Every time we got stopped Dad would say ‘whatever they ask for give it to them. Just be calm.’ Plenty of times we got pulled over and I never saw him fight,” Hane Assad said. “I can’t believe they did that to my dad. Almost an 80-year-old man. All the soldiers there couldn’t handle him? This is uncalled for. You don’t treat no elderly person like that.”

News article:
The IDF on Friday announced the removal of the deputy head of the battalion involved in a friendly fire incident during which two Border Police officers were lightly wounded while thwarting a drug smuggling attempt along the Egyptian border last week. An internal investigation into the January 27 incident found that the deputy commander of the Caracal Brigade erred in a number of ways, including in failing to coordinate aspects of the drug smuggling operation with the various units involved and in violating open-fire weapon regulations, the IDF said in a statement, which did not include the identity of the commander removed from his post. The battalions involved were also ordered to study and simulate the incident to ensure that it doesn’t happen again. The head of the IDF’s Southern Command Eliezer Toledano, who handed down the disciplinary action, said in a statement that the drug smuggling that takes place on the Egyptian border poses a criminal problem with broader security ramifications and “is characterized by great complexity that requires complete coordination between all involved.” IDF chief of staff Aviv Kohavi accepted the decision taken by Toledano and characterized the incident as a “serious and unnecessary [one] that should have been avoided.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms According to an IDF spokesperson, there were at least nine smuggling attempts along the frontier overnight, making it “one of the most active nights on the Egyptian border in recent memory.” On a sometimes nightly basis, Egyptian smugglers attempt to pass contraband over the border — mostly marijuana from grow houses in the Sinai Peninsula, but sometimes harder drugs like heroin — to Israelis, who collect the packages and sell the drugs in Israel. The IDF and Israel Police seized some 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of drugs, worth an estimated NIS 8 million ($2.5 million), over the course of the night, one of the largest busts in at least the past year, the military said. No arrests were made, however. Advertisement On the night in question, smugglers on the Egyptian side of the border drove up to the security fence in armored vehicles, with machine guns on top, and opened fire “massively” into Israeli territory, the IDF spokesperson said. The machine-gun fire was not initially directed at Israeli troops but was instead meant to deter Israeli forces from approaching the area, she noted. A team from the Caracal Battalion, which guards the Egyptian border, responded to the attack and returned fire. A Border Police vehicle with the two officers inside was also nearby and approached the fence from the Israeli side. During the firefight, the Caracal soldiers — including the deputy battalion commander — apparently believed that the Border Police vehicle was a truck being used by the Israeli smugglers to collect the packages of drugs, and opened fire at the tires, the IDF spokesperson said. The two officers were lightly wounded by the gunfire and were taken to Beersheba’s Soroka Medical Center for treatment, the military said. The case of friendly fire came after a deadly incident weeks earlier, in which two officers from the elite Egoz unit were shot dead by a fellow officer in another case of mistaken identity. Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report.

News article:
Israel's public security minister has called for an investigation into the Israel Police's use of hard sponge-tipped bullets against Bedouin, five of whom suffered head injuries, during protests last month over the planting of JNF trees. Public Security Minister Omer Bar-Lev asked the Justice Ministry’s police misconduct unit to investigate the cases after learning about them from a report published by the Hebrew edition of Haaretz on Sunday. >> Five Israeli bullets, five Bedouin with serious head injuries Bar-Lev told Haaretz that he was shocked by the report and that the Justice Ministry has told him that the matter is being examined. Haaretz is only aware of a single complaint filed by a victim’s family – that of Abdullah Tarabin, a 16-year-old who lost an eye after being hit by a sponge-tipped bullet. His father told Haaretz that his son was an innocent bystander. Open gallery view 16-year-old Abdullah Tarabin who lost an eye when it was hit by a sponge-tipped bullet. Credit: Eliyahu Hershkovitz "Netanyahu bet everything on Trump": Inside Israel's Iran bind. LISTEN On Sunday, Joint List Knesset member Ahmad Tibi submitted a parliamentary question to Bar-Lev regarding injuries sustained by Bedouin during a demonstration on January 13, where Bedouin protested tree planting by the Jewish National Fund on land they used for farming. As reported by Haaretz, four demonstrators were injured in the upper portions of their bodies within a period of four minutes by sponge-tipped bullets. In 2000, after unrest in the Arab community resulted in the deaths of 13 Arab demonstrators and one Jewish Israeli, police use of rubber-coated bullets to disperse demonstrations was outlawed. Tibi asked why the hard sponge-tipped bullets that police are currently using shouldn’t also be outlawed. “Five head wounds in ten days, 36 in two and half years, is intentional policy, not a mistake,” Tibi told Haaretz, “the result of excessive violence, brutal repression and trigger-happiness that must be stopped, not encouraged and backed.” In June of last year, the police loosened restrictions on the use of hard sponge-tipped bullets, which replaced smaller and lighter sponge-tipped bullets that police had used in earlier years.

News article:
Israeli special forces kill three Palestinians and arrest another in the city of Nablus in the northern part of the occupied West Bank. The incident took place in the city’s al-Makhfeya neighborhood on Tuesday, the official Palestinian Wafa news agency reported. The agency cited its correspondent as saying that an Israeli special force detachment attacked the neighborhood with an unmarked civilian vehicle bearing a Palestinian number plate. The forces then started firing at another vehicle that was travelling nearby, killing three of its occupants and arresting the fourth. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade identified the victims as the West Bank-based resistance group’s members, naming them as Ibrahim al-Nablusi, Adham Mabrouk, and Muhammed al-Dakhil. According to the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz, the occupying regime has accused the targeted Palestinians of “several shooting attacks” over the past weeks. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority’s health ministry called the Israeli operation "an assassination." The PA’s foreign ministry also described it as a "field execution." Hamas urges mass funerals for martyrs Reacting to the development, Hamas, the resistance movement that is headquartered in the nearby Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip, urged all Palestinian groups to stage an “intense reprisal.” “The [Israeli] enemy’s atrocity entails setting fire to the places that host Zionist servicemen and settlers,” it said in a statement. The resistance group called for mass participation in the funeral of the three Palestinians. “Let it be a march that infuriates the enemy, and sends a message that we are the righteous ones, and that resistance is our path to restore the rights that have been taken from us,” it said. Jasem al-Barghouti, one of Hamas’ officials who is based in the West Bank, meanwhile, said the atrocity proved that resistance was the only option that could protect the Palestinian nation. He slammed the PA’s “security coordination” with the Israeli regime, saying the coordination only empowered the regime to conduct more such atrocities against the Palestinians. Israel’s Minister for Military Affairs, Benny Gantz praised the Israeli military and other participating organizations over the criminal operation, which he described as “preventive” and “proactive.” The Israeli regime occupied the West Bank in a heavily-Western-backed war in 1967. Ever since, it has been dotting the territory with hundreds of illegal settlements, besides imposing the strictest of restrictions on the Palestinians’ freedom there.

(Photo by Ayman Nobani/Xinhua) JERUSALEM/RAMALLAH, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel confirmed on Tuesday its forces killed three Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank during an alleged "operation to thwart a terror cell." The three men were "armed terrorists who were ... killed during clashes with the security forces," Israel's Border Police announced. Earlier in the day, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said in a statement that Israeli soldiers shot dead three Palestinian men in al-Makhfeya neighborhood in the city of Nablus. Israel's Shin Bet security service claimed in a separate statement that the three killed Palestinians were responsible for several recent shooting attacks against the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli civilians, adding that the Israeli forces suffered no casualties. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett tweeted that "those who harm us will be harmed." On the other side, Palestine called on the international community to investigate the Israeli killing, as its cabinet called on the United Nations, the human rights organizations and the international law organizations to "condemn the awful crime and act." According to a statement issued by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed wing of the Fatah movement led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the three men are members of the group and "heroic martyrs." Recent weeks have seen a sharp rise in violence of Jewish settlers against the Palestinians and Palestinian property in the West Bank, as well as Palestinian attacks against Israeli forces and settlers. ■ People carry the body of one of the three Palestinians killed by Israeli forces during a funeral in the West Bank city of Nablus, on Feb. 8, 2022.

Thousands of Palestinians have marched in the Israeli-occupied West Bank for the funeral of three Palestinians, who were assassinated earlier by the Israeli regime’s forces. The funeral took place in the northern city of Nablus on Tuesday, hours after an Israeli special forces’ detachment killed the victims and arrested a fourth there. The incident took place in the city’s al-Makhfeya neighborhood, the official Palestinian Wafa news agency reported. The agency cited its correspondent as saying that the Israeli unit attacked the neighborhood with an unmarked civilian vehicle bearing a Palestinian number plate. The forces then started firing at another vehicle that was travelling nearby, killing three of its occupants and arresting the fourth. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade identified the victims as the West Bank-based resistance group’s members, naming them as Ibrahim al-Nablusi, Adham Mabrouk, and Muhammed al-Dakhil. “With blood and spirit, we’ll redeem you, o martyr!” mourners chanted as they carried the bodies of the Palestinians through the streets. Videos that emerged from the funeral “recalled the bygone years of the Second Intifada (Uprising)," reports said. “Revenge! Revenge! Brigades! Qassam!” the Palestinians called out. According to the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz, the occupying regime has accused the targeted Palestinians of “several shooting attacks” over the past weeks.

News article:
Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian during clashes in the occupied West Bank late Sunday, hours after police fanned out in a tense east Jerusalem neighborhood trying to contain violence between ultranationalist Jewish activists and Palestinian residents. Early Monday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Akram Abu Salah, 17, died from a gunshot to his head. The clashes erupted after Israeli forces rolled into Silat al-Harithiya village near Jenin to destroy homes of two Palestinian detainees accused of opening fire at a car traveling near a West Bank settlement outpost and killing a settler in December. Earlier in Jerusalem, unrest took place in Sheikh Jarrah, a flashpoint neighborhood where clashes last year helped spark an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Dozens of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and other east Jerusalem neighborhoods are at risk of eviction by Jewish settler organizations, and tensions between the sides often escalate to violence. The latest unrest erupted after a settler's home was torched over the weekend. Itamar Ben-Gvir, an ultranationalist lawmaker, responded to the fire by setting up a makeshift office early Sunday near the home of a family facing possible eviction. Palestinians moved in on Ben-Gvir's tent, throwing plastic chairs in the afternoon and scuffling with his supporters. Late Sunday, riot police sprayed putrid-smelling water to break up Palestinian protests. One video on social media showed an Israeli policeman kicking a young Palestinian man. Police reported at least 12 arrests. The Palestinian Red Crescent medical service said 14 Palestinians were wounded, including four people shot with rubber bullets. Explosions from stun grenades used by police to disperse crowds could be heard during the evening. Ben-Gvir, a follower of a radical rabbi who called for the expulsion of Arabs from Israel, accused police of using "extreme brutality" against his followers. He said he would spend the night in the area "so they will learn." In addition to the threatened evictions, thousands of Palestinians live in homes in east Jerusalem that face the threat of demolition because of discriminatory policies that make it extremely difficult for Palestinians to build new homes or expand existing ones. Threatened evictions, tied up in decades-old battles between Palestinian residents and Jewish settlers, set off protests and clashes last May that helped ignite the Gaza war. Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. It later annexed east Jerusalem, home to the city's most sensitive holy sites, in a move that is not recognized by the international community. Israel considers the entire city to be its capital, while the Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The city's fate is one of the most divisive issues in the century-old conflict.

A Palestinian teen was killed late Sunday in a firefight between Israeli troops and gunmen during the demolition of the home of a terror suspect near Jenin in the West Bank, the Palestinians said. Mohammad Akram Ali Taher Abu Salah, 17, died after being shot in the head by live Israeli fire, according to the Palestinian Authority Health Ministry. In a statement, the Israeli military said that troops had come under fire and that “soldiers fired at several armed [Palestinians] who they identified at the scene.” According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, four Palestinians were wounded during the clashes. The army said troops had come under fire, in addition to having rocks and Molotov cocktails thrown at the soldiers at several positions inside the village during the Sunday night raid.

Israeli authorities have charged Jaradat, along with three other Palestinians, in the killing of Yehuda Dimentman, 25, in a deadly West Bank terror shooting in mid-December. Israel demolishes the homes of Palestinians accused of carrying out deadly terror attacks as a matter of policy. The efficacy of the policy is controversial even within the Israeli security services and human rights activists have denounced it as unfair collective punishment. Dimentman was killed as he left a yeshiva at the Homesh outpost where he studied. Homesh was evacuated in 2005 following the withdrawal from Gaza and some West Bank settlements. While Israeli law bans resettling at Homesh, the army has tolerated the presence of the yeshiva for over a decade and a half. The area has also been the site of repeated clashes between the outpost’s hard-right Jewish settlers and local Palestinians. Tensions have been rising across the West Bank over the past few months. December and January saw repeated “lone wolf” attacks, with Palestinians seeking to stab or run over Israelis. The army also reported several incidents in which bursts of gunfire struck military posts, without any casualties. Advertisement Last Tuesday, Israeli undercover police killed three Palestinians during a rare daytime raid in the West Bank city of Nablus. The Israeli troops fired dozens of rounds into the car before seizing two M-16 rifles from the vehicle and driving away from the scene. Israeli defense officials accused the three of being behind in the string of recent shooting attacks. They were later claimed as members by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, a loose coalition of armed groups affiliated with the ruling Fatah party.

News article:
A mother of a Palestinian cries next to his body (not pictured), who medics said was shot by Israeli forces during clashes, at a hospital near Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank February 15, 2022. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, the Palestinian health ministry said, during what the Israeli military described as a violent confrontation. The military said dozens of Palestinians hurled rocks at soldiers stationed at an army post near the village of Nabi Saleh. The soldiers "responded with riot dispersal means ... including live fire in order to stop a suspect", the military statement said, adding that the shooting was being examined. It was unclear whether the man who was killed had been throwing rocks. An eye witness, who declined to be named, told Reuters that a group of about 10 Palestinians, some of whom were throwing stones, had started marching toward the soldiers near the village entrance when the troops opened fire. The Palestinian Health Ministry identified the dead man as Nihad al-Barghouti, 20. He sustained two bullet wounds around his pelvis, the ministry said. Palestinians in Nabi Saleh, a village northwest of Ramallah, have for years protested against land seizures by Israel, leading to confrontations with the Israeli military and Jewish settlers. Most countries consider Israeli settlements in occupied territory to be illegal. Israel disputes this, citing historical, biblical and political ties to the land. Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. The Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital - all territories Israel captured in a war in 1967.

A Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli soldiers near Nabi Saleh, a small town northwest of Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority Health Ministry said on Tuesday. The man was identified as Nihad Amin al-Barghouti, a resident of nearby Kufr Ein in his 20s. Al-Barghouti previously served a term in Israeli jail for security offenses, according to Palestinian media. The Israeli military said in a statement that troops had fired on “dozens of Palestinians” who approached a reinforced army post next to Nabi Saleh and threw stones at soldiers. The soldiers “responded with riot dispersal means and suspect arrest procedure, which included live fire,” the Israeli army said in a statement. “A report has been received about the death of a Palestinian. The matter is being examined,” the army concluded.

The small group approached the tower. The soldiers descended from the tower and then they started firing — just one shot,” said the witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal.

But they why it was necessary for the soldiers to descend from the tower in the first place. “If they’d stayed in the tower, it was reinforced, they would have been in no danger. This proves that the intention was to kill. These were young kids — [al-Barghouti] was the oldest of them,” the witness said. Al-Barghouti’s death comes as tensions between Israel and the Palestinians have risen across the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Clashes have erupted for the past several nights in the flashpoint East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. Dozens of Palestinians and right-wing Israelis have faced off, with police arresting some and firing sound grenades and high-pressure water to disperse the gatherings. Advertisement Sheikh Jarrah has become one of Jerusalem’s tensest neighborhoods. Far-right Jewish nationalists have sought to evict Palestinian residents in legal battles that helped touch off violence between Israel and the Hamas terror group last May. Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah have recently been protesting the pending eviction of the Salem family. The eleven Palestinians are set to be evicted by Jerusalem city councilmember Yonatan Yosef as early as March. Far-right Israeli politician Itamar Ben Gvir has set up a temporary “office” in the neighborhood, further stoking tensions. Ben Gvir said he was protesting the insecurity felt by Jewish Israelis living in Sheikh Jarrah, following the firebombing of a home where a Jewish family lived. Two suspects were arrested earlier this week in connection with the Friday attack. On Tuesday, Israeli troops raided Al-Quds University in Abu Dis to break up a protest against the Sheikh Jarrah evictions.

News article:
The photograph is exceptional. There are not many like it. An elderly Palestinian shepherd is sitting on the ground at the entrance to his house, his head and face bleeding, his clothing also stained with his blood, an expression of panic and helplessness on his face. Up to this point there’s nothing exceptional here. Lately almost every day Palestinian farmers are barbarically attacked by settlers – routine behavior. But look who’s sitting next to the shepherd: a female soldier in a steel helmet and blue rubber gloves. She’s bandaging his wounds. This picture was taken last week in the shepherds’ community in Mount Qanub, on the edge of the Judean Desert. This week the shepherd from the photo, Mohammed Shalalda, 72, told me that the nurse from the army even hugged him. “What aren’t all the soldiers like that?” asked the man, hospitalized for five days after the pogrom and still suffering from his wounds. The settlers beat him with stones, axes and clubs, after dozens of them invaded his community to attack him and his family. This area is swarming with settlers and outposts, most of them wild and violent: Ma’aleh Amos, Avi Hanahal, Metzad, aka Asfar, and Pnei Kedem – names that you’ve never heard, and that’s a good thing. These are accursed places. This wasn’t their first attack against shepherds here, but it was the most serious one. Shalalda was convinced they would kill him. At the sight of the soldier who was taking care of him, not only was he filled with gladness, so is everyone who looks at this photo. There’s something touching about it, almost to the point of tears. A soldier taking care of a wounded Palestinian man. When Shalalda showed me the photo this week in the home of his son in the village of Sa’ir, where he is recovering from his wounds, I felt the same longing for a moment of compassion, along with a bit of Israeli pride: How moral our army is. An army medic administers first aid to a Palestinian, and what more can we ask. Why aren’t there more such occasions and such soldiers, like the soldier from Mount Qanub. In a reality in which Israeli President Isaac Herzog was attacked this week with shouts of “You should be ashamed of yourself” from young people at a conference in memory of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, a major spiritual leader of the national religious camp, for daring to mention the fate of another elderly Palestinian, 78-year-old Omar As’ad, who was left to die by the roadside by soldiers of the Netzah Yehuda battalion, even just one young soldier with gloves gladdens the heart. But this desperate longing for a bit of compassion and pride quickly crashed in the face of reality. That’s also a good thing. We should not have been captivated by the photograph. With all due respect to the soldier, who did simply what was called for, the victim was the handiwork of all of us, including the medic and the army in which she serves, and no military bandage will heal his wounds. All Israelis without exception participated in this Ku Klux Klan pogrom in Mount Qanub. The rioters of Asfar and its satellites came in the name of all of us to beat the old man because he’s a Palestinian. They came just as people came for the Jews in Europe – violent, hate-filled and racist. The fact that nobody stops them is enough to prove that they are here on our behalf, doing their deeds as our emissaries. The Israel Defense Forces spokesman is likely to use this photo, as he uses the Israeli field hospitals on the Gazan border while the Israel Air Force is bombing Gaza’s children. The enlightened Israeli will look at the photo and tell himself: Wild animals, those settlers, they abused an old man, but look how the soldier is taking care of him. The soldier is us, the beautiful Land of Israel that was taken from us. But that’s an illusion. The soldier is not Israel. She’s an anomaly. Seizing on her is a way to cleanse our conscience. The settlers are living to the east of Bethlehem as the emissaries of every Israeli who supported their existence there with silence, indifference and government budgets.

News article:
The photograph is exceptional. There are not many like it. An elderly Palestinian shepherd is sitting on the ground at the entrance to his house, his head and face bleeding, his clothing also stained with his blood, an expression of panic and helplessness on his face. Up to this point there’s nothing exceptional here. Lately almost every day Palestinian farmers are barbarically attacked by settlers – routine behavior. But look who’s sitting next to the shepherd: a female soldier in a steel helmet and blue rubber gloves. She’s bandaging his wounds. This picture was taken last week in the shepherds’ community in Mount Qanub, on the edge of the Judean Desert. This week the shepherd from the photo, Mohammed Shalalda, 72, told me that the nurse from the army even hugged him. “What aren’t all the soldiers like that?” asked the man, hospitalized for five days after the pogrom and still suffering from his wounds. The settlers beat him with stones, axes and clubs, after dozens of them invaded his community to attack him and his family. This area is swarming with settlers and outposts, most of them wild and violent: Ma’aleh Amos, Avi Hanahal, Metzad, aka Asfar, and Pnei Kedem – names that you’ve never heard, and that’s a good thing. These are accursed places. This wasn’t their first attack against shepherds here, but it was the most serious one. Shalalda was convinced they would kill him. At the sight of the soldier who was taking care of him, not only was he filled with gladness, so is everyone who looks at this photo. There’s something touching about it, almost to the point of tears. A soldier taking care of a wounded Palestinian man. When Shalalda showed me the photo this week in the home of his son in the village of Sa’ir, where he is recovering from his wounds, I felt the same longing for a moment of compassion, along with a bit of Israeli pride: How moral our army is. An army medic administers first aid to a Palestinian, and what more can we ask. Why aren’t there more such occasions and such soldiers, like the soldier from Mount Qanub. In a reality in which Israeli President Isaac Herzog was attacked this week with shouts of “You should be ashamed of yourself” from young people at a conference in memory of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, a major spiritual leader of the national religious camp, for daring to mention the fate of another elderly Palestinian, 78-year-old Omar As’ad, who was left to die by the roadside by soldiers of the Netzah Yehuda battalion, even just one young soldier with gloves gladdens the heart. But this desperate longing for a bit of compassion and pride quickly crashed in the face of reality. That’s also a good thing. We should not have been captivated by the photograph. With all due respect to the soldier, who did simply what was called for, the victim was the handiwork of all of us, including the medic and the army in which she serves, and no military bandage will heal his wounds. All Israelis without exception participated in this Ku Klux Klan pogrom in Mount Qanub. The rioters of Asfar and its satellites came in the name of all of us to beat the old man because he’s a Palestinian. They came just as people came for the Jews in Europe – violent, hate-filled and racist. The fact that nobody stops them is enough to prove that they are here on our behalf, doing their deeds as our emissaries. The Israel Defense Forces spokesman is likely to use this photo, as he uses the Israeli field hospitals on the Gazan border while the Israel Air Force is bombing Gaza’s children. The enlightened Israeli will look at the photo and tell himself: Wild animals, those settlers, they abused an old man, but look how the soldier is taking care of him. The soldier is us, the beautiful Land of Israel that was taken from us. But that’s an illusion. The soldier is not Israel. She’s an anomaly. Seizing on her is a way to cleanse our conscience. The settlers are living to the east of Bethlehem as the emissaries of every Israeli who supported their existence there with silence, indifference and government budgets. The blood of the shepherd Shalalda is on all our heads, those of Israelis both wild and enlightened. The image of this outstanding soldier is misleading. How tempting it is to be swept up by it, how painful it is to regain our senses.

News article:
A 12-year-old Palestinian was seriously injured after being shot in the head by Israeli soldiers during a violent protest against an illegal outpost in the northern West Bank on Friday afternoon, a Fatah activist at the demonstration told The Times of Israel. Rayan Yousef Hamayel, 12, was about 100 meters from the soldiers when he was shot, said Hisham Dweikat, a local Fatah activist who attended the protest between the Palestinian village of Beita and the illegal Israeli outpost of Evyatar. The Israeli army said in a statement that hundreds of Palestinians partook in the violent protest, hurling stones at soldiers and burning tires. Troops responded using riot dispersal measures, the military said, not commenting on the injured 12-year-old. No soldiers were injured during the protest. Rayan was struck in the back of his head by a rubber-coated steel bullet, fracturing his skull, according to his father Yousef. “There was so much blood,” Yousef told The Times of Israel.

He is a child,” said Yousef. Yousef dismissed the idea that Rayan would have been better served had he stayed home, rather than joining the clashes. “In villages where there aren’t clashes, the settlers still enter and attack us. No one’s safe, wherever they are,” he said. Twenty-two other Palestinians were injured during Israel’s dispersal of the rioters. The majority of the injured suffered from tear gas inhalation and did not require hospitalization, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Dozens of Palestinian protesters were filmed throwing stones at an IDF bulldozer, which was setting up a barrier preventing villagers from Beita from approaching Evyatar.

Nine Palestinians, mostly youth, have been killed in the violent protests, which Israeli troops suppress using riot dispersal measures, including rubber-tipped bullets. In June, the Israeli government reached an agreement with the dozens of settler families squatting, which saw them vacate the northern West Bank hilltop in exchange for the army agreeing to leave illegally erected mobile homes intact and a permanent military presence installed to secure the area. The government also agreed to conduct a survey of the land and install a full-time religious seminary followed by a full-fledged settlement there if it was found to not belong to private Palestinian landowners. The survey determined that small parts of the land, historically farmed by Beita residents, could be designated as belonging to the state, and now it is up to Defense Minister Benny Gantz to fulfill his promise to the settlers. In one of his last moves as attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit controversially signed off on a plan to legalize the outpost, but Gantz still faces opposition from left-wing members of the coalition, who warn that such a move would significantly damage Israel’s international standing. The Biden administration has also raised its concern over the matter privately, an Israeli official told The Times of Israel. “We believe it is critical for Israel and the Palestinian Authority to refrain from unilateral steps that exacerbate tensions and undercut efforts to advance a negotiated two-state solution. This certainly includes settlement activity,” a State Department official said in response to a query on the matter. Palestinians weren’t the only ones protesting against Evyatar on Friday. Hundreds of Israeli left-wing activists, including several lawmakers, marched toward the outpost around the same time, demanding the government scrap the planned compromise deal with settlers to legalize the wildcat community. Advertisement Police stopped marchers from ascending a hill to Evyatar, which has been declared a closed military zone, though some still attempted to reach the outpost. A right-wing activist was briefly detained by officers for attempting to snatch a banner from a protester, according to police. Meretz MK Mossi Raz said the protester was “assaulted” by officers. Friday’s protest near Evyatar was one of several Palestinian demonstrations that took place throughout the West Bank and East Jerusalem as Israeli security forces were on high alert at the tail end of a week of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the flashpoint Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Police bolstered Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem’s Old City and the Damascus Gate area with additional officers and Border Police troops after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held a Thursday assessment on the tensions, the Kan public broadcaster reported. Hundreds of Palestinians held Friday prayers in Sheikh Jarrah in what has become a common form of protest in the neighborhood over the past year. Demonstrators clashed with police several times throughout the afternoon and footage showed officers sometimes violently shoving protesters, but there were no reports of arrests or injuries. A police statement said a “riot” broke out during the protest, with some of the demonstrators blocking roads and refusing to obey officers’ orders. Police also said “calls of incitement” were heard and acknowledged officers “shoved the rioters at the scene.” שוטר א' מפיל את האישה על הכביש. בא שוטר ב' שבאדיבות עוזר לה לקום… רק כדי לדחוף אותה שוב ולהפיל אותה על הארץ. pic.twitter.com/M1AOsnj9jM Advertisement — ™גונטז׳ (@gontarzn) February 18, 2022 “Unfortunately some of the rioting was led by and at the instruction of elected representatives who arrived at the scene,” the police statement added in an apparent reference to Joint List MK Ofer Cassif, which images showed him sitting in the street with other protesters. Police have had an increased presence in the flashpoint neighborhood since the beginning of the week after clashes were touched off by the alleged weekend firebombing of a home where a Jewish family lives. Sheikh Jarrah, a majority Palestinian neighborhood also home to a number of Israeli Jewish families, is regularly a focus of protests due to a push by some right-wing Israelis to evict Palestinian families from homes they say were owned by Jews before 1948. Israeli officials fear the clashes in Sheikh Jarrah may once again snowball into open war in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In May, the pending evictions of several Palestinian families from the neighborhood helped fuel clashes in Jerusalem that kicked off an 11-day conflict between Israel and the Gaza-ruling Hamas terror group, as well as deadly bouts of street violence between Arabs and Jews inside Israel. Hamas on Sunday warned of a “severe” response following clashes in Sheikh Jarrah, though tensions there have largely calmed since Tuesday. The Biden administration is particularly concerned about tensions in Jerusalem bubbling over in April, which will see a confluence of the Jewish holiday of Passover, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Christian holiday of Easter. Washington has been urging Israel in recent weeks to take preemptive steps to lower tensions, US and Israeli officials told The Times of Israel earlier this week.

The Biden administration has also raised its concern over the matter privately, an Israeli official told The Times of Israel. “We believe it is critical for Israel and the Palestinian Authority to refrain from unilateral steps that exacerbate tensions and undercut efforts to advance a negotiated two-state solution. This certainly includes settlement activity,” a State Department official said in response to a query on the matter. Palestinians weren’t the only ones protesting against Evyatar on Friday. Hundreds of Israeli left-wing activists, including several lawmakers, marched toward the outpost around the same time, demanding the government scrap the planned compromise deal with settlers to legalize the wildcat community. Advertisement Police stopped marchers from ascending a hill to Evyatar, which has been declared a closed military zone, though some still attempted to reach the outpost. A right-wing activist was briefly detained by officers for attempting to snatch a banner from a protester, according to police. Meretz MK Mossi Raz said the protester was “assaulted” by officers. Friday’s protest near Evyatar was one of several Palestinian demonstrations that took place throughout the West Bank and East Jerusalem as Israeli security forces were on high alert at the tail end of a week of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the flashpoint Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Police bolstered Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem’s Old City and the Damascus Gate area with additional officers and Border Police troops after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held a Thursday assessment on the tensions, the Kan public broadcaster reported. Hundreds of Palestinians held Friday prayers in Sheikh Jarrah in what has become a common form of protest in the neighborhood over the past year. Demonstrators clashed with police several times throughout the afternoon and footage showed officers sometimes violently shoving protesters, but there were no reports of arrests or injuries. A police statement said a “riot” broke out during the protest, with some of the demonstrators blocking roads and refusing to obey officers’ orders. Police also said “calls of incitement” were heard and acknowledged officers “shoved the rioters at the scene.” שוטר א' מפיל את האישה על הכביש. בא שוטר ב' שבאדיבות עוזר לה לקום… רק כדי לדחוף אותה שוב ולהפיל אותה על הארץ. pic.twitter.com/M1AOsnj9jM Advertisement — ™גונטז׳ (@gontarzn) February 18, 2022 “Unfortunately some of the rioting was led by and at the instruction of elected representatives who arrived at the scene,” the police statement added in an apparent reference to Joint List MK Ofer Cassif, which images showed him sitting in the street with other protesters. Police have had an increased presence in the flashpoint neighborhood since the beginning of the week after clashes were touched off by the alleged weekend firebombing of a home where a Jewish family lives. Sheikh Jarrah, a majority Palestinian neighborhood also home to a number of Israeli Jewish families, is regularly a focus of protests due to a push by some right-wing Israelis to evict Palestinian families from homes they say were owned by Jews before 1948. Israeli officials fear the clashes in Sheikh Jarrah may once again snowball into open war in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In May, the pending evictions of several Palestinian families from the neighborhood helped fuel clashes in Jerusalem that kicked off an 11-day conflict between Israel and the Gaza-ruling Hamas terror group, as well as deadly bouts of street violence between Arabs and Jews inside Israel. Hamas on Sunday warned of a “severe” response following clashes in Sheikh Jarrah, though tensions there have largely calmed since Tuesday. The Biden administration is particularly concerned about tensions in Jerusalem bubbling over in April, which will see a confluence of the Jewish holiday of Passover, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Christian holiday of Easter. Washington has been urging Israel in recent weeks to take preemptive steps to lower tensions, US and Israeli officials told The Times of Israel earlier this week.

News article:
A Palestinian teen was shot dead by Israeli troops Tuesday night while allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at passing cars near the West Bank city of Bethlehem. Palestinian Authority health officials identified the deceased as Muhammad Shahada, 14, a resident of al-Khader, near Bethlehem. Israeli soldiers provided him with first aid on the scene, but he died of his injuries shortly thereafter, the Israeli army said. Israeli soldiers ambushed “three Palestinian suspects” throwing firebombs at a spot near al-Khader, the army said Israelis traveling along the area’s main traffic artery, Route 60, have repeatedly been attacked with Molotov cocktails at the juncture in recent weeks. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Israel Defense Forces said the three suspects, including Shahada, were responsible for a string of local firebomb attacks. ”The troops fired at one of the suspects while he threw a Molotov cocktail, and hit him,” the IDF said in a statement. Former Khader town mayor Adnan Sbeih said he heard the shooting and rushed out of his home, which lies on the outskirts of the town near the scene of the ambush. Advertisement The Israeli security barrier separates al-Khader from Route 60 and Sbeih and others noted that Shahada was shot on the al-Khader side of the wall, disputing whether he actually posed a risk to motorists. “The child was maybe 100 meters from the wall. But the army seemed to have fired from much closer. It seemed like the army had prepared an ambush on this side of the wall,” Sbeih said in a phone call. Ahmad Salah, Muhammad’s cousin, told The Times of Israel that he believed Shahada was nowhere near close enough to the wall to threaten Israelis — “even if we assume that he was throwing Molotov cocktails.” He pointed to a video from the scene which showed soldiers giving first aid in what appeared to be a courtyard between homes. “You can see in the videos that he’s still within the houses [of the village]. People filmed from their homes through the windows — that’s not next to the wall,” claimed Salah. ???? الاحتلال يطلق النار صوب شاب في بلدة الخضر ببت لحم ويصيبه بشكل مباشر قبل اعتقاله pic.twitter.com/35Fg8rGklK Advertisement — وكالة شهاب للأنباء (@ShehabAgency) February 22, 2022 The West Bank has seen a rise in violent confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in recent weeks. Two Palestinians were shot last week during confrontations with Israeli forces. Nihad al-Barghouti, 19, was shot and killed near Nebi Saleh last Tuesday after allegedly throwing firebombs at a military post, although Palestinian witnesses dispute the matter. The second Palestinian, 17-year-old Mohammad Abu Salah, was killed during a firefight between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in the town of Silat al-Harithiya, near Jenin. The troops had arrived after dark to demolish part of a home belonging to a Palestinian charged in a terror attack in which yeshiva student Yehuda Dimentman was killed near the Homesh outpost in December. Israeli undercover police killed three Palestinians during a rare daytime raid in the West Bank city of Nablus earlier this month. The Israeli troops fired dozens of rounds into the car before seizing two M-16 rifles from the vehicle and driving away from the scene. Israeli defense officials said the three were behind a string of recent shooting attacks on military posts. They were later claimed as members by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, a loose coalition of armed groups affiliated with the ruling Fatah party.

An Israeli citizen was shot dead as a convoy he was traveling in outside Kyiv came under fire, apparently by Ukrainian troops who mistook him for a Chechen militant. The man’s family identified him as Roman Brodsky, a father of two and DJ who had been living in Ukraine with his family. He was the first Israeli citizen reported killed in the Russian onslaught against Ukraine, which Moscow launched last Thursday. The Foreign Ministry said Brodsky was part of a convoy of vehicles traveling to the Moldovan border to leave the country. He and his partner were intending to then fly to Israel. According to Brodsky’s father, his son was shot dead at a checkpoint. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “[The Ukrainian soldiers] thought he was Chechen or something and killed him,” his father told the Kan broadcaster. Despite Ukrainian soldiers shooting Brodsky, his family told the Channel 12 news outlet that they blame the “dictator” Vladimir Putin for his death. His father told the station that they want help bringing him for burial in Israel, and asked that Israel do more to ensure that people who are still alive can make it safely to the Jewish state. Brodsky came to Israel at age 13 with his family. He lived in the country for 27 years and had two small children. He returned to Ukraine about 2 years ago to start a business in Kyiv. Advertisement The Zaka rescue service gave his age as 37, though some Israeli news outlets identified him as 41 or 42 years old. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett sent condolences to the family on Monday evening. “In the name of all Israeli citizens, I want to send my condolences to Roman’s wife, children and family in Israel and in Ukraine. We are doing everything to help Israelis return home,” Bennett said. The Foreign Ministry said it had informed the man’s wife and child who were still in Ukraine, as well as his parents in Israel. His mother collapsed upon hearing the news and was taken to Ashkelon’s Barzilai Medical Center for care. Brodsky’s father and stepmother live in the southern city of Arad, while his mother lives in Ashkelon. They were informed of their son’s death by Magen David Adom. According to the Ukrainian interior ministry, as of Monday, 352 civilians have been killed, 14 of them children, in the Russian offensive, and 1,684 people have been injured, 116 of them minors. Israel’s Foreign Ministry estimated that several thousand Israeli citizens were still in Ukraine, though many had started making their way to the country’s borders, where Israeli embassy employees were working to get them on flights back to Israel.

Two Palestinians were killed in a firefight with Israeli troops near the West Bank city of Jenin early Tuesday morning. The Israel Police said undercover Border Police officers came under fire while arresting a terror suspect in the Jenin refugee camp. The suspect, Emad Abu al-Heija, is the son of imprisoned senior Hamas official Jamal Abu al-Heija. Palestinian media identified the two fatalities as 19-year-old Shadi Najm, and 22-year-old Abdullah al-Housri. The Islamic Jihad terror group immediately claimed al-Housri as a member. Masked gunmen affiliated with Islamic Jihad’s armed wing in Jenin published a menacing video after al-Housri’s death, vowing revenge. “Let the criminal enemy know that his soldiers and checkpoints and military will know no safety,” one of the gunmen said, reading out a prepared statement.

Later, as the officers left the refugee camp, dozens of Palestinians hurled stones, Molotov cocktails, and a makeshift grenade at the officers, who responded with “riot dispersal means and live fire,” police said. Images showed al-Housri’s body wrapped in the flag of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, as well as the terror group’s logo on his firearm.

A Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank on Tuesday afternoon, the Palestinian Authority Health Ministry and the Israeli military said. Palestinian health officials identified the man as Ammar Shafiq Abu Afifa from the al-Aroub refugee camp near Hebron. They said he was shot on the outskirts of Beit Fajjar, near Bethlehem. Officials said that they had received the report from the PA branch that handles ties with Israel, meaning that Abu Afifa’s body was likely in Israeli custody. Nearly four hours after the incident occurred, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that soldiers operating security cameras identified two “suspects” approaching a lookout point near the settlement of Migdal Oz. Troops dispatched to the scene chased the two men, and opened fire toward them according to open-fire procedures, the military said.

The US State Department on Sunday denied brokering an agreement for Israel to indirectly supply natural gas to Lebanon. “Media reports that the United States has brokered an energy deal between Israel and Lebanon are false,” the department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs wrote on its Twitter account.

According to the unsourced report Saturday, the agreement was signed in secret over the weekend, and will see Israel transfer gas from the offshore Leviathan field to Jordan, From there it will be transferred to Syria and on to Lebanon, though the network said the move will require repairing and extending a gas line that flows between those countries, which could take several years. The report said the agreement was approved by the United States and was also coordinated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

It has been described by the World Bank as one of the most severe crises the world has witnessed since the 1850s. Advertisement Severe shortages in fuel have resulted in crippling power cuts and hours-long waits at gas stations. The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group, Hassan Nasrallah, announced in August that Iran was sending fuel to Lebanon to help ease the crisis. The first Hezbollah-commissioned Iranian oil tanker arrived in the Syrian port of Baniyas in September and the diesel was unloaded to Syrian storage places before it was brought overland to Lebanon by tanker trucks, where it was welcomed with celebratory gunfire. The Iran-backed Hezbollah, often accused of operating a state-within-a-state, has been taking part in Syria’s civil war alongside government forces. It manages its own crossing points along the Lebanon-Syria border, away from formal border crossings. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has said the shipments violate Lebanon’s sovereignty and are not approved by his government. Israel has said it will not interfere with the shipments. Under another initiative to bring some power to the country, energy ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon in September agreed to a plan to bring Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity to Lebanon via Syria.

The Iran-backed Hezbollah, often accused of operating a state-within-a-state, has been taking part in Syria’s civil war alongside government forces. It manages its own crossing points along the Lebanon-Syria border, away from formal border crossings. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has said the shipments violate Lebanon’s sovereignty and are not approved by his government. Israel has said it will not interfere with the shipments. Under another initiative to bring some power to the country, energy ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon in September agreed to a plan to bring Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity to Lebanon via Syria.

News article:
The US State Department on Sunday denied brokering an agreement for Israel to indirectly supply natural gas to Lebanon. “Media reports that the United States has brokered an energy deal between Israel and Lebanon are false,” the department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs wrote on its Twitter account. The tweet did not address the veracity of the reported agreement, which Channel 12 news said was brokered by Amos Hochstein, Washington’s special envoy and coordinator for international energy. According to the unsourced report Saturday, the agreement was signed in secret over the weekend, and will see Israel transfer gas from the offshore Leviathan field to Jordan, From there it will be transferred to Syria and on to Lebanon, though the network said the move will require repairing and extending a gas line that flows between those countries, which could take several years. The report said the agreement was approved by the United States and was also coordinated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The country of six million is experiencing its worst-ever financial crisis, with a currency that has lost around 90 percent of its value, people’s savings trapped in banks, and qualified labor emigrating in droves. It has been described by the World Bank as one of the most severe crises the world has witnessed since the 1850s.

The natural gas from Egypt will be used to generate electrical power to the Lebanese who are currently living with only few hours of state electricity a day and are obliged to pay increasing hefty bills to private generator operators, which also depend on diesel fuel. Internet services were disrupted in Lebanon on Sunday because of diesel shortages which pushed head of state-run telecom provider OGERO, Imad Kreidieh, to threaten of resigning. “If I cannot provide internet, it will be better to leave my post,” he said.

News article:
Time to end Hezbollah’s hold over Lebanon Osama Al-Sharif Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, President Michel Aoun and PM Saad Al-Hariri attend a graduation ceremony for officer cadets, Fayadyeh, 2017. (Reuters) Short Url https://arab.news/nx6sb For decades, the sectarian power-sharing understanding between Lebanon’s warlords, who became the faces of its ruling political elite, was a marriage of convenience that allowed each to claim a slice of the country’s lucrative economic cake. That understanding, the Taif Agreement, provided a period of economic recovery after years of civil war. Thus, while the political elite enjoyed the economic windfall, leaving enough for their respective sects to survive and endure, the system itself, imperfect as it is, kept going on thanks to its sheer momentum. That is until one party to the deal decided to change the rules and claim a wider share, or what became known as the disruptive vote in any government. Hezbollah’s rise came by accident. Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, in collaboration with Christian militias led by the Kataeb Party, and the ensuing series of events that culminated with the expulsion of the Palestinian Liberation Organization from the country finally led, in 1985, to the emergence on the scene of Hezbollah, with Iran’s solid backing. Back then, Hezbollah had a just cause: To rid Lebanon of Israeli occupation. Along with its fellow Shiite partner Amal, it fought Israel and finally drove it out of Southern Lebanon in 2000. And when the civil war ended in 1990, Hezbollah refused to disarm while Israel was still occupying parts of the country. That was a milestone in the evolution of the party as an armed militia within the Lebanese state. And that reality remained a major challenge — if not an impediment — for successive Lebanese governments. The sectarian power-sharing deal had become skewed. Hezbollah became a major political player because it had infiltrated key state institutions. Slowly but surely, its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, began identifying himself as a regional player with unabashed fealty to the agenda of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It is no wonder that the paralysis that hit Lebanon’s political system was followed by economic collapse. Lebanon became hostage to the man ruling from Beirut’s southern district. He dragged the country into a devastating war in 2006 and admitted he was wrong. But his apology was not a remorseful one. He became more defiant as he built an arsenal of Iranian missiles that he threatened to launch at Israel, even though a war of that sort would surely destroy what is left of Lebanon. In May 2008, after a long political stalemate, Hezbollah’s forces briefly overtook Beirut to pin down their Sunni foes. The message was clear to all: Hezbollah had become a state within a state and it now manipulated the sectarian agenda to bring down the government whenever it pleased. Its alliance with the Christian Free Patriotic Movement, led by President Michel Aoun, proved to be unholy in all aspects. To serve narrow political objectives, Aoun allowed Hezbollah to derail the political process on more than one occasion, leading to the mass civil protests in 2019. From then on, Lebanon went into a downward spiral. And the plunge continues. Setting aside the alleged involvement of Hezbollah in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005, the explosion that destroyed Beirut’s port in August 2020 complicated things for the group. Lebanon’s political crisis deepened when a judge was appointed to investigate the incident. Hezbollah and Amal objected and wanted the file closed. Aside from the huge economic losses to the port and property — estimated at $15 billion — the explosion killed 218 civilians and injured more than 7,000. A month after joining Najib Mikati’s newly formed government last September, ministers belonging to the two Shiite groups began a boycott of the Cabinet over the port explosion investigation. The lira has since lost almost 90 percent of its value, putting 80 percent of the Lebanese population below the poverty line. To make things worse, Nasrallah launched an irresponsible and unwarranted verbal attack on Saudi Arabia, a country hosting no less than 150,000 Lebanese expatriates. The diplomatic backlash from Gulf Cooperation Council countries was severe and Beirut found itself politically and economically isolated. The leaders of Hezbollah and Amal have abandoned their Lebanese identity and brought the whole country to its knees. Osama Al-Sharif Now, Hezbollah and Amal have announced that their ministers are ending the Cabinet boycott for the sake of passing the 2022 budget and alleviating the economic crisis. This is yet another ploy to tighten Hezbollah’s grip on the government. The bitter fact is that the two groups’ leaderships have abandoned their Lebanese identity and brought the whole country to its knees. The end of the boycott could be related to news that the West and Iran are closer than ever to reaching a deal in Vienna. Hezbollah might be feeling that Iran’s regional priorities are about to change. Whatever the reason, Hezbollah has become a burden on Lebanon’s tired back. Even in a sectarian power-sharing understanding — one that has become anathema for most Lebanese — the group is claiming much more than its fair share. Going back to business as usual is no longer an option for Lebanon. A new deal must be struck; one that replaces the sectarian power-sharing system with an equitable arrangement that recognizes a single Lebanese national identity and that ends the two-decade hijack of the state by Hezbollah. Osama Al-Sharif is a journalist and political commentator based in Amman.

Lebanon is ready to resume talks over a maritime border dispute with Israel, the country’s president, Michel Aoun, said on Wednesday. Longtime foes Israel and Lebanon have no diplomatic relations and are technically in a state of war. They each claim about 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea as being within their exclusive economic zones. The two countries started indirect negotiations through a US mediator in 2020 at a UN peacekeeping base in Lebanon’s Naqoura, but the talks have stalled several times. The last round of talks on the matter was held last May. Lebanon has sunk deep into an economic and financial crisis that started in late 2019 — a culmination of decades of corruption and mismanagement by the political class. The small Mediterranean country is eager to resolve its border dispute with Israel, paving the way for potential lucrative oil and gas deals. Israel’s Energy Ministry said in response that it is ready to resume talks, with Israeli officials quoted by the Kan public broadcaster as saying, “For us, the negotiations never been stopped.

In November, the Axios news site reported that Hochstein informed Israel and Lebanon that if they could not agree to a compromise, he would end his involvement in the talks. He suggested to top Israeli officials during a visit to Israel that they need to get the deal done before the March 2022 parliamentary election in Lebanon, the report quoted Israeli officials as saying. Advertisement Hochstein was also in Beirut a month earlier as he continued his efforts to restart the stalled talks. The Israel-born envoy also told officials that he was not planning to resume the joint talks held at a UN base on the border. Instead, he would meet with each side independently and then offer a bridging proposal. “Hochstein told us he is not going to present a proposal that both sides like, but the opposite — that both won’t like. But if three to four months from now he sees the parties are not willing to take the deal, he would drop the whole thing and won’t deal with this anymore,” a senior Israeli official told Axios. Hochstein was looking to get both sides to make serious compromises, officials said, noting that both countries wanted to resolve the dispute despite tensions between them. In October, the leader of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah terror group, Hassan Nasrallah, warned Israel against unilaterally searching for natural gas in the disputed maritime region before any agreement is reached. In a wide-ranging speech broadcast from an undisclosed location during a ceremony marking Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, Nasrallah said that while he would leave it up to the Lebanese government to negotiate an end to the dispute, his group would not tolerate Israeli searches in the disputed region. Advertisement Accusing Israel of casting a “greedy” eye over Lebanon’s natural resources, the terror leader said Israel was “mistaken if it thought it could extract these resources from the disputed area before negotiations are completed.” “The resistance is capable of acting and will do so against any Israeli actions in the disputed zone,” Nasrallah said, accusing Israel of giving a company the go-ahead to begin explorations.

Advertisement Accusing Israel of casting a “greedy” eye over Lebanon’s natural resources, the terror leader said Israel was “mistaken if it thought it could extract these resources from the disputed area before negotiations are completed.” “The resistance is capable of acting and will do so against any Israeli actions in the disputed zone,” Nasrallah said, accusing Israel of giving a company the go-ahead to begin explorations.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun declared on Wednesday that his country was prepared to restart indirect negotiations with Israel over the two countries’ maritime borders. According to Israel’s Kan news, Israel responded to the announcement by saying that “for us, the negotiations have never been stopped.

News article:
Lebanon is at a crucial crossroads as its government finally convenes for the first time in several months. It will have little time to negotiate a reform package with the International Monetary Fund to avoid economic collapse. And while the Shiite duo of the Amal movement and Hezbollah recently made headlines by ending their three-month boycott of cabinet sessions, thus allowing the government to convene, this is no assurance that they will not continue to meddle with Lebanese lawmakers to derail any reform package that is needed to begin rebuilding. Right now, the Lebanese people are suffering; many are starving and rightfully distrustful that the government will come to their assistance. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF) are experiencing challenges in carrying out their missions, which could create regional problems if Lebanon’s security and sovereignty are not protected. How the United States responds to these troubles can play a pivotal role in helping to stabilize one of the few liberal democratic states in the Arab world. Lebanon’s collapse would end the many assets it brings to the Middle East: counterterrorism cooperation with the U.S., an inclusive democracy, religious coexistence, gender equality, and access to Western education (especially the two leading American universities in the Middle East). Increased Iranian influence in Lebanon could lead to the country’s loss of sovereignty and independence and likely would result in a growing terror threat to the U.S. There is no looking the other way; the US must act. A new policy brief released by the American Task Force on Lebanon, the Middle East Institute and more than 20 leading policymakers makes the case that friends of the U.S. and Lebanon in the international community can play a critical role in encouraging Lebanese politicians to put the Lebanese people first when setting policy, and not their personal interests. The traditional political parties abet corruption and oppose inclusive reforms; others, such as Amal and Hezbollah, also have disruptive agendas. Together, this makes it nearly impossible for Judge Tarek Bitar to conduct an independent investigation into the Aug. 4, 2020, Beirut Port explosion, and undermines the judiciary and other state institutions that protect democracy in Lebanon. The first challenge for the U.S. and its allies is to promote the integrity of parliamentary elections on May 15. Results of the election should reflect the needs of Lebanon’s people for economic progress, a significant social safety net, transparent government, and a program for eliminating government corruption. This is a call not merely for younger leadership, but for leaders with a nonsectarian mentality whose allegiance starts and ends with Lebanon. New candidates and political parties will appear on the ballot, and it is vital that they have the opportunity to make their case to voters. The U.S. should join an international effort to provide election monitors and assistance to civil society organizations that promote democracy and clean government. Anyone who interferes in this election should be sanctioned or otherwise punished. The U.S. also should use its influence and leadership with countries such as France and the Gulf states to help combat corruption and promote reform in Lebanon. This will ensure that the Lebanese people have reliable foreign partners and the resources to withstand nefarious efforts made by countries such as Iran and Syria. A positive step is to advance the maritime border negotiations with Israel, which will remove an area of provocations between Lebanon and Israel. The U.S. must continue to play a leadership role that ensures conditions for fruitful talks. Importantly, the U.S. also must understand that any agreement it makes with Iran must impose a requirement for Iran to control — and eventually eliminate — its terrorist proxies in the Middle East, such as Hezbollah. Lastly, the depth of Lebanon’s economic crisis cannot be overstated. The Mikati government must quickly adopt a national budget and complete negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for an agreement that is fair to bank depositors, initiates banking and public sector reforms, and creates opportunities for businesses to grow and create employment. The Lebanese people deserve to live in a sovereign, independent state that is not threatened by internal militias, terrorists or neighboring countries, and the U.S. cannot afford to have Lebanon become a failed state. The elections must happen in a fair and transparent manner. Support for the LAF and ISF must increase. Reforms must begin. The potential erosion of Lebanon’s integrity as a state would be a tragic loss of a longtime U.S. friend and could further undermine American credibility in the region.

News article:
Beirut - Asharq Al-Awsat The repeated attacks against the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) are political messages from Hezbollah and Iran to the UN and international community. Three attacks against the peacekeeping force were reported in one month alone. Never have there been this many attacks against the international troops in the space of one month. The attacks took place amid international calls that the Iran-backed Hezbollah party lay down its arms and for Lebanon to implement UN Security Council resolution 1701 and 1559. UNIFIL has, meanwhile, taken a firmer stance against these assaults, more so than it has ever done before. In a sharp tone, it demanded that the perpetrator be held to account, calling on the Lebanese authorities to carry out a probe. This marked a shift in its tone as UNIFIL usually used to announce an investigation in such attacks and that it was coordinating with the Lebanese military. Resolution 1701 was issued in August 2006 to end the Israeli war on Lebanon. It gave UNIFIL the jurisdiction to carry out the necessary security measures in areas where it is deployed in southern Lebanon. Among other points, the resolution demands that areas of UNIFIL's deployment are not used for hostile attacks of any kind. The resolution provides protection for UN facilities and employees, guarantees their freedom of movement in humanitarian work and protects civilians, while respecting the role of the Lebanese government. The resolution effectively expanded the role of UNIFIL, which was first formed and deployed in Lebanon in 1978. Since then, the UN troops have been deploying at least 400 patrols a day. The troops have rarely come under attack and when they do, they usually happen before their mandate is extended in August of every year. Political and field changes must have happened for three attacks to take place against UNIFIL in one month. In November alone, three assaults were reported against the troops. One attack was reported in the town of Shakra on December 24, another in the town of Ramia on December 25 and the third in Bint Jbeil on January 3. Often, "locals" are blamed for attacking UNIFIL. 'Locals' and Hezbollah Lebanese academic and political researcher Dr. Mona Fayad rejects accusations that "locals" are behind these attacks. In remarks to Asharq Al-Awsat, she said that such excuses are "not fooling anyone." Rather, she said Hezbollah, which is "hiding behind the people", should be held responsible. She said the party has managed over time to establish an authority that is independent of the Lebanese state. One of the ways it managed to reach this position is its assuming of the role of "speaking on behalf of the resistance community and labeling as 'locals' people, especially Shiites, whom it mobilizes whenever the party needs them to exert pressure on a certain side. That way the party avoids direct confrontation." Political motives The frequency of the recent attacks has raised questions over their motives and political messages to the international mission. UNIFIL was firm in demanding a probe into the attacks, rejecting attempts aimed at restricting its freedom of movement in the South. Fayad noted the latest attack when a routine UNIFIL patrol was assaulted even though it did not veer off its main route. Past attacks have been blamed on patrols changing their routes without coordinating with the Lebanese army or on troops taking photos in specific locations. Fayad said the latest attacks are taking place at a time when the residents of the South feel that they need UN troops given the security and peace they have established in the area since the implementation of resolution 1701. Prior to that, they had never experienced such peace and calm, she added. At a time of upheaval in the rest of the country in recent years, the South has enjoyed relative calm, with the assassination of Shiite dissident Loqman Slim last year as the only major incident. He was killed in the South, in an area that is filled with surveillance cameras and where Hezbollah must be very familiar with. Hezbollah, continued Fayad, has exploited the "army, resistance and people" slogan to exert pressure on various sides, while still avoiding turning attention to it. Indeed, Hezbollah is not mentioned when attacks on UNIFIL are reported, but rather the "locals" are the ones being blamed. The party uses such tactics to give the impression that it is implementing resolution 1701. Change in UNIFIL's tone After the latest attack on January 25, UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said the peacekeepers were not trespassing on private property, but were passing through a routine route. They were carrying out their duties according to resolution 1701 to preserve stability in the South. He stressed that the resolution grants the troops complete freedom of movement and the right to deploy patrols in their area of operations. The attacks against the men and women who are serving peace are deemed as crimes by Lebanese and international laws. The Lebanese authorities must probe these crimes and put the perpetrators on trial, he demanded. Tenenti's statements mark a shift in tone. Fayad said the peacekeepers will no longer accept the excuse that the attacks were sparked by them changing their patrol route or that they were taking photos. The change in the spokesperson's tone is a sign that the confrontation is growing because the UN mission senses a shift in the equation and an opportunity for it to play a better role, she explained. Furthermore, Fayad said these changes "are not restricted to Lebanon alone," but they are tied to the Vienna nuclear talks with Iran. International messages Political researcher and retired Gen. of Staff Khaled Hamade said the timing of the attacks are more significant than the assaults themselves. There is no doubt that Hezbollah is behind the attacks, which are tied to regional developments, Hamade told Asharq Al-Awsat. The developments point to significant changes on the ground in the region. Iran is seeking to use its regional cards in response to its setbacks in the region, he explained. Iran, not Hezbollah, should be blamed for the attacks on UNIFIL because the party is an extension of Tehran in Lebanon. Iran is seeking to "shuffle all regional cards," said Hamade. He cited the developments in Iraq that is stumbling in forming a new government. He also noted the attempt on the life of Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi. He pointed to the repeated rocket attacks on the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia by the Iran-backed Houthi militias in Yemen. These are all signs of Iran's reactions in regions where it wields influence, stressed Hamade. Moreover, the attack carried out by ISIS against Gweiran prison in northeastern Syria is "one of the cards Iran is using to exert pressure in the region." Lebanon is another one of Iran's cards and it is using UNIFIL to deliver messages. Hamade said Tehran is using all the cards at its disposal in reaction to the setbacks it has suffered. In Lebanon, Hezbollah does Iran's bidding by attacking UNIFIL. By attacking UNIFIL, Iran is saying that it can obstruct the implementation of resolution 1701, explained Hamade. Lebanon is helpless in responding to or thwarting such a violation, so the government often takes a very vague stance that does nothing in affecting the situation on the ground. UN cover Meanwhile, fears have been growing in the South that the attacks would force UNIFIL to pull out of Lebanon, which would cost the country one of its last remaining international covers as it grapples with an unprecedented economic crisis. Hamade eased these concerns, saying the peacekeeping force will remain. The attacks will not force UNIFIL to withdraw, but the repeated incidents will prompt international reactions, perhaps even a Security Council meeting. "The Council will not be extorted and will not allow the obstruction of an international resolution," he stated. "Furthermore, Hezbollah itself does not want the UN troops to withdraw because it will lose a precious card in its extortion." Another factor is Israel, said Hamade. It wants an international force deployed in the South because it ensures its security. Iran itself also wants UNIFIL to stay so that it can continue on delivering its messages. Hezbollah wants the troops to remain so that it can keep its attention focused on internal Lebanese affairs, added Hamade. It will continue to abide by resolution 1701, implementing it "with an Iranian twist and a way that serves its interests."

News article:
President Michel Aoun on Monday asked Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib to file a U.N. Security Council complaint against Israel over its violation of Lebanon’s airspace to carry out an overnight strike on Syria. Aoun made the request during a Cabinet session in Baabda, in which Interior Minister Bassam al-Mawlawi briefed the conferees on the busting of “17 spy networks that were working for the Israeli enemy” inside Lebanon. “It turned out that the role of these networks is domestic and regional,” Mawlawi told Cabinet. Prime Minister Najib Miqati for his part hailed “the Intelligence Branch of the Internal Security Forces over this major achievement.” “Busting these networks once again proves the importance of preemptive security and strong coordination among the various security agencies concerned with protecting Lebanon,” the premier added. Al-Akhbar newspaper reported the busts on Monday, calling it the largest operation against suspected Israeli agents in the country for 13 years. It said that the ISF's intelligence unit started the crackdown four weeks ago and had so far detained around 20 people, including Lebanese, Palestinian and Syrian nationals -- some of whom were later released. The al-Akhbar report claimed that at least 12 of the suspects in detention were aware they working for Israel, while the rest believed they were providing information for global companies or non profit organizations. Israel and Hizbullah fought a 33-day war in Lebanon in 2006. Between April 2009 and 2014, Lebanese authorities detained more than 100 people accused of spying for Israel, most of them members of the military or telecom employees. The rate of arrests, however, had declined in recent years.

News article:
Lebanese President Michel Aoun has called upon the country’s top diplomat to file a complaint with the UN Security Council (UNSC) against the Israeli regime’s repeated violations of the Arab country’s sovereignty and airspace to carry out airstrikes in neighboring Syria. Aoun instructed Lebanese Foreign Affairs Minister Abdullah Bou Habib on Monday to take the measure, Arabic-language Lebanon 24 news website said, citing a report by Lebanon's al-Jadeed television station. Syria’s official news agency SANA, citing a military source, reported that Israeli warplanes fired several missiles from the direction of the eastern Lebanese town of Rayaq at some targets near Damascus at about 3:05 a.m. (0005 GMT) local time on Monday, but Syrian air defenses could bring down most of the projectiles. The source noted that the strikes had caused some “material damage.” There were no immediate reports of casualties. Last month, the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants condemned in the strongest terms an Israeli missile strike against Syria’s strategic western port of Latakia, saying the attack once again exposed the true nature of the Tel Aviv regime. “The [December 28, 2021] attack, which came during the holidays and was the second in less than a month, once again exposes Israel's true face,” the ministry was quoted by Lebanon’s official National News Agency as saying. The ministry then reaffirmed Beirut’s support for “the Syrian Arab Republic and the brotherly Syrian people, who are suffering from the most terrible crisis in their modern history," and wished them "peace and prosperity.” Israel violates Lebanon's airspace and territorial waters on an almost daily basis, claiming the flights and incursions serve surveillance purposes. Lebanon’s government, Hezbollah and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) have repeatedly condemned Israel’s overflights, saying they are in clear violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the country’s sovereignty. Back on September 30 last year, fighters from Hezbollah intercepted and shot down an Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle while it was hovering over the southern part of Lebanon. Hezbollah said in a brief statement carried by Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Manar television network that it downed an Israeli drone that had entered the Lebanese skies with “appropriate weapons." The statement added the Israeli aircraft was brought down as it was flying over Maryamin valley on the outskirts of the southern town of Yater.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun yesterday called on his Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, to file a complaint against the "Israeli violations" to the United Nations Security Council.

News article:
Defense Minister Benny Gantz said on Wednesday that Israel has offered the Lebanese army aid multiple times. Gantz, who gave a pre-recorded speech at a conference hosted by the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that Lebanon has become "an Island of instability" and its citizens "are not our enemies." Gantz said that the Israeli military had offered aid to Lebanon four times in the past year, including last week. Israel, Gantz said, wishes to offer the Lebanese army aid amid a shortage in basic supplies and have lost over 5,000 soldiers recently. The offer, coordinated through the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon, was aimed to help the army "face the strengthening of Hezbollah under Iran's support," Gantz said. A senior Israeli official denied Gantz's claims on Wednesday night. "Israel didn't offer assistance to Lebanon army," the source said, "Israel offered humanitarian aid to the people of Lebanon through the UN following an explosion in one of Lebanon's ports recently." The defense minister also addressed threats posed by Iran. He expressed confidence in the U.S.'s abilities to bring to a "halt the Iranian nuclear project." Gantz also said that the U.S. and Israel are promoting "operational cooperation" in face of a possible nuclear breakthrough by Tehran. Open gallery view Defense Minister Benny Gantz speaking at Haaretz Israel Democracy Conference in September Credit: Hadas Parush A senior diplomat however said that Israel didn't offer to assist the Lebanese army, but offered to provide humanitarian aid to Lebanese people mediated by the United Nations after the port blast in Beirut. Earlier on Wednesday, Gantz began a surprise visit on Wednesday to Bahrain, his spokesperson said. It is the first visit of an Israeli defense minister to Bahrain. Gantz was welcomed at the airport by Bahrain Defense Minister Abdulla bin Hasan Al Nuaimi. On Tuesday Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke in the conference and announced that Israel Defense Forces will start using a laser-based missile interception system 'within a year.' The prime minister says that after the laser interception system becomes operational, "The equation will change – they'll invest a lot, and us a little." Each interceptor for the Iron Dome – the missile defense system currently in use – costs about 170,000 shekels (nearly $53,000), and each incoming rocket usually requires more than one interceptor. According to Bennett, the system can also serve "our friends in the region, who are also vulnerable to serious threats from Iran and its proxies."

U.S. Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein arrived in Lebanon Tuesday carrying a new proposal regarding the maritime borders demarcation between Lebanon and Israel. Amos' visit comes after Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz had said that "Israel is ready to resume the maritime border talks with Lebanon." Indirect negotiations, mediated by the U.S., had been stalled after a disagreement on a disputed area. Two weeks ago, Lebanon sent a letter to the U.N. to pressure for speeding up the negotiations. The letter mentions a disputed area that includes a gas field, the Karish field that Lebanon is considering a disputed area. It considers any Israeli attempt to explore gas in the area a threat to international peace and security. As negotiations resume, Lebanon hopes that oil and gas discoveries in its territorial waters will help it overcome an unprecedented economic and financial crisis.

News article:
President Michel Aoun has stirred controversy by avoiding to consult with Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Najib Miqati regarding a letter that he sent to the U.N. about the sea border demarcation with Israel, media reports said. The letter was delivered by Lebanese Ambassador to U.N. Amal Mudallali at the Presidency’s demand and following a request from Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, Kuwait’s al-Anbaa newspaper reported. The letter states that Lebanon will now negotiate over Line 29 instead of Line 23 while preserving its right to amend Decree 6433 should there be procrastination, the daily quoted official sources as saying. Speaking to the newspaper, parliamentary sources said Aoun addressed the letter in a “unilateral” manner without consulting with Berri and Miqati, and that Bou Habib has cited Miqati’s “preoccupation with the draft state budget” as an “excuse.” The parliamentary sources added that Aoun’s move might be aimed at appeasing Washington so that it lifts the sanctions imposed on Free Patriotic Movement chief Jebran Bassil. Informed sources meanwhile said that the visit of U.S. energy envoy Amon Hochstein to Lebanon is aimed at “splitting” the offshore oil and gas reserves between Lebanon and Israel instead of demarcating the maritime border.

Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is delivering a speech in which he appears to attempt to distance his movement from Tehran, while also gloating that Israel is afraid to go to war against either. The leader of the Iran-backed Shiite terror group claims Israel is not serious about actually attacking Iran, but if it does, Hezbollah will not immediately retaliate against Israel on Tehran’s behalf, but will decide whether or not to get involved. “Iran is a strong regional state and any war with it will blow up the entire region,” he says, according to Naharnet. Amid domestic criticism that his group acts in Tehran’s interests and not Lebanon’s, he challenges in a speech for anyone to “tell us about a single act that Hezbollah did for the sake of Iran rather than for the sake of Lebanon.” He claims that Hezbollah’s precision-guided missiles are spread all around Lebanon, so that Israel would need to launch a full-scale war in order to destroy them. He says Israel is afraid to go to war against Hezbollah, which has unprecedented manpower. He also claims that Israeli drone flights over Lebanon have stopped due to Hezbollah’s superior air defenses. He adds that he is against sharing offshore gas with Israel and doesn’t really care about negotiations between Beirut and Jerusalem over determining the countries’ exclusive economic zones. “We do not consider ourselves to be concerned with the technical discussions about the sea border demarcation with Israel,” he says.

Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Tuesday claimed Israel was not serious about actually attacking Iran. But if it does, he said, his Lebanese terror group will not automatically retaliate on Tehran’s behalf, but will decide whether or not to get involved. In an interview with Iranian state TV, the leader of the Iran-backed Shiite organization appeared to attempt to assert Hezbollah’s independence from Tehran, while also claiming Israel was afraid to go to war against either. “Iran is a strong regional state and any war with it will blow up the entire region,” he said, according to Naharnet. Amid domestic criticism that his group acts in Tehran’s interests and not Lebanon’s, he challenged anyone to “tell us about a single act that Hezbollah did for the sake of Iran rather than for the sake of Lebanon.” He denied the Iranian embassy in Beirut was involved in Hezbollah’s decision-making. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Nasrallah claimed that the United States fears going to war with Iran, asserting it was incapable of stopping Tehran’s nuclear program. He also warned of “a very intense and harsh” Iranian response if Israel attacks Iran. “Iran is not on joking terms with anyone,” he was quoted as saying by Press TV. He claimed that Hezbollah’s precision-guided missiles were spread all around Lebanon, so Israel would need to launch a full-scale war in order to destroy them. Advertisement He also accused Israel of being afraid to go to war against Hezbollah. “Were the Israeli regime certain that it would be victorious in a war with Hezbollah, it would not hesitate for even a moment,” Nasrallah said. He also claimed that Israeli drone flights over Lebanon have been “greatly reduced” due to Hezbollah’s improved air defenses. Nasrallah added that he opposes sharing offshore gas with Israel and does not really care about negotiations between Beirut and Jerusalem over determining the countries’ exclusive economic zones. “We do not consider ourselves to be concerned with the technical discussions about the sea border demarcation with Israel,” he said. Nasrallah’s remarks come several weeks after both Israel and Lebanon announced their intentions to resume talks over an area of about 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea that both countries claim as being within their exclusive economic zones. Advertisement The US envoy mediating the talks has since met with Israeli and Lebanese officials. The two countries started indirect negotiations through a US mediator in 2020 at a UN peacekeeping base in Lebanon’s Naqoura, but the talks have stalled several times. The last round of talks on the matter was held last May. Lebanon has sunk deep into an economic and financial crisis that started in late 2019 — a culmination of decades of corruption and mismanagement by the political class. The small Mediterranean country is eager to resolve its border dispute with Israel, paving the way for potential lucrative oil and gas deals. Agencies contributed to this report

News article:
Hezbollah's secretary general says the Lebanese resistance movement rejected an offer of financial support by the United States in exchange for turning its back on Palestine and ending confrontation with the occupying Israeli regime. In an interview with Iran’s Arabic-language al-Alam news network on Tuesday, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Americans tried to negotiate with Hezbollah many times over the past years, both before and after 2000, through various channels. There were discussions between Hezbollah and Washington via intermediaries, but the resistance group announced that there is no need for negotiations as the United States is an enemy, he added. "Previously, they (the Americans) sent us a delegation on behalf of Dick Cheney to negotiate a halt in our support for Palestine and attacks against Israel. In return, they said that they would pay us billions of dollars and even allow us to have our weapons, an offer which we naturally opposed.” Lebanon fought off two Israeli wars in 2000 and 2006. On both occasions, battleground contribution by Hezbollah proved an indispensable asset, forcing the Israeli military into a retreat. Lebanon and the occupying entity are technically at war since the latter has kept the Arab country’s Shebaa Farms under occupation since 1967. Elsewhere in his comments, Nasrallah said, “We do not recognize the existence of Israel. This is the land of Palestine.” He also expressed Hezbollah’s opposition to any attempt by the Lebanese government to normalize ties or cooperate with the Israeli enemy. The main objective of the normalization of ties with Tel Aviv is to make the Palestinian people frustrated so that they would finally relinquish their rights, the Hezbollah chief noted. He further warned the equation that an encroachment on al-Quds means an encroachment on the resistance axis is still in place. Additionally, he asserted that Hezbollah does not interfere in the affairs of the UAE and Saudi Arabia or any other country and that it has no problem with Lebanon's dialogue with Arab states. 'US looting Syria’s resources' Nasrallah said that the United States does not negotiate with terrorists, but always cooperates with them. The US is present in the east of the Euphrates River to plunder Syrian oil and gas, he emphasized. The war on Syria ended without achieving its goals. “Some of the targets being bombed in Syria are affiliated with Hezbollah… But, we have set an equation... If any of us is killed, they must wait for our response… Well, in the attacks now, they are very careful so that no one is killed,” he explained. Iraqi parliament’s decision to expel Americans ‘decisive’ Also in his interview, the Hezbollah secretary general hailed as “decisive” the Iraqi parliament’s decision on the US withdrawal from the Arab country. Baghdad, he said, witnessed large protests demanding the pullout of American troops from Iraq following the martyrdom of Iran’s top anti-terror commander General Qassem Soleimani and his Iraqi ternchmate Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy head of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units, outside Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2020. Bahrainis ‘still committed to ideals, principles’ Nasrallah said that what happens in Bahrain is, in fact, a severe repression, the arrest of clerics, the revocation of people’s citizenship and a request for help from foreigners. However, he added, the Bahraini nation still keep adhering to their ideals and principles.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Lebanon’s senior Christian cleric called on Wednesday for the government to agree a plan with the International Monetary Fund to save the country from financial collapse and said elections should be held on time later this year. The Lebanese government began a new round of talks with the IMF last month in the hope of securing an agreement - something Beirut has failed to achieve since the crisis erupted in 2019 and pushed a majority of the population into poverty. Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai said the government must accelerate reforms and “agree with the IMF on a plan that saves Lebanon from collapse.” An IMF deal is widely seen the only way for Lebanon to unlock foreign aid it needs to get out of the crisis, which came to a head when the economy collapsed under huge public debts caused by decades of state corruption and mismanagement, Reuters reported. Rai also said a parliamentary election scheduled for May should be held on time. The new parliament is due to elect a head of state later in the year to replace President Michel Aoun. Aoun and other leaders have said they are committed to holding the May polls. However, analysts say some parties, including allies of the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah group who together with it have a parliamentary majority, could face setbacks in the election, the first since the financial collapse. Rai last month warned against attempts to “circumvent” the election. Rai is a critic of Hezbollah, saying it has harmed Lebanon by dragging it into regional conflicts where the group has supported Iran and its regional allies as they compete for influence with Gulf Arab states. Rai reiterated his call for Lebanon to adopt a position of “positive neutrality” in its foreign relations.

US envoy Amos Hochstein urged Lebanese authorities Wednesday to settle a maritime border dispute with Israel, saying it was the “last minute” for an agreement that could facilitate hydrocarbon exploration at sea. Longtime foes Israel and Lebanon have no diplomatic relations and are technically in a state of war. They each claim about 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea as being within their exclusive economic zones. “I think that we’re at the moment of narrowing those gaps towards a deal,” Hochstein told Lebanese broadcaster LBCI in an interview. “There’s no later anymore. This is the later. This is the last minute,” he added.

"President Aoun expressed Lebanon's readiness to discuss the points raised during the meeting, which will be completed later, and stressed the continuation of communication with the American side to this end." According to the official statement, the meeting also addressed the US role in overcoming the obstacles to Lebanon importing gas and electricity from Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Lebanon is locked in a dispute with Israel over an area of 1,430 square kilometres in the Mediterranean Sea. The area apparently includes part of Israel's Karish gas field.

The Israeli army, on Friday, announced that its representatives participated in a tripartite meeting with Lebanese military officials and the commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Anadolu News Agency reports. In a statement to Anadolu Agency, Israeli army spokesman, Avichay Adraee, said the meeting took place at the UNIFIL headquarters in Ras Al-Naqoura in southern Lebanon. The spokesman said, during the meeting, the Israeli army presented, what it claimed, "Lebanese violations of Security Council Resolution 1701, which focused on the presence of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and the presence of prohibited weapons there." "Notably, this meeting was pre-determined and forms part of the mechanism to prevent friction along the Blue Line," Adraee added. UNIFIL is a multinational peacekeeping force that has been deployed in southern Lebanon since 1978. Its primary objective is to maintain security in the region and monitor a cessation-of-hostilities agreement. Following the 2006 conflict between Israel and the Lebanese group, Hezbollah, UNIFIL was tasked with ensuring the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for a cease-fire between the warring sides and an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Hezbollah Sheikh Ali Damoush called for Lebanon not to accept the agreement to demarcate maritime borders that do not guarantee full Lebanese sovereignty, Al-Quds Al-Arabi reported on Friday. Damoush announced in a statement: "We reject all forms of normalisation of ties with the enemy. It is not acceptable that the Lebanese accept any proposal, under American pressure, for the demarcation of maritime borders that do not respect Lebanese fuel and gas rights." He accused the US administration of being the: "Biggest cheater, terror sponsor and supporter of corrupt and dictatorships around the globe." According to Damoush, the US: "Interferes in the internal affairs of the countries and practices extortion on the different states in order to impose its own conditions." READ: Lebanon's Hezbollah warns Israel against drilling in disputed maritime border area Damoush indicated that the US administration is trying to impose its conditions through its envoy, who mediates the talks between Lebanon and Israel on the demarcation of maritime borders. He accused the US administration of ignoring democratic values to achieve its own interests. These remarks came following a proposal put down by US Senior Advisor for Global Energy Security Amos Hochstein. In 2020, Lebanon reached a framework agreement on the demarcation of maritime borders mediated by the US and under the patronage of the United Nations. Lebanon and Israel have so far held five rounds of indirect negotiations on the demarcation of maritime borders.

News article:
Last Wednesday, during the mass service on Saint Maroun's Day attended by most Lebanese leaders, Maronite Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi looked into the eyes of President Michel Aoun and said, with an assuaging tone, that, “We are struggling together so that Lebanon does not continue to be a battleground for regional conflicts, a platform for missiles, and a front for fighting.” The Lebanese would then hear the response to this statement from Hassan Nasrallah speaking to Iranian television Al-Alam that same evening. Al-Rahi added that the state of Lebanon was not founded to be an enemy to its sister nations and friends, so let’s not make Lebanon an enemy to itself. From this, there are five priorities which al-Rahi used to appeal to the leaders sitting with him. These represent the true will and aspiration for Lebanon and its sister and friendly nations. The first is holding elections, both parliamentary and presidential, on their constitutionally assigned dates. Secondly, the truth behind the Beirut Port blast must be uncovered, as it is untenable for the investigation to remain obstructed and a victim of conflicts and interpretations, as if there are those who fear the truth. Thirdly, the process of reform and agreement with the IMF must be accelerated. Fourth, the implementation of the Taif Agreement must be sustained along with UN Security Council resolutions. This was already stipulated in the Kuwaiti, Arab, international paper to which the Lebanese government responded with platitudes and emotional rhetoric, claiming to uphold relations with “Arab brothers” while Hezbollah renders Lebanon a platform for aggression, verbal and actual, against Gulf Arab brother nations. Moreover, this includes hosting opposition conferences in Hezbollah’s strongholds in Beirut, as well as assisting the Houthis with training and enabling their attacks against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It was a humorous, albeit embarrassing, coincidence that Nasrallah, speaking to Iranian Al-Alam Wednesday evening, accused the US embassy of funding NGOs. He also claimed that when the embassy invited 20 such organizations to protest and demand the implementation of Resolution 1559, only 20 people participated. This caused some to point to a negative development on that same Wednesday, as only a very small group of people were brought to chant for Aoun as he entered the church, promoting much mockery and derision. It was clear, and fully understood, to whom Al-Rahi was directing this speech, even before Nasrallah responded and claimed the opposite of what the Patriarch said. However, Al-Rahi was clear in emphasizing his demands first of the Lebanese in the unfortunate alliance with Hezbollah, and to President Michel Aoun who ascended to Baabda Palace after two and a half years of presidential vacuum. The Republican Palace was once destroyed by the Syrian air force, and again corroded by the vacuum engineered by Hezbollah, and a third time by the Security Council which issued a statement early this month regarding the resolution emphasizing the binding clause of holding free, fair and transparent elections as scheduled on May 15. Hezbollah is on a quest to sabotage any attempt at calm that could restore confidence in Lebanon, from the Kuwaiti initiative to the Security Council statement, to the Saudi-American accord on the importance of elections as an entry point for change in Lebanon which was the subject of profound discussion between Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan and the Acting Assistant Secretary of Near Eastern Affairs Yael Lempert. However, in light of the current ruling majority led by Hezbollah, it is difficult to cooperate with Lebanon to save it economically, financially, or in terms of its security. As part of this endeavor, Hezbollah is preparing to hold a political conference for the Bahraini opposition Al-Wefaq National Islamic Society in Dahieh, the southern suburb of Beirut, on January 14. This was revealed mere hours after Nasrallah’s televised speech in which he described international efforts to restore confidence in Lebanon as mere “foreign dictations.” He did not hesitate to say, in contradiction to the Patriarch’s words, that he will respond if Iran is attacked by Israel, stressing that Lebanon is just an Iranian missile platform. He considered that those who demand the surrender of their weapons are “using the enemy's terminology” while forgetting that the enemy is bombing Hezbollah and Iran on a daily basis in Syria, and that he failed to respond with a single shot fired! Returning to the elections, it was suspicious when Nasrallah said that the majority and minority introduced by the ballot box will have no say over Hezbollah’s weapons. In this context, bishop Samir Mazloum says that Patriarch Al-Rahi’s warning against postponing the elections is based on information he has of an intention to postpone elections and undermine the Lebanese people’s right to change, especially at a time when Hezbollah feels that its ally in the Free Patriotic movement is bleeding amid divisions within its internal house, when Aoun’s nephew claimed that he intends to run against Aoun. This is at a time when the Aounist movement is being disintegrated, after they enabled Hezbollah to put Lebanon in its chokehold, instead of the “Lebanonization of Hezbollah” as Aoun had promised to the US Congress before the issuance of Resolution 1559.

In an unprecedented acknowledgment of doubting the superiority of its own air force in the skies of Lebanon, Israel confirmed that it had received Hezbollahs messages that posed a threat to the Israeli Air Force and its freedom of movement, putting what it referred to as a "finger in the eye of Israel", with the resistance in Lebanon deliberately revealing air defense systems in its possession. The announcement by the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, about the activation of the air defense systems of the resistance, sparked a debate inside the Israeli entity about the remaining freedom its air force is capable of having to spying over Lebanon or target Syria from Lebanese airspace. The "Strong Foundation 2" maneuver conducted by the Palestinian resistance factions in the Gaza Strip during the last days of 2021 is not comparable to the previous exercises in the past years, whether in context, timing or objectives. Therefore, the messages that it inferred, whether to the enemy or to friends, were different as well. The resistance, in light of the continuous stumbling in the issues of reconstruction and prisoners swap, which threatens to escalate again, wanted to make the occupation understand that it is ready for any new round, and that it operates as a one mans heart in any upcoming standoff.

News article:
BEIRUT: Eighty-nine percent of respondents in a recent poll said they trusted the Lebanese Armed Forces to ensure the country’s stability, while 80 percent felt the same way about the religious leadership and 75 percent about the judiciary. In contrast, just 19 percent of those polled — regardless of their religious beliefs — thought political parties could be trusted to ensure stability. On Hezbollah, opinions were divided. The poll, conducted by Zogby Research Services, found that 48 percent of respondents had confidence in it to secure Lebanon’s stability, while 52 percent did not. Almost two-thirds of those polled expressed the belief that the “weapons and forces of the resistance should be under the control of the LAF and this includes a majority of respondents in every sectarian community.” The poll was carried out in September, 10 days after the formation of Najib Mikati’s government. The respondents were adults from various Lebanese regions and sects, and all said they were optimistic about the future despite the current situation being worse than it was five years ago. A total of 869 people were asked their opinions on the economic crisis in Lebanon, how it has affected citizens and how far they trust state institutions. They also gave their views on Lebanon’s relations with other countries, the political regime and their hopes for the upcoming legislative elections. Speaking at an event organized by the AUB Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs, also attended by Arab News, James Zogby, who owns the polling company, said: “The developments Lebanon has faced of late led to breaking the existing regime which needs reform, but the ruling political elite does not want to admit that.” Zogby, who is also the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, said the poll showed that respondents had been seriously affected by shortages of fuel (97 percent), electricity (89 percent) and drinking water (74 percent). More than a third of people reported having to go without food on some occasions, with one in five from poor backgrounds saying they or members of their families had “very often gone without meals because of a lack of money or available food.” “Almost two-thirds said they don’t have enough income to make ends meet. And when asked to identify the most pressing economic problems facing the country, far and away the two issues they pointed to were the collapse of the lira (Lebanese pound) and corruption. Given this dire situation, almost two-thirds of all respondents said they would emigrate if given the opportunity,” Zogby said. He added that about 65 percent of respondents thought the “Oct. 17 revolution was beneficial for the country’s stability, while 29 percent said parliament does not ensure stability.” Seventy-six percent of respondents under the age of 30 were more confident in the revolution ensuring Lebanon’s stability. When asked whether Lebanon should strengthen or weaken its ties with other countries, only France scored well, with respondents supporting strengthening ties with Paris by a ratio of two to one. On the US and Iran, a third of people said ties should be strengthened, a third said they should be weakened and a third said they should remain as they were. Zogby said that respondents, “seemed optimistic of change in the next legislative elections,” with almost 60 percent expressing some confidence that they would “bring the political change Lebanon needs.” That attitude may be due to the fact that two-thirds of respondents said they would be voting for the “new alternative parties, with this holding true for all demographic groups. Only one in five said they will vote for the traditional parties.” This rejection extends to the Taif agreement, with almost 60 percent saying Lebanon should dispose of the Taif formula and “adopt a new constitutional model of governance.” The results of the poll — which Dr. Fadlo Khoury, president of the American University of Beirut, said was based on reliable sources, and which was praised by Dr. Joseph Bahout, director of the Issam Fares Center for Public Policy and International Affairs at AUB — also raised a number of questions. Dr. Brigitte Khoury, founding director of the clinical psychology training program at AUH, said: “People need food and health security, in addition to security itself. Every day brings new challenges to the Lebanese, which prevents them from planning for the future or from dreaming of a better future.” She added that after the explosion of the port of Beirut, “people became more desperate and depressed, while the level of tension rose and people lost their power and control, and this is the hardest thing that a human being could face, and it could acquire a violent tendency especially among people who live through shocking events.” Khoury said that if the “elections do not take place then I fear that people will further lose their power and control especially if there is no justice or a sound judiciary.” Dr. Jamil Mouawad, a political scientist, expressed his fear that the “institutions which the Lebanese still trust might be a target for the untrustworthy political powers. We see how the judiciary and the military institutions are getting besieged by the politicians.” He was skeptical about the “possibility of the next parliamentary elections producing promising changes if the parties in power revert to confessional polarization and to using money.” The Lebanese “should agree on a political plan to get out of the crisis and this is something that is not clear. And the question that needs an answer is what is the political regime that the Lebanese want, and what are we protesting against?” Mouawad said that “the ones who participated in the Oct. 17 revolution lack experience and should have history lessons to see what has happened.”

News article:
Lebanon’s Foreign Minister responded positively to proposals from US negotiator Amos Hochstein on settling a maritime border dispute with Israel, in comments published Friday, as Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah reportedly gave a green light to continue negotiations. Longtime foes Israel and Lebanon have been engaged in US-led talks over the past year aimed at demarcating offshore exclusive economic zones. The disputed area, hundreds of square miles wide, is thought to contain large deposits of natural gas, a potential game changer for Lebanon, which is mired in a devastating economic crisis. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib told the Lebanese Al Joumhouria newspaper that US mediator Amos Hochstein brought “positive proposals that can be built upon” and that Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun had asked for them to be delivered in writing so the country can formally respond. Hochstein, the US State Department’s Senior Adviser for Global Energy Security, notified Israel recently that Nasrallah had given his approval to the Lebanese government to move forward with the negotiations, according to a Thursday Haaretz daily report. Defense officials told the newspaper the terror group is keen on an agreement. In October, Nasrallah had warned Israel against unilaterally searching for natural gas in the disputed maritime region before any agreement is reached. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Israel and Lebanon have no diplomatic relations and are technically in a state of war. They each claim about 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea as being within their exclusive economic zones. “I am confident that there will be a unified position in Lebanon and that there’ll be a unified position in Israel, and that we’ll be able to move forward,” the Israel-born Hochstein said earlier this month. Israel and Lebanon had resumed negotiations over their disputed maritime border in 2020 but the process was stalled by Beirut’s claim that the map used by the United Nations in the talks needed modifying. Advertisement Lebanese politicians hope that commercially viable hydrocarbon resources off Lebanon’s coast could help lift the debt-ridden country out of an unprecedented financial crisis branded by the World Bank as one of the planet’s worst in modern times. A senior defense official told Haaretz that solving the dispute is of high priority for the United States, due to its belief it can help alleviate Lebanon’s spiraling energy crisis. Lebanon is currently grappling with its worst-ever financial crisis, and fuel shortages have ground the country to a halt in recent months. With a bankrupt state unable to deliver more than an hour or two of electricity a day, individuals, businesses and institutions have relied almost entirely on diesel-powered generators. Both Israel and Lebanon announced last month their intentions to resume talks. Hochstein met with Israel’s Energy Minister Karine Elharrar last month.

News article:
(MENAFN- Nam News Network) BEIRUT, Feb 19 (NNN-NNA) – Lebanon will not accept a maritime border demarcation plan that gives Lebanon an area less than 860 square km, in the disputed area with Israel, Lebanese Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, said yesterday. “We want to protect our interests in this area rich in natural gas, and the most important thing for Lebanon is, to start oil and gas exploration,” the minister was quoted as saying, by Lebanese al-Jadeed TV. Bou Habib said, the 860-square km-area offered by Line 23 is very important, as it achieves Lebanon's interests, while the Frederick Hoff line, previously suggested by the U.S. was rejected by Lebanese authorities, as it only gives Lebanon 490 square km in the disputed area. U.S. Envoy, Amos Hochstein, visited Lebanon earlier this month, to hold negotiations with Lebanese officials on border demarcation, but no final deal was made about the line that will be adopted in demarcation. “There was a verbal offer and not a written one, from the American mediator, but Hochstein's latest offer was more acceptable and positive, compared to previous demarcation suggestions,” Bou Habib said, adding that, negotiations are still going on. In 2020, Israel and Lebanon began U.S.-mediated negotiations, concerning their maritime border, but talks stalled when Lebanon expanded its demands, increasing the disputed area from 860 square km to 2,300 square km, which would include at least part of the Karish North field, initially claimed by Israel.– NNN-NNA

Bou Habib said, the 860-square km-area offered by Line 23 is very important, as it achieves Lebanon's interests, while the Frederick Hoff line, previously suggested by the U.S. was rejected by Lebanese authorities, as it only gives Lebanon 490 square km in the disputed area. U.S. Envoy, Amos Hochstein, visited Lebanon earlier this month, to hold negotiations with Lebanese officials on border demarcation, but no final deal was made about the line that will be adopted in demarcation. “There was a verbal offer and not a written one, from the American mediator, but Hochstein's latest offer was more acceptable and positive, compared to previous demarcation suggestions,” Bou Habib said, adding that, negotiations are still going on. In 2020, Israel and Lebanon began U.S.-mediated negotiations, concerning their maritime border, but talks stalled when Lebanon expanded its demands, increasing the disputed area from 860 square km to 2,300 square km, which would include at least part of the Karish North field, initially claimed by Israel.– NNN-NNA

News article:
In a televised Feb. 16 address, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah lauded the Lebanese terrorist group’s increasing military capabilities, with an emphasis on its missile and drone arsenals. Nasrallah boasted that Hezbollah had managed to convert many of its missiles into precision-guided armaments, despite Israel’s best efforts to prevent this. Due to the “threat of transporting precision missiles from Iran to Lebanon and in cooperation with our specialized technicians and experts and those of the Islamic Republic [Iran], we have developed the capability of converting our missiles, which number in the thousands, to precision-guided missiles. We started this process years ago, not now,” he said. The Hezbollah leader threatened that should Israel attempt to search for these missiles, it would face a second “Operation Ansariya,” alluding to the terror group’s deadly ambush in 1997 of an Israeli naval commando force near the village of Ansariya in southern Lebanon. Nasrallah also lauded Hezbollah’s drone production, saying, “We have been producing drones in Lebanon for a long time, and whoever wants to buy them, submit an order.” He also claimed that Hezbollah’s increased air-defense capabilities had led to a decrease in Israeli air operations over Lebanon. According to Hezbollah, reduced Israeli surveillance flights have forced Israel to recruit more agents in Lebanon to compensate. To demonstrate its capabilities, Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force recently launched a drone into northern Israel, which was shot down and landed intact in Israeli territory. In response, on Feb. 20, Hezbollah launched another drone, which Hezbollah claimed had penetrated some 43 miles into Israeli territory, hovering for 40 minutes and then safely returning to Lebanon. The drone was named “Hassan” after the founder of Hezbollah’s drone force, Hassan al-Laqqis. Hezbollah presented the incident as a “new slap in the face” to Israel, quoting Israeli officials who highlighted the “failure of the Israeli military and technological system to commandeer and shoot down the drone.” Hezbollah stressed that to cover for its “military failure,” Israeli jet fighters made a low-level flight over the skies of Beirut and the Hezbollah neighborhood of Dahiye. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories In accelerating the use of aircraft of all kinds, Nasrallah’s message is clear: Israel does not control the skies, and Hezbollah can violate Israeli sovereignty and sow fear and anxiety across Israel’s north. As Hezbollah’s aircraft improve, with close Iranian assistance, its air threat to Israel will increase. Nasrallah also claimed that last summer Hezbollah carried out its largest exercise since its establishment in 1982. The terror group also showed off on its Al Manar television its “alpinist unit,” conducting exercises on snowmobiles at an altitude of 4,500 feet. Nasrallah’s show of force comes against a backdrop of growing internal difficulties in Hezbollah due to the ongoing economic crisis in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s opponents accuse the organization of being Iran’s messenger boy and Nasrallah of personally representing the interests in Lebanon of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Nasrallah was recently forced to reiterate that “Hezbollah is Lebanese, from its top leadership to all its fighters, people and environment. Hezbollah’s decisions are Lebanese. It takes into consideration the interests of Lebanon and its people. It is a friend and ally to Iran, but this does not oblige it with any commitment. Hezbollah makes its (own) decisions… and Iran doesn’t impose its dictates. … Tell us of a single act that Hezbollah did for the sake of Iran rather than for the sake of Lebanon.” These protestations are greeted with contempt in Lebanon and beyond. Hezbollah’s willingness to be Iran’s cannon fodder in Syria and sacrifice over 2,000 fighters and thousands of wounded not for jihad against Israel but for Iranian strategic purposes betrays the reality: Nasrallah serves as Khamenei’s representative in Lebanon, for all intents and purposes. In a further attempt at pretense, Nasrallah claimed that should Israel attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, Hezbollah “will convene and decide how to respond and according to the circumstances.” Or in other words, that Hezbollah’s reaction will not be automatic and will reflect Lebanon’s national interests. The Hezbollah leader throws sand in observers’ eyes and plays with words. Two months ago, Nasrallah secretly visited Tehran, meeting with Khamenei and senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Quds Force to discuss options and responses in case Israel attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities, as well as coordination between Iran and Hezbollah in this scenario. Iran’s directives to Hezbollah in the event of such an attack are clear and brook no interpretation: launch long-range missiles at Tel Aviv and strategic targets deep inside Israel. Nasrallah, meanwhile, defiantly called on Jews to leave Israel and return to their home countries, adding mockingly that “we are ready to bear the cost of their tickets.” Hezbollah is in the thick of preparations for parliamentary elections in Lebanon this May. Hezbollah stresses that it seeks to hold the elections on time and rejects the possibility of delaying them. Hezbollah is concerned about the possibility of a decline in the electoral power of the National Patriotic Party, its ally in the Christian camp. The terror group appears to be working to strengthen its ties with the Christian camp and with its Shi’ite allies, led by Amal’s leader, Nabih Berry. At the same time, Hezbollah is stepping up its attacks on the United States and particularly on the involvement of the U.S. ambassador in Beirut in internal Lebanese politics. The U.S. embassy is accused of aiding and encouraging NGOs that work against Hezbollah, of involvement in Lebanon’s economy and of being the cause of Lebanon’s financial crisis. American military assistance, and in particular the American financial assistance to pay the salaries of Lebanese army soldiers and officers, do not lower the intensity of Hezbollah’s criticism. Ironically, the aid is welcome and most appreciated since it strengthens the Lebanese army, an ally of Hezbollah. IDF Brig. Gen. (ret.)

News article:
In one of his first official acts, President Joe Biden canceled the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which had been expected to carry upwards of 830,000 barrels of Canadian crude per day to the U.S. In the same month, Biden banned new oil and gas leases on public lands. One year later, the U.S. pulled support from a pipeline designed to bring natural gas from Israel and Cyprus across Greece to Italy and Bulgaria. Amos Hochstein, now Biden's senior advisor for energy security, was reported by The Jerusalem Post to have previously said he would be "extremely uncomfortable with the U.S. supporting" EastMed. "Why would we build a fossil fuel pipeline between the EastMed and Europe when our entire policy is to support new technology...and new investments in going green and in going clean?" Clean, green and more expensive, with security implications for European allies who will be increasingly reliant on unreliable Russian gas. But hey, it's for the environment. Unless... Hochstein was recently in Lebanon and Israel, trying to resolve a long-standing maritime border dispute to enable Lebanon to take part in the natural gas drilling and exploration revolution in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Yes, that would be the same Lebanon that is occupied by U.S.-designated terror organization and Iranian proxy Hezbollah, and which has built an enormous and increasingly powerful military force aimed expressly at Israel. Yes, that Lebanon. In an interview with Lebanese media released by the U.S. State Department, Hochstein never mentions Hezbollah. Hochstein: "We cannot allow Lebanon's electricity system to degrade any further than it already [has]. How can we tell Lebanese people to stay in Lebanon, to work toward Lebanon, that there's hope for a renewed economy and a [re]building, after so much despair? If you can't even have reliable electricity, we will just see a continued degradation of the economy and the energy system, which will lead to loss of hope. That leads to a failed state. We cannot allow that to happen." News for Hochstein: Lebanon is already a failed state. Hezbollah ransacked it and destroyed it. Electricity won't solve Lebanon's problems. Liberation might, but Hochstein isn't going there. And where will the gas come from? Hochstein: "In order to get the gas, you have to come through somewhere. Egypt has to go through somewhere. Israel is probably not the right place for it to come, and therefore Syria is the only option." This is a staggering thought in two ways. First, not Israel—well, that Hezbollah would 100 percent rather rule a "failed state" than take gas from Israel is a given. That the U.S. government agrees with Hezbollah about this is troublesome, to put it mildly. And THROUGH SYRIA? The U.S. will facilitate commerce through the criminal and sanctioned Assad regime, responsible for the deaths of an estimated half-million-plus people, including through the use of chemical weapons, rather than issue an ultimatum to Hezbollah—gas from Israel or no gas at all. Now, THAT is staggering. Hochstein: "There's no transaction with the Syrian regime. We do not believe in normalizing Assad...and this is in no way, shape or form a waiving of those sanctions or undermining them. This will allow Syria to keep some of the gas—a small percentage of the gas in Syria, for electricity for Syrian people, in exchange—as a payment for the tariff, for the gas to go through Syria." Cue laughter. What percentage, who will monitor it and how will Syria be penalized if/when it takes too much? As for EastMed? Hochstein: "I've always believed...countries deserve to have affordable and reliable sources of energy. ...By and large, I don't advocate for natural gas in almost any other place in the world, except when it's for immediate use now, not for legacy projects that will be forever." Translation: Gas for Hezbollah now because there are pipelines already in existence. New pipelines to reduce future European reliance on Russia? No. But... Hochstein: "With Russia threatening its neighbors with invasion, and with Russia under-supplying the European market because it wants it to have leverage over Europe through natural gas, sending prices soaring across Europe and wreaking havoc for people as they struggle to heat their homes in the middle of the winter—we need to make sure that there's enough natural gas and enough energy products for today's world, while not losing focus on the energy transition." Translation: Finishing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia? OK. Future allied-operated natural gas for European use? No. Hochstein: "The gas market in the Eastern Mediterranean all around [Lebanon] went from nothing to everything. The Zur discovery in Egypt, the discovery is in Israel, the infrastructure in Cyprus, in...Greece. The infrastructure in Turkey. All around you—in 10 years, [it] went from literally zero to transformational. Except in Lebanon. So, you're not losing by compromising. You're gaining." Translation: Get in on the action, Hezbollah. Europe, not so much. Israel, not with any help from us. Shoshana Bryen is senior director of the Jewish Policy Center and editor of inFOCUS Quarterly.

News article:
Defense Minister Benny Gantz threatened Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group on Wednesday, saying attempts to create an equation of response with Israel would result in a bill with “high interest.” “I suggest to [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah not to make accounts and equations with Israel.

His remarks — made from the Tel-Hai College near the Lebanon border — come after the Iran-backed terror group claimed responsibility for launching a small drone, apparently for reconnaissance, that entered Israel from Lebanon on Friday, and seemingly flummoxed Israeli attempts to intercept it. Apparently in response, two Israeli fighter jets flew from the Mediterranean Sea over the Lebanese capital before departing several minutes later.

During his address on Wednesday, Gantz also warned that if a controversial IDF draft bill does not pass two more Knesset readings, “there will be severe damage to our ability to counter the security challenges we face, and in the long run, Israel’s security superiority will be harmed.”

News article:
Lebanese President Michel Aoun has categorically dismissed as untrue the allegations that representatives from the Arab country have made concessions to Israel in the course of indirect US-mediated talks over their disputed maritime border to allow for offshore energy exploration. “The issue of [maritime] border demarcation is a matter of sovereignty par excellence. It is impossible for any shortcomings to occur. Line 29 was the starting point for the negotiations. If the talks arrive at satisfactory conclusions, a large part of Lebanon's problems will be resolved,” Aoun told Lebanon’s Arabic-language OTV television station on Tuesday evening. He highlighted that “all the statements about concessions made during indirect talks with Israel on the maritime border dispute are not true.” “Those making these claims are not aware of what happened in the course of the negotiations, which will safeguard Lebanon’s rights and natural wealth. It is what is important,” Aoun pointed out. Last week, the Hezbollah resistance movement warned Lebanese authorities of Washington’s attempts to woo Beirut into establishment of formal diplomatic relations with Israel during talks over their disputed maritime border. “In light of recent developments concerning maritime demarcation talks, indication is that American mediators are trying to impose a fait accompli in the hope that it would open up the window of normalization with Israel,” the Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc, the political wing of Hezbollah in the Lebanese parliament, said in a statement on February 17. “The national duty of the government requires it to urge relevant authorities to exercise increased vigilance in order to avoid hidden traps. Normalization with the Zionist regime is completely rejected and not acceptable under any pretext,” the statement pointed out. Lebanese politicians hope that commercially viable hydrocarbon resources off Lebanon’s coast could help lift the debt-ridden country out of its worst economic crisis in decades. In February 2018, Lebanon signed its first contract for drilling in two blocks in the Mediterranean with a consortium comprising energy giants Total, Eni and Novatek. Lebanon and Israel took part in indirect talks to discuss demarcation in 2020. But they stalled after Lebanon demanded a larger area, including part of the Karish gas field, where Israel has given exploration rights to a Greek firm. The talks were supposed to discuss a Lebanese demand for 860sq km (330 square miles) of territory in the disputed maritime area, according to a map sent to the United Nations in 2011. However, Lebanon then said the map was based on erroneous calculations and demanded 1,430 square kilometers (552 square miles) more further south, including part of Karish.

News article:
https://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/insight/ In one of his first official acts, President Joe Biden canceled the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which had been expected to carry upwards of 830,000 barrels of Canadian crude per day to the U.S. In the same month, Biden banned new oil and gas leases on public lands. One year later, the U.S. pulled support from a pipeline designed to bring natural gas from Israel and Cyprus across Greece to Italy and Bulgaria. Amos Hochstein, now Biden’s senior advisor for energy security, was reported by The Jerusalem Post to have previously said he would be “extremely uncomfortable with the U.S. supporting” EastMed. “Why would we build a fossil fuel pipeline between the EastMed and Europe when our entire policy is to support new technology…and new investments in going green and in going clean?” Clean, green and more expensive, with security implications for European allies who will be increasingly reliant on unreliable Russian gas. But hey, it’s for the environment. Unless… Hochstein was recently in Lebanon and Israel, trying to resolve a long-standing maritime border dispute to enable Lebanon to take part in the natural gas drilling and exploration revolution in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Yes, that would be the same Lebanon that is occupied by U.S.-designated terror organization and Iranian proxy Hezbollah, and which has built an enormous and increasingly powerful military force aimed expressly at Israel. Yes, that Lebanon. In an interview with Lebanese media released by the U.S. State Department, Hochstein never mentions Hezbollah. Hochstein : “We cannot allow Lebanon’s electricity system to degrade any further than it already [has]. How can we tell Lebanese people to stay in Lebanon, to work toward Lebanon, that there’s hope for a renewed economy and a [re]building, after so much despair? If you can’t even have reliable electricity, we will just see a continued degradation of the economy and the energy system, which will lead to loss of hope. That leads to a failed state. We cannot allow that to happen.” News for Hochstein: Lebanon is already a failed state. Hezbollah ransacked it and destroyed it. Electricity won’t solve Lebanon’s problems. Liberation might, but Hochstein isn’t going there. And where will the gas come from? Hochstein : “In order to get the gas, you have to come through somewhere. Egypt has to go through somewhere. Israel is probably not the right place for it to come, and therefore Syria is the only option.” Translation: This is a staggering thought in two ways. First, not Israel—well, that Hezbollah would 100 percent rather rule a “failed state” than take gas from Israel is a given. That the U.S. government agrees with Hezbollah about this is troublesome, to put it mildly. And THROUGH SYRIA? The U.S. will facilitate commerce through the criminal and sanctioned Assad regime, responsible for the deaths of an estimated half-million-plus people, including through the use of chemical weapons, rather than issue an ultimatum to Hezbollah—gas from Israel or no gas at all. Now, THAT is staggering. Hochstein : “There’s no transaction with the Syrian regime. We do not believe in normalizing Assad…and this is in no way, shape or form a waiving of those sanctions or undermining them. This will allow Syria to keep some of the gas—a small percentage of the gas in Syria, for electricity for Syrian people, in exchange—as a payment for the tariff, for the gas to go through Syria.” Cue laughter. What percentage, who will monitor it and how will Syria be penalized if/when it takes too much? As for EastMed? Hochstein : “I’ve always believed…countries deserve to have affordable and reliable sources of energy. …By and large, I don’t advocate for natural gas in almost any other place in the world, except when it’s for immediate use now, not for legacy projects that will be forever.” Translation: Gas for Hezbollah now because there are pipelines already in existence. New pipelines to reduce future European reliance on Russia? No. But… Hochstein : “With Russia threatening its neighbors with invasion, and with Russia under-supplying the European market because it wants it to have leverage over Europe through natural gas, sending prices soaring across Europe and wreaking havoc for people as they struggle to heat their homes in the middle of the winter—we need to make sure that there’s enough natural gas and enough energy products for today’s world, while not losing focus on the energy transition.” Translation: Finishing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia? OK. Future allied-operated natural gas for European use? No. Hochstein : “The gas market in the Eastern Mediterranean all around [Lebanon] went from nothing to everything. The Zur discovery in Egypt, the discovery is in Israel, the infrastructure in Cyprus, in…Greece. The infrastructure in Turkey. All around you—in 10 years, [it] went from literally zero to transformational. Except in Lebanon. So, you’re not losing by compromising. You’re gaining.” Translation: Get in on the action, Hezbollah. Europe, not so much. Israel? Not with any help from us.

Liberation might, but Hochstein isn’t going there. And where will the gas come from? Hochstein : “In order to get the gas, you have to come through somewhere. Egypt has to go through somewhere. Israel is probably not the right place for it to come, and therefore Syria is the only option.” Translation: This is a staggering thought in two ways. First, not Israel—well, that Hezbollah would 100 percent rather rule a “failed state” than take gas from Israel is a given. That the U.S. government agrees with Hezbollah about this is troublesome, to put it mildly. And THROUGH SYRIA? The U.S. will facilitate commerce through the criminal and sanctioned Assad regime, responsible for the deaths of an estimated half-million-plus people, including through the use of chemical weapons, rather than issue an ultimatum to Hezbollah—gas from Israel or no gas at all. Now, THAT is staggering. Hochstein : “There’s no transaction with the Syrian regime. We do not believe in normalizing Assad…and this is in no way, shape or form a waiving of those sanctions or undermining them. This will allow Syria to keep some of the gas—a small percentage of the gas in Syria, for electricity for Syrian people, in exchange—as a payment for the tariff, for the gas to go through Syria.” Cue laughter. What percentage, who will monitor it and how will Syria be penalized if/when it takes too much? As for EastMed? Hochstein : “I’ve always believed…countries deserve to have affordable and reliable sources of energy. …By and large, I don’t advocate for natural gas in almost any other place in the world, except when it’s for immediate use now, not for legacy projects that will be forever.” Translation: Gas for Hezbollah now because there are pipelines already in existence. New pipelines to reduce future European reliance on Russia? No. But… Hochstein : “With Russia threatening its neighbors with invasion, and with Russia under-supplying the European market because it wants it to have leverage over Europe through natural gas, sending prices soaring across Europe and wreaking havoc for people as they struggle to heat their homes in the middle of the winter—we need to make sure that there’s enough natural gas and enough energy products for today’s world, while not losing focus on the energy transition.” Translation: Finishing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia? OK. Future allied-operated natural gas for European use? No. Hochstein : “The gas market in the Eastern Mediterranean all around [Lebanon] went from nothing to everything. The Zur discovery in Egypt, the discovery is in Israel, the infrastructure in Cyprus, in…Greece. The infrastructure in Turkey. All around you—in 10 years, [it] went from literally zero to transformational. Except in Lebanon. So, you’re not losing by compromising. You’re gaining.” Translation: Get in on the action, Hezbollah. Europe, not so much. Israel? Not with any help from us.

News article:
Lebanese President Michel Aoun has denounced repeated Israeli violations of the Arab country’s sovereignty, calling on the United Nations to compel the Tel Aviv regime to implement Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 33-day Israeli military onslaught in 2006, and respect Lebanon's territorial integrity. During a meeting with the outgoing commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Major General Stefano Del Col, on Thursday, Aoun stressed that the Beirut government “is committed to maintaining calm and stability in southern Lebanon and implementing Resolution 1701.” He highlighted that Israeli violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty are condemned by all strata of the Lebanese society, stating that the UN should exert pressure on Israel to stop such violations. Aoun also underscored Lebanon’s full rights and sovereignty by land, sea and air, in accordance with the international law and treaties. For his part, Del Col praised the strong relations between UNIFIL forces and local authorities in southern Lebanon. He expressed hope that the UN Security Council would extend UNIFIL’s mandate for a period exceeding 6 months, which is stipulated in the previous relevant resolution. “I wish Lebanon a future without international security forces, where the Lebanese nation would live in peace,” Del Col said. Israel violates Lebanon's airspace and territorial waters on an almost daily basis, claiming the flights and incursions serve surveillance purposes. Lebanon’s government, Hezbollah and UNIFIL have repeatedly condemned Israel’s overflights, saying they are in clear violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the country’s sovereignty. Back on September 30 last year, fighters from Hezbollah intercepted and shot down an Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle while it was hovering over the southern part of Lebanon. Hezbollah said in a brief statement carried by Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Manar television network that it downed an Israeli drone that had entered the Lebanese skies with “appropriate weapons." The statement added that the Israeli aircraft was brought down as it was flying over Maryamin valley on the outskirts of the southern town of Yater.

Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has said that Hizbullah "has never been as strong as it is today." Nasrallah stated, in an interview with al-Manar TV, that "if Israel starts a war on Lebanon, then it will see all our strength.” The Israeli military had failed last week to intercept a drone that crossed its northern border. Hizbullah claimed responsibility and minutes later, two Israeli warplanes overflew Beirut and its suburbs at a very low altitude in a mock raid. "Israel is a temporary entity," Nasrallah said. "It will cease to exist," he added. Nasrallah stressed that "if you remain silent and surrender your weapons, you tell your opponent that you are crushed, humiliated and weak." "The enemy will not pity you, it will humiliate you even more," Nasrallah added. "Let them give us one example of peoples who resisted, surrendered their weapons, and kept their dignity," Nasrallah said. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib had headed to Kuwait last month to deliver Lebanon's answers to a paper of demands that had been delivered to Lebanon by the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister. Sheikh Ahmed al-Nasser said it was "a Kuwaiti, Gulf, Arab and international message" containing measures and ideas to build confidence again with Lebanon. The measures included Lebanon's commitment to U.N. resolutions related to Hizbullah's disarmament. Bou Habib made it clear, ahead of his departure to Kuwait, that Lebanon will not disarm Hizbullah.

News article:
Hezbollah supporters wave their group and Iranian flags during a protest on the Lebanese-Israeli border near the southern village of Kafr Kila, Lebanon, May 14, 2021. (AP) Beirut - Asharq Al-Awsat Supporters of the Hezbollah party in Lebanon have increased their threats against opponents through social media ahead of the May parliamentary elections. The latest threat was against Lebanese University professor Bassel Saleh. Threats are often made ahead of elections, but this year they take on a new edge given that the polls are taking place after the 2019 popular revolt against Lebanon's ruling class. Civil society groups that have emerged from the protests are working hard to run in the elections, with hopes pinned that they would achieve a breakthrough given the support they have from the people. Saleh, a native of Kfar Shouba in the South - a Hezbollah stronghold, revealed that he received a death threat through social media from a party loyalist after he had criticized the party in wake of Israeli jets flying over Lebanon in recent days. He said Hezbollah supporters were "arrogant" for boasting that they did not fear the jets. Saleh wrote on social media: "Aren't [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah and his party ruling us so that Israeli jets could stop violating our airspace?" He added that he didn't understand the "arrogance that comes with those who boast of excessive force and not fearing death". He also cited the detention of a "militiaman in Chouya" for launching a rocket towards Israel last summer. The man, a Hezbollah member, was riding a rocket launcher in the southern region of Chouya. He was held by a number of local residents after he launched the projectile. Soon after making his posts, Saleh revealed that he received a direct threat against his life, with the aggressor even knowing where he worked. He said the Hezbollah supporter was defying the law and security agencies, while his followers cheered him on. "These are a group of people, who claim patriotism and purity, according to their standards alone, while accusing those who oppose them of treason and that they should be taken out," said Saleh. He urged the security agencies and international powers monitoring Lebanon to make note of the threat. "We are waging a direct conflict with an alliance of militias and mafias. We are at the mercy of theft, deception and the violation of all rights," he continued. He told Asharq Al-Awsat that he was following up on the legal proceedings after he had filed a complaint over the threat. Saleh tied the threat to the upcoming elections and his activism along with others in the South. He said the supporters were primarily "irked by his criticism of the alleged invincible fighter, whose image the party has been building for the past 35 years, and whom he described as a militiaman." Moreover, he remarked that Hezbollah will be wary of the electoral battle in the South. He said the party was able to terrorize the southerners who took to the street in 2019 and it will make sure that the dissidents' voices are not heard at the ballot boxes. Saleh predicted that the party will intensify its campaign against its opponents as the elections draw near. He cited the assassination of Shiite dissident Lokman Slim in 2021 as evidence of how far the party will go to silence opponents. He also recalled the intimidation against Shiite activists ahead of the 2018 elections. Journalist Ali al-Amine, who was running for a seat in the South, was even assaulted. Researcher and professor Mona Fayyad said Hezbollah's threats against opponents will only intensify ahead of the elections, not ruling out the possibility of it resorting to assassinations. She told Asharq Al-Awsat that the party is being defensive, adding that the it will use the elections to reap more seats in parliament and prove that its popularity has not waned in spite of the evident rising voices of dissent among its Shiite community. The party's real image had been exposed, she continued, especially after Israeli gas will be pumped to Lebanon and after the authorities signaled that they were prepared to relinquish some territory for Israel in the maritime border negotiations. The people view this all as an act of treason, so the party will react in self-defense, she warned.

News article:
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. — AFP/File BERLIN: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that he believed reviving the Iran nuclear deal was still possible after "modest progress" in talks, after meeting with European allies in Berlin. "My own assessment, talking to all of our colleagues, is that returning to mutual compliance, it remains possible," Blinken told reporters. "We've seen, I would say, some modest progress in the last couple of weeks in the talks" in Vienna, he added. Speaking at a joint news conference, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that "urgent progress" was needed in talks aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. "The window for finding a solution is closing," she said. "The negotiations are in a decisive phase. We need urgent, urgent progress, otherwise we will not be successful in reaching a joint accord." Blinken agreed it was a "decisive moment" in the negotiations, adding "time is running out" to reach a deal. Their comments came a day after US President Joe Biden said it was "not time to give up" on the talks with Iran, insisting "there is some progress being made". Talks to restore the accord between Tehran and world powers — the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China, and Germany — began last year but stopped in June as Iran elected ultraconservative President Ebrahim Raisi. The talks on the accord known as the JCPOA resumed in November. Blinken said last week that there were only "a few weeks left" to save the deal, and the US was ready to look at "other options" if the talks fail. The deal offered Iran much-needed relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy, in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. Then-US president Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal from the deal in 2018 prompted Tehran to go back on its commitments. Tehran is seeking verification of the sanctions easing, as well as guarantees that Washington will not withdraw from the deal again. Baerbock said progress was being hobbled by the fact that "Iran, parallel to the talks, unfortunately continues to turn the spiral of nuclear escalation". Western powers have complained about slow process in the talks at a time when Iran has accelerated its nuclear work, for example increasing uranium enrichment. The West wants Iran to meet a number of requirements including destroying its advanced centrifuges.

News article:
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that talks with Iran over its nuclear program are at a "decisive moment," and warned that Washington and its allies may change tactics if a deal isn't reached in the coming weeks. Blinken said that the longer Iran fails to comply with the 2015 Vienna accord — intended to rein in Tehran's nuclear program — the closer it would get to being able to build an atomic weapon. "We are indeed at a decisive moment," Blinken told reporters in Berlin after meeting senior diplomats from Germany, France and Britain. He added that he believed modest progress had been made during the ongoing round of talks in the Austrian capital. "But we are not where we need to be. And if we don't get there very soon, we will have to take a different course," he said. The U.S. withdrew from the Vienna accord under President Donald Trump and reinstated economics sanctions on Tehran. Iran responded by increasing the purity of uranium it enriches and its stockpiles, in breach of the accord. President Joe Biden has signaled that he wants to rejoin the deal. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, whose country remains part of the accord known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action along with France, Britain, China and Russia, echoed Blinken's words. "Our objective is to maintain and to preserve the agreement and above all, to make Iran see sense and to ensure that Iran can no further increase its enrichment capacity," she said. Baerbock indicated that European nations had sought to ensure China and Russia also maintain pressure on Tehran. Both countries have in recent days spoken of new trade and economic cooperation agreements with Iran, which some fear could undermine efforts to get Tehran to make concessions at the Vienna talks. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian agreed that progress is needed urgently. "It's been almost two months since the negotiations resumed in Vienna," he said in a statement. He acknowledged that some progress has been made, but that "negotiations cannot continue at such a slow pace while in parallel the Iranian nuclear program is advancing so quickly." "We will very quickly find ourselves in an untenable situation," Le Drian said.

News article:
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that talks with Iran over its nuclear program are at a "decisive moment," and warned that Washington and its allies may change tactics if a deal isn't reached in the coming weeks. Blinken said that the longer Iran fails to comply with the 2015 Vienna accord — intended to rein in Tehran's nuclear program — the closer it would get to being able to build an atomic weapon. "We are indeed at a decisive moment," Blinken told reporters in Berlin after meeting senior diplomats from Germany, France and Britain. He added that he believed modest progress had been made during the ongoing round of talks in the Austrian capital. "But we are not where we need to be. And if we don't get there very soon, we will have to take a different course," he said. The U.S. withdrew from the Vienna accord under President Donald Trump and reinstated economics sanctions on Tehran. Iran responded by increasing the purity of uranium it enriches and its stockpiles, in breach of the accord. President Joe Biden has signaled that he wants to rejoin the deal. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, whose country remains part of the accord known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action along with France, Britain, China and Russia, echoed Blinken's words. "Our objective is to maintain and to preserve the agreement and above all, to make Iran see sense and to ensure that Iran can no further increase its enrichment capacity," she said. Baerbock indicated that European nations had sought to ensure China and Russia also maintain pressure on Tehran. Both countries have in recent days spoken of new trade and economic cooperation agreements with Iran, which some fear could undermine efforts to get Tehran to make concessions at the Vienna talks. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian agreed that progress is needed urgently. "It's been almost two months since the negotiations resumed in Vienna," he said in a statement. He acknowledged that some progress has been made, but that "negotiations cannot continue at such a slow pace while in parallel the Iranian nuclear program is advancing so quickly." "We will very quickly find ourselves in an untenable situation," Le Drian said.

News article:
Iran said Monday that differences with the United States remain over the issues of lifting sanctions and obtaining guarantees in Vienna talks aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. "Important and significant issues remain regarding the removal of sanctions that have not made an agreement possible so far," foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said at a news conference. He reiterated calls for guarantees that the US will not withdraw from the 2015 deal, which was derailed in 2018 when the administration of then-president Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out of the pact. Khatibzadeh's remarks came as the eighth round of negations to restore the agreement -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- has been on pause since Friday, with the negotiators returning to their capitals for consultations. The European Union's coordinator for the talks, Enrique Mora, said at the time that "political decisions" are required to break the deadlock, and that talks are expected to resume this week. The drive to salvage the nuclear deal resumed in late November, after talks were suspended in June as Iran elected ultraconservative President Ebrahim Raisi. The deal -- agreed by Iran, the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- offered Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. But the US reimposed severe economic sanctions after the 2018 withdrawal, prompting Tehran to begin rolling back on its commitments under the deal. Khatibzadeh nonetheless noted "very significant progress" over the previous three weeks in negotiations over the lifting of sanctions and nuclear commitments, as well as obtaining guarantees. "We suggest that after returning from their capitals, (other parties) come with necessary decisions so that we can conclude quickly what has been prepared in drafts," he said. "The other parties know the differences clearly. They need to make political decisions, especially in Washington," he added. "We await political decisions by Washington upon the return of the US delegation." The US has participated only indirectly in the talks, which seek to bring Washington back to the accord and to ensure Iran returns to its commitments under the deal. "We can reach a lasting, reliable and good agreement the day after the return of the negotiators to Vienna" if the other parties make the "right" political decisions, he added.

News article:
President Biden is reaching a make or break moment in his pursuit of reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. One year into the Biden administration, officials say that only a few weeks remain to save the agreement before Iran advances its nuclear capabilities beyond reversal, raising fears it will build a weapon of mass destruction. A senior State Department official told reporters on a call Monday that the U.S. and Iran only have “a handful of weeks left to get a deal.” “We are in the final stretch,” the official said. “This can’t go on forever because of Iran’s nuclear advances.” The White House has said it is committed to diplomacy to revive the agreement, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but is “preparing alternative options,” in particular with Israel, should the talks collapse. But experts and analysts are encouraged that an initial agreement is forming among the parties as the eighth round of talks in Vienna concluded over the weekend and officials are back in their respective capitals to discuss concrete decisions on moving forward. “Now is the time for political decisions,” the official said. “Now is the time for Iran to decide whether it’s prepared to make those decisions necessary for a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA.” Iranian officials have raised the possibility of engaging directly with the U.S. after nearly a year of European, Russian and Chinese diplomats shuttling between the two sides as negotiating intermediaries. The senior official suggested Monday that direct talks could accelerate an agreement, though stressed that a deal is not guaranteed. Critics are likely to sharpen their opposition as the U.S. and Iran move closer to reviving the JCPOA. They argue the pathway to an agreement — relieving sanctions and allowing Iran to access to international markets — will only serve to enrich their ballistic missile program and support for terrorist proxies throughout the region. Two top officials on the U.S. negotiating team have stepped down — deputy special envoy for Iran Richard Nephew and Ariane Tabatabai, a senior adviser in the State Department arms control bureau — reportedly over concerns that special envoy for Iran Rob Malley’s team is being too dovish on sanctions relief with Iran. The State Department has said that Nephew is moving to another job in the agency and the official on Monday said that while it’s a “regret” that he is moving on, it’s not unusual and that the policy of the administration remains tightly focused on returning to the JCPOA. “It’s not a matter of personal differences. It’s a matter of policy that the administration has settled on and that everyone serving the administration is pursuing,” the official said. The Biden administration argues that the JCPOA is the best chance to immediately impose strict limits on Iran’s nuclear activity and open it up to intrusive international monitoring. “We still believe that if we can get back in the weeks ahead — not months ahead, weeks ahead — to the JCPOA, the nuclear agreement, that would be the best thing for our security and the security of our allies and partners in the region,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NPR earlier this month, adding, “The runway is very short.” Amid the time crunch, administration officials and experts appear cautiously optimistic about the prospect of a deal. “After months of uncertainty, of delay — a path over returning to the deal is coming into view,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace where she is an expert on diplomacy with Iran. “Wide gaps on key issues, particularly assurances on sanctions relief and sequencing remain, but there appears now to be a focused effort to bridge those gaps through creative diplomacy,” she said. Dennis Ross, a former special assistant to President Obama and expert in Middle East policy, said that the Iranians have signaled in public comments that they are more interested in coming to an agreement than they were in the previous year. “Being ready to do a deal is not the same as being anxious to do it,” Ross added. “Do they feel sufficient pressure to get sanctions lifted enough to do a deal?” Participants to the Vienna talks are working to finalize an “outcome document,” Russia’s lead negotiator, Mikhail Ulyanov, tweeted last week — a sign that concrete agreements on some issues are being put in writing. Iran’s foreign minister has also indicated Tehran is open to engaging in direct talks with the U.S. in Vienna. The negotiators in Vienna have so far managed to isolate themselves from broader geopolitical tensions playing out — between the U.S., Europe and Russia over threats to Ukraine; poor relations between the U.S. and China over the battle for global supremacy; and closer ties between Moscow and China in opposition to the U.S. and its western allies. Still, there is a threat that ties between Iran, China and Russia may grow stronger as tensions with the U.S. and Europe further pull the world apart. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has made economic recovery a pillar of his administration, and looked to strengthen Tehran’s relations with China and Russia to realize that. Raisi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 19 and China is importing Iranian oil despite sanctions from the U.S. DiMaggio says that these closer relations are still reliant on sanctions relief, which can strengthen the hand of the U.S. in the Vienna talks, but that the diplomatic balance is delicate. “Any shift in Iran’s currently depressed commercial relations with these countries, hinges on the lifting of U.S. extraterritorial sanctions, so this is a very key incentive for the Iranians to revive the deal,” she said. If the talks fail, one of the contingency options is strengthening sanctions, and that include targeting more forcefully China’s imports of Iranian oil. But DiMaggio says that these options don’t address the most troubling issue, Iran’s buildup of its nuclear capabilities. “For the Biden team, versions of potential plan B are being contemplated, and they are naturally more coercive in scope and they include a range of more economic pressure, but the problem is there’s no evidence to suggest that such approaches would produce a different result,” she said. “In fact, Iran’s nuclear program is more advanced today than it’s ever been, even in the face of ‘maximum pressure,’ ” she continued, referring to the campaign name used by the Trump administration to impose an estimated 1,500 sanctions on Iran to force it to negotiate a better deal that never materialized. Any alternative plan for the Biden administration is likely to be tightly coordinated with the Europeans, said Naysan Rafati, senior analyst on Iran with the International Crisis Group. “There’s virtually no daylight between the E3 and U.S. position, and if we get to a point where we come to a judgment where the existing framework doesn’t work, I think the odds are that whatever the Europeans do, and whatever the Americans are going to do, are going to be fairly, tightly coordinated,” Rafati said. As the Vienna talks progress, Republican critics of a potential nuclear deal could use any breakthrough of an agreement as fodder to criticize Biden and Democrats leading up to the midterm elections. Republicans and even some Democrats were opposed to the 2015 deal brokered by the Obama administration, which they argued was insufficient in curtailing Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2018 in a break with European allies. The senior State Department official said Monday that Iran is “weeks, not months” away before it has enough fissile material to make a nuclear bomb. “It doesn’t mean they’ve given up their nuclear weapon option, it means they are closer to where they would have been and they’re agreeing to effectively put it on hold until 2030,” Ross said of a renewed agreement. “If you don’t stop their current advance, you are left with nothing short of use of force.”

The Biden administration argues that the JCPOA is the best chance to immediately impose strict limits on Iran’s nuclear activity and open it up to intrusive international monitoring. “We still believe that if we can get back in the weeks ahead — not months ahead, weeks ahead — to the JCPOA, the nuclear agreement, that would be the best thing for our security and the security of our allies and partners in the region,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NPR earlier this month, adding, “The runway is very short.” Amid the time crunch, administration officials and experts appear cautiously optimistic about the prospect of a deal. “After months of uncertainty, of delay — a path over returning to the deal is coming into view,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace where she is an expert on diplomacy with Iran. “Wide gaps on key issues, particularly assurances on sanctions relief and sequencing remain, but there appears now to be a focused effort to bridge those gaps through creative diplomacy,” she said. Dennis Ross, a former special assistant to President Obama and expert in Middle East policy, said that the Iranians have signaled in public comments that they are more interested in coming to an agreement than they were in the previous year. “Being ready to do a deal is not the same as being anxious to do it,” Ross added. “Do they feel sufficient pressure to get sanctions lifted enough to do a deal?” Participants to the Vienna talks are working to finalize an “outcome document,” Russia’s lead negotiator, Mikhail Ulyanov, tweeted last week — a sign that concrete agreements on some issues are being put in writing. Iran’s foreign minister has also indicated Tehran is open to engaging in direct talks with the U.S. in Vienna. The negotiators in Vienna have so far managed to isolate themselves from broader geopolitical tensions playing out — between the U.S., Europe and Russia over threats to Ukraine; poor relations between the U.S. and China over the battle for global supremacy; and closer ties between Moscow and China in opposition to the U.S. and its western allies. Still, there is a threat that ties between Iran, China and Russia may grow stronger as tensions with the U.S. and Europe further pull the world apart. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has made economic recovery a pillar of his administration, and looked to strengthen Tehran’s relations with China and Russia to realize that. Raisi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 19 and China is importing Iranian oil despite sanctions from the U.S. DiMaggio says that these closer relations are still reliant on sanctions relief, which can strengthen the hand of the U.S. in the Vienna talks, but that the diplomatic balance is delicate. “Any shift in Iran’s currently depressed commercial relations with these countries, hinges on the lifting of U.S. extraterritorial sanctions, so this is a very key incentive for the Iranians to revive the deal,” she said. If the talks fail, one of the contingency options is strengthening sanctions, and that include targeting more forcefully China’s imports of Iranian oil. But DiMaggio says that these options don’t address the most troubling issue, Iran’s buildup of its nuclear capabilities. “For the Biden team, versions of potential plan B are being contemplated, and they are naturally more coercive in scope and they include a range of more economic pressure, but the problem is there’s no evidence to suggest that such approaches would produce a different result,” she said. “In fact, Iran’s nuclear program is more advanced today than it’s ever been, even in the face of ‘maximum pressure,’ ” she continued, referring to the campaign name used by the Trump administration to impose an estimated 1,500 sanctions on Iran to force it to negotiate a better deal that never materialized. Any alternative plan for the Biden administration is likely to be tightly coordinated with the Europeans, said Naysan Rafati, senior analyst on Iran with the International Crisis Group. “There’s virtually no daylight between the E3 and U.S. position, and if we get to a point where we come to a judgment where the existing framework doesn’t work, I think the odds are that whatever the Europeans do, and whatever the Americans are going to do, are going to be fairly, tightly coordinated,” Rafati said. As the Vienna talks progress, Republican critics of a potential nuclear deal could use any breakthrough of an agreement as fodder to criticize Biden and Democrats leading up to the midterm elections. Republicans and even some Democrats were opposed to the 2015 deal brokered by the Obama administration, which they argued was insufficient in curtailing Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2018 in a break with European allies. The senior State Department official said Monday that Iran is “weeks, not months” away before it has enough fissile material to make a nuclear bomb. “It doesn’t mean they’ve given up their nuclear weapon option, it means they are closer to where they would have been and they’re agreeing to effectively put it on hold until 2030,” Ross said of a renewed agreement. “If you don’t stop their current advance, you are left with nothing short of use of force.”

TEHRAN, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian on Thursday called for a "stable and reliable" nuclear agreement in the ongoing Vienna talks, which aimed at resolving disputes between the Islamic republic and the western countries over the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal. "Iran is ready to reach a good, stable and reliable agreement" in the talks underway in Vienna, Amir Abdollahian made the remarks in a telephone conversation with his Japanese counterpart Yoshimasa Hayashi, according to Iranian Foreign Ministry's website. The Japanese top diplomat expressed his country's support for the Vienna talks, stressing the need for serious action by all parties to live up to their commitments and seize the current opportunity to reach an agreement. Amir Abdollahian thanked Japan for its support and readiness to help advance the Vienna talks. The Vienna talks, which began last year to restore the nuclear pact following the withdrawal of the United States in 2018, have now reached a crucial stage for political decisions of the parties involved, according to analysts. ■

News article:
The Biden administration reportedly believes that a revival of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran would no longer achieve the key condition of keeping Tehran one year away from amassing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb. US officials told The Wall Street Journal Thursday that Iran’s so-called breakout time would be significantly less than a year due to the advancements it has made in its nuclear program since former US president Donald Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018. The exact length of the breakout time will depend on the manner in which Iran agrees to return to compliance with the deal, be it by dismantling its stockpiles of enriched uranium and relevant pieces of equipment, destroying them or shipping them abroad. However, enough nuclear material for a bomb is not the same as having the capabilities to build the core of the weapon and to attach it to the warhead of a missile, which Iran is not believed to possess and would likely take many more months to achieve. Despite the JCPOA’s more limited impact, US negotiators are still committed to returning to the deal, guided by the belief that some restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program are better than none at all.

However, some administration officials warn that if the breakout time is less than six months, it will be much more difficult for the US to respond to a rapid acceleration of Iran’s nuclear program, The Wall Street Journal reported. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the US breakout assessments reported by the Journal, but said that a revived agreement “would address our urgent nonproliferation concerns.” “As we have said, we have only a few weeks to conclude an understanding, after which the pace of Iran’s nuclear advances will make return to the JCPOA impossible,” the spokesperson said. Advertisement The latest round of talks in Vienna to salvage the JCPOA were put on pause last week, with the European Union’s coordinator calling for “political decisions” to break the deadlock.

TEHRAN, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian top security official on Sunday underlined cautious optimism about the progress in the Vienna talks on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, calling for a "balance" in the parties' commitments. "Despite the limited progress in the Vienna talks, we are still far from achieving the necessary balance in the commitments of the parties," Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani tweeted. "Political decisions in Washington are requirements for balance of commitments to reach a good agreement," he noted. Iran and world powers signed a nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in July 2015. However, former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the agreement in May 2018 and reimposed unilateral sanctions on Iran. Since April 2021, eight rounds of talks have been held in the Austrian capital between Iran and the remaining JCPOA parties to revive the pact. The U.S. government announced on Friday that it was waiving sanctions on Iran's civilian nuclear program, which allows international nuclear cooperation projects. ■

Iran's top security official said Sunday that Washington and Tehran had so far failed to produce "balance" in their commitments during the Vienna talks aimed at restoring the nuclear deal. "Despite limited progress in the #ViennaTalks, we are still far from achieving the necessary balance in the commitments of the parties," Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Shamkhani said in a Twitter post. "Political decisions in #Washington are requirements for balance of commitments to reach a good agreement." Iran is engaged in negotiations with Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia directly and with the United States indirectly to revive the 2015 deal formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. After months of stalemate, progress has been made in recent weeks to revive the agreement that was supposed to prevent Iran from acquiring an atomic bomb, a goal it has always denied pursuing. Former U.S. president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the pact in 2018 and reimposed tough economic sanctions on Iran, prompting the Islamic republic to begin pulling back from its commitments under the deal. Talks on reviving the agreement were halted last week and the negotiators returned to their capitals for consultations. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, in a phone call with Iran's foreign minister on Saturday, said he expected all parties to come to Vienna with a clear agenda to reach an agreement and be ready to make political decisions. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in the call that "positive developments have taken place since the previous talks, but they still do not meet our expectations. "We are determinedly seeking a good deal, but at the same time we are focusing on preserving our red lines and national interests." The U.S. State Department on Friday said it was waiving sanctions on Iran's civil nuclear program in a technical step necessary to return to the JCPOA. The waiver allows other countries and companies to participate in Iran's civil nuclear program without triggering U.S. sanctions on them, in the name of promoting safety and non-proliferation. "What happens on paper is good but not enough," Amir-Abdollahian said on Saturday, adding that "we seek and demand guarantees in the political, legal and economic sectors."

The United States said on Monday a deal was possible with Iran on its nuclear program but needs to be completed urgently, AFP reported. "A deal that addresses all sides' core concerns is in sight, but if it is not reached in the coming weeks, Iran's ongoing nuclear advances will make it impossible for us to return to the JCPOA," a US State Department spokesperson said, referring to the 2015 framework agreement. The statement comes as indirect talks between the US and Iran in Vienna are set to resume. Iran has gradually scaled back its compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal it signed with world powers in response to former US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement in May of 2018. However, it has held several rounds of indirect talks with the US on reviving the deal. The talks are being mediated by the remaining five countries that are party to the deal. Negotiators from the three European countries involved in the negotiations recently said the talks are reaching their final stage and now require political input. Last week, a senior US State Department official said that the nuclear talks are entering the "final stretch". The official added that all sides will have to make “tough political decisions”. On Sunday, Iran's top security official said that Washington and Tehran had so far failed to produce "balance" in their commitments during the Vienna talks. "Despite limited progress in the Vienna Talks, we are still far from achieving the necessary balance in the commitments of the parties," Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Shamkhani said in a Twitter post. "Political decisions in Washington are requirements for balance of commitments to reach a good agreement," he added.

News article:
Iran on Monday said talks with world powers in Vienna to restore the 2015 nuclear deal are “complicated and difficult” but have not hit an impasse. Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh acknowledged during a news conference in Tehran that key issues are still under discussion. But, he said, the very fact of its staying in the nuclear deal, despite the US pullout in 2018, was a political decision on Iran’s part. While claiming to remain in the deal, Tehran has significantly scaled back its commitments under the agreement, known as the JCPOA. “The negotiations are complicated and difficult as they have reached key issues that need serious political decisions especially by Washington,” Khatibzadeh said. But “there is no impasse in Vienna.” “If the US and European parties show real determination,” an agreement can be reached very soon, he said. “We need objective guarantees to make sure the US does not leave the agreement once again and that it honors its commitments.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The goals of the negotiations are to have the US return to the deal by lifting its anti-Iran sanctions and to have Iran return to full compliance with its commitments under the agreement. “All JCPOA sanctions with any labels must be lifted at the same time,” Khatibzadeh said. His remarks came after Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, accused Western countries at the talks of only pretending to be interested in a resolution in order to avoid agreeing to any obligations. Advertisement “The work of Iranian negotiators towards progress is becoming more difficult every moment… while Western parties ‘pretend’ to come up with initiatives to avoid their commitments,” he tweeted, according to a Reuters translation of his remarks. Shamkhani was commenting on his phone call with chief Iranian negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani, which, he said, also left him with the impression that Iran’s delegates at the talks were facing increasing difficulty in acting on instructions from Tehran. Meanwhile, Russian envoy to the talks Mikhail Ulyanov tweeted that “significant progress has been made in the course of negotiations” on Sunday. #JCPOA participants (without #Iran) and the #US met this afternoon to assess the situation at the #ViennaTalks on JCPOA.

Advertisement The subject has been somewhat on mute in Washington after 10 months of indirect talks failed to achieve the breakthrough Biden hoped for in reviving the 2015 deal repudiated by his predecessor Donald Trump. Trump pulled the US out of the deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration, in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Iran is demanding those sanctions be lifted before it recommits to some terms of the deal that it breached in response to the US exit, including its increased enrichment of uranium. The US is indirectly participating in the talks between the JCPOA’s remaining signatories, Iran, the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China. Supporters and opponents of the agreement have been making their voices heard in Washington in recent days, and US negotiator Rob Malley gave a closed-door briefing to the Senate on Wednesday. “Sobering and shocking,” was the summary provided by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy after the briefing confirmed what experts have been saying — that Iran could be just weeks away from having enough fissile material to make an atomic weapon. This is known as “breakout time” and even if several other steps are required to actually build a bomb, it is a crucial phase. Murphy, like most Democrats, supports the Biden administration’s attempts to revive the JCPOA and believes Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran was counterproductive. Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is among the Democrats who are more skeptical. “I think we’re at a critical moment, a serious moment and we’ll see which way it turns,” Menendez told AFP after the briefing. “But I certainly walked away with a sense of the difficulties of the moment we are in.” Advertisement Earlier this month, Menendez warned the White House against reviving the agreement as it is. “At this point, we seriously have to ask what exactly are we trying to salvage?” he said. Supporters of a negotiated solution warn that if Iran becomes a nuclear threshold state, that could spark a military confrontation with Israel or the United States conducting preemptive strikes on Iran. Israel, which opposes the nuclear deal, has repeatedly said it reserves the right to strike Iran if it is facing an existential nuclear threat, whether or not the JCPOA is revived.

News article:
(MENAFN- Trend News Agency) TEHRAN, Iran, Feb. 15 Trend : Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdolahian and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell had a phone call discussing the Vienna talks, Trend reports citing IRNA. During the phone call, Josep Borrell said it is necessary for all parties to help the talks move forward by showing flexibility, taking into account each other's capabilities and constraints. Hossein Amirabdolahian also said that the lack of serious will by other parties to reach a good and reliable agreement in Vienna has led to the unnecessary prolongation of Vienna talks. Both sides agreed to continue close consultations to move forward with the Vienna Talks. They also assessed the negotiations process as positive overall. In January 2016, JCPOA was launched between Iran and the P5+1 group (US, Russia, China, UK, France, and Germany) in connection with Iran's nuclear program. In May 2018, the US announced its withdrawal from the deal and imposed sanctions on Iran in November of the same year. To preserve the agreements reached as part of the JCPOA, the European signatories of the deal started in January 2019 that a financial mechanism for maintaining trade with Iran called INSTEX was formed. On May 8, 2019, Iran announced that it had ceased fulfilling its commitments regarding the sale of over 300 kilograms of uranium, as stated in the deal, basing its decision on the other signatories that have not fulfilled their obligations. On July 7, Iran announced that it will not be fulfilling its commitments regarding the enrichment of uranium at 3.67 percent and the reconstruction of the Arak Heavy Water Reactor Facility as stated in the deal. Iran announced that it will enrich uranium using next-generation centrifuges and will not mix it with the enriched uranium residues as part of the third step of reducing commitments in JCPOA on Sept.5. On Nov. 5, 2019, Iran announced that it took the fourth step in connection with reducing its commitments to the nuclear agreement. So, uranium gas is being pumped to the centrifuges at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. On Jan.2020, Iran took the last fifth step in reducing the number of its commitments within JCPOA. As reported, in late 2020, the Iranian parliament has decided to implement a strategic plan to tackle the sanctions, citing the non-implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) signed between Iran and six countries and the imposition of sanctions on Iran. According to the decision of the Iranian parliament, as of February 23, Iran suspended the implementation of additional steps and an additional protocol provided for in the nuclear deal. The US imposed new sanctions on Iran in November 2018. Over the past period, the sanctions affected Iranian oil exports, more than 700 banks, companies, and individuals.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says the Vienna talks are nearing a critical stage and that progress has been made in the process thanks to Tehran’s logical approach and initiative. During a telephone conversation with his British counterpart Liz Truss, Amir-Abdollahian called on the other participants to act earnestly and responsibly in order to reach the desired results at the talks. He stressed the need for reaching a consensus among all negotiating parties on a single text that would take into account the legitimate demands of the Islamic Republic. The eighth round of talks between Iran and the P4+1 group of countries resumed in the Austrian capital last Tuesday after a 10-day break. The two sides have bridged some gaps, but differences remain. The talks aim to bring the US back into full compliance with the 2015 Iran deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), almost four years after it unilaterally left the deal and took hostile measures – including the “toughest ever” sanctions – against Iran to destroy it. During the talks, Tehran has said it is committed to negotiating a “lasting, reliable agreement” in the shortest time possible, but insists that it will not be bound by “artificial deadlines.” Elsewhere during their phone conversation, Amir-Abdollahian and Truss also exchanged views on the current state of bilateral relations. The Iranian foreign minister evaluated the trend of ties between Tehran and London as “positive”. Referring to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Yemen, he voiced hope that Britain would fulfill its responsibilities to end the catastrophe caused by the ongoing aggression against the impoverished country. Amir-Abdollahian further explained Iran’s principled position on Afghanistan and stressed the formation of an inclusive government in the Central Asian state and swift assistance to its people by the international community. UK debt to Iran The British foreign secretary, for her part, said that the growing relations between the UK and Iran serve the interests of both countries. She also expressed hope that Britain would be able to pay its debt to Iran in the near future. The UK’s debt to Iran is estimated to be as much as £400 million ($542 million), arising from the non-delivery of tanks ordered by Iran’s ousted monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Additionally, Truss pointed to cooperation between London and the United Nations to help the Afghans, praising Iran’s effective role in this regard. She further offered condolences over the passing of Iran’s Ambassador to Sana’a Hassan Irloo. The envoy died in December 2021 of the COVID-19 complications after some Saudi officials delayed his return home for medical treatment.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says the Vienna talks are nearing a critical stage and that progress has been made in the process thanks to Tehran’s logical approach and initiative. During a telephone conversation with his British counterpart Liz Truss, Amir-Abdollahian called on the other participants to act earnestly and responsibly in order to reach the desired results at the talks. He stressed the need for reaching a consensus among all negotiating parties on a single text that would take into account the legitimate demands of the Islamic Republic. The eighth round of talks between Iran and the P4+1 group of countries resumed in the Austrian capital last Tuesday after a 10-day break. The two sides have bridged some gaps, but differences remain. The talks aim to bring the US back into full compliance with the 2015 Iran deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), almost four years after it unilaterally left the deal and took hostile measures – including the “toughest ever” sanctions – against Iran to destroy it. During the talks, Tehran has said it is committed to negotiating a “lasting, reliable agreement” in the shortest time possible, but insists that it will not be bound by “artificial deadlines.” Elsewhere during their phone conversation, Amir-Abdollahian and Truss also exchanged views on the current state of bilateral relations. The Iranian foreign minister evaluated the trend of ties between Tehran and London as “positive”. Referring to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Yemen, he voiced hope that Britain would fulfill its responsibilities to end the catastrophe caused by the ongoing aggression against the impoverished country. Amir-Abdollahian further explained Iran’s principled position on Afghanistan and stressed the formation of an inclusive government in the Central Asian state and swift assistance to its people by the international community.
