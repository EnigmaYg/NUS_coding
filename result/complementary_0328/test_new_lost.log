News article:
EU looking at payment system with Iran to thwart US sanctions IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Sept 15, IRNA -- The European Union's biggest economic powers are planning to create a "special purpose" financial company to thwart US President Donald Trump's sanctions and help Iran continue to sell oil in Europe and do business transactions. The move by France, Germany and Britain, and supported by the EU comes after Trump in May unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, which the Europeans, Russia and China continue to support and have pledged to do their utmost to protect. EU officials on Friday confirmed the plan to create the "special purpose vehicle," which was first reported by Spiegel, the German news site. When asked about the financing model, a spokesperson for the German Finance Ministry said, "The German government is working together with the European External Action Service and the European Commission, as well as France and the United Kingdom, on maintaining financial payment channels with Iran. The negotiations on this are intensive and ongoing. There are different models under consideration. "As you know, it is a central goal of the EU and the German government to ensure that the processing of transactions is secured," she said during a regular government news conference. "All options are being considered." A French official added the EU needed "a financially independent sovereign channel" in order to keep the Iran deal alive. The plan under review in Berlin and Brussels would involve establishing a kind of clearing house for all European trade with Iran. A form of commercial entity known as a "special purpose vehicle" would be established, with European governments as shareholders. The new company would act as an intermediary for cross-border payments to and from Iran, with no involvement from European commercial or central banks, which are frightened of becoming the target of American countermeasures. The clearinghouse is likely to be based in Luxembourg, but its capitalization remains unclear. The European Investment Bank and national development banks, like Germany's KfW, may be involved, although here too there is genuine fear of American retribution. One EU official explained that the "special purpose vehicle" would effectively function as an accounting firm, providing a loophole to keep trade flowing between EU countries and Iran. If Italy wanted to buy Iranian oil, it could wire money to the firm, which would handle the rest of the transaction. Iran, similarly, could wire money for the purchase of European products. The special purpose vehicle would keep the money for the transactions within the EU, and outside the reach of US control over global money-transfer systems. It would also avoid the need to use banks that are afraid of being cut off from doing business in the US financial market if they are accused by the US Treasury Department of violating the sanctions. A first battery of renewed US economic sanctions took effect against Iran last month, and further sanctions – including sanctions on the Iranian oil sector, a mainstay of the country's economy – are set to take hold in November. While the EU has already taken steps to obstruct Trump's sanctions – including potential penalties against firms that enforce the American sanctions without permission of the European Commission – officials in Europe still fear that the US dominance of the world financial system will block most business with Iran. Tehran itself has warned the Europeans that they should develop new ways of trading with Iran by early November if they want to preserve the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The US wants all businesses and countries around the world to stop doing business with Iran. News of the EU plan comes only two days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker vowed in his final State of the Union address to increase the role of the euro in international trade, particularly in terms of energy purchases. Word of the European plan to prop up Iran's oil industry is certain to further damage the already badly-strained transatlantic relationship. European governments have rarely acted so decisively in opposition to American foreign policy. Their action is partly motivated by what is viewed as an American attack on European sovereignty. Trump's government is seen as coercing compliance rather than working out agreed policy. A determined effort to get around US sanctions would also encourage European businesses to stay the course in Iran. Reuters, politico.eu and handelsblatt.com contributed to this story.

News article:
A member of the Yemeni pro-government forces is pictured in front of the May 22 Hospital on the eastern outskirts of port city of Hodeida, on Thursday (AFP photo) UNITED NATIONS — United Nations food chief David Beasley spotted a tiny foot sticking out from under a blanket in a hospital in Yemen that has been overwhelmed with malnourished children, so he tried to bring a smile to the face of the small patient. “It was just like tickling a ghost,” Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, told reporters in New York on Friday after returning from a three-day visit to the war-torn, impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. Beasley recounted a conversation he had with a doctor at the hospital in the country’s capital Sanaa: “He said ‘every day about 50 children are brought to us. We have to send 30 home to die. We can only accommodate 20.’” Beasley will brief the UN Security Council on Friday with UN aid chief Mark Lowcock and UN Yemen Envoy Martin Griffiths, who is trying to broker peace in the more than three-year conflict seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. The Houthis now rule most of Yemen’s population, while the exiled government controls a section of the south. The country’s economy is in crisis and three-quarters of Yemen’s population, or 22 million people, require aid. Some 8.4 million are on the brink of starvation, though Lowcock has warned that will likely rise to 14 million. “This is not on the brink of a catastrophe. This is a catastrophe,” Beasley said. “You cannot solve the humanitarian crisis in Yemen today with humanitarian response alone. It’s now going to require an economic infusion of substantial liquidity. Both are going to be required to avert a famine,” he said. Yemen’s riyal has lost more than half its value against the US dollar since the start of the war. Soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis and the central bank has struggled to pay public-sector salaries on which many depend as foreign exchange reserves dwindle. Beasley also visited Yemen’s main port city Hodeida, which handles 80 per cent of the country’s food imports and aid supplies. The Saudi-led coalition has ordered a halt in a log-running offensive against the Houthis in Hodeida, sources said on Thursday. “That port has got to protected at all costs,” Beasley said. “We are prepared, if necessary, if all parties desire, for the UN to take over the operational capacity of the port. We are prepared to do that, we do not want to do that, but if that’s what it takes we will do it,” he said. Beasley also spoke about seeing an eight-month-old baby boy at the hospital in Sanaa who weighed a third of what he should. His mother had driven hundreds of kilometres through military checkpoints to get him medical help. “The little boy died yesterday,” he said. Containing the crisis Kuwait said this month there was a “positive view to contain the Gulf crisis”, and a source familiar with US policy said diplomats were putting forward a plan on Qatar. But neither side seems ready to cede ground. Qatar’s foreign ministry spokeswoman said last month that Khashoggi’s death should serve as a “wake-up call”. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said on Tuesday he did not expect a thaw soon. “I am very pessimistic about this. With the current [Saudi and UAE] leadership I don’t see that there is any way that things may be loosened up,” he told reporters. “The only face-saving way for them to get out is to apologise.” Abu Dhabi says the dispute is not a priority, according to three diplomats and other sources familiar with Gulf policy. “The Qataris are raising the price for resolving the crisis,” said one Western diplomat. “The Emiratis are happy to keep the Qataris isolated.” Qatar and UAE authorities did not respond to requests for comment. Riyadh and Abu Dhabi continue to reassure Washington that the dispute will not deter the formation of a proposed Middle East security alliance, which would include Doha, diplomats said. They said the UAE still strongly supports Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman against Iran and on his economic and social reforms, seen by Abu Dhabi as essential to replicating the UAE model of a business-friendly, tolerant Muslim society to combat extremism. “The Emiratis see Saudi Arabia as the only choice to lead the region. They haven’t blinked in their belief that Riyadh’s reform plans are the best and only option,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for the Arabian Peninsula at the International Crisis Group.

News article:
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers showed cautious support on Monday for possible new economic sanctions on Iran in a shift of policy after accusations of Iranian attack plots in France and Denmark, diplomats said. Denmark and France briefed their EU counterparts at a meeting in Brussels on the alleged plots and ministers agreed to consider targeted sanctions on Iranians in response, although no details or names were discussed, five diplomats told Reuters. Though still at an early stage, the EU’s readiness to penalize Iranians would be the first such move in years after months of internal division over how to punish Iranians accused of destabilizing activities in Europe and the Middle East. Until now, the EU has been straining to uphold the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers that U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May. It has been less willing to consider sanctions, instead seeking talks with Tehran. Iran has warned it could ditch the nuclear deal if EU powers do not protect its trade and financial benefits. France has already imposed sanctions on two Iranians and Iran’s intelligence service over what it says was a failed plot to carry out a bomb attack at a rally near Paris organized by an exiled Iranian opposition group. One option is to establish those asset freezes at an EU-wide level, diplomats said. Denmark, which in October said it suspected an Iranian government intelligence service had tried to carry out an assassination plot on its soil, is also open to EU-wide sanctions, the diplomats told Reuters. In October, France said there was no doubt that Iran’s intelligence ministry was behind the June plot to attack the demonstration by Iranian exiles near Paris. It froze assets belonging to Tehran’s intelligence services and two Iranian nationals - a Vienna-based diplomat now under arrest in Belgium for the plot and the deputy minister and director general of intelligence, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam. Neither appear to have held any assets in France. Paris also discreetly expelled an Iranian diplomat, diplomatic sources told Reuters last month. Iran has denied any involvement in either alleged plot. Under the 2015 deal, Iran restricted its disputed nuclear program, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions against it. MISSILE SANCTIONS DIDN’T FLY In March, Britain, France and Germany proposed to sanction Iran over its development of ballistic missiles and its role in Syria’s war, but the initiative failed to gather sufficient support across the EU to take effect. Italy was one EU country unwilling to countenance new measures as it sought to preserve business ties with Iran. In an effort to balance Iran policy, the ministers at their meeting on Monday also tried to press ahead in setting up a special mechanism to trade with Iran that could be under EU, not national, law. The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a kind of clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods in an effective barter arrangement circumventing U.S. sanctions, which are based on global use of the dollar for oil sales. Despite technical difficulties and delays, the EU believes this formula could shield individual member states from being hit by U.S. sanctions that have been reimposed on trade with Iran after Washington’s pullout from the nuclear deal. “There is a willingness for the financial vehicle ... to be set up quickly,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters. However, no country has come forward as a potential host. Their reluctance arises from fears that SPV reliance on local banks to smooth trade with Iran may incur U.S. penalties, severing the lenders’ access to U.S. markets, diplomats said. Luxembourg is seen as a good candidate to manage the Iran SPV given its experience in creating a similar mechanism during the 2009-12 euro zone financial crisis.

News article:
Jason Greenblatt, a key architect of President Donald Trump's troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, announced his resignation Thursday. His departure places another question mark over the much-delayed initiative, which the White House has touted as the "opportunity of the century," but has yet to see the light of day and has been rejected in advance by the Palestinians. Greenblatt, who worked for two and a half years alongside Trump's powerful son-in-law Jared Kushner, said in a statement that his plan had been "a vision for peace." Kushner lauded him as someone "trusted and respected by all of the leaders throughout the region." A senior administration official said Greenblatt was going to spend more time with his family but left on good terms and "holds the confidence of the president." For all the warm words, Greenblatt's departure only adds to the sense that Trump's promise to transform the US approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is floundering. Just a week ago, Greenblatt signaled the latest pushback to the plan's unveiling, saying it would not be released until after Israel's September 17 election, which will decide whether Trump ally Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power. Ilan Goldenberg, a Middle East negotiator in former US president Barack Obama's government, said another election -- the US presidential polls in November next year -- could be the real reason for a hold up. "Let me translate this for you," he tweeted after Greenblatt's announcement. "Kushner's Mideast peace plan will not see the light of day before November 2020 if at all (my bet is on never)." 'Good riddance' Trump has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history. He has slashed aid to the Palestinians, while making big concessions to the Israelis, including formalizing US recognition of the divided city of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. According to the Republican, his concept for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolves around encouraging massive economic investment, hoping that money will speak louder than political divides. However, Palestinian leaders have dismissed the plan as one-sided and failing to address their wish to end Israeli occupation and the expansion, encouraged by Netanyahu, of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land. Greenblatt "was an apologist for the most extreme, hardline government in the history of Israel," Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, told AFP. "Nobody ever saw him as evenhanded or neutral in any way. He was totally committed not to peace but to the justification of all Israeli violations," she said. "I think the Palestinians as a whole are going to say good riddance." Critics of the Trump push have also criticized his choice of key personnel: Kushner and Greenblatt, a former lawyer for Trump's businesses, are both Orthodox Jews and have long ties to Israel, but no previous foreign policy or diplomatic experience. One of the aides tapped by the White House on Thursday to fill Greenblatt's shoes, Avi Berkowitz, only graduated from Harvard Law School in 2016. 'Vision' Israeli authorities, however, were sorry to see Greenblatt go. Netanyahu thanked Greenblatt "for his dedicated work for security and peace and for never hesitating to tell the truth about the state of Israel to its detractors." A senior Trump administration official echoed that sentiment, underlining Greenblatt's role in the steadily intensifying nature of Washington's support for Israel. "Jason was instrumental, together with others in the administration, when the president recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights," the official said. "Jason has also been instrumental in helping to reframe the discussions about the conflict, using the approach that a real peace can only be built on truth." The question is when Greenblatt's plan will finally emerge and whether it will gain traction. According to the White House official, "the vision is now complete and will be released when appropriate."

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print Maryam Rajavi: Boycotting mullahs’ illegitimate election is a patriotic duty and the nation’s pledge to martyrs of the uprising Written by Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) on 05 February 2020. MARYAM RAJAVI: REGIME’S INTENSIFYING FACTIONAL FEUDING, DEEPENS INTERNAL SCHISM BOYCOTT OF ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY The Iranian regime’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei, grappling with the nightmare of his overthrow subsequent to the recent November and January uprisings, and reeling from irreparable blow he suffered with the elimination of Qassem Soleimani, is poised to institute a unipolar regime. Khamenei wants to consolidate his authority with the formation of a one-faction Parliament to forestall his regime’s inevitable overthrow. After completing an unprecedented purge of parliamentary candidates, Khamenei warned those “who were elected through elections, but undercut elections,” and scolded his rival faction, “How is it that when an election is in your favor, it is correct and definitive, but when not in your favor, it is defective?” Addressing his president, Hassan Rouhani, who on January 27 had described the election as appointments because of the purge of his faction’s candidates, Khamenei said, “When you falsely claim this election has been engineered or is not an election, you discourage the people.” https://twitter.com/iran_policy/status/1222973474794242048 Khamenei added, “The Guardian Council has a standing in the Constitution and is a trustworthy institution. How can one so easily accuse this institution as being biased toward some people?” Khamenei revealed his dread of public apathy and rejection of the election farce and said, “Someone may not like me, but if that person likes Iran, he/she must cast a vote. Thus, anyone who likes Iran and the country’s security, wants to see the problems resolved and wants to see the correct turnover of the elite, should participate in the election.” According to state-run media, the Guardian Council has disqualified 90 of the sitting members of the parliament, some of whom have served three terms. Candidates in 170 districts are from Khamenei’s faction and the main candidates of the rival faction in other districts have been eliminated, such that ultimately 260 seats will go to the faction most aligned with Khamenei and 30 to the so-called moderate factions. The rival faction is warning about widespread boycott of the election and the regime’s “implosion,” describing the Guardian Council’s purges as “a looming danger to the foundation of the Islamic Republic.” It has appealed to Khamenei to allow it to compete in the election in order to increase voter participation. On January 15, Rouhani said, “Do not disturb the people, don’t tell the people that for every parliamentary seat there are 17, 170 or 1,700 candidates. From how many factions? One? This cannot be an election. One cannot run the country with one faction.” Rouhani’s spokesman, Ali Rabiei said on February 3rd, “An indication of resistance to conduct that will implode Iran (regime) is the presence of us all at the ballot box. All of us must be present, whether critics or those who are worried.” The regime is planning wholesale fraud and rigging. Mostafa Mirsalim, affiliated with Khamenei’s faction, has already foretold the participation of “at least 70 percent” of eligible voters. Contradicting the rival faction, on January 27, Rouhani referred to systematic rigging in the election. “In any case, we could not make the election electronic… What is this, someone writes on a ballot, then drops it in a box, someone reads it, another person marks a ledger, it is not known what is read and what is marked. Then after we have recorded all [the ballots], at the very end, when they want to compile all the votes, what kind of funny business will take place… Many elections run into problems during compilation of the ballots.” Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), described the aggravating crisis and schism at the top of the regime over the election charade a manifest reflection of another deadly impasse the regime is facing. She said, the complete purge of the rival faction’s candidates is a clear sign of the ruling religious fascism’s inevitable retrenchment in the face of the surging uprisings and the crisis of overthrow. Mrs. Rajavi emphasized that the Iranian people have cast their true vote in the November 2019 and January 2020 uprisings with chants of “death to the principle of the velayat-e faqih, and death to Khamenei.” They will boycott the mullahs’ illegitimate election more than before. Boycotting this farce is a patriotic duty and the Iranian nation’s pledge to the martyrs of the Iranian people, especially the 1,500 martyrs of the November uprising. It also reflects the demands of the January 2020 uprising of the people and students for the overthrow of the illegitimate ruling theocracy in its entirety. The people and students chanted “death to Khamenei, death to the dictator, death to the principle of the velayat-e faqih, death to the oppressor, be it the shah or the leader,” demonstrating that they want a future devoid of shah and the mullahs, and one based on democracy and people’s sovereignty. https://twitter.com/Maryam_Rajavi/status/1225160037502521346 Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran February 5, 2020

"Egypt is always ready to enter into negotiations and participate in upcoming meetings between the ministers of irrigations of the three countries," the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement. It added that "serious and constructive talks would contribute to a fair, balanced, and comprehensive agreement." The ministry said the agreement would have to take into account "Egypt's water interests as well as those of Ethiopia and Sudan." The statement came after the announcement on Thursday by Khartoum and Addis Ababa "to resume technical discussions about the filling and operation of the dam." On Thursday, Prime Minister of Sudan Abdalla Hamdok and Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed held an online meeting and agreed to resume the talks in order to reach a final agreement on the filling and operation policies of the GERD. The meeting came after Addis Ababa said it would not delay filling the GERD, which it began constructing in 2011. Both Egypt and Sudan fear the reservoir, which has a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters, will impact their essential water supplies. Hamdok and Abiy's talks were the first after a diplomatic spat that broke out between Egypt and Ethiopia reached the United Nations Security Council. The negotiations between the three countries reached a deadlock last February after Ethiopia skipped the final round of talks in Washington. Enditem

News article:
Cairo - Khartoum - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein and Mohammed Amin Yassin Talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) were marred by disputes for the second consecutive day Wednesday. In two separate statements, the irrigation ministries of Egypt and Ethiopia agreed that talks, which would last until June 13, “did not produce any tangible results.” Cairo placed four conditions during the virtual meeting between the ministers of the three countries, including a call to Addis Ababa to declare it would take no “unilateral action” on filling the dam. The talks were held in the presence of observers from the European Union, the US and South Africa. Observers told Asharq Al-Awsat that the bumpy start of the negotiations and the insistence of Ethiopia not to heed the agreements reached in previous talks in Washington, are signs that there is no solution, and that the crisis is heading towards more escalation. Egypt says the reference for discussions should be the discussions held in Washington during talks brokered by the US and the World Bank in February. Egypt was the only country that initialed the document issued during the talks after the US failed to secure the signatures of Ethiopia and Sudan. Ethiopia has planned to start filling the reservoir of the dam in July. In a statement, the Sudanese irrigation ministry said that during Wednesday’s meetings the three countries expressed their viewpoints. The Egyptian delegation held to the February 21 document as the basis for negotiation, it said. It added that the three countries would continue negotiations to work on a consensual solution. Sudan has rejected a proposal by Ethiopia to sign a partial bilateral agreement for the initial filling of the dam. Nasreddine Allam, former Egyptian Minister of Water Resources, told Asharq Al-Awsat that Egypt’s negotiators would not tolerate Ethiopia’s intransigence and its attempt to bring talks back to square one. Hani Raslan, an expert on Sudan at Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, hinted at the “failure of the talks.” In a tweet, Raslan wrote that Ethiopia wants to destroy all what has been accomplished by insisting to start filling the dam next month.

News article:
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia warned Sudan on Tuesday it was running out of patience with its neighbour’s continued military build-up in a disputed border area despite attempts to diffuse tensions with diplomacy. The decades-old dispute over al-Fashqa, land within Sudan’s international boundaries that has long been settled by Ethiopian farmers, erupted into weeks of clashes between forces from both sides late last year. “The Sudanese side seems to be pushing in so as to inflame the situation on the ground,” Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti told reporters. “Is Ethiopia going to start a war? Well, we are saying let’s work on diplomacy.” “How long will Ethiopia continue to resolve the issue using diplomacy? Well, there is nothing that has no limit. Everything has a limit,” he told a briefing in Addis Ababa. Sudan’s information minister and government spokesman Feisal Mohamed Saleh said the country did not want war with Ethiopia but its forces would respond to any aggression. “We fear that these comments contain a hostile position towards Sudan. We ask of Ethiopia to stop attacking Sudanese territory and Sudanese farmers,” he told Reuters. Sudan said on Dec. 31 that it had taken control of all of Sudanese territory in the area. Ethiopia says Sudan took advantage of its forces being distracted by the Tigray conflict to occupy Ethiopian land and loot properties. The United Nations said in a report last week on the humanitarian situation in Tigray that there were reports of a military build-up on both sides of the border around the area. The border tensions come at a time when Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt are also trying to resolve a three-way row over Ethiopia’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ethiopia sees the dam as key to plans to become Africa’s largest power exporter. Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile, fears the dam across the Blue Nile could devastate its economy. Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan said on Sunday that they reached a new impasse in the dispute. Egypt and Ethiopia separately blamed Sudanese objections to the framework for the talks. On Tuesday, Ethiopia’s Dina criticised both Egypt and Sudan for delaying the negotiations. “Are the two speaking the same language? More or less. The two are speaking the same language when it comes to stalling it.”

News article:
One of the unidentified individuals informed the outlet that the proposal is “more than anything about trying to get the conversation started” between the two countries, which have been at odds for decades and saw tensions hit a new boiling point under the Trump administration. A looming expiration to an agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is also serving as a push to establish renewed talks. The deal between the pair allows the UN watchdog to continue inspections of its nuclear facilities, but is due to expire in June and take with it the agency’s access to Iranian facilities. Shahrokh Nazemi, the head of press at Iran’s mission to the United Nations, responded to the Politico revelation by indicating that “the [deal] needs no specific proposal,” and that the US just needs to follow implementation of the 2015 agreement. The Biden camp did not offer details of the ongoing diplomatic talks. In 2018, the Trump administration walked away from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which in turn re-imposed sanctions on Iran, and initiated even stricter financial hurdles as Trump sought a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. As a result, Tehran has taken several steps against denuclearization and argues that since the US abandoned the deal first, they should take the first step in renegotiating and ultimately removing sanctions. Biden stated on the campaign trail that he wanted to reverse his predecessor’s actions against Iran. However, he has been working under the assumption that he will either remake or at least update the 2015 deal. Most recently, the Biden White House has stated that sanctions will not be lifted unless Iran returns to compliance with the original deal. Reports have indicated that the US is willing to make the first move in returning to negotiations. Biden is facing increased tension in competition as Iran continues its attempt at nuclear growth including signing a $400 billion deal with China, which includes investment into the renewable energy and nuclear energy infrastructure. — Permanent Mission of China in Vienna (@ChinaMissionVie) March 29, 2021 ​European officials have also attempted to salvage the agreement, setting up talks between Iran and the US, an effort subsequently rejected by both parties. — Saeed Khatibzadeh (@SKhatibzadeh) February 28, 2021 ​Europe faces its own challenge of encountering US sanctions of their own if they attempt to do business with Iran.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Iran held a final presidential debate Saturday that showed the fissures within the country’s politics, as hardliners referred to those seeking ties to the West as “infiltrators” and the race’s two other candidates brought up the unrest that surrounded Tehran’s disputed 2009 election. Analysts and state-linked polling put hardline judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi as the clear front-runner in Friday’s upcoming vote, with the public now largely hostile to the relative moderate President Hassan Rouhani after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. But that didn’t stop Rouhani’s former Central Bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati from harshly criticizing Raisi, at one point getting up from his chair to hand him a list he described as naming individuals who haven’t paid back huge loans from state banks. He again tried to link Raisi to former President Donald Trump, whose decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Iran’s nuclear deal has seen the country crushed by sanctions. “Mr. Raisi, you and your friends have played in Trump’s ground with your extremist policies,” Hemmati said. For his part, Raisi called Hemmati’s move a stunt and said he’d make sure the government returns to the nuclear deal. The deal “would not be executed by you, it needs a powerful government to do this,” Raisi said. The election Friday will see voters pick a candidate to replace Rouhani, who is term limited from running again. The vote comes amid tensions with the West as negotiations continue to try and resuscitate the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The debate took on the pattern of the previous ones, with hardliners focusing their criticism on Hemmati as a stand-in for Rouhani. Hard-liner Alireza Zakani went as far to accuse Hemmati of committing a “huge treason” by sharing financial information to the International Monetary Fund. Hardline former Revolutionary Guard chief Mohsen Rezaei described the Rouhani government as being run by “infiltrators.” Hemmati has raised eyebrows in recent days after telling The Associated Press in an interview he’d be potentially willing to speak with President Joe Biden. He also warned that without deals with the wider world, Iran’s economy would see no growth. “What will happen if the hardliners have power?” Hemmati asked. “I tell you there is going to be more sanctions with global consensus.” It remains unclear if the debates will affect voters’ opinions. The state-linked Iranian Student Polling Agency suggested just 37% of Iranian adults watched the second debate. There also remains the larger concern about turnout in the election. Officials in the past have pointed to turnout as a sign of popular support for Iran’s theocratic government. As of now, ISPA estimates turnout will be around 41% of Iran’s over 59 million eligible voters. That would the lowest percentage since Iran’s 1979 revolution. ISPA polling also puts Raisi as the front-runner with enough of a percentage to avoid a runoff. But unlike the earlier debates, both Hemmati and an inconspicuous reformist candidate named Mohsen Mehralizadeh brought up mass protests that directly challenged the government. Mehralizadeh at one point asked Raisi to intervene with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to pardon people still held after nationwide demonstrations in November 2019 over price rises of state-subsidized gasoline. Those demonstrations ended with one lawmaker suggesting 7,000 people had been arrested. Amnesty International put the death toll from the violence at at least 208, with the rights group saying security forces killed demonstrators. Iran has yet to offer any definitive account of what happened. Responding later to Mehralizadeh, Raisi said most of those arrested “have been pardoned by the supreme leader, except those who had relations with other countries or had other issues.” He offered no figures for those pardoned and those still detained. The 2019 demonstrations were the deadliest since Iran’s 2009 presidential vote that saw hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected amid a disputed result that gave rise to the Green Movement protests. “What happened to our youth during these 12 years that changed their chants from ‘Where is my vote?’” to ‘No way I’m voting?’” Hemmati asked at one point.

News article:
This week, Democrats from across the country will come together to formally nominate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for president and vice president of the United States. Progressives, Blue Dogs, moderates, East Coasters, and West Coasters will unite around our shared values and common goal: Extinguish the corrupt, incompetent Trump presidency. The convention offers Americans from all walks of life the opportunity to hear from our party’s leaders. The lineup of speakers includes a wide array of opinions, each offering a unique view on how to solve our country’s most pressing problems. RICHARD FOWLER: BIDEN-HARRIS WILL APPEAL TO EMERGING ELECTORATE, OPENING AMERICAN DREAM TO ALL And while the Republican Party would like to paint this diversity of voices as a weakness, I see it as a strength. The convention gives us an opportunity to come together to build back a better, stronger, fairer America — an America where everyone gets a say in the process. Whether it be creating an economy that works for everyone, or achieving universal, quality affordable health care for all, Democrats are united in the fight for equality, justice and opportunity for everyone, regardless of income, race or religion. Our nation is facing unprecedented challenges, and this year’s convention doesn’t shy away from that. Early on, we took the threat of the coronavirus seriously and thus were able to plan a jam-packed event with speakers from across the ideological spectrum. On their face, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Gov. John Kasich, President Barack Obama, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. attorney Sally Yates may not seem like a group of people that would come together to support the same platform — but that’s the power of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Biden-Harris is a true unity ticket: Biden started his career post-law school as a public defender; Harris as a prosecutor. Years later in their careers, they would meet as competitors for our party’s nomination. Today, they are the team America needs to solve our most pressing challenges. Joe Biden has served in public life for nearly a half-century. Democrats and Republicans alike know him as an empathic, uniting voice. He’s a decent, steady, seasoned fighter and exactly the leader we need in these uncertain times. This ticket represents the very best of our party. As vice president, Biden fought hard for the Affordable Care Act and knows the difference reliable, affordable health care can make in someone’s life. In the midst of one of the greatest public health crises of our lifetime, this isn’t lost on him. He’s a champion for middle-class workers and served for decades in the Senate, negotiating deals with the Republican Party and pushing hard to make sure working families were heard. The first Black and Indian American woman to represent California in the U.S. Senate, Kamala Harris is a living example of the American Dream and has made a career out of ensuring everyone can achieve it. She fought tirelessly for those who were marginalized or forgotten when she worked in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. When she went on to become attorney general of California and a U.S. senator, that fighting spirit only grew stronger. Trump’s sexist comments, calling her “mean” and “nasty,” glide right off her back as she sets an example for women and girls everywhere to not allow herself to be defined by weak men. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This ticket represents the very best of our party. Pragmatic, thoughtful and empathic leaders are what our country is crying out for and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris deliver that 10 times over. Throughout the next week, we’ll hear lots of different ideas about the way this country could be run. It would be disingenuous to say we agree on everything. We don’t. But that’s OK. The range of experiences and ideas that our party brings to the national stage is what makes us so strong. Democrats are working-class Americans, they’re scientists and doctors, they’re frontline workers and teachers, they’re stay-at-home moms and dads, they’re farmers and cattle ranchers, they’re business leaders and media moguls, they’re engineers and librarians, they’re veterans and Gold Star families, they’re you and me and every single one of us gets a seat at the table. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Progress can be incremental. It can be frustrating and daunting and never quite right. But change is all around us. This ticket is a window into what America looks like and also what America could be. An America that is governed by seasoned leaders, by women of color, by those who come from humble beginnings and don’t have Ivy League degrees. An America where everyone gets a chance to make their voice heard, even if not everyone agrees. The week ahead will surely give us a peek at the better days to come, and I look forward to officially nominating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to build back our nation stronger than ever before.

News article:
The Democratic Party’s 80-page platform on foreign and domestic policy devotes only three paragraphs to Israel, a major U.S. ally. But their inclusion in the official party program received final approval only after an impassioned debate pitting progressives against mainstream Democrats at their national convention, which ended yesterday in Milwaukee. The committee that produced the official draft tried to satisfy both wings, but the staunchly pro-Israel faction, supported by the party’s presidential nominee, Joe Biden, prevailed. Biden rejected two key demands of the progressives, whose left-of-center positions were embraced by Senator Bernie Sanders. His bid for the party’s nomination was handily quashed by Biden, the middle-of-the-road candidate who served as President Barack Obama’s vice-president. The loaded word “occupation,” a reference to Israel’s military rule of the West Bank, was deleted from the platform, in line with a request from moderate Democrats and the conservative-leaning American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). And a proposal to restrict U.S. military aid to Israel in the event of Israel’s annexation of parts of the West Bank was rebuffed. The platform endorsed Israel’s annual $3.5 billion in U.S. assistance. The progressives, however, made some gains. James Zogby, a Democrat and the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, believes the party’s platform this year was friendlier to pro-Palestinian activists than in the past. He described it as a “a major improvement” over previous platforms. For the first time in its history, the Democrats explicitly endorsed Palestinian political rights within the framework of a two-state solution, while reaffirming support for Israel’s security. The Democrats’ plank was supported by J Street, a Jewish lobbying organization to the left of AIPAC, and by a group of 27 dovish former Israeli diplomats and members of parliament who, in a letter on July 25, criticized Israel’s occupation and endorsed the formation of “a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel with Jerusalem as a shared capital.” Advertisement Democrats expressed opposition to Israel’s expansion of settlements in the West Bank and came out against unilateral annexation, a controversial plan that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended on August 13 so that Israel’s historic agreement to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates could be advanced. While the platform blasted the Boycott, Divestment and Boycott (BDS) campaign against Israel, it endorsed a new provision supporting “the constitutional right of our citizens to free speech.” In other words, left-wing Democrats are now free to advocate for BDS. In the runup to the convention, progressives succeeded in winning a few victories on the campaign trail. Two of the party’s most visible pro-Palestinian figures, Ilhan Omar (Minnesota) and Rashida Tlaib (Michigan), easily won their primaries. Advertisement Jamaal Bowman, a progressive, defeated Eliot Engel (New York), a pro-Israel politician who chaired the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in another primary. In the U.S. Senate, 19 Democrats wrote a letter to Netanyahu warning him that annexation of the Jordan Valley would “fray” U.S. ties with Israel. Sanders’ former Jewish outreach advisor, Joel Rubin, said that while the platform contained “strong progressives priorities,” it was generally “very reflective” of Biden’s pro-Israel position. In short, it was strongly supportive of the United States’ strategic alliance with Israel and its commitment to Israel’s security. Biden’s pro-Israel credentials are unassailable, even judging by one small incident. Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian American BDS supporter who has been accused of antisemitism, briefly appeared at a Democratic convention meeting. When the news got out, Biden released a special statement condemning Sarsour. “Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of antisemitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform,” his spokesman said in no uncertain terms. If elected, Biden and his vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, will vigorously support a two-state solution and consistently denounce annexation. In all probability, he will tacitly accept President Donald Trump’s out-of-the-box decisions to move the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Biden will probably chart a new course on Iran. He backed the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 and which Netanyahu lambasted, and continues to believe it was useful in freezing Iran’s nuclear program and preventing a war between Israel and Iran. On his website, Biden contends that the accord successfully prevented Iran from building a nuclear arsenal. He says he would return to the accord while “more effectively pushing back against” Iran’s “destabilizing activities” in the Middle East. Biden maintains good relations with Netanyahu, despite their disagreements on major issues like Iran and Israeli settlements and despite an unpleasant incident that marred one of his last official trips to Israel in 2010. Obama dispatched Biden to Israel a decade ago to break a diplomatic impasse between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. As Biden visited Yad Vashem to honor the victims of the Holocaust, an Israeli government agency, the district planning commission, announced that 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem would be constructed in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their future capital. The announcement was regarded as a slap in the face by the Obama administration. The then U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, advised Biden to cut short his visit, but Obama decided that he should carry on. Biden soldiered on and retained his cool, but the incident damaged Obama’s relationship with Netanyahu. One can assume that Netanyahu will tread very carefully should Biden succeed Trump, who’s widely regarded as one of the most pro-Israel presidents in history. Under a Biden presidency, Netanyahu would have to shelve annexation indefinitely.

News article:
CNN anchor Jake Tapper suggested on Tuesday that Republicans would be "rioting" if Democrats attempted similar "norm-busting" tactics at their own convention. There were plenty of firsts at the Republican National Convention from President Trump's pardon of felon-turned-activist Jon Ponder, his overseeing a naturalization ceremony at the White House, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's address from Jerusalem. Minutes before the convention began, Tapper slammed the "erosions of norms and standards." "There was an expectation in this country that secretaries of state, a tradition, secretaries of state will not speak at conventions," Tapper told his colleague Wolf Blitzer. "I cannot imagine the outcry if Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had spoken at the Democratic Convention in 2012." CNN'S JOE LOCKHART ATTACKS SANDMANN AS 'SNOT NOSE ENTITLED KID' AFTER NETWORK'S DEFAMATION SUIT He continued, "We're also going to have the president issuing a pardon during a political convention. I mean, the individual no doubt deserves a pardon. He was pardoned earlier this year by the state of Nevada. The idea that this would be done as part of a political convention- it's just a completely norm-eroding, norm-busting tradition. And I think we're going to see a lot of that during this convention. And I just can't even imagine what Republicans on Capitol Hill would be doing if Democrats were doing these types of activities during a convention, Wolf. They'd be rioting, frankly."

Preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons will be one of the top foreign policy and national security challenges facing Joe Biden when he becomes president Jan. 20. Realistically, diplomacy and empty threats won’t accomplish this vital task — we’ve seen them fail under both Democratic and Republican administrations. The only way for Biden to succeed will be to use military force against Iran. I realize this proposal will be met with cries of “warmonger” and doomsday scenarios of a massive U.S. invasion of Iran with heavy American casualties. But that’s not what I’m suggesting. UK, GERMANY, FRANCE CALLS IRAN NUCLEAR MOVES ‘DEEPLY WORRYING’ Marine Gen. James Mattis, then head of U.S. Central Command (and later President Trump’s defense secretary), said in 2013 that the American military could bring Iran to its knees. “There are a number of means to do that,” he said, “perhaps even short of open conflict.” The U.S. has an arsenal of weapons that can be used in coordination with allies including Israel and Arab nations that don’t require a Desert Storm-type of invasion of Iran. Unlike diplomacy, which has repeatedly failed to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions, limited force against the regime can succeed. President Trump rightly abandoned President Barack Obama’s overly generous Iran nuclear deal, which failed to stop Tehran from advancing toward a nuclear bomb. But while Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions has crippled Iran’s economy, it has not stopped the Islamic Republic’s malignant behavior. And Trump’s term in office is about to end with Iran closer to possessing nuclear weapons than it was when he became president in January 2017. What can Biden do differently to deal with a major Iranian threat to our national security and the security of U.S. allies? Unfortunately, Biden is starting off on the wrong path. He wants to return to Obama’s calamitous Iran nuclear deal and appears ready to ease the pressure on Iran to entice the regime to return to the negotiating table. The Iranians, however, have no interest in talks without being compensated for the economic damage of the Trump sanctions. But even if Biden takes this unwarranted step, there is zero chance Iran will agree to serious limits on its nuclear program, let alone restrictions on its other malign activities supporting terrorism and military action in the greater Middle East. Only military force can eliminate or at least seriously reduce the Iranian threat. Obama never seriously threatened military force against Iran. He appeared weak by failing to enforce his red line and attack Syria following the regime’s use of chemical weapons, and then furthered his profile in weakness by withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. The Iranians concluded they had nothing to fear from Obama. They used that to their advantage to out-negotiate the president and his team and get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without sacrificing their strategic objectives. Trump’s term in office is about to end with Iran closer to possessing nuclear weapons than it was when he became president in January 2017. Trump initially frightened Iranian leaders when he attacked Syria. He gave the Iranians another scare when he approved the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the terrorist commander of the Iranian Quds Force. But Trump’s unpredictability, his calls for withdrawing troops from the Middle East and elsewhere, and his failure to respond to Iranian provocations — even after a ballistic missile attack on a U.S. base in Iraq — revealed his belligerent threats to be just bluster. To be effective, threats must be credible. Biden must demonstrate he is prepared to use force against Iran if necessary. That means a U.S. response must take place if Iran attacks our allies or if our assets are attacked. We should not seek escalation, but shouldn’t shrink from it either. One way to contain the Iranians is by keeping U.S. forces in the region, especially in neighboring Iraq. The ayatollahs who rule Iran were petrified they might be the next target after the American military deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein under President George W. Bush. But the threat from the U.S. dissipated with the removal of our troops and the reluctance of the next two American presidents to use force. While our armed forces must be ready to act if necessary, we have a range of other options — one of which is cyberwarfare. The U.S.-Israeli intelligence operation Olympic Games, started under President George W. Bush and expanded under Obama, for example, is believed to have set the Iranian nuclear weapons program back months, if not years. PENTAGON SENDS B-52 BOMBERS TO PERSIAN GULF, AS US LAUNCHES AIRSTRIKES IN SOMALIA AFTER PULLING OUT In 2019, the U.S. Cyber Command targeted computer systems that control Iranian missile launches and those used by an Iranian intelligence group believed to be involved in planning attacks against oil tankers. The United States also reportedly conducted a cyber operation in response to Iran’s attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities. Likewise, in response to an Iranian cyberattack, Israel reportedly hacked into Iranian computers that regulate the flow of vessels, trucks, and goods — bringing shipping traffic at Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port terminal to a halt. Sabotage may be carried out in other ways. Over the summer, for example, several explosions and fires attributed to Israel damaged weapons facilities across Iran. One blast destroyed parts of a secret facility in Parchin associated with nuclear weapons research and damaged part of a missile facility. Another explosion destroyed a building at the Natanz enrichment facility where Iran has been developing advanced centrifuges to significantly speed up the enrichment of uranium. The Institute for Science and International Security reported that this represented “a significant setback to Iran’s plans and ability to mass produce advanced centrifuges” and said rebuilding the plant would likely take at least a year. Decapitating the leadership of Iran’s terror and nuclear networks can also weaken the regime. Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani, the mastermind of Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria, who the Pentagon said was “actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.” Israel has been accused of killing at least six Iranian scientists, most recently the head of the Iranian nuclear weapons program, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Contrary to the appeasers’ claims that such assassinations have no impact, former CIA Director Michael Hayden told Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman that “the death of those human beings had a great impact on their nuclear program.” The killings hurt Iran in three ways: “the loss of the know-how in the dead men’s minds; the significant delays in the program resulting from the need to beef up measures to prevent penetration by Western intelligence; and the abandonment of the program by experienced experts for fear that they would suffer a similar fate,” Hayden said. The killing of Fakhrizadeh and sabotage operations exposed the weakness of Iran’s intelligence agencies. This was an embarrassment to the regime and caused officials to engage in recriminations and lose confidence in their ability to protect their personnel and facilities. Knowing its nuclear facilities are targets, Iran has moved some underground. The United States could target them using bunker-busting bombs, which former Defense Secretary Ash Carter said have the capability to “shut down, set back, and destroy” Iran’s nuclear program. Airstrikes could also destroy Iranian air bases, naval bases, and ballistic missile installations. Iran has harassed American ships in the Persian Gulf and threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. has planned for this contingency and could send a message if tensions escalated by sinking Iran’s brand-new warship. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER A U.S. operation could target Kharg Island — from which Iran exports 90% of its oil and natural gas — or the port of Bandar Abbas, which is responsible for 90% of Iran’s container trade. A broader strike might include air and missile strikes against oil refineries, natural gas terminals, railways, bridges, roads and power plants. America could also impose a no-fly zone and/or a naval embargo on Iran. Military planners always hope their operations will succeed. However, they must also consider worst-case scenarios, including many of those suggested by opponents of the use of force. Even limited attacks could provoke Iranian retaliation against U.S. troops and allies, and escalate to war. But here’s what’s important to remember: If Iran develops nuclear weapons, most — if not all — our options will be foreclosed. Nuclear weapons would virtually guarantee that no nation would dare attack the Islamic Republic. This is why the Iranian leaders have been working for years to develop a nuclear force. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even worse, if Iranian leaders actually ordered the use of nuclear weapons to attack another nation or U.S. forces, the consequences would be horrific. Ultimately, incoming President Biden will have to decide whether the risks of military action against Iran outweigh the benefit of preventing it from acquiring nuclear weapons. But he will also have to consider the costs and benefits of inaction. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MITCHELL BARD

News article:
As the regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran reached ever new heights with a potential escalation following Riyadh's execution of prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the entrance of a new major actor to the troubled waters of Middle Eastern politics was taking place. So far, President of China Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have visited almost every region in the world in the context of their multidimensional foreign policy approach, but not the conflict-ridden Middle East. Therefore, when Xi embarked on a major diplomatic tour into the region comprising Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt there were plenty of remarks in global media outlets concerning the critical decision of the "Middle Kingdom" to finally come out from the sidelines and take a step forward to become a global player.Not least because the Middle East represents the most difficult regional geopolitical realm in which China's non-interference into other countries' domestic affairs policy and staunch neutrality could be maintained due to endless conflicts among regional neighbors. As a pretext to the historic visit, Xi was trying to gradually inject China into the complicated Middle Eastern political seen by inviting representatives of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime and the opposition in Syria to Beijing to promote a peaceful resolution. He also dispatched his deputy foreign minister to Riyadh and Tehran at the peak of the crisis to mediate between the sides and to recommend calm. More importantly, Xi made a last minute alteration in his long-planned visit itinerary and decided to visit Tehran instead of the previously planned United Arab Emirates (UAE). This significantly raised the profile of his historic tour at a time when the spotlights of global investors are all focused on Iran, striving for economic opportunities in the post-sanctions era. As one of the major global importers of energy, China's main interest in Saudi Arabia and Iran is expectedly economic, based on the maintenance of cheap and reliable supply of oil. Currently, Saudi Arabia is China's biggest supplier of crude oil and bilateral trade stands around $69 billion. During Xi's visit, he and King Salman inaugurated an energy research center and opened the Yasref Oil Refinery, a major joint venture between Saudi Aramco and China's Sinopec. They also signed a memorandum of understanding for the construction of a high-energy nuclear reactor. But China's diplomatic hyperactivity in the Middle East cannot be confined to pure economic opportunism based on maintaining cordial relations with all economic partners. On the contrary, Beijing seems to have realized a diplomatic opportunity space created by the lack of interest in Middle Eastern politics on the part of U.S. President Barack Obama's administration and the fully fledged engagement of Russia in the Syrian civil war, allying itself clearly with the Shiite camp. Therefore, neither Washington nor Moscow are in a position to act as an honest broker in the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which presented a perfect moment for China's entry onto the Middle Eastern stage as a global power. Therefore, Xi wanted to become the first global leader to visit Tehran following the lifting of international sanctions to which China has contributed. Commercially, Iran is the favorite trading partner and logistical hub for China in the region, a status that was confirmed with 17 new agreements of cooperation in the areas of energy, trade and industry and a comprehensive strategic partnership document. The plan is to raise bilateral trade to $600 billion in 10 years, and the key to that vision is China's One Belt One Road initiative, which includes ambitious rail, road and port projects, including a high-speed rail network connecting Xinjiang in western China with Tehran via Almaty, Bishkek and Ashkhabad. Iran is geo-strategically important in this vision as it stands at a crossroads at the edge of Asia before the route of the ancient Silk Road reaches Turkey and Europe. Given the deeply skeptical approach of Iran's Shiite establishment toward the U.S. and Europe despite the recent rapprochement, China's autonomous stance in the world system provides comfort for long-term collaboration. While China has long maintained a policy of non-interference in other countries' domestic politics, harmony and economic cooperation, this might be just about to go through a radical change as far as the Middle East is concerned. China is becoming a superpower and will act like one. shortlink copied

News article:
Secretary-General of the Lebanese Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah revealed on Friday an agreement with Iran to start loading a third ship of oil derivatives to sail to Lebanon. This came in a televised speech delivered by Nasrallah on the fourth anniversary of the Second Liberation, which was broadcast by some Lebanese channels, including pro-Hezbollah Al-Manar TV channel. Nasrallah stated: We agreed with the Iranians to start loading a third ship of oil derivatives to head towards Lebanon. We need more than three ships to face the next stage. On 19 August, Nasrallah confirmed that an Iranian fuel ship was on its way to his country, and then on 22 August, he announced that a second oil vessel would sail to Lebanon within days, and other ships would follow. Read: Lebanon heading towards collapse, Sunni sheikh warns So far, the Lebanese side did not announce the arrival of any ship coming from Iran, and the government has issued no official comment about the Iranian oil shipments, the location to unload the cargo or who would benefit from it. Lebanon has been suffering a severe fuel shortage for more than two months due to the lack of sufficient foreign exchange to import it. In his speech, Nasrallah stressed the importance of: "Forming a government as soon as possible in order to start reaching solutions to the ongoing crises." On 26 July, President Michel Aoun commissioned Najib Mikati to form a new government to succeed the caretaker government, which resigned six days after the explosion of the Beirut Port on 4 August, 2020. Consultations are still ongoing between the concerned parties to agree on a government formation. Read: Lebanon water supply cuts as fuel shortage continues

Iran’s first fuel tanker that set sail two weeks ago is en route to Lebanon as a second ship also begins its journey to assuage the sufferings endured by the Lebanese people under severe fuel shortages and American sanctions. Data from TankerTrackers, a global tanker tracking website, showed that the first ship is sailing toward Lebanon. 2021-08-28 update regarding Iranian fuel for Lebanon: - We received an acknowledgement signal from Iran for the first tanker we identified. This vessel is underway with fuel for the electric power grid. - Gasoline tanker hasn't departed yet. - Investigating 3rd tanker. /TT pic.twitter.com/FQ7pwybbqG — TankerTrackers.com, Inc. (@TankerTrackers) August 28, 2021 2021-08-29; second update regarding Iranian fuel for Lebanon: The second tanker has departed port and is currently underway. We should know by morning if she’s left the country as well. It’s a process, people. /TT — TankerTrackers.com, Inc. (@TankerTrackers) August 29, 2021 Citing informed sources, Lebanon’s al-Manar television network also confirmed the report. Meanwhile, Hebrew sources said that Lebanon’s resistance movement Hezbollah is at a state of alert in case the Israeli regime makes a miscalculation with regard to the ship. On August 19, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned the US and Israel that the vessels carrying Iranian fuel would be regarded as “Lebanese territory,” as he announced the departure of the first ship from Iran. Earlier today, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh cautioned against any move targeting the tankers, saying that neither the US nor any other country is in a position to stop legitimate trade between Iran and Lebanon. “We are very serious about exercising our sovereignty and everyone should know that legitimate trade in this sphere is one of the basic principles of international law,” Khatibzadeh said during a virtual press conference. Fuel shortages in Lebanon have forced businesses and government offices to close, threatening to cause blackouts at hospitals and halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country. The plan to send Iranian fuel to Lebanon is seen as a watershed in breaking US sanctions, which have targeted both countries. Just a few hours after Nasrallah’s August 19 announcement, US Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea claimed that Washington would help Lebanon implement a plan to transfer Egyptian gas to Lebanon for power generation. The Hezbollah leader later derided Shea’s plan as an act of “selling illusions to the Lebanese,” saying even if implemented, it could take a year to import gas from Egypt to Lebanon. In remarks on Friday, Nasrallah announced that a deal was reached with Tehran to import a third fuel-loaded tanker to ease crippling shortages in the country. “The coming days will prove those doubtful about the shipments arriving with fuel wrong ... and our words will be clear when the first vessel reaches Lebanon,” he said in a televised speech. He also said the country’s economic crisis was the result of an economic siege imposed by the US, stressing that the so-called Caesar sanctions by Washington on Syria had also harmed Lebanon. “Go ahead and give Lebanon an exemption for Iranian gasoline and diesel ... go ahead and give Lebanon an exemption from Caesar,” Nasrallah said, addressing Washington in his speech.

News article:
Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat on Friday commented sarcastically on the entry of Hizbullah-imported Iranian diesel from Syria into Lebanon. “We no longer know from where the diesel, gasoline and oil convoys are coming,” Jumblat said in a tweet. “Those who care for us have become numerous to an extent that we might become an oil exporting country without border demarcation and without excavation -- neither in the north nor in the south nor at sea nor on land,” the PSP leader added. Jumblat is believed to be a co-owner of at least one Lebanese oil and gas company. Dozens of tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel arranged by Hizbullah arrived in shortage-hit Lebanon Thursday. As they entered from Syria through an illegal crossing in the eastern region of Hermel, the trucks were greeted by Hizbullah supporters waving the group's yellow flag and ululating women tossing rice and rose petals. Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had promised in August he would bring fuel from Iran to alleviate the rationing that is sowing chaos across the country. A first Iranian ship reached the Syrian port of Baniyas earlier this week. The cargo was offloaded there and trucked to Lebanon, the first of several planned deliveries. A total of 80 trucks carrying four million liters (more than one million gallons) of petrol entered Lebanon on Thursday and were expected to fill the tanks of Al-Amana, a fuel distribution company which is owned by Hizbullah and has been under U.S. sanctions since February 2020. "This is humanitarian aid that will meet the needs of the population," said Jawad, a 50-year-old Hermel resident who was among the crowd gathered to welcome the convoy. Hizbullah "is not replacing the state, it's a temporary measure until the state can deliver its duties," he said. For critics, however, the convoy is a symbol of the dissolution of the Lebanese state. "Don't forget this day," tweeted Laury Haytayan, a Lebanese oil and gas expert and activist, describing it as the day Hizbullah won over the Lebanese state. Hizbullah is often accused by its opponents of operating a state-within-a-state and has been taking part in Syria's civil war alongside government forces. Nasrallah's announcement last month was a boon for the Tehran-backed movement and prompted the announcement of several other fuel supply schemes via other regional powers. The amount of Iranian petrol being delivered can only meet a small part of the demand in Lebanon, where motorists spend hours -- sometimes days -- in queues to fill up. Under another initiative to bring some power to the country, energy ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon earlier this month agreed a plan to bring Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity to Lebanon via Syria. The United States has backed the plan and given rare approval for the Arab neighbors to escape punishment under sanctions targeting the Syrian regime.

Palestinian Munadel Infeiat, 26, one of the six prisoners who had tunnelled out of Israel's high security Gilboa Prison, is surrounded by Israeli forces as he appears at the magistrates' court in the northern Israeli city of Nazareth on Sunday (AFP photo) OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — All six Palestinians who escaped an Israeli high-security jail through a tunnel dug under a sink are back in custody, after the forces said on Sunday they had recaptured the last two. The inmates, who were being held for attacks against Israel, became heroes among many Palestinians when reports emerged they had burrowed out using tools as basic as a spoon. The full weight of Israel's security apparatus was deployed to catch them, including aerial drones, road checkpoints and an army mission to Jenin in the occupied West Bank where many of the men grew up. The huge manhunt lasted almost a fortnight, with the first four fugitives recaptured last week. The Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday the remaining two had surrendered "after being surrounded by security forces" that had acted with precision on accurate intelligence. The men, 35-year-old Ayham Kamamji and 26-year-old Munadel Infeiat, are both members of Islamic Jihad, an armed Palestinian Islamist movement. Islamic Jihad hailed its "heroes" following the re-arrests, vowing the Palestinian people "will not surrender" in response to Israeli "criminality and aggression". The pair were arrested in a joint operation with counterterrorism forces in Jenin and were "currently being interrogated", the Israeli forces statement said. Two other men who had allegedly helped the fugitives were also detained, it added. 'Major mishap' Taleb Abo Jaafar, who owns the Jenin house in which the two fugitives were found, said he had been surprised to discover his home cordoned off in the middle of the night. "There was shooting around the house. I went out to see what happened, I opened the door and looked at the street, the forces were outside and they told me to go back inside," he told AFP. In a call on Sunday with Israeli security chiefs, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett branded the escape "a major mishap". “But you mobilised with joint forces until the mission was completed,” he added, vowing in a separate statement that the security establishment would “correct what needs to be corrected”. All six fugitives were members of Palestinian groups who were convicted by Israeli courts of plotting or carrying out attacks against Israelis. Kamamji, originally from Kafr Dan near Jenin, was arrested in 2006 and jailed for life for the kidnap and murder of a young Israeli settler, Eliahu Asheri. Islamic Jihad said Kamamji suffered abdominal and intestinal illness in jail and was subject to “medical negligence” by prison authorities. Infeiat, arrested last year, had been jailed multiple times previously for his role in the armed group, and was awaiting sentencing at the time of the escape. Hiding in lorry park The other four men recaptured last week included Mahmoud Abdullah Ardah, the alleged mastermind of the escape, and Zakaria Zubeidi, who headed the armed wing of the Fateh movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Zubeidi was found hiding in a lorry park just outside Nazareth in northern Israel along with one of the other men, Mohammad Ardah, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 for his role in Islamic Jihad’s armed wing. The remand of the four was extended at Nazareth’s magistrates’ court to September 29 in a Sunday hearing, police said. ‘Spoon of freedom’ Questions remain over how jailbreak could have happened, and a formal inquiry has been announced. A lawyer for Yaqub Qadri, the sixth escapee, told Palestinian television that the inmates had not planned to escape when they did on September 6. She said they rushed ahead with the plan on that day because they feared guards had become suspicious and noticed changes in their cell. The break-out had been planned for months, Ardah’s lawyer told AFP, saying that “Mahmoud told me he started digging in December”. Ardah told him he used spoons, plates and even the handle of a kettle to dig the tunnel from his jail cell. Spoons have since become a symbol of Palestinian resistance, with protesters both inside and outside the Palestinian territories carrying them at demonstrations. They have inspired political artwork as far away as Kuwait, where artist Maitham Abdal has sculpted a giant hand clasping what he labelled the “spoon of freedom”.

News article:
Egypt’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Mohamed Abdel Aty, meets with Oliver Varhelyi, the EU Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement. (Asharq Al-Awsat) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Ambassador Christian Berger, head of the European Union delegation to Egypt, expressed the EU’s interest in strengthening cooperation with Cairo in the water sector. Berger stressed that the EU attaches great importance to water and the utilization of natural resources and has responded to the challenges associated with this sector in Egypt since 2007 through various programs, which contributed to creating job opportunities and improving the quality of life for the Egyptian population. His remarks came during a conference held on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Cairo Water Week (CWW), under the title, “Financing Water Projects… Challenges and Opportunities.” The conference was organized by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in partnership with the Delegation of the European Union to Egypt, the French Development Agency (AFD), and the German Development Bank (KfW). EIB Director of Lending Operations in EU Neighboring Countries, Flavia Palanza said the comprehensive Egypt Vision 2030 and the National Strategy for Water Supply and Sanitation (2008-2037) are excellent frameworks for policy dialogue and to guide investments in priority areas and projects in the water sector. Palanza pointed to many challenges associated to climate change, stressing that the financial means were not sufficient to meet them, especially due to the coronavirus pandemic. She stressed the importance of cooperation in the water sector, especially with Egypt, saying that the EU was committed to providing and adopting a comprehensive approach, grants and loans in order to enhance the benefits. Also on Tuesday, Egypt’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Aty met with Oliver Varhelyi, the EU Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement. “The European Union prioritizes the water issue, which is a major determinant of sustainable development, with its associated economic and social dimensions,” Varhelyi said. The EU official expressed his understanding of the importance of the Nile River for Egypt as the main source of water in the country. The meeting touched on a number of issues of common interest in which Egypt and the EU can strengthen their partnership, including climate change and migration.

News article:
Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas made a rare visit to Israel Tuesday for talks with Defence Minister Benny Gantz, which the defence ministry said focused on security and civil matters. Gantz told Abbas that he intended to "continue to promote actions to strengthen confidence in the economic and civilian fields, as agreed during their last meeting," the ministry statement said. "The two men discussed security and civil matters," it added. Israeli media reported that the meeting took place at Gantz's home in the central town of Rosh HaAyin. In late August, Gantz visited the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah for talks with Abbas, the first official meeting at such a level for several years. But after those talks, hawkish Prime Minister Naftali Bennett underlined that there was no peace process under way with the Palestinians, "and there won't be one". Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Hussein al-Sheikh tweeted on Wednesday that Abbas met with Gantz. "The meeting dealt with the importance of creating a political horizon that leads to a political solution, in accordance with international resolutions," he said. The pair also discussed "the tense conditions on the ground due to the practices of settlers" as well as "many security, economic and humanitarian issues". Israel's right-wing opposition party Likud condemned the latest meeting, saying that "concessions dangerous for Israel's security were only a matter of time". Likud added a dismissive reference to Bennett's governing coalition, which includes an Israeli Arab party for the first time. "The Israeli-Palestinian government has put the Palestinians and Abbas back on the agenda... it is dangerous for Israel," Likud said. Deepens Palestinian divide Palestinian movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also condemned the visit. It went against the "national spirit of our Palestinian people", a Hamas statement read. "This behaviour by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority deepens the Palestinian political divide, complicates the Palestinian situation, encourages those in the region who want to normalise relations with the occupier, and weakens the Palestinians' rejection of normalisation," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. The Gulf Arab states Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco and Sudan, signed US-brokered normalisation deals with Israel during the presidency of Donald Trump. Relations between Israel and the Palestinians deteriorated sharply during Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu's record 12 years as prime minister, up to June this year. US-sponsored peace talks broke down in 2014 as Netanyahu oversaw an intensification of illegal Jewish settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank. Right-winger Bennett, the former head of a settler lobby group who opposes Palestinian statehood, leads a coalition of parties from the Jewish nationalist right and the left and centre. Gantz's meeting with Abbas follows a visit to the region by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. *This story was edited by Ahram Online Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
The United States said Monday a deal was possible with Iran on its nuclear program but that an agreement had to be completed urgently as Tehran advances its capabilities, on the eve of renewed talks. The negotiations — attended by China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom, Iran and the United States — will resume in Vienna after being halted at the end of last month. They come after parties in recent weeks cited progress in seeking to revive the 2015 accord that was supposed to prevent Iran from acquiring an atomic bomb, a goal it has always denied pursuing. “A deal that addresses all sides’ core concerns is in sight, but if it is not reached in the coming weeks, Iran’s ongoing nuclear advances will make it impossible for us to return to the JCPOA,” a US State Department spokesperson said, referring to the 2015 framework agreement. Parties have been negotiating in Vienna since last year with indirect US participation. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Former US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the pact in 2018 and reimposed tough economic sanctions on Iran, prompting the Islamic Republic to begin pulling back from its commitments under the deal and step up its nuclear activities. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said the answers that “the United States brings tomorrow to Vienna will determine when we can reach an agreement.” “We have made significant progress in various areas of the Vienna negotiations” including on guarantees that Iran seeks that a new US administration would not breach the deal once again, Khatibzadeh told reporters. Advertisement ‘Decisive moment’ Experts say the Iranians have deviated so much from the restrictions of the 2015 deal that they are only weeks away from having enough fissile material to make an atomic weapon. According to an Israeli television report over the weekend, Israel fears that even a restored nuclear agreement may leave Iran only a few months from having sufficient fissile material for a nuclear bomb. The original deal aimed to keep Iran at least a year away from amassing enough material for a nuclear weapon. In a briefing Monday, National Security Adviser Eyal Hulta said there is a real chance that Iran will return to a nuclear deal and that the US will lose its tools for pushing Iran into a “longer and stronger” deal. “We must prepare for every one of the possibilities, whether there is a return to a deal or not,” he said. At the same briefing, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett vowed Israel will maintain its freedom of action regardless if an agreement is reached or not, a day after discussing Iran’s nuclear program with US President Joe Biden. Washington has sought direct negotiations in this home stretch, but said talks remain indirect at Iran’s request. Advertisement German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called it “the decisive moment” in an interview with the Washington Post published Monday. “We gave them a clear message that now this is the time for decisions and for progress, and not for prolonging the process,” he said. “We hope that they will use the chance.” On Friday, Washington made a gesture by announcing it was waiving sanctions on Iran’s civil nuclear program, a technical step necessary to return to the 2015 JCPOA. The waiver allows other countries and companies to participate in Iran’s civil nuclear program without triggering US sanctions on them, in the name of promoting safety and non-proliferation. The move “should facilitate technical discussions necessary to support talks on JCPOA return in Vienna,” negotiators of Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement Saturday. For Iran, though, the move fell short. “Real, effective and verifiable economic benefit for Iran is a necessary condition for the formation of an agreement,” Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said in a tweet. “The show of lifting sanctions is not considered a constructive effort.” Advertisement Shamkhani said Sunday that Washington and Tehran had so far failed to produce “balance” in their commitments during the Vienna talks. “Despite limited progress in the #ViennaTalks, we are still far from achieving the necessary balance in the commitments of the parties,” he tweeted.
