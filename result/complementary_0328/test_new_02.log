News article:
This Saturday will mark 100 days since the beginning of the phenomenon of incendiary kites and balloons being launched into Israeli communites bordering the Gaza Strip, with parents complaining of the accompanying difficulties in raising their chidlren under the constant specter of fires and rocket attacks. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter When the first incendiary kite landed in a Gaza border community on March 30, few imagined that it would turn into a such a regular occurrence that would see dozens of fires break out on a daily basis and ravage swathes of Israeli landscape. Every day the flames devour more and more locations, thousands of acres of forests, agricultural land and fields The local residents, who already live under a constant threat of rocket fire from the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror groups, now have to fear suspicious balloons in the sky or kites flying from across the border. One senior security source said that what began as a gimmick during protests on the Gaza border, has grown into a serious threat that is making life increasingly difficult for local residents, and adds a new threat for which the people there need to prepare their kids. It might also lead to another escalation of violence in the south, several officials have warned. The reality of rocket fire and Code Red alerts is part of everyday life for the residents of Gaza border communities. Those who were still children when rocket fire began in 2001, are now parents who have to teach their children not only about the danger of missiles but about incendiary balloons as well. "In your development as a parent in the Gaza border region, you cannot hide the reality of the situation anymore,” said Michal Gal-Burgan, a mother of two, from the Eshkol Regional Council. “Our children ask us questions ‘Why are they not nice to us?’. We tell them the truth and don’t sugarcoat and we tell them about the balloons and kites as well. We simply tell them not to touch. There is a feeling of desperation and exhaustion,” added Gal-Burgan. She also discussed daily life in the region since the end of Operation Protective Edge in 2014. “It’s been four years since Protective Edge, and until recently it was calm and we could live a normal life, but right now the situation is tense once again. It’s tiring. I had hoped that when I became a parent, my children wouldn’t have to deal with the same issues. I thought the government would find a solution so we could live in peace, but in reality, everyday we give up part of our peace of mind,” she concluded. Local children also spoke about their experiences, exlpaining how they deal with the dangerous phenomenon. "Counselors showed us a picture of a kite and a balloon," said 8-year-old Elia Gal who attends a children's home for at-risk kids. "The balloon in the picture had a sponge with matches attached to it. The counselors told us that if we find something similar then we should stay away from it and call for help." Avi Dabush, Dana Kalfa with the girls Hila and Amit, Michal and Nimrod Gal-Burgan with the children Elia and Ariel and Aharon (Photo: Haim Horenstein) Aaron Ariel Lavie, a father of four and a resident of Shuva, a religious moshav in southern Israel where over the past months dozens of incendiary balloons have landed, says that he and his family are very strong. However, he calls on the government to urgently formulate a policy to resolve the issue. “I am not of those who complains ... but unfortunately there’s no policy on what happens in the Gaza Strip. If there is no diplomatic solution, there’s no point entering another war. It’s hard to see our land being burned. I am a person that loves nature and it is painful to watch it get destroyed. It will only intensify. We shouldn't accept this threat,” vented the father. Ofir Kalfa, a father of two, and a Sderot native who currently lives in Kibbutz Gevim in the Gaza border region, explained the difficulties he is experiencing in raising children in such an environment. “Our children are heroes. The suffering they’ve experienced over the past few months has reached new heights. Our responsibility, as adults, is to fix the situation. The Netanyahu government is far from doing that,” Kalfa complained. Another father of two, Avi Dabush from Sderot who serves as the Head of the Meretz party in the periphery, called on the country to invest more in the region. “Seventeen years of war and 100 days of incendiary kites, and the Israeli government keeps putting out fires. The position of the leadership is to formulate a strategy and to promote prosperity in Sderot and Gaza border communities. This is what the brave residents and children here deserve,” exclaimed Dabush.

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — In southern Israel, firefighters battled some 40 blazes over the weekend, as Arabs continued dispatching terror balloons and kites at Israel. One of those fires, at Kibbutz Or Haner, spread quickly and required nine firefighting crews, aided by four planes, to bring under control. On Friday, a number of terrorists were injured when they tried to throw a firebomb at Israeli forces near the Karni Crossing in Gaza. The firebomb exploded while still in the hands of the terrorists, apparently killing one terrorist. There were no injuries to Israeli forces. Gaza sources reported that one terrorist was killed in riots near the border fence. In a statement, the IDF said that “Hamas uses various methods to conduct terror activities in the guise of violent demonstrations. They use the crowding and large gatherings as excuses to endanger the residents of Gaza and turn them into a cover for their terror activities.”

Nine firefighting teams and four firefighting aircraft fought a blaze outside Kibbutz Or HaNer in southern Israel. Incendiary kites also ignited a fire near Kibbutz Nir Am. A post on the Facebook page of Reshet 13 Hebrew news showed the damage caused by the incendiary kites. The incendiary kites and helium balloons are part of the ongoing Hamas-led March of Return protests and thousands have been sent over the border into Israel. On Friday evening, a group of Gazans approached the security fence separating Israel from Gaza when an explosive one was carrying went off, killing the 22-year-old man. In contrast to the Gazan violence, approximately four-thousand Israelis took part in a protest on Friday on the border with Gaza, waving Israeli flags and flying blue kites in response to the Gazan incendiary kites. The demonstrators also called on the Israeli government to recover the bodies of Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, IDF soldiers who were killed in Gaza during the 2014 war. Hamas refuses to return their remains.

News article:
Israeli diplomats have responded with shock to secret details of the Iran deal revealed in the Senate hearing of US Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday, in which classified sections of the deal not originally released were unearthed. One particularly troubling detail that was divulged is that the covert military base Parchin, which Iran has admitted to using to test exploding bridge wire nuclear detonators, will be off limits to international inspectors, exactly as Iran has threatened. Instead Iran will take its own samples from Parchin and do its own testing of the covert site. Kerry responded in the hearing by saying the agreements on Parchin are part of the classified section of the deal, and that he trusts the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) when it says it is satisfied with them; ironically, the IAEA has in numerous reports warned that Iran is conducting nuclear weapons testing at the site, and requested numerous times to inspect the site - requests that Iran rejected. Responding to the revelation, a senior Israeli diplomatic source was cited by Yedioth Aharonoth saying, "not only did the Iranians receive a warning time of 24 days (before inspection) to clean things up, apparently they don't even need to worry because they're the ones collecting the samples." "That means it just allows the Iranians to fabricate the samples and there is no chance that breaches (of the deal) will be found. It means there won't be real inspection." A senior minister of the Israeli government who is also a member of the Security Cabinet was likewise quoted on condition of anonymity in the report responding to the self-testing issue. "In this deal and its annexes there are lots of astonishing things, like the fact that Iran is the one to collect the samples from nuclear sites, and that the world powers obligated to help Iran prevent sabotage at nuclear facilities," said the minister. He added, "each day it becomes clear how awful this deal is. This deal is full of holes. Everyone understands that they (the Iranians) tricked them. The more we go deeper into deals and annexes we discover that the Americans and the international community crossed many red lines." Heightening the concern over Parchin, satellite photos have shown Iran has been modifying the site, possibly expanding the nuclear tests and covering up their existence. Given that international inspectors will not be allowed in the site, Iran would apparently be allowed to ramp up its covert nuclear weapons program unfettered. Reports tied the Parchin base to Iran's nuclear program following a mysterious explosion at the site last October. IAEA reports in November 2011 pointed to nuclear weapons development previously conducted at the site, and a 2012 IAEA report likewise confirmed explosives containment vessels were at the site and likely used to test nuclear detonators.

News article:
The head of Iran’s atomic agency said Friday that his country has not signed any separate agreement regarding UN inspections at its Parchin military complex, the Iranian media reported. “The AEOI and the IAEA do not have any separate agreement on visiting the Parchin military site,” Ali Akbar Salehi told the state-run ICANA news agency, referring to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency, respectively. Iran and world powers agreed last week in Vienna to a deal that limits Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for an end to crippling economic sanctions. The IAEA twice inspected Parchin, an installation some 30 km southeast of Tehran, a decade ago, and is now requesting further visits. The UN suspects that nuclear testing has been conducted at the site. Salehi’s remarks appear to contradict a clause in the so-called road map signed by him and IAEA chief Yukiya Amano on July 14, which Amano called “clarification of past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms According to the joint statement released by the two at the time, “Iran and the IAEA agreed on another separate arrangement regarding the issue of Parchin.” Amano’s individual statement at the time reiterates that the road map contains “a separate arrangement regarding the issue of Parchin.” But, Salehi said Friday, “Inspections will be conducted only within the framework of the [road map] agreement,” according to the Tehran Times. Mansour Haqiqatpour, the vice chairman of the Iranian Parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, earlier this week also expressed Tehran’s opposition to a further Parchin inspection, Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency reported. Advertisement “Despite Iran’s goodwill measures, the IAEA has unfortunately once again requested visiting the Parchin military site,” Fars quoted Haqiqatpour as saying. “In recent years, Iran has provided the International Atomic Energy Agency with several times of access to the Parchin military site, and the agency’s inspectors have visited it and found it completely clean of any evidence of nuclear activity,” he said. US lawmakers opposed to the Iran agreement cite “secret side deals” within it, among them provisions for inspections of Parchin. These provisions were not previously revealed to Congress as part of its 60-day review process of the deal, something that is required by law. One day after Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Representative Mike Pompeo (R-KS) said earlier this week that an IAEA official in Vienna had told them about the agreements with Iran, administration officials denied these constituted “secret side agreements” that were kept out of the agreement presented to Congress. “There’s no side deals, there’s no secret deals, between Iran and the IAEA, that the P5+1 has not been briefed on in detail. These kinds of technical arrangements with the IAEA are a matter of standard practice, that they’re not released publicly or to other states, but our experts are familiar and comfortable with the contents, which we would be happy to discuss with Congress in a classified setting,” State Department Spokesman John Kirby said during his daily press briefing.

News article:
The head of Iran’s atomic agency said Friday that his country has not signed any separate agreement regarding UN inspections at its Parchin military complex, the Iranian media reported. “The AEOI and the IAEA do not have any separate agreement on visiting the Parchin military site,” Ali Akbar Salehi told the state-run ICANA news agency, referring to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency, respectively. Iran and world powers agreed last week in Vienna to a deal that limits Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for an end to crippling economic sanctions. The IAEA twice inspected Parchin, an installation some 30 km southeast of Tehran, a decade ago, and is now requesting further visits. The UN suspects that nuclear testing has been conducted at the site. Salehi’s remarks appear to contradict a clause in the so-called road map signed by him and IAEA chief Yukiya Amano on July 14, which Amano called “clarification of past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms According to the joint statement released by the two at the time, “Iran and the IAEA agreed on another separate arrangement regarding the issue of Parchin.” Amano’s individual statement at the time reiterates that the road map contains “a separate arrangement regarding the issue of Parchin.” But, Salehi said Friday, “Inspections will be conducted only within the framework of the [road map] agreement,” according to the Tehran Times. Mansour Haqiqatpour, the vice chairman of the Iranian Parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, earlier this week also expressed Tehran’s opposition to a further Parchin inspection, Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency reported. Advertisement “Despite Iran’s goodwill measures, the IAEA has unfortunately once again requested visiting the Parchin military site,” Fars quoted Haqiqatpour as saying. “In recent years, Iran has provided the International Atomic Energy Agency with several times of access to the Parchin military site, and the agency’s inspectors have visited it and found it completely clean of any evidence of nuclear activity,” he said. US lawmakers opposed to the Iran agreement cite “secret side deals” within it, among them provisions for inspections of Parchin. These provisions were not previously revealed to Congress as part of its 60-day review process of the deal, something that is required by law. One day after Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Representative Mike Pompeo (R-KS) said earlier this week that an IAEA official in Vienna had told them about the agreements with Iran, administration officials denied these constituted “secret side agreements” that were kept out of the agreement presented to Congress. “There’s no side deals, there’s no secret deals, between Iran and the IAEA, that the P5+1 has not been briefed on in detail. These kinds of technical arrangements with the IAEA are a matter of standard practice, that they’re not released publicly or to other states, but our experts are familiar and comfortable with the contents, which we would be happy to discuss with Congress in a classified setting,” State Department Spokesman John Kirby said during his daily press briefing.

News article:
Several very disturbing aspects about the Iran nuclear deal have come to light which require clear thinking and firm action by all P5+1 parties to the agreement. For example it is impossible to reconcile assurances of 24/7 surveillance with the subsequently disclosed provision of 24 days’ notice being required before IAEA will be given access to suspicious sites. It does not require any stretch of imagination to foresee that this period can be used to remove evidence and that it could be extended by spurious arguments about special circumstances or inaccessibility. After all President Obama emphasized in his press conference that Iran cannot be trusted Annex One, Section Q of the agreement requires that IAEA inspectors will first have to ask Iran’s permission to visit a suspicious location: “The IAEA will provide Iran the reasons for access in writing and will make available relevant information.” After that, Iran has the chance to propose “alternative means” to address IAEA suspicions. All of that will stretch the period. According to the Wall Street Journal, Charles Duelfer, former Iraq weapons inspector, told the paper that there is a lot the regime can do to hide material in a few hours, let alone days, allowing room for Iran to maneuver and potentially hide much of what it is doing regarding weapons design or component testing. Side deals and additional causes for concern As Secretary Perry has declared he is not aware of the recently disclosed secret side deals to the Iran nuclear agreement concluded between the IAEA and Iran, one must conclude that the negotiators for the other P5+1 countries are equally uninformed about some critical details relating to the agreement they concluded with Iran. In the circumstances one expects all the P5+1 countries to examine every explicit and implicit detail of this historic agreement and to take care to remove all ambiguities that may lead to future disputes about the true meaning and intent of each clause. After all, rational and responsible behavior require nothing less. According to US Senator Tom Cotton and Congressmen Mike Pompeo they were told that the secret side deals will not be shared with other nations, with Congress, nor with the U.S. public. One of these side deals concerns inspection of the Parchin military base which the IAEA has not been allowed to visit and where it is believed Iran has conducted nuclear-warhead tests.. The other concerns how the IAEA and Iran will resolve outstanding issues on possible military dimensions (PMDs) of Iran’s past nuclear program which Iran has consistently refused to divulge over the years Advertisement In a July 15 Wall Street Journal op-ed Former Department of Energy official William Tobey explained that for inspections to be meaningful, Iran would have to completely and correctly declare all its relevant nuclear activities and procurement, past and present. Apart from being denied access to the secret agreements, the P5+1 countries should be even more concerned that they will not be able to determine whether or not Iran will have complied with them. Evidently Secretary Kerry’s assurances, expressed in the video clip below, that all the information would be received from Iran are far from having been realized. Troubling too, is the revelation that US inspectors have been banned from the IAEA surveillance team although some claim that they are among the most qualified for the task. Advertisement And most incredible of the questions about the nuclear agreement is the suggestion that that the IAEA will not be allowed to collect samples from suspected sites but will have to rely on samples collected and submitted by the Iranians. This would be a “dangerous farce,” according to former CIA intelligence analyst Fred Fleitz in National Review Online. His warning followed an exchange at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, in which John Kerry would not definitively deny a claim by Sen. James Risch that Iran will be responsible for gathering samples from the military base Parchin. Sen. Bob Menendez asked Kerry, “Is it true that the Iranians are going to be able to take the sample, as Senator Risch said? Kerry responded, “As you know, that is a classified component of this. It’s supposed to be discussed on a classified setting… I’m not confirming how it’s happening…I’m saying that we are confident that the IAEA jas the ability to get the answers that they need.” Most disturbing of all, are suggestions from reliable sources that other secret deals probably exist in addition to the two that have been disclosed serendipitously and, as mentioned above, the parliaments of all P5 countries as well as members of the EU need to study the materially very carefully in their own interests bearing in mind their responsibility to future generations.

News article:
As the world’s largest kosher food certification agency, we at the Orthodox Union know a few things about inspection programs. Our “OU” logo is on nearly one million food products made in over ninety countries, and some age old Jewish rules about kosher supervision are relevant to the current debate over the proposed Iran Nuclear Deal. Earlier this year, President Obama said the negotiations with Iran were premised on the notion that we shouldn’t trust Iran and that a deal must provide “vigorous, unprecedented inspections so we know at every point along their nuclear chain exactly what they’re doing…for twenty years…and…even if they wanted to cheat…we would have insights into their program we’ve never had before.” In April, Secretary of Energy Moniz, one of the Deal’s lead negotiators, told Bloomberg News that to assure of this “we expect to have anytime, anywhere access” to sites where Iran might conduct nuclear program activities. Now that the Deal has been concluded, we see that its inspection regime falls short of the benchmarks previously stated by the President and his team. While IAEA inspectors will have access to known nuclear sites in Iran, they must request access to Iranian military or other suspected sites, and Iran can delay such access for at least 24 days — leaving plenty of space for cheating and time for it to be concealed once suspected. Here is where the lessons from kosher laws are instructive. There are clear requirements for providing inspection and certification for a kosher food producer. In the case of a restaurant, where there’s concern that in the frenetic activity of a kitchen mistakes can, and will, happen, a certifying rabbi must be on site constantly; whenever the kitchen is operating the rabbi is there. In the case of a food production factory, where systems and ingredients are more fixed, a certifying rabbi must be able to come and inspect unannounced, whenever he wishes. These modes of inspection are required even when the cooks and owners are trustworthy. In the case of a food producer owned by someone untrustworthy, the certifying rabbi must also have a set of keys to the restaurant or factory. Only these modes of inspection and certification are sufficient to earn a kosher seal of approval. Critically, if a food producer — whether it’s a small corner café or huge Nabisco factory — refuses to accept such inspection rules or violates them, the OU will withhold or rescind its kosher certification and the producer will face the consequences in the marketplace. The OU will not water down its standards to assuage the food producer — he must meet our standards. President Obama and other world leaders acknowledge the Iranian regime has a record of unscrupulousness. The President has asserted that the Deal’s inspection regime is sufficient because Uranium and other nuclear materials have a half-life of eons and can be detected with sophisticated sensors even if removed. But this argument assumes all work related to a nuclear weapons program involves nuclear materials, which it does not, and that Iran will not be able to hide such work in locations that elude suspicion entirely, which they can — they’ve done it before. Thus, there is no question the inspection program in the pending deal falls short. An inspection program that does not allow inspectors to deploy anywhere in Iran with the ability to inspect suspect facilities in the country in real time is clearly insufficient. If Iran indeed intended full compliance with the agreement, and does not plan to pursue a nuclear weapon surreptitiously, they would have nothing to hide and no reason to object to such pervasive inspections. The Obama Administration and its five negotiating partners should have rejected the agreement on this basis alone — and the U.S. Congress should vote to disapprove the Deal on this basis in the next 60 days. Without a truly robust regime of inspection, there’s no doubt the proposed Deal with Iran is not kosher.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, July 29 By Fatih Karimov - Trend: A senior nuclear expert believes that the verification of Iran N-program depends on a secret agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency and this country's full cooperation with the UN body. Secretary of State John Kerry insisted on July 28 the Barak Obama administration has not seen the contents of two side agreements to the Iran nuclear deal reached between that country and the IAEA. Besides an agreement between Iran and P5+1 and signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran also signed an bilateral agreement with the IAEA to solve remaining disputes and answer the UN body's questions in coming weeks. While ignoring the objections of both Iran and U.S. lawmakers, the implementation of nuclear agreement depends on verification of Iran's nuclear program by the IAEA. Tehran says the removal of sanctions based on nuclear agreement could start in four to six months. Iran has also asked the IAEA to keep the mutual agreement hidden. Responding to a question about "how long a time is needed for the IAEA to prove Iran's nuclear activities have been totally peaceful and does the measures, mentioned in the nuclear agreement guarantee this program would remain peaceful?", Toby Dalton, Co-Director, Nuclear Policy Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told Trend on July 29 that "first, how long it will take the IAEA to be able to say that Iran's program is totally peaceful will depend very heavily on how much Iran cooperates in the investigation of past activities. It could be five years, 10 years, or never - it is impossible to say at this point I think until we know more about the cooperation given by Iran to the IAEA, although the agreement does stipulate that the IAEA should be able to say in eight years that Iran's program is peaceful". Iran has agreed to put restrictions in some nuclear activities from eight to 15 years. The nuclear expert added that "second, the point that is not acknowledged by critics of the deal is that without these provisions in place through the deal, there would be no process for the IAEA to determine whether the program is peaceful or not. So compared to what existed before the deal, there is a much better chance the IAEA can carry out a thorough investigation that will reach conclusion". "Third, there is no guarantee, either under the deal or not under the deal and regardless of the verification provisions in place, that Iran's nuclear program will remain peaceful. That is up to Iran. The deal certainly creates incentives and disincentives for Iran that should limit its desire to build nuclear weapons, and my view is that the deal is more likely to ensure that Iran's program is focused on nuclear energy than nuclear weapons than would a simple continuation of the sanctions regime in place," he said. The U.S. Republicans argue that the achieved JCPOA is not enough to ensure Iran's nuclear program would remain peaceful, while Iranian hardliners says the agreement has damaged Iran's rights.

News article:
A U.S. think tank said Iran might be cleaning up its Parchin military site, where some countries suspect experiments may have taken place in a possible atomic weapons program, but Iran denied this on Thursday. The U.S.-based Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) pointed to satellite images showing vehicles and container-like objects being moved at Parchin. Iran said this was part of road works in the area. ISIS said the images were taken after Iran signed a major deal with world powers to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Such activity might complicate the work of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose job it is to judge whether Iran's past atomic activity had any military dimensions, including through access to Parchin. "This renewed activity occurring after the signing of the (July 14 deal) raises obvious concerns that Iran is conducting further sanitization efforts to defeat IAEA verification," the Washington-based think tank said in a report. "This renewed activity may be a last ditch effort to try to ensure that no incriminating evidence will be found," said ISIS, which was founded by a former IAEA nuclear inspector to bring scientific expertise to debates about nuclear weapons. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York issued a statement saying it "strongly denies and rejects the baseless claims about the so-called cleanup operations in the Parchin Military Complex". It said there was construction work at Parchin to repair a road and denounced "the extensive vicious campaign at work ... to poison the positive environment at the global level." "The Islamic Republic of Iran... has never had any military nuclear activity and has never been engaged in any unconventional act that would need a hasty cover-up," it added. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters on Thursday he could not confirm the group's findings but that any cleanup effort would be "cause for concern." He said the United States is confident it knows what has occurred at Parchin as well as its ability to detect previous nuclear activity at any Iranian site. "You can't cover up past nuclear activity very easily. It lasts for decades, even longer," Toner said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest separately played down any such Iranian efforts, although he said at a daily briefing he could not discuss any specific intelligence matters. 'No tolerance' Former IAEA Deputy Director General Olli Heinonen, currently at Harvard University, said there could be multiple reasons for the activity at Parchin, including sanitation or even a desire to test the limits of the nuclear deal. "If this, after the requests of the IAEA to access (the site), ... goes without a contest a precedent has been created," he said. "There should be no tolerance to any possible alterations of a site after access has been requested by the IAEA." According to data given to the IAEA by some member states, Parchin might have housed hydrodynamic experiments to assess how specific materials react under high pressure, such as in a nuclear blast. A diplomat familiar with the Iran file said that the images showed the difficulty of implementing the July deal. "Old habits die hard," he said, referring to Iran, which in the past had failed to declare some of its nuclear activities to the IAEA. The Vienna-based agency, which had no immediate comment on the ISIS report, said in its latest extensive Iran report that it continued to observe vehicles and construction material at Parchin and that activities there since 2012 are likely to have undermined its ability to conduct verification. As a precondition to full sanctions relief, Tehran must provide sufficient information to the IAEA by Oct. 15 to allow it to prepare a final report on its past nuclear program. The Obama administration is defending the nuclear deal with Iran against strong opposition by some lawmakers who also criticize the IAEA for not releasing its own agreement with Iran to resolve concerns about Iran's nuclear past. "I explained that my legal obligation is to protect safeguards confidentiality and this is an essential element of the international safeguards regime," IAEA head Yukiya Amano said after meeting U.S. politicians this week.

News article:
New evidence suggests that vehicles parked near Iran’s Parchin nuclear site have been there for years and may not indicate illicit cleanup efforts, as suggested last week by a Washington research group. Images taken in the past five years show that there have always been approximately 20 vehicles parked at the Parchin site, which is suspected of being used for experiments related to weaponization of Iran’s nuclear technology, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, had suggested that the satellite images may show “Iran’s last-ditch effort to eradicate evidence” of nuclear weapons development at Parchin prior to planned inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Intelligence analyst and former US nuclear-weapons scientist Robert Kelley denied the Washington-based institute’s claims. “The ‘parking lot of death’ has been imaged dozens of times and there are clear patterns of passenger cars parked there,” he said “There have been no indicators of a change in Iranian activities of any significance — no earth moving or sanitization whatsoever.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Kelley also suggested that the vehicles likely belonged to workers at a nearby explosives plant. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saturday that the vehicles were for the purposes of road work, not cleanup. “We have announced that road construction operations are being carried out at Parchin,” Zarif told reporters in Tehran, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. Claims to the contrary, he said, were “lies,” he said. “All allegations against the Islamic Republic of Iran in this ground have always been baseless.” Advertisement Paul Ingram, executive director of the British American Security Information Council, dismissed suspicions of Parchin cleanup efforts as exaggerated. “Parchin is an active site and movement is inevitable. Attempting an impossible cleanup in full view of satellites and just before Congressional votes would be stretching conspiracy theories beyond breaking point,” he said. Satellite images of the vehicles at Parchin were circulated to US lawmakers, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence met with politicians in July to explain their significance. After seeing the images, some of the officials expressed concern that what they were seeing was a possible breach of last month’s nuclear agreement. “I think it’s up to the administration to draw their conclusions. Hopefully this is something they will speak on, since it is in many ways verified by commercial imagery. And their actions seem to be against the grain of the agreement,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said.

News article:
Iranian officials warned Yukiya Amano, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that he would lose their trust in the event that he discloses the content of the Tehran regimes’ secret agreements with the international nuclear watchdog, according to a report Monday in Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency. Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) said that if Amano had disclosed the terms of the agreements, “he himself would have been harmed.” Iran’s Ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, added that the agency had secret agreements with all member states that it was obliged to protect. “The discussions revealed that the secret texts between Iran and the Agency have not even been provided to the US administration,” Najafi said. “For the very same reason, they cannot be presented to the Senate members either.” Ali Akhbar Salehi, the head of the AEOI, said that his agreement to resolve all issues of Iran’s past nuclear work “will be implemented with full respect to Iran’s red lines.” Iran has insisted that inspectors will not be allowed into military sites, including Parchin. Access to Parchin,where Iran is believed to have tested detonators for a nuclear device, is essential for clarifying the full extent of the possible military dimensions (PMD) of Iran’s nuclear program. Last week, satellite images suggested that Iran was further sanitizing Parchin. Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted that the only work going on at Parchin was road construction. However, David Albright, a former weapons inspector and head of the Institute for Science and International Security, responded in an op-ed that was published in The Washington Post that Zarif’s reaction to the revelation showed that Iran’s “recent actions are the start of such a reinterpretation of the agreement.” At the end of July, Iran filed a complaint with the IAEA claiming that the United States was in material breach of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Part of the complaint seemed to be a warning directed towards the IAEA, stating, “in implementing this procedure as well as other transparency measures, the IAEA will be requested to take every precaution to protect commercial, technological and industrial secrets as well as other confidential information coming to its knowledge.” The Iranian understanding of the IAEA’s procedures doesn’t comport with that of former deputy director-general of the IAEA, Olli Heinonen, who said that there are procedures in place that would allow a member state of the IAEA’s board of governors to request the distribution of the same side agreements that Iran claims are absolutely confidential.

News article:
Iran will be allowed to use its own experts to look for signs of nuclear weapons work at a contested military facility, according to The Associated Press, in a disclosure that is sure to further inflame criticism of a secret component of the nuclear deal. The secret agreement signed between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the Parchin facility has emerged as one of the most contested aspects of the multinational deal signed by the U.S., Iran and five other world powers. {mosads}The AP report confirms allegations made by members of Congress, who have not been able to see the document for themselves. Earlier this summer, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said that the details of the agreement “would not be unlike causing athletes to just mail in their own urine specimens in the mail, and us believing that it came from them.” House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other GOP lawmakers were quick to blast the “secret” agreement Wednesday. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) — the No. 2 Senate Republican — said the deal is based on a “remarkably naïve” trust of Iran. “This type of unorthodox agreement has never been done before by the IAEA and speaks to the great lengths our negotiators took to accommodate the Ayatollah despite repeated assurances from the administration that this deal is not based on trust,” Corker added in a statement. The former deputy director general of the IAEA, Olli Heinonen, told the AP that he could not think of a single instance in which a country being monitored for nuclear work has been allowed to do its own investigations. Analysts suspect Iran previously tested detonators for nuclear devices at the Parchin military facility. In recent weeks, intelligence assessments and commercial satellite photographs have suggested that Iran may have been scrubbing the site of any past nuclear work in the run-up to inspections. Under the terms of the agreement, Iran has agreed to provide the IAEA with photos and videos of areas that may be linked to weapons work. Exceptions will be made for “military concerns,” the AP reported. That suggests that international inspectors will not have complete access, even to secondhand reports of suspected weaponization sites. The White House has repeatedly denied allegations that the bilateral agreement between Iran and the IAEA is a “secret side-deal” to the main nuclear accord. Instead, it has insisted that the terms of the IAEA’s inspections regime always remain confidential and that that secret nature of those agreements is a core part of the international body’s work. On Wednesday, it expressed confidence that the IAEA’s ability to investigate Iran’s alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon under the terms of the agreement. “We are confident in the agency’s technical plans for investigating the possible military dimensions of Iran’s former program,” said National Security Council spokesman Ned Price. “Just as importantly, the IAEA is comfortable with arrangements, which are unique to the agency’s investigation of Iran’s historical activities.” Price declined to comment on the details of the report. Administration officials have not been able to review the text of the agreement between Iran and the IAEA themselves, but they have maintained that they have been fully briefed on their terms and are “satisfied” by what they have heard. Those briefings have been relayed to members of Congress by officials, including IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano, though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed frustration that they cannot get the agreements’ actual text. –Jordan Fabian contributed to this report, which was updated at 6:26 p.m.

News article:
(JTA) — Iran has a secret agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency enabling it to choose its own experts to inspect its Parchin nuclear site. In a finding that could have implications for the nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, The Associated Press reported Wednesday that it had obtained a document outlining a “separate side agreement worked out between [the United Nations agency] and Iran.” While the United States and the five other world powers that negotiated the Iran nuclear deal were “not party to this agreement,” they “were briefed on it by the IAEA and endorsed it as part of the larger package,” the AP reported. Under the agreement, the IAEA allows Iran “to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence or activities that it has consistently denied — trying to develop nuclear weapons,” the article said. While the document obtained by the AP is a draft, and not the final version of the agreement, one official familiar with its contents told the news service it “doesn’t differ substantially from the final version.” Opponents of the Iran nuclear deal in Israel and the United States quickly responded to the report. While the White House declined to comment on the reported document, according to the Times of Israel, Israel’s Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said sarcastically, “One must welcome this global innovation and outside-the-box thinking. One can only wonder if the Iranian inspectors will also have to wait 24 days before being able to visit the site and look for incriminating evidence?” He was referring to a section in the nuclear deal that gives Iran 24-days notice prior to inspections of its undeclared nuclear sites. “This side agreement shows that true verification is a sham, and it begs the question of what else the administration is keeping from Congress,” Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, said, according to the Times of Israel. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican senator, said, “Trusting Iran to inspect its own nuclear site and report to the U.N. in an open and transparent way is remarkably naive and incredibly reckless. This revelation only reinforces the deep-seated concerns the American people have about the agreement.”

News article:
(JTA) — Iran has a secret agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency enabling it to choose its own experts to inspect its Parchin nuclear site. In a finding that could have implications for the nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, The Associated Press reported Wednesday that it had obtained a document outlining a “separate side agreement worked out between [the United Nations agency] and Iran.” While the United States and the five other world powers that negotiated the Iran nuclear deal were “not party to this agreement,” they “were briefed on it by the IAEA and endorsed it as part of the larger package,” the AP reported. Under the agreement, the IAEA allows Iran “to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence or activities that it has consistently denied — trying to develop nuclear weapons,” the article said. While the document obtained by the AP is a draft, and not the final version of the agreement, one official familiar with its contents told the news service it “doesn’t differ substantially from the final version.” Opponents of the Iran nuclear deal in Israel and the United States quickly responded to the report. While the White House declined to comment on the reported document, according to the Times of Israel, Israel’s Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said sarcastically, “One must welcome this global innovation and outside-the-box thinking. One can only wonder if the Iranian inspectors will also have to wait 24 days before being able to visit the site and look for incriminating evidence?” He was referring to a section in the nuclear deal that gives Iran 24-days notice prior to inspections of its undeclared nuclear sites. “This side agreement shows that true verification is a sham, and it begs the question of what else the administration is keeping from Congress,” Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, said, according to the Times of Israel. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican senator, said, “Trusting Iran to inspect its own nuclear site and report to the U.N. in an open and transparent way is remarkably naive and incredibly reckless. This revelation only reinforces the deep-seated concerns the American people have about the agreement.”

News article:
In a departure from the usual procedure, Iran will be allowed to use its own “experts and equipment” to provide international inspectors with environmental samples from the military base and suspected nuclear site Parchin, the Associated Press (AP) reported today, citing a classified draft of a side agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that its reporters had seen. Any IAEA member country must give the agency some insight into its nuclear program. Some countries are required to do no more than give a yearly accounting of the nuclear material they possess. But nations— like Iran — suspected of possible proliferation are under greater scrutiny that can include stringent inspections. But the agreement diverges from normal inspection procedures between the IAEA and a member country by essentially ceding the agency’s investigative authority to Iran. It allows Tehran to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence for activities that it has consistently denied — trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has consistently refused to allow a significant investigation of Parchin, despite repeated requests by the international community to disclose the full extent of its past nuclear work, including any possible military dimensions (PMD). Omri Ceren, The Israel Project’s managing director for press and strategy, explained last year why knowing the full extent of Iran’s nuclear research is essential for making the deal “verifiable.” At stake are international concerns over the so-called possible military dimensions (PMDs) of the Iranian nuclear program, the central significance of which has sometimes been underplayed by voices within the foreign policy community. While the P5+1 is charged with negotiating over Iran’s uranium work, its plutonium work, and its ballistic missile work – all of which the Iranians are obligated by half a dozen United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions to roll back – the IAEA seeks to establish the scope of Iran’s overall atomic program, including in those three more specific areas. The mandate stretches beyond full-blown weaponization work, and into military involvement in uranium mining, centrifuge construction, and so on. Full Iranian disclosure is considered a minimum to establishing a robust verification regime: The IAEA can’t verify that Iran has met its obligations to limit uranium work, for instance, unless it knows the full scope of the uranium work that’s being done. PMD-related transparency is seen as not just another issue – say, one that Iran could refuse to trade away by making concessions in other areas – but as a prerequisite to verifying Iranian compliance across all issues. The Israel Project publishes The Tower. Late last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran would not need to reveal the full extent of its past nuclear research in order to receive sanctions relief. A former CIA analyst, Fred Fleitz, responded to the news that Iran would be allowed to provide International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors with environmental samples from suspected nuclear sites by calling the agreement a “dangerous farce,” and arguing that, without “unfettered” access for inspectors, Iran would be able to clean up suspected nuclear sites. Earlier this month, satellite imagery showed that Iran was further sanitizing Parchin. After these charges were dismissed by Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, David Albright, a former weapons inspector and head of the Institute for Science and International Security, wrote that the P5+1 powers’ failure to insist that Iran account for its past nuclear work will “make a mockery of the nuclear deal.” [Photo: Sherlock72 / YouTube ]

After the team had left the site and returned to their hotel, having taken several samples that Syria had authorized, [a] senior inspector bragged that he had taken an unauthorized 'swipe' of a surface in the men's room and had placed the swipe in one of his pockets. On the team's return to IAEA headquarters, this unauthorized swipe was sent off for analysis by just one member state, not several states as is the norm -- a norm respected in the case of the other, authorized samples. Also ignored were IAEA protocols that stipulate that at least two inspectors should always be present when samples are taken, and that swipe materials should be taken from and placed back into clean receptacles, not from or into (possibly contaminated) inspector pockets. In addition, Syria was not informed of the unauthorized swipe and was not given a duplicate of this particular sample, contrary to normal practice. When the samples came back from analysis, it was on the unauthorized swipe that aU [man-made, or anthropogenic Uranium] particles had been found. Natural uranium particles found in some authorized samples were not anthropogenic.

News article:
The State Department on Thursday said “in no way” did the UN atomic watchdog agree to let Iran inspect its own nuclear facilities, rejecting revelations of a secret side deal between the Islamic Republic and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Associated Press reported Wednesday on a previously undisclosed side deal between Iran and the IAEA that would allow Tehran to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it has been accused of using to develop nuclear arms at least a decade ago. The IAEA wishes to investigate the site in order to learn more about Iran’s past activities there. State Department spokesman John Kirby dismissed the report, saying in “no way” would the UN nuclear agency cede its oversight to Iran. “That is not how the IAEA does business,” Kirby said in a statement, according to Reuters. Responding to the report on the side deal, Olli Heinonen, in charge of the Iran investigation as IAEA deputy director general from 2005 through 2010, told AP on Wednesday he could think of no similar arrangement — a country essentially allowed to carry out much of the probe of suspicions against it. The report, based on a document seen by the AP, newly riled Republican lawmakers who have been severely critical of the broader agreement to limit Iran’s future nuclear programs, signed by the Obama administration, Iran and five world powers in July. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The critics have complained that the wider deal is unwisely built on trust of the Iranians, while the administration has insisted it depends on reliable inspections. “President Obama boasts his deal includes ‘unprecedented verification.’ He claims it’s not built on trust,” said the Republican leader of the House, Speaker John Boehner, “But the administration’s briefings on these side deals have been totally insufficient — and it still isn’t clear whether anyone at the White House has seen the final documents.” But in an interview with the AP, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi questioned the significance of the disclosure, noting it relates to investigations of past military work, not nuclear dealings going forward. “I truly believe in this agreement,” she said. Advertisement And she asserted that House Democrats have the votes to uphold any Obama veto of a congressional resolution disapproving of the Iran agreement. Congress will vote next month on such a resolution, but if it is approved Obama has pledged to veto it. A two-thirds vote in the House and Senate would then be necessary to override him — a tough goal to reach even in a Congress controlled by Republicans who will likely oppose Obama unanimously. “The president’s veto would be sustained” if the vote were held today, Pelosi said, adding she hopes it doesn’t get to that point. “But I feel very confident about it. … We will sustain the veto.” The director general of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, reacted to the AP story with a statement Thursday defending the agreement the agency reached with Iran concerning the Parchin military site. He said he was disturbed that the AP report “suggested” that the IAEA has given responsibility for nuclear inspections to Iran. While noting the side deal is confidential, he said, “I can state that the arrangements are technically sound and consistent with our long-established practices. They do not compromise our safeguards standards in any way.” Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman of Iran’s nuclear agency was quoted on state TV calling the AP report “media speculation” without denying its substance. The document seen by the AP is a draft that one official familiar with its contents said doesn’t differ substantially from the final version. He demanded anonymity because he isn’t authorized to discuss the issue. Advertisement It is labeled “separate arrangement II,” indicating there is another confidential agreement between Iran and the IAEA governing the agency’s probe of the nuclear weapons allegations. The document suggests that instead of carrying out their own probe, IAEA staff will monitor Iranian personnel as they inspect the Parchin nuclear site. Iran will provide agency experts with photos and videos of locations the IAEA says are linked to the alleged weapons work, “taking into account military concerns.” That wording suggests that — beyond being barred from physically visiting the site — the agency won’t get photo or video information from areas Iran says are off-limits because they have military significance. IAEA experts would normally take environmental samples for evidence of any weapons development work, but the agreement stipulates that Iranian technicians will do the sampling.

News article:
(JTA) — A White House spokesman said the administration was “confident” in an agreement that would have Iran’s own inspectors examine a suspected weapons site. The Associated Press reported Wednesday on an agreement signed between the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations, and Iran that would let experts and equipment chosen by Iran inspect the Parchin military complex on behalf of the IAEA. Iran has been suspected of nuclear weapons research at Parchin. The Iranian inspectors would then report their findings to the IAEA. On Wednesday, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the Obama administration supported the arrangement. The administration is “confident in the agency’s technical plans for investigating the possible military dimensions of Iran’s former program,” Price said, according to AP. “The IAEA has separately developed the most robust inspection regime ever peacefully negotiated.” The report’s revelation has met harsh criticism from Israeli and American opponents of the agreement reached last month over Iran’s nuclear program between six world powers, including the United States, and Iran. On Wednesday, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, the government’s point man on Iran, released a bitingly sarcastic response to the report. “One must welcome this global innovation and outside-the-box thinking,” he said. “One can only wonder if the Iranian inspectors will also have to wait 24 days before being able to visit the site and look for incriminating evidence?” Steinitz was referring to a provision in the original agreement that allows for a 24-day waiting period before international inspections of undeclared sites with suspected nuclear activity. That deal eases sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.

News article:
Israel on Thursday demanded the publication of undisclosed agreements reached between Iran and the UN International Atomic Energy Agency, after a report on part of the accord detailed Iran’s ability to police itself at a suspected military nuclear site. An Israeli diplomatic official said the report had proven Israeli opposition to the nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers correct. “There is just one safe way to verify this report: for the world powers to publicize all appendixes to the nuclear deal with Iran,” a diplomatic official said. The IAEA has refused to publicize details of the agreements it reached with Tehran, but on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported the nuclear watchdog ceded the responsibility of nuclear inspections at the Parchin military complex to Tehran officials. The IAEA inspection of Parchin, a site believed by some experts to be where Iran has previously experimented with high-explosive detonators for nuclear arms, is linked to a broader probe of allegations that the Islamic Republic has worked on atomic weapons in the past. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The more details we learn about the Iran deal the more we realize that our worries were justified and correct,” the Israeli official said. The Parchin deal is a side agreement worked out directly between the IAEA and Iran, and is not linked directly to the multilateral nuclear deal signed on July 14, though the US says it will only ease sanctions once the atomic watchdog gives its stamp of approval. The United States and five other world powers that signed the July 14 nuclear agreement were not party to the Parchin deal but were briefed on it by the IAEA and endorsed it as part of the larger package. The IAEA said the organization was required by law not to reveal the details of its agreements with Iran. Advertisement Earlier on Thursday, the IAEA said it was was satisfied with arrangements concerning the inspection of Iranian military facilities, and an agency spokesman said the arrangements were “consistent with the IAEA verification practice and they meet the IAEA requirements.” IAEA head Yukiya Amano called the agreement “technically sound” and said the AP report had misrepresented his agency’s work. The White House also endorsed the confidential arrangements, and said it was “confident” in the abilities of the IAEA to monitor and inspect the possible military dimensions on Iran’s past nuclear work and was “comfortable” with agreement between the IAEA and Tehran to ensure compliance with the nuclear deal. Iran has refused access to Parchin for years. Based on US, Israeli and other intelligence and its own research, the IAEA suspects that the Islamic Republic may have experimented with high-explosive detonators for nuclear arms at that military facility. The IAEA has also repeatedly cited evidence, based on satellite images, of possible attempts to sanitize the site since the alleged work stopped more than a decade ago. Israel has repeatedly slammed the nuclear deal concluded by the P5+1 powers and Iran, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branding it a historic mistake that will both pave Iran’s path to the bomb and, by lifting sanctions, cement the Islamist regime in power and allow it to fund more terrorist activity and other dangerous regional interventions.

News article:
Reported Nuclear Side Deal Allows Iran to Do Self-Inspections August 20, 2015 by Victor Beattie A draft of a side agreement to the Iranian nuclear agreement between the U.N. atomic watchdog agency and Tehran will allow Iran to use its own inspectors to investigate the secretive Parchin nuclear site, the Associated Press reported. The revelation comes just weeks before the U.S. Congress votes on whether to reject the deal. The Obama administration expressed confidence Wednesday in the technical plans of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for investigating Parchin, a military base south of Tehran, and previous possible military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear program. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said that while familiar with the contents, he would not comment directly on the purported draft IAEA document. "The IAEA is comfortable with arrangements which are unique to the agency’s investigation of Iran’s historical activities," Kirby noted. "When it comes to monitoring Iran's behavior going forward, the IAEA has separately developed the most robust inspection regime ever peacefully negotiated to ensure Iran’s current program remains exclusively peaceful – the overarching objective" of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. ​​Routine deal Kirby described the confidential arrangement between Iran and the IAEA as routine with other nations. "What the deal has endorsed is ensuring that ... possible military dimensions of their program have been adequately addressed by the IAEA.," he said. "That is what the P5+1 has endorsed. ... That process, that goal, that achievement is part of the roadmap going forward because, as we said, until those concerns are adequately addressed by the IAEA, there can be no sanctions relief under this deal," Kirby added. The side agreement, known as "separate arrangement 2," diverges from normal procedures, AP reported, by allowing Iran to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence of activities it has consistently denied: trying to develop nuclear weapons. ​​US congressional reaction But House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said, "International inspections should be done by international inspectors. Period." "Congress must now consider whether this unprecedented arrangement will keep Iran from cheating. This is a dangerous farce," he said in a statement. Congress is expected to vote on the Iran nuclear agreement when it returns from a recess next month. Ambassador James Jeffries, who served in the George W. Bush administration and is now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute on Near East Policy, expressed shock over this latest revelation and insisted the Iranians cannot be trusted. "I’m increasingly of the view that this administration will do anything to avoid challenging or irritating the Iranians," Jeffries said. "This was a country that was pursuing nuclear weapons at that site [Parchin]. I know that. I’ve seen the intelligence. This is going to reverberate very, very broadly around Congress, as it should." ​​Possible veto If Congress passes a vote of disapproval, President Barack Obama has pledged to veto it. Congress would then need a two-thirds vote in both chambers to override the veto. Jeffries said that while the White House will lose votes on this latest report, it is unlikely to derail the agreement. Regional analyst Stephen Zunes of the University of San Francisco said criticism of the draft side agreement is overblown, adding the IAEA has a good track record of monitoring nuclear activity around the world. "They do not let countries get away with self-inspections that would, in any way, threaten their ability to monitor the development, possibly, of nuclear weapons," Zunes said. He said the Parchin facility "has been used for testing new explosives, new engines for missiles and the like, which could have application to nuclear weapons. "However, given that there will be very direct, intrusive inspections regarding the enrichment of uranium, and other activities that could lead to fissile materials, in many ways this is not relevant. If they don’t have the fissile material to develop a nuclear weapon, it's not a threat," he added. 'Most intrusive' inspections Zunes views the overall agreement as containing the most intrusive inspections regime of any country not defeated in war. The IAEA has sought access to Parchin to corroborate intelligence suggesting Tehran conducted tests on nuclear triggering devices. According to the AP, Iran is to provide the IAEA with photos and videos of locations it says are linked to alleged weapons work “taking into account military concerns.” That suggests the agency will be barred from physically accessing the site.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print NCRI – Iran’s regime will be allowed to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it has been accused of using to develop nuclear arms, operating under a secret agreement with the U.N. agency that normally carries out such work, The Associated Press reported on Wednesday. Yet, little attention has been paid to the man whose signature is on the agreement on behalf of Tehran. Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) General Ali Hosseini-Tash, a former Deputy Defense Minister and a key official in charge of the regime’s nuclear weaponization, is the counterpart of the IAEA regarding the inspection of Parchin, which is suspected to be a site for nuclear related activities. IRGC Brigadier General Ali Hosseini-Tash is one of the most prominent officials involved in the Iranian regime’s nuclear weapons program. In his position as head of the research section of the Ministry of Defense and as Deputy Minister of Defense, from February 2004 until September 2005, he oversaw the organ in charge of the weaponization aspect of the nuclear project (at the time called Center for Development of Advanced Defense Technology). On November 19, 2004, in a press conference in Paris, the Iranian Resistance revealed that IRGC Brigadier General and Deputy Minister of Defense Ali Hosseini-Tash was pursuing the nuclear weapons project along with Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and a biological weapons project with an individual named Nader Maghsoudi. Hosseini-Tash reported these activities directly to Ali Shamkhani, the then-Minister of Defense. Parchin site was one of the most important locations used by the Center for Development of Advanced Defense Technology. Saeed Borji, a confidant of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh and an explosives expert, was a key director of this organ. He was in direct contact with the Ukrainian expert Vycheslav V. Danilenko, who oversaw the construction of explosive chamber(s) used in Parchin. Borji was the head of the “Center for Explosives, Blast Research and Technologies” (Farsi acronym METFAZ), a subdivision of the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), which is currently in charge of weaponization projects. Danilenko shared his experiences with Borji. When Parchin was being used for these experiments, Hosseini-Tash directly supervised the organ that worked on weaponization. “Ali Hosseini-Tash is a senior IRGC commander, who has been in charge of advancing Tehran’s bomb-making projects for many years. In this position, he has been intimately involved in every detail of the nuclear weapons program and is fully aware of the program’s vulnerabilities and concealment tactics,” said Shahin Gobadi, of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), based in Paris. “Allowing the Tehran regime to inspect Parchin and provide the results to the IAEA is akin to allowing a murderer to investigate his own murder and provide the relevant DNA to the police,” he said on Saturday. “Keeping these side agreements confidential under the pretext of confidentiality of agreements between the IAEA and the regime not only blocks independent scrutiny of viability of the process but also enables the regime to further cheat and conceal the previous military dimensions of its nuclear work.” “That the official in charge of the weaponization work is apparently going to oversee the implementation of inspection at Parchin makes it palpably clear that Tehran is in no way serious as it relates to transparency and verification and that it has every intention to engage in deception, denial and duplicity regarding its past weaponization work as it has done in the past two decades,” Mr. Gobadi added. The NCRI first revealed Hosseini-Tash’s role in the nuclear weapons program at a press conference on April 28, 2004 by Mr. Mohammad Mohaddessin, Chairman of the NCRI Foreign Affairs Committee.

In his position as head of the research section of the Ministry of Defense and as Deputy Minister of Defense, from February 2004 until September 2005, he oversaw the organ in charge of the weaponization aspect of the nuclear project (at the time called Center for Development of Advanced Defense Technology). On November 19, 2004, in a press conference in Paris, the Iranian Resistance revealed that IRGC Brigadier General and Deputy Minister of Defense Ali Hosseini-Tash was pursuing the nuclear weapons project along with Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and a biological weapons project with an individual named Nader Maghsoudi. Hosseini-Tash reported these activities directly to Ali Shamkhani, the then-Minister of Defense. Parchin site was one of the most important locations used by the Center for Development of Advanced Defense Technology. Saeed Borji, a confidant of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh and an explosives expert, was a key director of this organ. He was in direct contact with the Ukrainian expert Vycheslav V. Danilenko, who oversaw the construction of explosive chamber(s) used in Parchin. Borji was the head of the “Center for Explosives, Blast Research and Technologies” (Farsi acronym METFAZ), a subdivision of the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), which is currently in charge of weaponization projects. Danilenko shared his experiences with Borji. When Parchin was being used for these experiments, Hosseini-Tash directly supervised the organ that worked on weaponization. “Ali Hosseini-Tash is a senior IRGC commander, who has been in charge of advancing Tehran’s bomb-making projects for many years. In this position, he has been intimately involved in every detail of the nuclear weapons program and is fully aware of the program’s vulnerabilities and concealment tactics,” said Shahin Gobadi, of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), based in Paris. “Allowing the Tehran regime to inspect Parchin and provide the results to the IAEA is akin to allowing a murderer to investigate his own murder and provide the relevant DNA to the police,” he said on Saturday. “Keeping these side agreements confidential under the pretext of confidentiality of agreements between the IAEA and the regime not only blocks independent scrutiny of viability of the process but also enables the regime to further cheat and conceal the previous military dimensions of its nuclear work.” “That the official in charge of the weaponization work is apparently going to oversee the implementation of inspection at Parchin makes it palpably clear that Tehran is in no way serious as it relates to transparency and verification and that it has every intention to engage in deception, denial and duplicity regarding its past weaponization work as it has done in the past two decades,” Mr. Gobadi added. The NCRI first revealed Hosseini-Tash’s role in the nuclear weapons program at a press conference on April 28, 2004 by Mr. Mohammad Mohaddessin, Chairman of the NCRI Foreign Affairs Committee.

International monitoring of Iran’s nuclear program could cost $10.5 million per year, according to The Associated Press. Under the nuclear agreement reached last month, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is affiliated with the United Nations, will be responsible for monitoring Iran’s compliance with certain requirements of the deal. On Monday, the AP reported it had obtained a document from the IAEA detailing the cost estimates of that effort. The document will be presented at a special IAEA meeting on Tuesday, according to the report. {mosads}The costs are calculated from the time the deal is implemented, which will be sometime after it’s officially adopted on Oct. 18, the AP said. AP reports that the deal’s monitoring effort, which would apply to the next 15 years, could total $157 million. The IAEA has also developed side deals with Iran that are related to the main Iran nuclear agreement. The agency has not publicly released these documents. Last week, however, the AP reported that one document it had obtained showed that the IAEA had agreed to allow Iranian experts and equipment to inspect a military site. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers have demanded access to these documents. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a key appropriator and GOP presidential contender, has threatened to withhold funding for the IAEA until those documents are provided to Congress. Both chambers are expected to vote on a resolution in mid-September disapproving of the Iran nuclear deal.

Iran says 'will not accept' leaks of secret data by IAEA Iran Press TV Aug 25, 2015 1:11PM Iran has called on the UN nuclear monitoring body to guarantee the confidentiality of information it will collect for verifying the peaceful nature of Tehran’s nuclear program. Iran’s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that the body should “exercise utmost vigilance to ensure full protection of all confidential information coming to its knowledge” during its inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities under Tehran’s nuclear agreement with the six world powers. “We will not accept any kind of leakage of classified information by anyone,” Reza Najafi said. He reiterated Iran’s commitment to the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), inked between Iran and the six powers – the US, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany – in July. Najafi also said Iran hopes for the “meaningful realization of fundamental shift” in the UN Security Council’s approach toward its nuclear dossier, following Resolution 2231 adopted in confirmation of JCPOA. Roadmap technically sound: Amano Also on Tuesday, the IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in a statement to the Board of Governors that Iran's recent agreement with the nuclear monitoring agency is "technically sound and consistent with established IAEA safeguards practices.” He emphasized that the agreement did not “compromise” the agency’s standards “in any way.” In line with a roadmap signed between Iran and the IAEA in mid-July, Tehran provided the agency with explanations in writing and related documents on August 15 in order to clarify past and present outstanding issues pertaining to its nuclear program, Amano said. As agreed in the roadmap, all activities are set to be completed by October 15, the IAEA chief said. He added that he would present his final assessment of Iran's nuclear activities to the Board of Governors by December 15. “As with all my reports, this assessment will be factual and impartial,” Amano said. Iran’s Vice President and Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, and the IAEA chief signed a roadmap for “the clarification of past and present issues” regarding Iran’s nuclear program in the Austrian capital, Vienna on July 14. The roadmap was aimed at accelerating and strengthening cooperation and dialogue between Iran and the IAEA with a view to resolving all outstanding issues by the end of 2015. Amano also expressed the IAEA’s readiness to “undertake the necessary work” regarding the JCPOA, noting that Iran and the P5+1 group of powers would set up a joint panel to monitor the implementation of the JCPOA. As requested by the UN Security Council, Amano added, Iran and the joint commission should “consult and exchange information, where appropriate, as specified in the JCPOA.” “We are ready to do this if authorized by the Board [of Governors],” the IAEA head said. He also noted that the IAEA will require an additional 9.2 million euros (10.6 million dollars) annually to conduct its inspection of Iran's nuclear facilities as required by the JCPOA. “The combination of comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol, together with the verification and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA, represents a very robust verification mechanism in Iran,” Amano said. He expressed hope that the sides would make full use of the current “historic opportunity” to resolve the Iran nuclear issue.

News article:
Iran’s role in inspecting its military facility and suspected nuclear site at Parchin, which was detailed in a recently leaked draft of a side agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Islamic Republic, departs “significantly from well-established and proven safeguards practices,” according to an analysis (.pdf) by Olli Heinonen, the former deputy director-general of the IAEA, that was published this week. Much of the current concerns arise from the reported arrangements worked out between the IAEA and Iran in the side documents to address PMD issues. If the reporting is accurate, these procedures appear to be risky, departing significantly from well-established and proven safeguards practices. At a broader level, if verification standards have been diluted for Parchin (or elsewhere) and limits imposed, the ramification is significant as it will affect the IAEA’s ability to draw definitive conclusions with the requisite level of assurances and without undue hampering of the verification process. According to Heinonen, the dilution of the verification regime at Parchin, which is crucial for establishing the extent of Iran’s past nuclear work and detecting any future illicit activities, is particularly significant given that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) will allow Iran to remain “a nuclear threshold state with a breakout time of about a year for the first ten years if the JCPOA is fully implemented.” Parchin and the PMD issues, given their relevance to understanding how far Iran has gone towards designing a nuclear weapon and its impact on overall safeguards, mean that confidence in IAEA verification cannot be set at a lower bar than accepted in the past. The fact is that under the JCPOA, the Islamic Republic retains a sizable nuclear infrastructure with a uranium-enrichment program exceeding its practical needs. In other words, Iran remains a nuclear threshold state with a breakout time of about a year for the first ten years if the JCPOA is fully implemented. Furthermore, Iran remains in non-compliance with its non-proliferation undertakings. This makes it all the more important that the IAEA is able to establish a credible baseline to ensure that Iran has halted its PMD activities and is able to monitor and provide early warning if such activities resume. If the parts of the leaked document and statements about Iranian sample taking at Parchin are correct, it raises questions that must be answered. Inspections are at the heart of the IAEA’s work, and the IAEA must have the opportunity to explain its decisions concerning Iran. At this stage, the said document has been judged within the IAEA to be too sensitive for public comment. The Agency Secretariat has decided against sharing it with its governing Board. But partial truths can be dangerous. The issue of confidentiality is an important matter for the IAEA. However, it should not be used as a blanket to stop legitimate questions, particularly regarding verification methods at Parchin. Historically, the IAEA has not viewed such issues as confidential. The IAEA and its member states have disclosed much more detailed facility-specific approaches at regular safeguards symposia. Additionally, in 2007 the IAEA Iran Work Plan6 addressing outstanding issues, accumulated over several years, was made available to all IAEA member states, and the Board also received a 2012 document from Iran related to very specific PMD questions,7 which happened while the IAEA was negotiating with Iran for greater clarity and access. Heinonen argued that, given the doubts about the reported inspections regime at Parchin, it would be advisable for “the IAEA and Iran, with support from the United States, to seek the release of the document in question,” and to address all relevant concerns about the inspections process for Parchin. He further noted that, in the past, such protocols have not been confidential. Heinonen concluded by writing that the issue isn’t “a matter of forcing a confession from Iran,” but rather helping the IAEA determine whether “Iran’s nuclear program remains purely peaceful.” Under the terms of the side agreement reached between the IAEA and Iran, a draft of which was published by the Associated Press (AP) last week, Tehran will be allowed to collect the evidence that the IAEA will evaluate to determine whether illicit nuclear work was ongoing at the Parchin military site. Iran is believed to have previously conducted experiments dealing with the detonation of a nuclear bomb at Parchin. The AP report sparked significant controversy, which Tom Nichols characterized as “attacking the reporters, rather than the story,” in a critique published in The Daily Beast. Heinonen has previously written that the IAEA has mechanisms that would allow for the side deals to be made available to its Board of Governors, of which the United States is a member. However, Iran has been adamant about not disclosing the contents of any side agreements, with Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) saying that if Yukiya Amano, the director-general of the IAEA, had disclosed the contents of the agreements, “he himself would have been harmed.” [Photo: AJC Berlin / YouTube ]

News article:
VIENNA (AP) — Iran has provided a “substantive volume” of information to the U.N. atomic agency on allegations that it worked on nuclear arms, the agency’s chief said Tuesday, but declined to characterize the value of the documents. Yukiya Amano said it would be premature to say how useful the information given by Iran last week would be in the investigation being conducted by his International Atomic Energy Agency. “We need to see the whole picture to have an assessment,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the IAEA’s 35-nation board, convened to seek approval — and funds — for the agency’s assigned task of monitoring the July 14 Iran nuclear deal. That deal between Iran and six world powers seeks to crimp Iran’s present nuclear programs that could be turned to making nuclear arms in exchange for sanctions relief for Iran, and is formally separate from the IAEA probe of the suspected past weapons work. But Amano must make a determination by Dec. 15 on whether or not the allegations are true in order for full easing of sanctions to kick in, and has signed an arrangement with Iran that commits Tehran to cooperate with the probe. Tehran has long described the allegations as based on false intelligence from the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and the arrangement is a test of whether the IAEA will be able to progress after nearly a decade of essential deadlock in trying to follow up on the suspicions. While Amano refused to discuss what Iran has handed over so far, a diplomat familiar with the probe said that Tehran has provided more than 100 pages of documents and related material. He said the information is a combination of documents the agency already is familiar with —meant to back up Iranian assertions that the accusations are lies — and new material that has yet to be evaluated. The diplomat demanded anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss confidential information. This article appeared in print .

News article:
VIENNA (AP) — Iran has provided a “substantive volume” of information to the U.N. atomic agency on allegations that it worked on nuclear arms, the agency’s chief said Tuesday, but declined to characterize the value of the documents. Yukiya Amano said it would be premature to say how useful the information given by Iran last week would be in the investigation being conducted by his International Atomic Energy Agency. “We need to see the whole picture to have an assessment,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the IAEA’s 35-nation board, convened to seek approval — and funds — for the agency’s assigned task of monitoring the July 14 Iran nuclear deal. That deal between Iran and six world powers seeks to crimp Iran’s present nuclear programs that could be turned to making nuclear arms in exchange for sanctions relief for Iran, and is formally separate from the IAEA probe of the suspected past weapons work. But Amano must make a determination by Dec. 15 on whether or not the allegations are true in order for full easing of sanctions to kick in, and has signed an arrangement with Iran that commits Tehran to cooperate with the probe. Tehran has long described the allegations as based on false intelligence from the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and the arrangement is a test of whether the IAEA will be able to progress after nearly a decade of essential deadlock in trying to follow up on the suspicions. While Amano refused to discuss what Iran has handed over so far, a diplomat familiar with the probe said that Tehran has provided more than 100 pages of documents and related material. He said the information is a combination of documents the agency already is familiar with —meant to back up Iranian assertions that the accusations are lies — and new material that has yet to be evaluated. The diplomat demanded anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss confidential information. This article appeared in print .

The cabinet approved today's reform in Israel Electric Corporation following two and a half hours of tumultuous debate. Despite criticism by minister from the Jewish Home Party and objections by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the vote was not postponed and the cabinet unanimously approved the reform. During the debate, Netanyahu again raised the subject of the state's petition to the High Court of Justice against the right of IEC workers to go on strike in opposition to structural changes in the economy and commented on the power of the workers' committees in monopolies. At the same time, the state is likely to announce in the coming days the withdrawal of its High Court of Justice petition against the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the IEC workers' committee, following today's cabinet approval of the reform in IEC. The agreement was approved unanimously after both Netanyahu and Minister of Education Naftali Bennett admitted that "An electricity sector with reform is better than one without reform." Netanyahu said during the discussion that although the bottom line was that he supported the agreement, "There is a bottom line below the bottom line." Netanyahu noted in this context that while from a historical perspective, organized labor had grown following the industrial revolution and in the circumstances of child labor and exploitation of workers, "The situation today is the opposite, and people have to be protected from the committees."

Giving his coalition partners an “unequivocal” ultimatum, the head of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party said Monday that if a bill that exempts his community’s seminary students from the military draft is not passed into law in the next seven weeks, the party will leave the government, likely spelling its untimely end. “It needs to pass its three readings by the end of this legislative session, otherwise we will leave,” Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman told Army Radio, referring to the Knesset’s summer sitting which comes to an end on July 22. “If the law doesn’t pass, we are leaving the government, unequivocally.” Litzman’s threat, not his first of this nature, comes ahead of a September deadline set by the High Court of Justice for the Knesset to re-legislate a previous exemption that the court disqualified on the grounds that it violated principles of equality. In September 2017, the High Court of Justice struck down a law exempting ultra-Orthodox men engaged in religious study from military service, saying it undermined the principle of equality before the law. However, the court suspended its decision for a year to allow for a new arrangement to be put in place, giving the government the option to pass a new law. After a similar ultimatum was made by UTJ during the Knesset’s winter session, coalition partners reached a last minute deal to cooperate on the contentious issue in order to reach an agreement before the deadline. But a compromise agreement still remains elusive, with Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman vowing that his staunchly secular Yisrael Beytenu party would not fold in the face of demands made by their ultra-Orthodox coalition partners. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The ultra-Orthodox parties have submitted two parallel bills on the military draft. The first, a quasi-constitutional Basic Law, would enshrine long-term Torah study as a recognized form of official service to the state in lieu of military service. The second bill would force the Defense Ministry to grant deferrals to yeshiva students, and refers back to the proposed Basic Law repeatedly in defending the arrangements. The ultra-Orthodox parties have long been opposed, on principle, to supporting Basic Laws. According to the March deal, the ultra-Orthodox conscription bills would be shelved until the Defense Ministry presented its own recommendations for amendments, which would then be brought for a Knesset vote. But Litzman said he has seen no progress from the Defense Ministry. Advertisement “I don’t know anything about their proposal. No one has spoken to me,” he said. “I’ve told the prime minister that we will not support a bill that we have not been involved with. Either we pass a bill that we accept or we go to elections.” Speaking at his Yisrael Beytenu Knesset faction meeting on Monday, Liberman said that the Defense Ministry proposals had been due to be presented to him on Sunday but that the committee working on them requested a extension of several days. He said that once the recommendations are presented to him, which he expects to happen this week, “I will read them and assess them, and if they are acceptable, we will present them [to the Knesset] next week.” With coalition Knesset members numbering 66 of the 120-seat legislature, the loss of UTJ’s six seats would almost certainly bring about new elections. “I’m not scared of elections,” Litzman said. “The polls show that it’s OK.” While the issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a contentious one in Israel — revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas, or seminaries, should be called up for compulsory military service like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population — months of sporadic street protests have recently been organized by the so-called Jerusalem Faction, which refuses to have any connection with the military. Advertisement Although ultra-Orthodox Israelis are exempted from enlistment, they are required to report to enlistment offices in order to sign a deferral of service, which Jerusalem Faction rabbinic leaders order their students not to do. The protests, usually focused in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, and Beit Shemesh, have led to violent clashes with police. Ultra-Orthodox seminary students have been largely exempt from Israel’s military draft since then-defense minister David Ben-Gurion exempted 400 students from service in 1949 on the grounds that “their studies are their craft.” Over the years, the High Court of Justice has struck down a number of changes to the laws regarding ultra-Orthodox exemptions from military service, finding them to be a violation of the principle of equality.

Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman asserted Sunday that the ultra-Orthodox parties would not quit the government over the Haredi draft law, warning that anyone who did topple the coalition would "pay the price." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "It doesn't look like anyone has anywhere to go. Anyone who breaks a functioning, effective right-wing government, I believe would pay a heavy price," Lieberman told Ynet in an interview. "I don't think the ultra-Orthodox have an interest in going to elections over the draft law of all things," he added. Lieberman presented the defense establishment's report on the IDF draft law to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday morning. Defense Minister Lieberman (Photo: Meir Ohayon) "We'll try to reach broad agreements in the coalition and bring the bill (to a vote) despite the tight timeframe," Netanyahu said. “I believe it is a very measured draft law, built on two different parametres,” Lieberman claimed. “When I set up a committee, I determined two criterias: one, to bypass The Chief of the General Staff, two, to bypass the The High Court. Between these aspects you can establish a state law, a serious and not a political one," the defense minister explained. "Professionals have drafted this law, without political intervention. It is not designed to gain more votes or to put anyone down, only to solve problems which have been on the table for too many years. If there is a practical and state approach to the draft law, I believe we will pass this difficutl hurdle,” Lieberman explained. The Defense Minister added “Firstly, I gave a free hand to the professionals because it’s obvious that I have a private and political agenda and I tried to steer clear of that and from agendas of other people. Today I am examining all the details, goals and quotas, sanctions both economical and general, etc.” He also approached the issue of a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Haredim outside an IDF draft office (Photo: Yuval Chen) “First of all, we need to understand why the civil life in Gaza is so challenging, and there are reasons for that. For a start, it’s Mahmoud Abbas, who only last week transferred half the salaries for April, without talking about May, and amid the holiday Ramadan as well," he said. “The second reason is that Hamas is not prepared to divert a single dollar from its spending on tunnels and missiles for the good of the Gaza residents," Lieberman argued. "$260 million was invested by Hamas in 2017 in building tunnels and in manufacturing rockets, and they’re not ready to spend a even dollar on health services or water and electricity infrastructure.” The third and most important reason, he continued, was that "if the Palestinians want a humanitarian gesture, we have to get a humanitarian gesture from them in return.” The defense minister asserted that the Gazans “don’t deserve” humanitarian relief until the bodies of IDF soldiers and the Israeli citizen Avera Mengistu which are being held by Hamas are returned to Israel. He further claied that Hamas only wants relief measures such as the lifting of the blockade to smuggle weapons and Iranian agents rather than to promote economic development. Economic relief, he insisted, would not calm the situation. “Those who say it’s that simple are delusional. Like those who said 'land in exchange for peace.' We left Gaza and got missiles and tunnels in return. Anyone who preaches that economic relief will put an end to terror, to protests near the border or to incendiary kites, is wrong and misled—plain and simple. It would not make a difference to our conflict with Hamas.” IDF tanks in the Golan Heights (Photo: AFP) According to Lieberman, Israel's main concern is Iran's presence in Syria and pushing Tehran's forces away from the Golan Heights. "All we're interested in when it comes to Syria is the complete evacuation of Iranian and Hezbollah forces. Nothing short of that," he said. "This is our position, and we're having a dialogue about this with the entire international community, including Russia and the United States," he added. "I think our position is clear to everyone, to all of those involved here in the Middle Eastern arena. When we have reached an agreement and get willingness from everyone to act to remove Iranian and Hezbollah forces, then we could say we've achieved our goal." The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Hezbollah and Iranian militia fighters have reportedly returned to southern Syria dressed in Syrian army uniforms and under Syrian flags. Lieberman, however, said only "a few dozen" Hezbollah members remain in southern Syria, "who serve as advisers or goaders." Turning to the upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Lieberman said he believed that an agreement would be reached between the two countries over Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal, and that it would ultimately have an impact on tensions between Israel and Iran. “It is important that the Trump administration achieves the main goal, which is dismantling North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and its nuclear capabilities," he said. "Of course, we would welcome this. A dramatic change of this kind would influence all international spheres, including Iran and its nuclear program. It is undoubtedly a dramatic thing.”

Haredim outside an IDF draft office (Photo: Yuval Chen) “First of all, we need to understand why the civil life in Gaza is so challenging, and there are reasons for that. For a start, it’s Mahmoud Abbas, who only last week transferred half the salaries for April, without talking about May, and amid the holiday Ramadan as well," he said. “The second reason is that Hamas is not prepared to divert a single dollar from its spending on tunnels and missiles for the good of the Gaza residents," Lieberman argued. "$260 million was invested by Hamas in 2017 in building tunnels and in manufacturing rockets, and they’re not ready to spend a even dollar on health services or water and electricity infrastructure.” The third and most important reason, he continued, was that "if the Palestinians want a humanitarian gesture, we have to get a humanitarian gesture from them in return.” The defense minister asserted that the Gazans “don’t deserve” humanitarian relief until the bodies of IDF soldiers and the Israeli citizen Avera Mengistu which are being held by Hamas are returned to Israel. He further claied that Hamas only wants relief measures such as the lifting of the blockade to smuggle weapons and Iranian agents rather than to promote economic development. Economic relief, he insisted, would not calm the situation. “Those who say it’s that simple are delusional. Like those who said 'land in exchange for peace.' We left Gaza and got missiles and tunnels in return. Anyone who preaches that economic relief will put an end to terror, to protests near the border or to incendiary kites, is wrong and misled—plain and simple. It would not make a difference to our conflict with Hamas.” IDF tanks in the Golan Heights (Photo: AFP) According to Lieberman, Israel's main concern is Iran's presence in Syria and pushing Tehran's forces away from the Golan Heights. "All we're interested in when it comes to Syria is the complete evacuation of Iranian and Hezbollah forces. Nothing short of that," he said. "This is our position, and we're having a dialogue about this with the entire international community, including Russia and the United States," he added. "I think our position is clear to everyone, to all of those involved here in the Middle Eastern arena. When we have reached an agreement and get willingness from everyone to act to remove Iranian and Hezbollah forces, then we could say we've achieved our goal." The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Hezbollah and Iranian militia fighters have reportedly returned to southern Syria dressed in Syrian army uniforms and under Syrian flags. Lieberman, however, said only "a few dozen" Hezbollah members remain in southern Syria, "who serve as advisers or goaders." Turning to the upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Lieberman said he believed that an agreement would be reached between the two countries over Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal, and that it would ultimately have an impact on tensions between Israel and Iran. “It is important that the Trump administration achieves the main goal, which is dismantling North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and its nuclear capabilities," he said. "Of course, we would welcome this. A dramatic change of this kind would influence all international spheres, including Iran and its nuclear program. It is undoubtedly a dramatic thing.”

News article:
With a legislative deadline imposed by ultra-Orthodox parties fast approaching, the Defense Ministry published Monday night its recommendations for reaching “a durable, realistic and relevant arrangement” on a bill to formalize limited ultra-Orthodox conscription. The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a contentious one in Israel — revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas, or seminaries, should be called up for compulsory military service like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population. The new proposal sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the seminaries where they study. “The number of recruits from the ultra-Orthodox community has increased 10-fold in the last decade. We should continue the efforts to progressively increase the amount of recruits to the IDF and National Service,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement. “The IDF has a need for ultra-Orthodox recruits and the ability to absorb them in the best possible way for the army in a way that contributes to their continued employment in the work market,” it said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The proposal specifically recommends “setting new goals for the IDF and National Service draft, annual increase in those serving, significant financial sanctions on draft dodgers and increasing benefits and remuneration for those who serve.” If adopted, the target for 2018 would be at just below 4,000 recruits with that number increasing by 8 percent per year for three years, 6.5% for the three years after that and 5% for a further four years. If the targets are not met by at least 95%, sanctions in the form of cuts to state fund allocated to ultra-Orthodox yeshivas would be put in place, increasing each year the targets are missed. Advertisement “The principle of universal conscription is a key value and is necessary to preserve the IDF as the national state army,” the recommendations explained. But the ultra-Orthodox community would still enjoy various exemptions from the regular conscription law, such as its recruits only being obligated to join the army from the age of 24, and not 18 like the regular draft. The recommendations also create a possible loophole that could inflate the numbers of recruits by allowing those who left the ultra-Orthodox community before the age of 18 to be included within the targets. The recommendations come ahead of a September deadline set by the High Court of Justice for the Knesset to re-legislate a previous exemption that the court disqualified. In September 2017, the High Court of Justice struck down a law exempting ultra-Orthodox men engaged in religious study from military service, saying it undermined the principle of equality before the law. However, the court suspended its decision for a year to allow for a new arrangement to be put in place, giving the government the option to pass a new law. Giving his coalition partners an ultimatum, Yaakov Litzman, the head of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party said last week that if a proposal dealing with the community’s conscription is not passed into law by June 22, when the Knesset summer recess begins, the party will leave the government, likely spelling its untimely end. Advertisement The Defense Ministry said it hoped to create a “durable, realistic and relevant arrangement that will meet the needs of the IDF as an equal and national army, stand up to the Supreme Court ruling cancelling [the previous law] and receive the necessary wide approval in order to become law.” Netanyahu told his Likud party’s lawmakers on Sunday that the legislative process on the bill would start as soon as the Defense Ministry’s recommendations were received in order to complete work on the legislation by the deadline. Coalition sources told The Times of Israel that the bill would likely be presented to the attorney general this week and then to the Ministerial Committee for Legislation next Sunday, where they hope it will receive authorization to be fast-tracked through the Knesset. After a similar ultimatum was made by Litzman’s UTJ during the Knesset’s winter session, coalition partners reached a last-minute deal to cooperate on the contentious issue in order to reach an agreement before the deadline. But a compromise agreement has been elusive, with Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman vowing that his staunchly secular Yisrael Beytenu party will not fold in the face of demands made by its ultra-Orthodox coalition partners. The ultra-Orthodox parties have submitted two parallel bills on the military draft. The first, a quasi-constitutional Basic Law, would enshrine long-term Torah study as a recognized form of official service to the state in lieu of military service. The second bill would force the Defense Ministry to grant deferrals to yeshiva students, and refers back to the proposed Basic Law repeatedly in defending the arrangements. The ultra-Orthodox parties have long been opposed, on principle, to supporting Basic Laws. According to the March deal, the ultra-Orthodox conscription bills would be shelved until the Defense Ministry presented its own recommendations for amendments, which would then be brought for a Knesset vote. Recent months have also seen sporadic street protests organized by the so-called Jerusalem Faction, which refuses to have any connection with the military. Although ultra-Orthodox Israelis are routinely exempted from enlistment, they are required to report to enlistment offices in order to sign a deferral of service, which Jerusalem Faction rabbinic leaders order their students not to do. The protests, usually focused in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, and Beit Shemesh, have led to violent clashes with police. Advertisement Ultra-Orthodox seminary students have been largely exempt from Israel’s military draft since then-defense minister David Ben-Gurion exempted 400 students from service in 1949 on the grounds that “their studies are their craft.” Over the years, the High Court of Justice has struck down a number of changes to the laws regarding ultra-Orthodox exemptions from military service, finding them to be a violation of the principle of equality.

A rabbinical decision-making council of an ultra-Orthodox party in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government called on its lawmakers Thursday to leave the coalition if a bill proposing to formalize limited ultra-Orthodox enlistment in the IDF passes in the Knesset. The ultimatum prompted senior coalition sources, quoted by Channel 10, to say that “the danger of early elections is again on the table,” after disagreements over the issue almost dissolved the government several months ago. The Council of Torah Sages, a body responsible for much of the decision-making for the hasidic members of the United Torah Judaism party (UTJ), instructed the four hasidic MKs out of the party’s six lawmakers to try and change the currently proposed bill, and quit the coalition if it is promoted without their approval. “We will make a demand from Prime Minister Netanyahu that the state request a delay from the High Court of Justice,” a senior source in UTJ was quoted as saying by the Ynet website, referring to a September deadline set by the court for the Knesset to re-legislate a previous exemption that the court disqualified.

After a similar ultimatum was made by Litzman’s UTJ during the Knesset’s winter session, coalition partners reached a last-minute agreement to delay passing a final law until the current summer session.

Earlier Thursday, Defense Minister Liberman defended his ministry’s bill, saying the proposal was a fair middle line on the divisive issue. “The proposal doesn’t fit my own worldview, and certainly not [Shas leader Aryeh] Deri’s or [United Torah Judaism leader Yaakov] Litzman’s, but this bill really is the answer, maybe the best one, to the IDF’s needs,” the defense minister said at a conference at Bar-Ilan University. The ultra-Orthodox parties have submitted two parallel bills on the military draft.

Advertisement Foreshadowing the council’s warning, UTJ head Litzman said last week that if a Haredi-backed proposal dealing with the community’s conscription is not passed into law by July 22, when the Knesset summer recess begins, the party will leave the government, likely spelling its untimely end. After a similar ultimatum was made by Litzman’s UTJ during the Knesset’s winter session, coalition partners reached a last-minute agreement to delay passing a final law until the current summer session. But a compromise agreement has been elusive, with Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman vowing that his staunchly secular Yisrael Beytenu party would not fold in the face of demands made by its ultra-Orthodox coalition partners. The new proposal sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that, if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the yeshivas where they study. The proposal specifically recommends “setting new goals for the IDF and National Service draft, an annual increase in the number of those serving, significant financial sanctions on draft dodgers, and increasing benefits and remuneration for those who serve.” If adopted, the target for 2018 would be set at just below 4,000 recruits, with the number increasing by 8 percent per year for three years, 6.5% for the three years after that and 5% for a further four years. If the draft falls short of 95% of those targets, sanctions in the form of cuts to state funds allocated to ultra-Orthodox yeshivas would be put in place. The fines would increase each year the targets are missed. Advertisement But the ultra-Orthodox community would still enjoy various exemptions from the regular conscription law, such as its recruits only being obligated to join the army from the age of 24, and not 18 like the regular draft. The recommendations also create a possible loophole that could inflate the numbers of recruits by allowing those who left the ultra-Orthodox community before the age of 18 to be included within the targets. Earlier Thursday, Defense Minister Liberman defended his ministry’s bill, saying the proposal was a fair middle line on the divisive issue. “The proposal doesn’t fit my own worldview, and certainly not [Shas leader Aryeh] Deri’s or [United Torah Judaism leader Yaakov] Litzman’s, but this bill really is the answer, maybe the best one, to the IDF’s needs,” the defense minister said at a conference at Bar-Ilan University. The ultra-Orthodox parties have submitted two parallel bills on the military draft. The first, a quasi-constitutional Basic Law, would enshrine long-term Torah study as a recognized form of national service in lieu of military service. The second bill would force the Defense Ministry to grant deferrals to yeshiva students, and refers back to the proposed Basic Law repeatedly in defending the arrangements. According to the March deal, the ultra-Orthodox conscription bills would be shelved until the Defense Ministry presented its own recommendations for amendments, which would then be brought for a Knesset vote.

News article:
Jerusalem – Senior United Torah Judaism MK Moshe Gafni said the Degel Hatorah party’s MKs “all support” new proposed legislation for haredi (ultra-Orthodox) enlistment, seemingly opening up a split with Agudat Yisrael, the other half of UTJ. “With us, we all support the [IDF draft] law,” Ganfi told haredi news website B’Hadrei Haredim on Friday when asked about the bill proposed by a special Defense Ministry committee last week. He added that Degel’s three MKs are waiting for leading haredi authority Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, 95, to finish the shiva mourning period for his son in order to speak with him on the issue and complete the round of consultations the MKs have conducted with other haredi rabbis, before a final decision is made. Gafni’s office later backtracked somewhat, saying “the leading rabbis are the ones who will decide on the enlistment law – and as long as they have not had their input there is no formal decision on the issue.” His comment is significant since it means ostensibly that the other leading rabbis who have been consulted agree to allow passage of the proposed bill, which includes deductions from the state-funded yeshiva budget if IDF enlistment targets from the haredi sector are not met. The notion that there should be negative consequences if haredi men fail to enlist has been fiercely opposed by the sector’s leadership, and the fact that the leading rabbis would agree to this idea is somewhat surprising. Several experts have noted, however, that the targets are not particularly high and the financial penalties for not meeting them not especially severe. That being the case, it appears that Degel’s MKs and rabbis believe the law is the best of a bad situation, and are reluctant to go to war over the bill since such a fight could lead to the collapse of the coalition and act as a political boost for Yair Lapid, perceived as a veritable villain by the haredi leadership. A Degel source told The Jerusalem Post earlier last week that the party did not view the proposed bill as completely objectionable, and that it may be allowed to pass, with changes made before final approval by the Knesset or even after the next elections. On Thursday, Agudat Yisrael’s Council of Torah Sages – comprised of the grand rabbis of the hassidic groups that make up the party – issued a strong statement against the bill, saying if it passed in its current form they would tell their three MKs to quit the government. They did seemingly leave room for negotiation, however, and Aguda sources said it was likely an extension to the September deadline set by the High Court of Justice for legislation would be requested in order to allow more time to haggle over the clauses of the Defense Ministry’s proposed bill.

News article:
Drafting Haredi yeshiva students is an ages-old controversy, which is reignited every few years, stirring up the political arena. The new challenge that has emerged, as was the case in the past, has come from the Supreme Court. From the Haredi perspective, the Supreme Court is the culprit and the only obstacle standing in the way of fully attaining their extortionist demands. It was Israel’s first President Chaim Weizmann who foresaw the ensuing existential battle over the unholy alliance of religion and politics. He wrote in 1947: “There are powerful religious communities in Palestine that now, under a democratic regime, will rightly demand to assert themselves. I think it is our duty to make it clear to them from the beginning that whereas the state will treat the true religious feelings of the community with the highest respect, it cannot turn the clock back to making religion the cardinal principle in the conduct of the state… it shall not control the ministries of state…. There will be a great struggle… I foresee something which will be perhaps reminiscent of the Kulturkampf in Germany, but we must be firm if we are to survive.” As many who follow Israel’s political life know, cries of “wolf, wolf!” foretelling of the government’s imminent collapse are common. Most of these are averted at the last minute either by the coalition government surrendering to the demands of those who hold a gun to their temples; by use of delay tactics (usually by the appointment of a committee to study the issue at hand); or by reaching a creative compromise. Two such crises are on the horizon now. One involves the conversion bill, which we addressed just recently. This week, the Supreme Court has handed Netanyahu some relief by agreeing to a six month postponement of the date the State is required to submit its response to pending petitions involving non-Orthodox conversions. These pending petitions and the anticipated ruling in support of these converts prompted the ultimatum from the Shas party, demanding that a conversion law be passed to preempt this court ruling. The second crisis involves the draft bill. Much like “Who is a Jew,” drafting Haredi yeshiva students is an ages-old controversy, which is reignited every few years, stirring up the political arena. In recent years, it was the 2013-2015 government coalition under pressure from the Yesh Atid party, which legislated a new draft bill, causing upheaval. It was summarily undone once the 2015 coalition was in place due to the Haredi parties’ demands. Every sanction and move towards religious freedom and equality advanced by the previous government were obliterated. The new government met the Haredi demands that no yeshiva student who refused to enlist would be forced to do so, and that no real sanctions would be applied any time soon to either the individuals who dodge the draft or the Yeshivas that provide them with shelter. The new challenge that emerged, as was the case in the past, came from the Supreme Court. It accepted petitions to nullify the new draft bill on constitutional grounds for presenting too serious a breach of the principle of equality. The Court declared the new law to be null and void, setting a date for a year henceforth for its ruling to take effect. That year ends in September 2018, and the race was on to find a new solution. And so, with delay tactics having been exhausted, with no plausible creative compromise on the horizon, and with the realization that even extremely willing political operators would not be able to withstand constitutional-judicial review, came the ominous initiative to castrate the Supreme Court. From the Haredi perspective, the Supreme Court is the culprit and the only obstacle standing in the way of fully attaining their extortionist demands. Their mindset happens to coincide with parallel frustrations on the part of some extreme right-wing political circles; the two have joined forces to bring the Supreme Court to its knees. This was the genesis of the “override clause” initiative, aimed at enabling political machinations to override Supreme Court rulings via counter-legislation. As expected, this is now back on the table. The head of United Torah Judaism faction in the Knesset (the ultra-Orthodox Ashkenazi party), MK Mozes stated this week that “The Council of the Great [Ones] of the Torah of Agudat Yisrael has decided unequivocally not to allow the [new] bill to pass. If it does, we will leave the government and the coalition… If there was the ‘override clause’ we wouldn’t be in this situation… [we should] return to our original bill and add the override clause to it… the IDF does not decide how many students will enlist from one high school or another so I don’t understand the claim that the IDF should be the one to decide how many [yeshiva students] will enlist, rather than the rabbis. Since when are the yeshivas tasked with providing soldiers for the IDF?”

News article:
JERUSALEM (JTA) — Israeli lawmakers gave preliminary approval to a bill that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The legislation, an amendment to the Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law, would widen the scope of current anti-discrimination law. The bill was approved on its first reading by a vote of 37 to 36. It now goes to the Knesset’s House Committee for discussion and amendment, and then must pass a second and third reading in the Knesset plenum to become law. The legislation, which was sponsored by Knesset lawmakers Dov Henin of the Arab Joint List and Michal Rozin of Meretz, is not supported by the ruling government coalition. However, two members of the coalition voted for the legislation. Amir Ohana of the Likud Party, who is openly homosexual, and Merav Ben Ari of the Kulanu Party, who last year had a baby with a gay friend and is raising her by way of shared parenting both broke ranks and voted for the legislation. Coalition chairman David Amsalem told the Times of Israel that he permitted the lawmakers to vote their conscience without fear of reprisal. Under the amendment, wherever Israeli law refers to discrimination, it would automatically also be referring to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. “In view of the changes that have occurred in Israeli law since 1992, and in view of the frequent attacks on the LGBT community owing to sexual orientation or gender identity in the form of discrimination and harassment, the time has come to amend the interpretation law beyond the legal meaning,” according to the explanation accompanying bill, Ynet reported. Meanwhile, a draft bill is circulating in the ruling coalition that would allow same-sex couples to adopt in Israel. Under the proposed legislation, the requirement that only a couple made up of a man and a woman can adopt children would be dropped, Hadashot news reported.

A controversial bill that seeks to settle once and for all the issue of IDF enlistment by the ultra-Orthodox is slated to come up for its first vote in the Knesset plenum as early as next week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday. The contentious legislation is the product of a Defense Ministry committee report published earlier this month. The ministry called the framework “a durable, realistic and relevant arrangement” for ultra-Orthodox conscription. The proposal sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that, if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the yeshivas, or rabbinical seminaries, where they study. Netanyahu’s Haredi coalition partners, the Shas and United Torah Judaism parties, have threatened to oppose the legislation if it advances, and even to destabilize the coalition, in order to torpedo the measure. On Sunday, in a meeting with coalition party leaders, Netanyahu insisted that the bill would move forward to a first or plenum vote, but that “after the first reading, there will be a discussion between all parts of the coalition toward a broad agreement for the second and third readings.” He brushed off the Haredi threats to the coalition, saying, “I don’t want elections, but I’m not afraid of elections. If there are elections, I’ll be okay.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms A bill must pass all three votes in the plenum to become law. At Sunday’s meeting, the heads of both Haredi parties, Shas’s Aryeh Deri and UTJ’s Yaakov Litzman, reiterated their opposition to the bill. “As we’ve said [when the Defense Ministry proposal first came out], we see in Torah study a supreme value for the Jewish people, and will insist that every student of Torah is able to concentrate on his studies without interruption,” Deri said. Advertisement With that, both Shas and UTJ have only vowed to oppose the “current version” of the bill, but have not said they are opposed in principle to its underlying framework. Last week, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman of the secularist Yisrael Beytenu party expressed support for the bill. “I think this is the most balanced, nonpartisan law and I very much hope that we will bring it next week to debate at the special Knesset committee and pass it by the end of the summer session in its second and third readings,” Liberman said. In September 2017, the High Court of Justice struck down a previous law exempting ultra-Orthodox men who were engaged in religious study from military service, saying it undermined the principle of equality before the law. However, the court suspended its decision for a year to allow for a new arrangement to be put in place, giving the government the option to pass a new law by September 1, 2018. The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a contentious one in Israel, revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas should be called up for compulsory military service, like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population. United Torah Judaism’s Litzman said earlier this month that if an ultra-Orthodox-backed proposal dealing with the community’s conscription is not passed into law by July 22, when the Knesset summer recess begins, the party will leave the government, likely spelling its untimely end. Advertisement But Litzman represents the Hasidic half of the UTJ party. The Lithuanian half, headed by MK Moshe Gafni, has been careful to avoid such pronouncements, as has Shas. After a similar ultimatum was made by Litzman during the Knesset’s winter session, coalition partners reached a last-minute agreement to delay passing a final law until the current summer session. But a final compromise agreement has been elusive, with Liberman vowing that his staunchly secular party would not fold in the face of demands made by the ultra-Orthodox.

United Torah Judaism’s Litzman said earlier this month that if an ultra-Orthodox-backed proposal dealing with the community’s conscription is not passed into law by July 22, when the Knesset summer recess begins, the party will leave the government, likely spelling its untimely end. Advertisement But Litzman represents the Hasidic half of the UTJ party. The Lithuanian half, headed by MK Moshe Gafni, has been careful to avoid such pronouncements, as has Shas. After a similar ultimatum was made by Litzman during the Knesset’s winter session, coalition partners reached a last-minute agreement to delay passing a final law until the current summer session. But a final compromise agreement has been elusive, with Liberman vowing that his staunchly secular party would not fold in the face of demands made by the ultra-Orthodox. The ultra-Orthodox parties have submitted two parallel bills on the military draft. The first, a quasi-constitutional Basic Law, would enshrine long-term Torah study as a recognized form of national service in lieu of military service. The second bill would force the Defense Ministry to grant deferrals to yeshiva students, and refers back to the proposed Basic Law repeatedly in defending the arrangements. The March deal delayed action on the issue, until the Defense Ministry presented its recommendations, which happened in the beginning of June.

News article:
A controversial bill that seeks to settle once and for all the issue of IDF enlistment by the ultra-Orthodox is slated to come up for its first vote in the Knesset plenum as early as next week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday. The contentious legislation is the product of a Defense Ministry committee report published earlier this month. The ministry called the framework “a durable, realistic and relevant arrangement” for ultra-Orthodox conscription. The proposal sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that, if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the yeshivas, or rabbinical seminaries, where they study. Netanyahu’s Haredi coalition partners, the Shas and United Torah Judaism parties, have threatened to oppose the legislation if it advances, and even to destabilize the coalition, in order to torpedo the measure. On Sunday, in a meeting with coalition party leaders, Netanyahu insisted that the bill would move forward to a first or plenum vote, but that “after the first reading, there will be a discussion between all parts of the coalition toward a broad agreement for the second and third readings.” He brushed off the Haredi threats to the coalition, saying, “I don’t want elections, but I’m not afraid of elections. If there are elections, I’ll be okay.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms A bill must pass all three votes in the plenum to become law. At Sunday’s meeting, the heads of both Haredi parties, Shas’s Aryeh Deri and UTJ’s Yaakov Litzman, reiterated their opposition to the bill. “As we’ve said [when the Defense Ministry proposal first came out], we see in Torah study a supreme value for the Jewish people, and will insist that every student of Torah is able to concentrate on his studies without interruption,” Deri said. Advertisement With that, both Shas and UTJ have only vowed to oppose the “current version” of the bill, but have not said they are opposed in principle to its underlying framework. Last week, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman of the secularist Yisrael Beytenu party expressed support for the bill. “I think this is the most balanced, nonpartisan law and I very much hope that we will bring it next week to debate at the special Knesset committee and pass it by the end of the summer session in its second and third readings,” Liberman said. In September 2017, the High Court of Justice struck down a previous law exempting ultra-Orthodox men who were engaged in religious study from military service, saying it undermined the principle of equality before the law. However, the court suspended its decision for a year to allow for a new arrangement to be put in place, giving the government the option to pass a new law by September 1, 2018.

The proposed IDF draft bill was passed in the Knesset in its first reading early Tuesday, with 63 MKs voting in favor and 39 voting against. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Knesset Finance Committee Chairman MK Moshe Gafni (United Torah Judaism) and some of Shas's members of Knesset initially left the plenum during the vote, and returned to vote against the bill only after making sure the coalition had the majority it needed to pass the legislation, with Yesh Atid indeed voting in favor. MK Lapid and Deputy Minister Litzman (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) Following the vote, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who is not a member of Knesset and therefore did not vote, praised the passing of the first hurdle toward the legislation's approval. "The Knesset showed responsibility," he wrote on Twitter. "Stateliness has won over media spins and divisions. I hope the bill is approved in its current version in second and third readings as well and in this Knesset session," he added. Ahead of the vote, ultra-Orthodox MKs fiercely argued against the proposed legislation, with United Torah Judaism MK Yisrael Eichler even wondering, "Do you really want the Haredim in the army?" He determined that the Knesset had "no moral right to sanction Torah students. Imagine someone sanctioned students who don't adhere to a certain system of values. Where do you get the nerve to do that? There's a nuclear reactor here dismantling society." Instead of mandatory military service, Eichler proposed "to establish a professional army in which anyone who chooses to enlist will be appreciated and paid properly." Haredim watch the discussion from the Knesset's public gallery (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) The existing Israeli Defense Service Law expires in September after the High Court of Justice deemed it unconstitutional, and so the Knesset must pass an alternative law before then. If a new law is not passed to regulate the exemptions of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students, tens of thousands of them are expected to receive IDF draft orders. The proposed legislation includes planned cuts to the yeshivot's budgets and the use of economic incentives to pressure the Torah study institutions to encourage enlistment, but no criminal sanctions. The enlistment objectives, as stated in the proposal, are that 3,000 yeshiva students will be drafted in the first stage and 600 will volunteer for national service. The plan will be given a two-year adaptation period, in which sanctions won’t be imposed if the yeshivot fail to meet the draft rates. In the third year, yeshivot who fail to encourage enlistment will be hit with economic sanctions if they drop below a 95-percent target. Earlier, Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman threatened to quit the coalition if the IDF draft bill proposal is passed into law. "No one thinks or dreams that if (MK Yair) Lapid supports this bill, that we will support it too," Litzman, who leads the Hasidic Agudat Yisrael faction in United Torah Judaism, said at the Knesset. Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) "We need to get to a situation in which anyone who wants to study at a yeshiva can have an arrangement that allows him to continue studying uninterrupted, and that is why we will vote against the law," he explained. MK Gafni asserted that "had it not been for the Torah students, there would've been no existence to the world." He called on the Torah students "to continue studying the Torah. Those who study should continue and not listen to what's being said here." MK Uri Maklev (UTJ) dismissed the discussion over the law, saying "There's no real debate here, this is a dialogue between deaf people." He also noted that "equality is no value when put against our right to exist." Shas MK Yinon Azoulay also called on yeshiva students to continue studying. "I call on the Torah students, even if you reach a situation in which you have to sacrifice yourselves - don't stop your Torah studies," he said. Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan (Bayit Yehudi) explained to "those who incite against this law" that "We have no intention to go into yeshivot and get Torah students out of there. Anyone who studies Torah and Torah studying is his job will continue studying Torah. But those who stopped studying will enlist. This situation of no enlistments for decades cannot go on." Yesh Atid MK Yair Lapid, whose is in the opposition but is expected to nevertheless vote in favor of the legislation, pointed to the Haredi protests against the legislation taking place in Jerusalem as the Knesset was in session. "As we sit here, Haredi are rioting across Jerusalem, and they understand more Haredim will have to enlist and join the job market," he said. MK Yair Lapid (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) "There is no party more consistent than Yesh Atid on this issue. In the previous Knesset, the prime minister made impassioned speeches about the draft law we led. He and the justice minister (Ayelet Shaked), who were proud of the law, later voted against it," Lapid continued. He was referring to the legislation his party passed while they were in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's third government and the Haredi parties were in the opposition, which was amended in Netanyahu's fourth government after the Haredim returned to the coalition and his own party was left in the opposition. "This is a wound in the heart of Israeli society, and it will not heal until a law will be put on the Knesset's table like the one put there today, and we will all live here together as people who have a shared responsibility," he went on to say. "We need a law like this law so we know we're taking a step toward all of us carrying the same burden—the sacred duty to defend the people of Israel and the State of Israel." "I'm not the one who signed off on this bill. The IDF did. The IDF chief did. And we're going with what the IDF wanted," he concluded. (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) Joint List MK Dov Khenin came out against the proposed legislation as well, saying the IDF draft law "is a bluff that only feeds the politics of hatred, which almost everyone in the political system stand to gain from, but the public loses. The army doesn't want to draft Haredim either, and this law will only drive many of the Haredi youth away from the job market because they will have to study to avoid enlistment." He called to "cancel the restrictions that prevent the Haredim from joining the job market," explaining that "If we don't do this, we condemn a big public to continued life in poverty." "Instead of farfetched and unrealistic laws, we need to promote equality, not create a mechanism that further deepends discrimination and social gaps," Khenin argued. Coalition chairman David Amsalem, right, talks to UTJ MK Moshe Gafni (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) Meretz leader MK Tamar Zandberg aimed her attack at her fellow opposition members. "It's been a while since we've last seen such a masquerade. The world of imagery is insufficient for this purpose. Is Lapid the Messiah's donkey?" she wondered. "This week will be remembered as one of our great misses as members of the opposition. Instead of all of us rising above (our differences) and standing united against Netanyahu, the battle became one between (Zionist Union head) Gabbay and Lapid," Zandberg added, referring to an earlier exchange of accusations between the two MKs. Zandberg also attacked the legislation itself, telling UTJ heads Litzman and Moshe Gafni, "You know this law is Isra-bluff. There's no equality and no enlistment." MK Itzik Shmuli (Zionist Union) argued that previous IDF chief Benny Gantz "said the need for Haredi enlistment was operational and national. This isn't a political whim... this plan is giving the green light to draft dodging, and it could endanger the 'army of the people.' This plan has no economic and criminal sanctions, and without them we can't enforce anything." Zionist Union's Knesset faction leader MK Yoel Hasson pointed out that the legislation was different to a memorandum issued by the Defense Ministry. "As we said, this version is diminished because it includes the Zionist yeshiva students, who enlist anyway, in the annual enlistment quotas," he said. Before the vote commenced, coalition chairman David Amsalem announced there has been a technical error that included students from Hesder yeshivot (a Zionist reigious yeshiva program combining advanced Talmudic studies with military service) under the purview of the law. The Yesh Atid party asked Amsalem for a written commitment that the error was indeed only technical in nature and would be remedied in future versions of the legislation. Amsalem then wrote a document confirming this and signed it. But Hasson was unconvinced, telling the Yesh Atid party, "Don't trust a letter with false promises, this is a bluff."

News article:
There has not been a lot of talk lately about the Jewish Home’s proposed High Court Override Bill, legislation that would allow the government to override High Court rulings. After suggesting that failure to pass the bill would provoke a coalition crisis, Naftali Bennett has toned down the volume over the bill recently. The Globe and Mail, a national newspaper in Canada, has a theory as to why. In an article published today by Sean Fine, Mr. Fine suggests that Canadian Supreme Court Justice Rosalie Abella’s speech at Hebrew U in April warning of dangers to Israeli democracy provided some of the impetus for the Israeli government to shelve the legislation. (Canada’s left-leaning newspapers love reporting on any topic which suggests that Israel is, or is becoming, less democratic). It is important to understand Justice Abella’s ideology before considering her statements. Whether she will admit it or not, Justice Abella is an ideological judge who consistently sides with the “left” in her decisions. Unlike some other judges of the Supreme Court in Canada, who do not decide cases along purely ideological lines, Justice Abella’s votes are almost completely predictable. In her time on the court, I can count on one hand the number of times I have agreed with her decisions on cases which have a political element to them. Just recently, Justice Abella supported a decision to allow Law Societies in BC and Ontario, arms of the “state”, to deny accreditation to a proposed Christian law school which would have met all of the substantive criteria to be recognized. However, the school, which is private and not state-run, also required, like many religious organizations, that its students agree to a Covenant which included abstaining from all sex that was not between a husband and wife. This one clause provided the justification for the state to deny accreditation on the basis that it excluded LGBT individuals from a religious Christian school. For possibly the first time ever, Canada’s Charter of Rights became a sword against a minority religious group instead of the shield against State interference it was meant to be. Understanding Justice Abella’s ideology is necessary to understand why she did not speak out against the High Court during the years when it not only became a threat to Israeli democracy, but undermined democracy completely under the stewardship of Aharon Barak. Under Barak, the court read-in its own “constitution” to Israel, when none existed, based on “Basic Laws”, some of which that were passed with fewer than 60 votes (less than ½ of the Knesset). Barak famously believed that “everything is justiciable”, essentially handing himself and other unelected judges the keys to the law-making throne in Israel. The High Court acted with no check on its power, created its own principles of “constitutional interpretation”, and undermined Israel’s legitimate security needs, setting limitations from an Ivory Tower against the democratically elected leaders and military commanders on the ground. In short, Barak’s reign over the court was radical – more far-reaching than the court in any other Western democracy, including Canada. Where was Justice Abella when this was all happening? Where were the speeches? Where were the warnings about how the court was undermining democracy? To the contrary, I am sure Justice Abella supported that development with open arms. In her speech at Hebrew U, Justice Abella reportedly stated that, “To me, when an independent judiciary is under siege, democracy is under siege, and when democracy is under siege, a country’s soul is being held hostage.” Does this mean Canada’s soul is under siege as well? As I have also pointed out in previous blog posts, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada has its own override clause, “the notwithstanding clause”. It is fair to say the Charter never would have been adopted without the inclusion of this clause, which allows the federal or provincial governments to pass laws notwithstanding their contravention of the Charter’s terms. While Mr. Fine devotes one brief sentence in the article noting this, it is a significant point which Justice Abella understandably would want to minimize, since it completely undermines her argument. It is important that we not let the Left prevent this legislation from passing based on hyperbolic Doomsday language. For example, there is nothing undemocratic about allowing the executive almost unfettered discretion to carry out foreign and security policy – in both Canada and the US, this is the case. There is nothing undemocratic about rules for “standing” before the court – in the Canada and the US, this is the case. Indeed, when “everything is justiciable”, the flip side is that the Knesset has zero final authority in the end of the day. This obviously cannot be proper in a democracy. In short, Israel should not take Justice Abella’s advice, which comes from a narrow, ideological political viewpoint with blinders as to the complete story of the High Court in the last few decades. While Justice Abella may be respected in Canada, her interests in this respect are not aligned with the interests of the Israeli people, but with the people of the Israeli left. If Israel’s coalition finally implements an override clause, the High Court has only itself to blame. Mr. Barak led an era of arrogance and usurped power, which was not bestowed on him and the High Court by anyone. To an overreach of such an unprecedented nature, the natural reaction is push-back by the Knesset. The Knesset is simply trying to restore the balance that should have existed from the beginning. Advertisement Thinking about the long term, there are many reasons why a 61-member override, the number of MKs currently proposed that would be needed, could create unintended negative consequences. Although more art than science, it seems to me that 70 is the right number: essentially a “coalition plus” amount of Knesset members (or in the future a broader coalition) should be able to nullify the court’s decisions. This would represent a broad consensus that would necessary include some centrist votes and would not be overly onerous so as be practically impossible to ever implement. Whatever reason the Override Bill has been put on the back-burner, this needs to change. It is absolutely critical for restoring the proper interplay between the High Court and the Knesset. Far from undermining democracy, it is a pro-democratic rebalancing. It is time for the Kulanu faction, and the entire government, to recognize this and support the Override Bill immediately.

News article:
There has not been a lot of talk lately about the Jewish Home’s proposed High Court Override Bill, legislation that would allow the government to override High Court rulings. After suggesting that failure to pass the bill would provoke a coalition crisis, Naftali Bennett has toned down the volume over the bill recently. The Globe and Mail, a national newspaper in Canada, has a theory as to why. In an article published today by Sean Fine, Mr. Fine suggests that Canadian Supreme Court Justice Rosalie Abella’s speech at Hebrew U in April warning of dangers to Israeli democracy provided some of the impetus for the Israeli government to shelve the legislation. (Canada’s left-leaning newspapers love reporting on any topic which suggests that Israel is, or is becoming, less democratic). It is important to understand Justice Abella’s ideology before considering her statements. Whether she will admit it or not, Justice Abella is an ideological judge who consistently sides with the “left” in her decisions. Unlike some other judges of the Supreme Court in Canada, who do not decide cases along purely ideological lines, Justice Abella’s votes are almost completely predictable. In her time on the court, I can count on one hand the number of times I have agreed with her decisions on cases which have a political element to them. Just recently, Justice Abella supported a decision to allow Law Societies in BC and Ontario, arms of the “state”, to deny accreditation to a proposed Christian law school which would have met all of the substantive criteria to be recognized. However, the school, which is private and not state-run, also required, like many religious organizations, that its students agree to a Covenant which included abstaining from all sex that was not between a husband and wife. This one clause provided the justification for the state to deny accreditation on the basis that it excluded LGBT individuals from a religious Christian school. For possibly the first time ever, Canada’s Charter of Rights became a sword against a minority religious group instead of the shield against State interference it was meant to be. Understanding Justice Abella’s ideology is necessary to understand why she did not speak out against the High Court during the years when it not only became a threat to Israeli democracy, but undermined democracy completely under the stewardship of Aharon Barak. Under Barak, the court read-in its own “constitution” to Israel, when none existed, based on “Basic Laws”, some of which that were passed with fewer than 60 votes (less than ½ of the Knesset). Barak famously believed that “everything is justiciable”, essentially handing himself and other unelected judges the keys to the law-making throne in Israel. The High Court acted with no check on its power, created its own principles of “constitutional interpretation”, and undermined Israel’s legitimate security needs, setting limitations from an Ivory Tower against the democratically elected leaders and military commanders on the ground. In short, Barak’s reign over the court was radical – more far-reaching than the court in any other Western democracy, including Canada. Where was Justice Abella when this was all happening? Where were the speeches? Where were the warnings about how the court was undermining democracy? To the contrary, I am sure Justice Abella supported that development with open arms. In her speech at Hebrew U, Justice Abella reportedly stated that, “To me, when an independent judiciary is under siege, democracy is under siege, and when democracy is under siege, a country’s soul is being held hostage.” Does this mean Canada’s soul is under siege as well? As I have also pointed out in previous blog posts, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada has its own override clause, “the notwithstanding clause”. It is fair to say the Charter never would have been adopted without the inclusion of this clause, which allows the federal or provincial governments to pass laws notwithstanding their contravention of the Charter’s terms. While Mr. Fine devotes one brief sentence in the article noting this, it is a significant point which Justice Abella understandably would want to minimize, since it completely undermines her argument. It is important that we not let the Left prevent this legislation from passing based on hyperbolic Doomsday language. For example, there is nothing undemocratic about allowing the executive almost unfettered discretion to carry out foreign and security policy – in both Canada and the US, this is the case. There is nothing undemocratic about rules for “standing” before the court – in the Canada and the US, this is the case. Indeed, when “everything is justiciable”, the flip side is that the Knesset has zero final authority in the end of the day. This obviously cannot be proper in a democracy. In short, Israel should not take Justice Abella’s advice, which comes from a narrow, ideological political viewpoint with blinders as to the complete story of the High Court in the last few decades. While Justice Abella may be respected in Canada, her interests in this respect are not aligned with the interests of the Israeli people, but with the people of the Israeli left. If Israel’s coalition finally implements an override clause, the High Court has only itself to blame. Mr. Barak led an era of arrogance and usurped power, which was not bestowed on him and the High Court by anyone. To an overreach of such an unprecedented nature, the natural reaction is push-back by the Knesset. The Knesset is simply trying to restore the balance that should have existed from the beginning. Advertisement Thinking about the long term, there are many reasons why a 61-member override, the number of MKs currently proposed that would be needed, could create unintended negative consequences.

News article:
Legislation that would exempt the prime minister from paying taxes on certain assets passed its first reading in the Knesset in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The bill, which passed with a majority of 32 to 20, requires two further ballots to become law. The legislation, authored by Likud MK Miki Zohar, who is considered a loyalist to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, would provide the prime minister with “a tax exemption for payments, services and gifts given to him in the framework of his job, excluding his salary,” according to the text of the bill. Specifically, the law would exempt the premier from taxes on his state-issued car and on utility bills paid by the state at his personal home. Speaking ahead of the vote, Zohar asked: “Is it conceivable that the president receives such a benefit and the prime minister does not?” Zohar told the assembled lawmakers to “try to put populism aside, deal with substance and vote for this law. The prime minister of Israel must earn a fair salary, no matter who he is.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms He claimed that the bill was not created for the benefit of Netanyahu but for the good of future prime ministers. “People forget that after this prime minister will come others and they will not be able to live with this salary,” he said from the Knesset podium in an apparent reference to Netanyahu being Israel’s most wealthy Knesset member. In 2015, Forbes magazine estimated Netanyahu’s net worth to be NIS 42 million ($11 million). The bill comes as the attorney general considers police recommendations to indict Netanyahu for receiving illicit gifts worth up to NIS 1 million, and two weeks after his wife Sara was charged for misuse of state funds. Advertisement In December the High Court ruled that fees paid by the state for the upkeep of the Netanyahus’ Caesarea property, which is owned by the couple but defined as an official state residence, count as taxable benefits given to a public servant. If passed into law, Netanyahu would profit by some NIS 8,000 ($2,200) a month in tax rebates, since he currently has to pay around NIS 3,000 in taxes on his car and NIS 5,000 on the residence. Netanyahu earns a gross monthly salary of NIS 48,800 ($12,500), according to a pay slip made public by the Prime Minister’s Office in March 2016. After income, national health insurance and social security tax deductions and vehicle expenses, the prime minister’s net monthly income stands at NIS 17,600 ($4,500). The bill could also add to Netanyahu’s monthly income by allowing him to charge the state for additional expenses at both the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem and his private home in Caesarea. Those expenses could tally up to a further additional NIS 10,000 a month. Both the tax rebate and the expenses could therefore reach up to an additional NIS 200,000 a year. The current text of the bill states that the additional funds would be awarded retroactively for the incumbent prime minister, meaning that if passed, Netanyahu could be given a lump sum of over NIS 2 million. Advertisement In order to value the exact amount of money that Netanyahu would be eligible for under the law, The Times of Israel has filed a Freedom of Information petition with the Prime Minister’s Office requesting his pay slips and expenses for the last nine years. The PMO has yet to respond to the request. Netanyahu’s financial dealings have been the subject of intense public scrutiny and, at times, scathing criticism, amid reports of excessive use of state funds, including NIS 80,000 ($20,000) a year on water at his Caesarea home, a NIS 10,000 ($2,500) monthly budget for ice cream, and a five-hour flight for which he spent NIS 450,000 ($125,000) to have a bed installed in the plane. In 2015, a state comptroller report found that expenditures at the prime minister’s residence had been excessive and improper, highlighting exorbitant spending on food, cleaning and clothing among other areas, and that budgetary practices had not been carried out with integrity and transparency. The comptroller highlighted and criticized, for instance, hundreds of thousands of shekels spent annually on takeout food, even though the residence employed a cook; excessive spending on the couple’s home in Caesarea, even though it was only used on weekends; and the employment of a Likud Central Committee member, Avi Fahima, as a private electrician on the weekends and even on Yom Kippur at the Caesarea home. Some of those findings formed the basis of a fraud investigation against the prime minister’s wife, Sara Netanyahu, in which she was indicted last week for charging some NIS 359,000 ($100,000) in gourmet meals to the state’s expense between 2010 and 2013, violating laws that ban the ordering of prepared food when a chef is employed at the official residence, according to Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. The Netanyahus have denied wrongdoing, calling the indictment “a new height of absurdity.” At the same time, Mandelblit is also reportedly considering bringing bribery charges against Benjamin Netanyahu in so-called Case 1000, or the gifts case, one of several corruption probes against the premier. The case, which police handed over to the prosecution in February with recommendations for a bribery charge, involves suspicions that the prime minister and his wife received illicit gifts from billionaire benefactors, including Israel-born Hollywood producer Milchan and Australian resort owner James Packer, in exchange for favors. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

Some of those findings formed the basis of a fraud investigation against the prime minister’s wife, Sara Netanyahu, in which she was indicted last week for charging some NIS 359,000 ($100,000) in gourmet meals to the state’s expense between 2010 and 2013, violating laws that ban the ordering of prepared food when a chef is employed at the official residence, according to Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. The Netanyahus have denied wrongdoing, calling the indictment “a new height of absurdity.” At the same time, Mandelblit is also reportedly considering bringing bribery charges against Benjamin Netanyahu in so-called Case 1000, or the gifts case, one of several corruption probes against the premier. The case, which police handed over to the prosecution in February with recommendations for a bribery charge, involves suspicions that the prime minister and his wife received illicit gifts from billionaire benefactors, including Israel-born Hollywood producer Milchan and Australian resort owner James Packer, in exchange for favors. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

Source: Xinhua| 2018-07-10 03:19:57|Editor: Mu Xuequan Video Player Close JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A controversial bill seeking to stop using Arabic in any official publication in Israel will be brought for final approval next week, local media reported on Monday. The new bill, pushed forward by Jewish nationalist lawmakers, seeks to strip Arabic of its status as an official language and anchor Israel as a Jewish state in law. With Arabs composing some 20 percent of its population, Israel currently has two official languages: Hebrew and Arabic. An earlier version of the bill, approved by the government in May, stated that the Arabic language will receive a special status and will be made accessible in all public institutions. According to Israel's Ynet news site, the new version drops the statement on making Arabic accessible and instead says its status will be regulated in a separate law. The amended bill also allows the establishment of Jewish-only communities in Israel, where Arabs are not allowed to rent or buy homes, Ynet reported. The bill is scheduled to be presented in the Knesset (parliament) next week. It needs to pass two full rounds of votes with a majority of 61 lawmakers in the 120-seat parliament. Tourism Minister Yariv Levin denied that the bill aims to cancel the Arabic language's official status, saying it will be "Israel's second official language." However, he said the new law will not require government and public ministries to include Arabic in their publications, as they currently have to do. Arab citizens of Israel are Palestinians who stayed put during the 1948 war. They formed Israel's largest minority and often complain about lack of job opportunities, racism, and discrimination in all fields of life, including access to health, education, transportation, and municipal services.

News article:
Israel has always understood itself to be a Jewish state. But for the past five years, politicians – specifically those on the right – have been pushing for legislation that would make that fact irrefutable, strengthening their ability to incorporate the country’s Jewish national and religious character into government policy. This proposed nation-state bill would be a Basic Law, which means it would have constitutional-like status. Israel’s lack of a constitution has led to the creation of a series of such “Basic Laws,” which the courts are meant to recognize as articulating the underlying principles of the state. However, due to internal wrangling over the wording of the law, the nation-state bill has enjoyed a legislative roller-coaster ride since its original conception back in 2013. >> Attorney general warns Netanyahu of international implications if Nation-State Bill Passed ■ Intervention against apartheid law casts Rivlin as gatekeeper of Israeli democracy ■ Netanyahu to make It official: Fascism is what we are Open gallery view Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated repeatedly that the passage of such a law is one of his top priorities, and is hoping to get the bill passed before the Knesset breaks for its summer recess next week. Yet he has failed to achieve a consensus among the parties in his last two coalition governments, and Habayit Hayehudi and United Torah Judaism have both raised objections to parts of the latest version. “Israel is a Jewish and democratic state, and for the sake of creating a balance and resisting those who challenge, I am determined to advance my version of the nation-state law,” Netanyahu said in 2014, as various factions battled over different versions of the bill. “Over the years, a distinct imbalance has been created between the Jewish element and the democratic one. There is an imbalance between individual rights and national rights in Israel,” he added. From the outset, human rights organizations and political figures on the left have decried the proposed law as antidemocratic, arguing that even in its mildest version, it legitimizes giving Jews and the Jewish religion preferential treatment and denying full and equal rights to the country’s non-Jewish citizens. >> Netanyahu to make it official: Fascism is what we are Its harshest critics, meanwhile, have said the law prepares the legal ground for a one-state solution and the annexation of the West Bank. In its the most recent version, figures ranging from left-wing activists to the Israeli president have joined the battle against preventing its passage in its current form. The clause that has upset them most would explicitly allow the establishment of communities that are segregated by religion or nationality, giving discrimination an official stamp of approval. The clause in the bill declares that “the state can allow a community composed of people of the same faith or nationality to maintain an exclusive community.” Open gallery view Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, December 2017. Credit: Kobi Gideon/GPO Some fear that enshrining this principle in law could not only lead to discrimination against Arabs and other non-Jews, but could also be interpreted as permitting discrimination against groups within the Jewish population. President Reuven Rivlin has slammed clause 7B, warning in a letter that it “could harm the Jewish people and Jews around the world and in Israel, and could even be used by our enemies as a weapon.” >> Intervention against apartheid law casts Rivlin as brave gatekeeper of Israeli democracy and morality The Knesset’s legal adviser, Eyal Yinon, and Deputy Attorney General Raz Nizri have both also come out against the clause, with Nizri explaining that the law would enshrine “personal discrimination against a citizen based only on his nationality.” And Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit said “there is no place for such a clause in its present form.” Eyal Zandberg from the Attorney General’s Office has said the clause “is blatant discrimination” and that “this means the residents selection committee can hang up a sign saying ‘No entry to non-Jews.’” 'Arabic was never an official language in Israel' Credit: Haaretz There are other controversial clauses in the proposed law that are also proving problematic: Hebrew will be the official language of the state, with the status of Arabic being reduced from an “official” to “special” language. Another clause would instruct judges to look for precedents from Jewish legal rulings in instances where Israeli law offers no guidance.

News article:
Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman (United Torah Judaism) said Tuesday that if the state cannot convince the High Court of Justice to postpone the expiration of the existing IDF draft law within a week, he would resign from the government. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The existing Israeli Defense Service Law expires in September after the High Court deemed it unconstitutional, and so the Knesset must pass an alternative law before then. If a new law is not passed to regulate the exemptions of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students, tens of thousands of them are expected to receive IDF draft orders. Prime Minister Netanyahu; Deputy Health Minister Litzman (Photos: Reuters, Avi Mualem) Litzman's close associates stressed he wasn't threatening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or the High Court, but rather acting at the instruction of his Agudat Yisrael faction's Council of Torah Sages, who determined a solution must be found before the end of the Knesset's summer session to prevent the drafting of yeshiva students. "If the matter is not resolved, meaning if we don't get a postponement from the High Court, he would not be able to remain in the government," one close associate explained. Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed Sunday that the new IDF draft bill was at the top of the coalition's priorities , expressing hope it can be passed in the current Knesset session, which ends next week. "We will have a meeting with the heads of the coalition today about the draft bill," he told a meeting of Likud ministers. "We will try to square the circle and bring this to an end as soon as possible. That is the main effort." But coalition officials said a solution will likely not be reached by the end of the summer session due to the objection of the Haredi parties, who have been vehemently against the current version of the legislation, formulated by the Defense Ministry. Because of that, Netanyahu will likely have no choice but to turn to the High Court and ask for an extension. The proposed legislation, which passed its first reading in the Knesset last week, includes planned cuts to the yeshivot's budgets and the use of economic incentives to pressure the Torah study institutions to encourage enlistment, but no criminal sanctions. The enlistment objectives, as stated in the proposal, are that 3,000 yeshiva students will be drafted in the first stage and 600 will volunteer for national service. These quotas are almost identical to the existing enlistment quotas that exist now. The plan will be given a two-year adaptation period, in which sanctions won’t be imposed if the yeshivot fail to meet the draft rates. In the third year, yeshivot who fail to encourage enlistment will be hit with economic sanctions if they drop below a 95-percent target.

News article:
Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday of possible implications for Israel in the international arena if the Nation-State Bill is passed in its current form. Sources confirmed to Haaretz that “the subject indeed came up” in conversation between Mendelblit and Netanyahu, but “there was no special meeting about" the legislation. Deputy Attorney General Ran Nizri also said, on Tuesday during a meeting at the Knesset, that the passage of the bill would have international ramifications, adding: “I stop here. We wear another hat. We are doing our job in closed rooms where we speak to the relevant political officials and there, more is said about the international implications.” >> Explained: The controversial bill that would allow Jewish-only communities in Israel The legislation, which would have a constitution-like status, would prioritize Jewish values over democratic ones. One controversial clause would allow the establishment of communities that are segregated by religion or nationality. The clause in the bill declares that “the state can allow a community composed of people of the same faith or nationality to maintain an exclusive community.” Eyal Zandberg from the Attorney General’s Office has said the clause “is blatant discrimination” and that “this means the residents selection committee can hang up a sign saying ‘No entry to non-Jews.’” The law would also define Hebrew as the only official language in Israel and instruct judges to look for precedents from Jewish legal rulings when Israeli law offers no guidance. In addition to damage to Israel’s democratic image, the implications might involve agreements and treaties to which Israel is a signatory, as well as international law. Meanwhile, Likud is looking into the possibility of changing the wording of one of the controversial clauses in the bill, clause 7b, which allows for the establishment of Jewish-only communities. The alternative wording is mainly declarative, and does not actually prohibit members of other ethnic groups from moving into Jewish communities. According to the alternative, the cause would read: “The State of Israel regards itself as committed to the resolution of the League of Nations, which supported dense Jewish settlement in areas under its control.” This wording was suggested by Dr. Haggai Vinitzky of the Menachem Begin Heritage Center, who presented it during a meeting at the Knesset Tuesday. Vinitzky’s wording is based on the document establishing the British Mandate in Palestine. Clause 6 of that document states that the British government would encourage dense Jewish settlement and would facilitate the immigration of Jews to areas of Palestine. The wording is expected to impede international criticism of the law. “It was clear to everyone that the wording of the original clause was very problematic, “a senior Likud official told Haaretz. “Vinitzky’s proposal solves a lot of problems, but it also makes the matter of settlement declarative rather than operative.” The major uncertainty, the official said, was “whether to continue to advance the law, which would be devoid of significant tools to ‘Judaize’ the Galilee and the Negev, and whether there was an important aspect in principle in the very legislating of a nation-state law in Israel. Netanyahu is the one who has to decide.” During the meeting it emerged that the current wording of the clause might open the door for the High Court of Justice to intervene and require equal construction for members of other religions and ethnic groups. Given that possibility, the right-wing parties decided to soften the language. The Yisrael Beiteinu party also suggested two alternative wordings Tuesday for the controversial clause. MK Oded Forer submitted the party’s objections to the bill and suggested wording similar to Vinitzky’s: “The State of Israel regards itself as obligated to establish and strengthen dense Jewish settlement in areas of the Land of Israel under its control.” Another alternative suggested by Forer was: “The State of Israel will be open to and encourage immigration of Jews and the ingathering of the exiles and will work to develop Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel.” The Knesset’s legal adviser said Forer’s suggestions were better than the wording presented by the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, which is working on the legislation, and these suggestions should be developed “to avoid the damage. It corresponds well with the Zionist ethos.” In criticizing the current wording, Forer told the committee: “What will happen in the city of Arad, when enough Gerer Hasidim move in and claim that ‘Jews who aren’t Jews according to what the Gerer Rebbe decided won’t be able to live in the city’”? Another controversial clause, 7a, would allow every person to maintain his or her culture, education, heritage, language and identity. The committee’s legal adviser, Gur Bligh, said that he could not rule out the possibility that the clause would discriminate against women based on the leeway it would give for everyone to maintain their own values.

News article:
The state asked the High Court of Justice on Sunday to grant a seven-month extension on a deadline it had set for passing legislation regulating military service for members of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community. The request came after Yaakov Litzman, deputy health minister and head of the United Torah Judaism party, said last week that he would resign from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, unless the court extends its deadline to legislate the bill. His ultra-Orthodox party cited the need for dramatic changes to the current version of the bill, which has been wending its way through the Knesset. In its application, the state noted that “this is an unusual request, submitted as a last resort against the backdrop of a sensitive issue.” Last September, the High Court ruled that a 2015 version of Israel’s draft law granting most yeshiva students draft exemptions was unconstitutional, and gave lawmakers a year to institute new guidelines for ultra-Orthodox enlistment. But the Knesset will conclude its spring session on July 19, and will not reconvene for the fall session until mid-October. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Without the amended legislation in place, current deferral regulations will expire with the deadline and thousands of yeshiva students could find themselves unable to renew their deferments, making them eligible to be drafted by the IDF. The contentious current version of the legislation, backed by the Defense Ministry, sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that, if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the yeshivas, or rabbinical seminaries, where they study. It passed its first reading in the Knesset at the beginning of the month, the first of three readings it must pass before becoming law. Advertisement Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman has said he will not support any changes to the current proposal. Litzman did not explicitly say his party would also leave the coalition if he resigned, suggesting he does not want to topple the government and force elections over the issue. The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a controversial one in Israel, revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas should be called up for compulsory military service, like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population.

News article:
JTA — Israel is debating legislation that supporters say states the obvious. Critics, meanwhile, say the measure will divide Israeli society and damage its relationships with the rest of the democratic world, especially Jews in the United States. The premise of the so-called Nationality Law is simple: It enshrines in Israel’s quasi-constitutional Basic Law that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people. But after that it gets more complicated. Much of the bill, sponsored by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, deals with obvious signs that Israel is a Jewish state, such as affirming the symbols on the flag and shield, setting the Hebrew calendar as the country’s official calendar, recognizing Jewish holidays and days of remembrance, and naming Jerusalem as the capital. Other parts of the law, however, have raised the hackles of segments of Israeli society and the Jewish Diaspora. These include clauses relegating Arabic to a “special” status instead of an official language, promoting the establishment of Jewish communities throughout Israel and addressing the state’s relationship with Diaspora Jewry. That the words “democracy” and “equality” do not appear once in the text have sounded alarm bells among its critics. Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, called the law a “weapon (for) our enemies.” Outgoing Jewish Agency head Natan Sharansky said it would end up “driving a wedge between Jews in Israel and in the Diaspora.” And thousands of Israeli protesters, Jewish and Arab, marched through Tel Aviv over the weekend to protest discriminatory aspects of the legislation. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In the 11th hour before the Knesset was to vote on the legislation — it is expected to pass — a leader of American Jewry flew to Israel and spent nearly two days discussing the bill and criticizing it face to face with Israeli lawmakers. Jerry Silverman, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America, told JTA on Monday that the Nationality Law “took over the agenda” of his trip. Prior to leaving for Israel, he spoke to the major Jewish organizations about their concerns over the legislation. While he was not permitted to address the Knesset joint committee working to massage the language of the legislation before it comes to the plenum for a vote sometime this week, Silverman said he sat in on the meetings and was recognized publicly as a representative of Diaspora Jewry. He said he discussed the concerns of American Jewry with many lawmakers and key members of the Knesset, as well as the Prime Minister’s Office. Advertisement Silverman told JTA he is concerned that the legislation, with its focus on the Jewish aspects of Israel, will alienate young American Jews who are “so social-justice conscious today.” He said there are several parts of the legislation that “American Jews would struggle with.” Changing the status of the Arabic language is being seen as “discriminatory,” according to Silverman. Arabs make up about 20 percent of Israel’s population. A section stating that Israel is responsible for preserving the connection of Israel with worldwide Jewry also has drawn criticism. Critics fear it is worded in such a way as to weaken the ability of Jews in the Diaspora, and even in Israel, to promote pluralism inside the Jewish state or petition the Supreme Court in Israel to hear cases on issues that affect Diaspora Jewry, such as the establishment of the egalitarian prayer section of the Western Wall. The wording of a clause that would have allowed for the establishment of communities based on one religion or nationality was changed Sunday to instead reflect “national value in developing Jewish communities and will act to encourage, promote and establish them.” Haaretz said the clause nonetheless promotes the establishment of “Jewish-only communities.” The previous wording of the clause would have “emboldened and given a lot of fuel to the BDS movement,” Silverman said, echoing the statements of many on social media and even in the halls of the Knesset. Some, especially Arab Israelis and their supporters, have used the word “apartheid” to describe the provision. The author of the original Nationality Law nearly a decade ago — Avraham Diskin, a political scientist and Hebrew University professor — rejects criticism of the legislation, which he calls “declarative” and “without a lot of practical” consequences. Advertisement Diskin told JTA that it is “high time” for a Basic Law that specifically identifies Israel as a Jewish state, in addition to the many Israeli laws that mention Judaism and the Jewish character of the state. There are “many people around the world outside of Israel, mainly Arabs, who are not ready to accept allowing the Jews to have their own nation state,” Diskin said. He added that in Israel, some challenge the notion of Israel as a Jewish state — Jews among them. Diskin said the law is most needed, however, because of the Israeli Supreme Court. He and other critics of the high court say it has ignored the Jewishness of the state, for example in cases of Palestinian residency rights in Israel, rights of foreign converts to citizenship, land purchases by the Jewish National Fund, draft deferments to haredi Orthodox youth and the deportation of illegal migrants. Israel’s Declaration of Independence repeatedly notes the connections of the Jews to Israel and that Israel is being established as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Unlike the Basic Law, however, the Declaration of Independence is not a legal document. Diskin said there is nothing in the legislation that violates human rights or the rights of minorities. Amir Fuchs, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, said the legislation resembles the preamble of an as-yet unwritten Constitution, and that “there is no [democratic] country in the world that has not specifically enumerated the right of equality in its constitution.” The legislation has “no clear statement that the state will have equal rights for all its citizens,” he told JTA. “This is what is missing. This is the problem,” Fuchs said. He acknowledged that other Basic Laws deal with Israel’s democratic nature and individual rights, including the one on human dignity and liberty. At least two other Basic Laws refer to Israel as both Jewish and democratic. Advertisement Fuchs, who heads the Defending Democratic Values Program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said there is no need for the new legislation since it is clear that Israel is a Jewish nation-state based on its symbols, language and holidays, among other things. He said he does not oppose the idea of a law stating that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people, but that such a law should also ensure that the state will have equal rights for all its citizens. But Fuchs does not believe that Israel will look substantially different after the passage of the legislation and disagrees with those who say it will turn the country into an apartheid state. The tipping point, he said, will be in close Supreme Court decisions, where the “Jewish” element could take precedence over the “democratic”element. The legislation is set to come up for a final vote before the end of the Knesset’s summer session on Sunday. The coalition has enough votes for passage because the haredi Orthodox parties are willing to support it. The haredi parties in the past have opposed the legislation due to its nationalist nature. But the addition of the word “religious” to a clause on the right to self-determination in part softened their stance. Silverman said that as a sovereign state, Israel has the right to pass such legislation. The Israeli and the American Jewish community are “pretty young environments for the two major Jewish communities in the world. And we are both going through growing pains.” Jewish organizations in the United States will be watching to see how the law is applied practically, particularly in cases involving Diaspora Jewry. “Israel has to be the nation-state for all Jews,” Silverman said. “That cannot be limited in any way.”

News article:
The Knesset on Tuesday rescinded legislation which gave the prime minister the authority to declare war upon consulting only the defense minister and not via a full cabinet vote. The cancellation of the clause passed its second and third readings with 77 MKs in favor and 16 against. The vote came amid heightened tensions on the border between Israel and Gaza, with many concerned that the recent uptick in violence could lead to a war. The Knesset passed legislation in April that included a controversial clause allowing the prime minister and defense minister to declare war or order a major military operation likely to lead to war, without requiring a full cabinet vote. Opposition MKs said at the time that the language of the law effectively gave free rein to the prime minister by removing all oversight. Even some political hawks were troubled by the legislation. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms MK Ofer Shelah of the Yesh Atid party hailed Tuesday’s vote, saying that it was “inconceivable that a decision to go to war could be in the hands of one person, without consultation with cabinet members.” Shelah added that if the amendment had not been approved, there would have “undoubtedly been a commission of inquiry in the future.” According to the now-canceled clause, in “extreme circumstances,” military operations could be authorized by the prime minister and defense minister alone and will not require a vote by cabinet ministers. The law did not specify exactly what those circumstances may be, or who would determine them, saying only that it would apply “if the issue is necessary due to urgency.” Advertisement The cabinet reportedly accepted that the legislation was too extreme and far-reaching, following criticism and concerns it may be struck down by the High Court. “It is appropriate that a decision of the Ministerial Committee regarding starting a war or taking significant military action that may at a high level of certainty lead to war be adopted by as wide a panel as possible,” the amendment rescinding the clause said. Some eight years ago, Netanyahu and then-defense minister Ehud Barak instructed the chief of staff and head of the Mossad intelligence service to put the army into a state of readiness, only to be told by the latter two that the specified activity was illegal because it had not been properly approved and could lead to war. There have, however, been numerous occasions where decisions of a similar nature have been taken by the security cabinet, a smaller forum of ministers tasked with forming policy regarding war and peace, or other smaller forums of ministers.

News article:
Tel Aviv: A bill enshrining Israel’s ‘Jewish character’ in law is heading into its final stretch after years of debate, over the objections of civil-rights organisations and opposition leaders who say it discriminates against the country’s Arab minority. The bill was expected to be brought to a parliamentary committee vote this week, after a provision that could have blocked Arabs and Jews from living in each other’s communities was excised. Detractors say the bill’s definition of the country as the Jewish national home is unfair to Arab citizens, who make up about 20 per cent of the population. The bill “is very important to guaranteeing the essence of our existence, and we must pass it soon”, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday at a meeting of his Likud party’s parliamentary faction, according to the Ynet website. The bill’s supporters want to bring it for a full Knesset vote before the parliament breaks for summer recess next week. If passed, it would become Israel’s 12th Basic Law — the country’s equivalent of a constitution — though it likely would face court challenges. Israeli regime leaders have argued for years that the state’s Jewish identity needs to be anchored in a specific law, not just in the Declaration of Independence. Nearly all Zionist political parties support formally defining Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, and the flag, national anthem and other symbols emphasise Judaism. The bill “sticks a finger in the eyes of a fifth of the citizens, deliberately creating conflict among people to earn a bit more political capital for the Netanyahu tyranny,” Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List, an alliance of Arab-dominated parties in Israel’s parliament, wrote on Twitter. Passing a bill strengthening the national characteristics of the state, without clearly anchoring the principle of equality for all citizens, could erode the Israeli regime’s democratic nature, said Amir Fuchs, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute. He said it was problematic that the bill demotes Arabic from its status as an official national language, instead granting it a “special standing” and mandating that Arab citizens continue to have access to state services in their native tongue. The legislation also could anger Palestinian officials, who don’t accept Israel as the Jewish state and reject the notion that Jews constitute a people entitled to self-determination. Palestinians also fear the bill could block their demand that Arab refugees from the 1948 Middle East war, and their millions of descendants, be granted a “right of return” to Israel. The bill declares occupied Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, a characterisation opposed by Palestinians, who claim the city’s eastern sector for themselves. The Palestinian National Authority broke off ties with Washington after the Trump administration recognised occupied Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last December.

Reactions to the Knesset’s passage overnight Wednesday of the new Jewish State law were predictably divided along party lines, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailing it as “a pivotal moment in the annals of Zionism and the State of Israel.” Lawmakers approved the law, which enshrines Israel as “the national home of the Jewish people” in the country’s quasi-constitutional Basic Laws, in its second and third readings, with 62 voting in favor, 55 opposed and two abstaining, after hours of heated debate in the Knesset chamber. While the coalition feted the passage of the law, members of the opposition decried it as nationalistic, divisive and a threat to democracy. “We enshrined in law the basic principle of our existence,” said Netanyahu. “Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people, which respects the individual rights of all its citizens. This is our state — the Jewish state. In recent years there have been some who have attempted to put this in doubt, to undercut the core of our being. Today we made it law: This is our nation, language and flag.” The law’s main proponent over the past few years, former Shin Bet head Avi Dichter, said it was a response to anyone in Israel who believes Jewish presence is temporary — referencing Arab MK Jamal Zahalka’s past claim that Arabs will outlast Jews in the country. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “All you can be is an equal minority, not an equal nationality,” Dichter said. Dichter asserted, “Contrary to the disinformation and fake news that have flooded [the conversation], the Basic Law does not hurt Israel’s minority cultures.” He also claimed it does not detract from the status of the Arabic language. One clause in the law downgrades Arabic from an official language to one of “special” standing, though it also says that “this clause does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect.” Advertisement Read the full text of the law here. Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein was also celebratory, saying “history” had been made in the plenum, and calling the new legislation “one of the most important laws ever to be passed by the Knesset.” Tourism Minister Yariv Levin condemned the opposition to the law by the Zionist Union faction, and particularly the Labor party, its chief component. “Tell us honestly, Labor members: Do you contest the Jewish people’s right to the Land of Israel? Is it not our nation state? Is its flag not acceptable to you? There has never been such a rejection by the Labor movement of Zionist values.” Critics have said that the law is discriminatory to Israel’s Arab and other minority populations. and needlessly provokes those minorities by underlining a preferential attitude toward Judaism. Zionist Union’s Shelly Yachimovich said, “Nobody believes it is nationality and the State of Israel that [the coalition is] interested in,” adding that the law encourages a “debased” form of nationalism “that hates the Other.” MK Tzipi Livni said the law in its current form prioritizes politics over substance. “When I asked coalition MKs why they weren’t bringing forth a version of the law that a hundred MKs could unite around, they smiled at me cynically and said Netanyahu wants the law to create strife. ‘Otherwise how will people know he’s more patriotic than you? What will we get out of supporting it?’ That’s the method.” Advertisement Outgoing opposition chief Isaac Herzog, the new head of the Jewish Agency, was more ambivalent, but expressed concern. “The question is whether the law will hurt or strengthen Israel,” he said. “History will be the judge. I very much hope the delicate balance between [Israel’s] Jewish and democratic aspects will not be upset.” In the opposition Yesh Atid party, MK Elazar Stern said the law was an insult “to our Druze and Bedouin brothers who serve with us in the IDF and in the security services.” A lone voice of dissent in Likud, MK Benny Begin said the legislation was not what he expected from his party, and warned that it could increase societal tensions and boost extreme nationalism. Meretz party head Tamar Zandberg, too, lamented the “shameful night” and “debased and tainted law.” The most withering criticism came from the Joint (Arab) List, which called the law “anti-democratic, colonialist, racist and with clear characteristics of apartheid.” “The law has no mention of the word democracy or the word equality, and is wholly committed to brutish emphasis of ethnic supremacy, leaving no doubt that there are two types of citizenship — first-rate ones for Jews and second-rate ones for Arabs,” it said. Joint List head Ayman Odeh said in a statement that Israel “has passed a law of Jewish supremacy and told us that [minorities] will always be second-class citizens… Netanyahu’s regime is digging a deep pit of fear, racism, and authoritarianism to divide us from each other. ” Advertisement He added, “We will not allow the majority to humiliate and destroy us,” and vowed to fight for “a future for all of us with democracy, equality, and justice.” The law also declares that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, sets the Hebrew calendar as the official calendar of the state, and recognizes Independence Day, days of remembrance and Jewish holidays. On Sunday, Netanyahu and Education Minister Naftali Bennett reached an agreement to cut a controversial clause that would have allowed the state to “authorize a community composed of people having the same faith and nationality to maintain the exclusive character of that community,” and replace it with a new clause celebrating “Jewish settlement” in Israel in general terms. Lawmakers amended the bill accordingly just hours before the final authorization, removing the clause sanctioning housing discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or religion. Some of the last-minute changes to the bill came after politicians, legal advisers and others warned that several of its clauses were discriminatory and could cast a dark shadow over Israel in the international arena. Judaism is already mentioned throughout the country’s laws, and religious authorities control many aspects of life, including marriage. But the 11 existing Basic Laws deal mostly with state institutions like the Knesset, the courts, and the presidency, while Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty defines Israel’s democratic character.

"Similar to a constitution, the basic laws underpin Israel's legal system and are more difficult to repeal than regular laws", The Times of Israel reported, adding that the law also declares that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, sets the Hebrew calendar as the official calendar of the state and recognizes all Jewish holidays. The most furious protests during the debate reportedly came from Arab lawmakers. According to the Times of Israel, Joint (Arab) List MK Jamal Zahalka ripped a printed text of the bill to shreds from the podium. "I declare with astonishment and sorrow the death of democracy… The funeral will take place today in the plenum," his fellow party member Ahmad Tibi was quoted as saying by The Times of Israel. Arabs make up a fifth of the country’s eight-million-strong population and have frequently accused the government of discrimination, including against Palestinian refugees, millions of whom have been trying to return to their ancestral homes after being banished during the creation of Israel.

News article:
The Israeli Parliament (the Knesset) recently passed a new law defining the country as "Jewish state." Considered a move to marginalize its 1.8 million Palestinian citizens, the bill was approved by the Knesset despite harsh criticism from Palestinian lawmakers as well as from a few Israeli ones. The bill also abolished the regulation that Arabic was one of the official languages of the country alongside Hebrew. Now, Arabic has been reduced to a "special status" and no longer registered as an official language, but can still be used in state institutions. Mainly backed by the right-wing government and political parties, the bill was passed by a vote of 62-55, with two lawmakers abstaining, in the 120-member Knesset. Arab lawmakers shouted in Parliament, saying this was done to consolidate the apartheid. This comes immediately after Israel's 70th anniversary as a state and following the U.S.' recognition of Jerusalem as the country's capital by moving its embassy from Tel Aviv. The bill has become another way of underlining that "Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people, and they have an exclusive right to the national self-determination of it." However, the law has raised the question of whether the struggle for coexistence has ended. Israel has been imposing cruel embargoes on Gaza and high security measures in the West Bank. Yet, it was possible and easier for Arabs to coexist in certain Israeli cities. The new law has excluded anyone who is not Jewish. Besides, some Israeli media sources have claimed that it was against secularism and that this definition will make the people unequal in the state on the grounds of religion. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is known with his tough Zionist and nationalist stance, said, "This is a defining moment in the annals of Zionism and the history of the state of Israel." The harsh criticism has managed to prevent forcing the courts to make verdicts according to Jewish theocratic law. Instead, it said, "The state views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will act to encourage and promote its establishment." This is ambiguous because it may lead to the isolation of Arabs totally. It is clearly known that Israel's establishment and development have been achieved only after millions of Arabs were displaced. Therefore, it is discouraging for Arabs who still believe there might be a chance for coexistence. For instance, an Arab lawmaker Ahmed Tibi said, "I announce with shock and sorrow the death of democracy." Yet, the Israeli government has been claiming that this "Jewish state" definition would not threaten civil rights. Netanyahu said, "We will keep ensuring civil rights in Israel's democracy, but the majority also has rights and the majority decides." Formally, the Arab citizens of Israel hold the same rights as Jewish Israelis. However, it is a fact that these Arabs face constant discrimination and difficulties in schools, state institutions and even hospitals. Besides Muslim Palestinians, Christians and Druze Arabs are also concerned about the new law.

Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat panned a new Israeli Basic Law on Thursday that enshrines Israel as the national home of the Jewish people, contending that it “legalizes apartheid.” Early Thursday morning, the Knesset passed the law, which has been dubbed “the nation-state Law,” with 62 lawmakers voting in favor, 55 opposed and two abstaining, after hours of heated debate in the Knesset chamber. “The ‘Jewish Nation-State’ [law] officially legalizes apartheid and legally defines Israel as an apartheid system,” Erekat tweeted from the PLO Negotiation Affairs Department account. “[It is] a dangerous and racist law par excellence.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a joint statment with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (not seen) at the prime minister's office in Jerusalem, July 19, 2018. Debbie Hill/Pool via Reuters RAMALLAH - 19 July 2018: The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) strongly denounced on Thursday the Israeli parliament's, the Knesset, adoption of the “Jewish Nation-State” law, WAFA news agency reported. PLO Executive Committee Member Hanan Ashrawi said in a statement that the Jewish Nation-State law “gives license to apartheid, discrimination, ethnic cleansing, and sectarianism at the expense of the Palestinian people. Such racist and prejudicial legislation is illegal by all standards of international law, democracy, humanity, justice, tolerance, and inclusion.” Ashrawi said, “Once again, the right-wing government coalition has exposed its true character by demonstrating that it is bent on sustaining an official policy of ethnic purity and supremacy, thereby regulating the indigenous Palestinian citizens to second-class status.” She added: “This also affirms Israel's willful intent to erase the Palestinian narrative, presence and continuity on the land, while actively eradicating the history, culture and identity of the Palestinian people which predate the creation of the state of Israel.” The PLO official said “the US administration's blind bias in favor of Israel and its total disdain for international law have emboldened Israel to persist with such unlawful and immoral policies.” Ashrawi called on all members of the international community and people of conscience “to question such legislation and blatant discriminatory policies and bring Israel to compliance with the norms and standards of civilized behavior.” She stressed: “Despite all Israeli efforts at eradicating our rights and our identity, the Palestinian people's resilience and determination to attain their freedom and historical validation will prevail." The Israeli Knesset voted 62 to 55 early Thursday to approve the Jewish Nation-State Basic Law that constitutionally enshrines the identity of the State of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. It guarantees the ethnic-religious character of Israel as exclusively Jewish and entrenches the privileges enjoyed by Jewish citizens, while simultaneously anchoring discrimination against Palestinian citizens.

News article:
The passage of the Nation-State Bill early Thursday morning, aimed at boosting Israel’s Jewish character, officially codifies and clarifies the facilitation of the prophetic ingathering and protecting of the Jewish people, says Yishai Fleisher, an Israeli radio broadcaster and international spokesman for the Jewish community in Hebron. The legislation, he said, “helps promote and promulgate Jewish ancient culture including the calander and language of the Bible.” The passage of this legislation comes on the heels of the United States moving its embassy to Israel’s capital, Jerusalem, followed closely by Guatemala. And other countries considering moving their embassies include Slovakia, Russia – the largest country in the world, and Brazil, the most populous South American state. With a majority of the world’s Jews currently living in Israel and now a government enshrining the Jewish character of the country, many say that we are living in momentous times. The bill had recently made worldwide headlines as the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee headed by Likud MK Amir Ohana met to discuss the Nation-State Bill on July 10, receiving widespread criticism, including from the President of Israel Reuven Rivlin and Natan Sharansky, outgoing Jewish Agency chairman. After hours of debate, the bill was passed with 62 in favor, 55 opposed, and two abstaining. Basic Law informs Israel’s legal system, much like a Constitution, and is more difficult to repeal than ordinary law. Up until now, Israel’s Basic Laws relate to state institutions and democratic character rather than its Jewish national identity. Sections already enshrined in ordinary law include the Law of Return (Jewish immigration), the name of the state, state symbols (the flag and national anthem), the Jerusalem Law, the calendar, national holidays and the Sabbath. A new clause in the bill that has received many critiques allows Israel to “authorize a community composed of people having the same faith and nationality to maintain the exclusive character of that community.” The Nation-State bill was first submitted in 2009-2010 by various Knesset members including the Kadima party’s Avi Dichter, who had sourced the idea from the Institute for Zionist Strategies, an Israeli policy and research think tank with the goal of preserving Israel as “a viable, democratic Jewish state.” Proponents of the legislation argue that Israel has been forgoing its Jewish nature for its democratic nature, and it is time that the two are put on equal footing – or with its Jewish identity eclipsing its democratic identity. Fleisher told Breaking Israel News, “In a lot of ways this bill is what you would have thought Israel is anyway – which is that Israel is the Nation-State of the Jewish people. The Nation-State bill is nothing but a redefinition of Israel’s Declaration of Independence, which sets out so clearly what is Israel’s goal.” Fleisher views Israel’s Jewish identity and democracy as conflicting values, one from ancient Judea and one from the western Greek empire. Israel, as the only Jewish State, should prioritize its Jewish identity, Fleisher said. “One of the great mistakes has been that we’ve promoted Israel as Jewish and democratic as if these two values are equal.” He related that while democracy may have beautiful values, “democracy is a Greek word – it reflects Greek values and it’s very hard to make those two very different systems of thought to be co-equal.” “To me, it was always obvious that Israel is a state whose job is to protect the Jewish people first and second, to be an incubator for Jewish values and culture and third to be a country that is a light unto the nations.” But legislation dissidents claim that Israel should be committed to full equality for all citizens, including minorities, and view Israel’s Declaration of Independence as enshrining democracy. Dr. Amir Fuchs, Head of the Defending Democratic Values Program at the Israel Democracy Institute told Breaking Israel News, “The initial clause that determines that Israel is a nation-state and has the right to self-determination [is a new principle]. This is anchored in the Declaration of Independence, but it is not currently written in any Basic Law except for the definition of “Jewish and democratic.” In contrast, he said, the proposed bill states that Israel is the national home of the Jewish people without ensuring the principle of equality for all its citizens, as defined in the Declaration of Independence. “This creates an imbalance between the Jewish and democratic values,” he maintained, adding, “Arabic is demoted from an official language of the state to a language that enjoys special status.” But Fleisher maintained that while Israel has and will guarantee civil rights to minorities, it should not guarantee national rights. “Nobody is taking away the civil rights of other people. Israel is in a neighborhood of 400 million Arabs that live in 22 Arab States, not to mention millions more Muslims in Iran and Turkey. They have these states mostly set up as ethnic and religious states and we have this one little state that’s here to be a protector of the Jews, a source of autonomy in their region.” He continued, “Israel is not here to create an Arab democracy or promote other people’s values or put everyone on equal footing. It’s here to promote a group of people who need protection in this world and need to have a place to have their culture grow and succeed.” According to Sharansky, this revocation would serve the BDS movements’ critiques of Israel. Likewise, Rivlin voiced his concern that the legislation could “harm the Jewish people worldwide and in Israel, and could even be used as a weapon by our enemies.” Pnina Tamano-Shatta, an Ethiopian member of Knesset in Yesh Atid also argued BDS would “celebrate” the law. Jewish diaspora leaders have agreed, including president of the Union of Reform Judaism Rabbi Rick Jacobs who said the law would give Israel’s enemies “more fodder” and “weaken the case we make for Israel every day across America.” Fuchs continued, “The bill was recently amended to state that Israel must work only “in the Diaspora” to nurture a relationship with diaspora Jewry. This means that Israel does not need to do such work within the country itself. This was a capitulation to the ultra-Orthodox parties, who were afraid that the bill would be interpreted as requiring Israel to recognize the non-Orthodox religious streams in Judaism.” Likewise, stated Sharansky, “While the nation-state law was originally intended to reinforce this principle, the most recent amendments to it are of great concern because they drive a wedge between Jews in Israel and in the Diaspora.” But Fleisher argued, “before this law, BDS seeks to destroy Israel and after this law, BDS will seek to destroy Israel” and “only if one perceives Israel as a non-Jewish American-style state would the bill drive a wedge between the Jewish State and the Diaspora.” He added, “Jewish Americans sometimes make the mistake in thinking that most states in the world are like America, but most states in the world are ethnic states that are there to first and foremost promote their own ethnicity – think Japan, Iceland, Slovakia, Czechia and Hungary – what do you think their national languages and cultures are? It’s obvious. They promote their own language and culture to help it flourish and grow. These things are obvious but when it comes to Israel there are forces trying to rip it down.” Fuchs suggested that a clause should be included in the bill stating that the State of Israel is fully committed to equality for all its citizens, in particular to its minorities. “It would be appropriate to mention the Arab minority as a large minority in Israel and to note that the state is obligated their integration and inclusion in the state – as written in the Declaration of Independence,” he related.

News article:
Jewish Nation-State Law divorces Israel from any claim to democracy Ramzy Baroud The head of the Arab Joint List alliance in the Israeli Knesset, Ayman Odeh, described the passing of the racist Jewish Nation-State Law as “the death of our democracy.” Did he truly believe that prior to this law he had lived in a true democracy? 4 Seventy years of Israeli Jewish supremacy, genocide, ethnic cleansing, wars, sieges, mass incarceration and numerous discriminatory laws — all aimed at the very destruction of the Palestinian people — should have given enough clues that Israel was never a democracy to begin with. The Jewish Nation-State Law is merely the icing on the cake. It simply gave those who argued all along that Israel’s attempt at combining democracy with ethnic supremacy was racism masquerading as democracy the munition they needed to further illustrate the point. There is no escaping the moral imperative now. Those who insist on supporting Israel must know that they are supporting an unabashed apartheid regime. The new law, which was passed after some wrangling on July 19, has divorced Israel from any claim, however untrue, to being a democratic state. In fact, the law does not mention the word “democracy” even once, but reference to the Jewish identity of the state are ample and dominant, clearly excluding the Palestinian people from their rights in their historic homeland. Most dangerous of all is the stipulation that “the state views Jewish settlement as a national value and will labor to encourage and promote its establishment and development.” True, illegal Jewish settlements already dot Palestinian land in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and de facto segregation already exists in Israel itself. Segregation is so entrenched that even maternity wards in Israeli hospitals separate between mothers based on their race. But the above stipulation will further accelerate segregation and cement apartheid, making the harm not merely intellectual and political, but physical as well. Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, has documented in its Discriminatory Laws Database a list of more than 65 Israeli laws that “discriminate directly or indirectly against Palestinian citizens in Israel and/or Palestinian residents of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) on the basis of their national belonging.” According to Adalah, these laws “limit the rights of Palestinians in all areas of life, from citizenship rights to the right to political participation, land and housing rights, education rights, cultural and language rights, religious rights, and due process rights during detention.” Those who insist on supporting Israel must know that they are supporting an unabashed apartheid. Ramzy Baroud While it would be accurate to argue that the Jewish Nation-State Law is the officiation of apartheid in Israel, this realization should not dismiss the previous reality upon which the country was founded 70 years ago. Apartheid is not a single law, but a slow, agonizing buildup of an intricate legal regime that is motivated by the belief that one racial group is superior to all others. Not only does the new law elevate Israel’s Jewish identity and erase any commitment to democracy, but it also downgrades the status of all others. Palestinian Arabs, the natives of the land of historic Palestine upon which Israel was established, do not feature prominently in the new law at all. There is a mere stipulation made to Arabic, but only to downgrade it from an official language to a “special” one. Israel’s decision to refrain from formulating a written constitution when it was founded in 1948 was not a haphazard one. Since then, it has been following a predictable model where it would alter reality on the ground to the advantage of Jews at the expense of Palestinian Arabs. Instead of a constitution, Israel resorted to what it termed “basic laws,” which allowed for the constant formulation of new laws guided by the state’s commitment to racial supremacy rather than to democracy, international law, human rights or any other ethnic value. The Jewish Nation-State Law is itself a basic law. And with that law, Israel has dropped the meaningless claim to being both Jewish and democratic. This impossible task was often left to the Supreme Court, which tried and failed to strike any convincing balance. This new reality should, once and for all, end the protracted debate on the supposed uniqueness of Israel’s political system. And since Israel has chosen racial supremacy over any claim, however faint, to real democracy, Western countries that have often shielded it must choose whether they wish to support an apartheid regime or fight against it. The initial statement by EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini was lackluster and feeble. “We are concerned, we have expressed this concern and we will continue to engage with Israeli authorities in this context,” she said, while renewing her commitment to the two-state solution. This is hardly the proper statement in response to a country that had just announced its membership in the apartheid club. The EU must end its wishy-washy political discourse and disengage from apartheid Israel, or it has to accept the moral, ethical and legal consequences of being an accomplice in Israeli crimes against Palestinians. Israel has made its choice, and it is unmistakably the wrong one. The rest of the world must now make its choice as well, hopefully the right one: standing on the right side of history, against Israeli Jewish apartheid and for Palestinian rights. Ramzy Baroud is a journalist, author and editor of the Palestine Chronicle. His latest book is ‘The Last Earth: A Palestinian Story’ (Pluto Press, London). Baroud has a PhD in Palestine Studies from the University of Exeter, and is a non-resident scholar at the Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies, University of California Santa Barbara.

Members of the Israeli anti-miscegenation group Lehava protest against the marriage of a Palestinian man and an Israeli Jewish woman in Rishon Letzion, 17 August 2014. Yotam Ronen ActiveStills The Israeli government has long funded various efforts to try to prevent romantic relationships between Jews and non-Jews, both inside territories it controls and around the world. But a new program confirmed this month by the tourism ministry takes Israel’s war on families of mixed religion or ethnicity to a new level. Israeli media reported on 10 July that in 2019, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will fund trips to the country for foreign Jews, with the express objective of participating in singles mixers on and around Tu B’Av, a day celebrated by some as the “Jewish Valentine’s Day.” “Over the course of the events, young Jewish-Israelis and Jews that live in the diaspora will get to know one another, and that is likely to lead to couples forming,” predicted Israel Hayom, the pro-Netanyahu newspaper owned by casino billionaire, Republican financier and anti-Palestinian donor Sheldon Adelson. “We’ll return to the glory days,” ruling Likud Party lawmaker Sharren Haskel told the paper. “Young [Jewish] men and women from all over the world will arrive and form relationships with local young men and women, in order to prevent assimilation and strengthen the connection to Judaism.” Haskel used a Hebrew word that literally translates as “assimilation,” but that in modern Hebrew is commonly used as a euphemism for miscegenation – romantic relationships and procreation between Jews and non-Jews. Haskel recently toured the al-Aqsa mosque compound along with Uri Ariel, a cabinet minister and leading figure in the Jewish extremist movement that supports the destruction of the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque in order to replace them with a Jewish temple. Israeli governments past and present have spent enormous sums subsidizing trips to the country for young Jews from abroad. Between 2010 and 2015 alone, the government gave more than $250 million to the largest provider of such trips, Birthright Israel. Adelson himself donated $40 million to Birthright in 2015. “Free sex vacation to Israel” The primary purpose of the program is fostering Zionist commitment and eventual emigration by young Jews, but the trips also aim to encourage young Jews to have sexual relations with one another, hoping this will sour them on romantic relationships with non-Jewish people back in their home countries. Birthright’s promotion of relationships between tour participants – and between participants and Israeli tour staff – is not explicitly cited in its official publications. But it is nonetheless widely acknowledged. In April, Birthright participants told Sarah Seltzer, a reporter with The Investigative Fund, about how “the combination of hook-up pressure, spring-break partying and romanticization of planned encounters between Israeli soldiers and American women” creates “a pervasive environment of sexual pressure that encourages Jews to meet, marry and, someday, procreate with other Jews.” In the experience of one young woman profiled by Seltzer, that pressure contributed to an alleged sexual assault perpetrated against her during a Birthright trip by an Israeli soldier. A writer for Vice who went on Birthright called it a “free sex vacation to Israel” and an “all-expenses-paid orgy in the desert,” sponsored by the Israeli government in the hope that “young Semites will meet, marry and procreate, yielding little mini Jews.” Other have also mocked the trips for sponsoring “22-year-olds to go to the Middle East, get totally drunk and have sex with everyone.” And in 2013, Birthright benefactor Sheldon Adelson himself told an assembled audience of young participants: “I hope you’ve all been doing the hanky-panky.” Dispensing with the pretense But the new Tu B’Av trips promoted by Haskel dispense with pretense: the initiative’s authors openly admit that their main objective is to encourage Jews to form romantic relationships with other Jews and to steer clear of non-Jews. Israel Hayom reported that the trips would include “wine tastings and camping in vineyards across the country,” to which local Israeli Jews would also be invited. The mixers will feature singing and dancing events dubbed “Returning to the Palmach and the Irgun” – a reference to two Zionist militias that participated in the 1948 Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of more than 750,000 Palestinians. The Irgun is particularly notorious for the massacre of Palestinian civilians in the village of Deir Yassin in 1948 and for the bombing of the King David Hotel two years earlier. Israel Hayom does not say how organizers would ensure that attendance would be restricted to Jews, and forbidden to Palestinian citizens of Israel, African refugees and other non-Jewish single men and women. However, given the highly segregated reality within Israel, this should not be difficult. No mixed marriages Israeli law records religious designations for each of its citizens and it does not permit couples registered under different religions to legally marry one another. The state does, however, retroactively recognize wedding ceremonies performed for such couples in other countries. Statisticians estimate that as many as one in 10 marriages in Israel are between persons from different groups. However, non-Jewish spouses – especially if they are from African states – often face deliberate obstacles from the government to their entry or residency. In recent years, Israeli government attacks on mixed relationships, within Israel and without, have been led by the far-right Jewish Home party and its leader Naftali Bennett. During Bennett’s time as education minister, Israel has stripped from its recommended reading lists for high school students books about mixed relationships. In 2015, it removed Borderlife, about a romance between a Jewish woman and a Palestinian man, and in 2016, it removed Trumpet in the Wadi, about a romance between a Jewish man and a Palestinian woman. Bennett’s education ministry also funds groups of religious Jews to move into the few mixed neighborhoods that still exist in the country – where Jews and Palestinians live alongside one another as unequal citizens, but in relative coexistence. There, the new arrivals incite against local mixed families and have distributed leaflets warning that “there are mixed marriages in almost every building in Jaffa” and exhorting residents to “strengthen Jewish identity.” Groups like Lehava recruit teens and adults to patrol Israeli towns and public beaches, where they harass mixed couples. They also protest Jewish-Palestinian wedding ceremonies with chants of “Death to the Arabs!” In 2014, three Lehava members torched the only school in the Jerusalem area with instruction in both Hebrew and Arabic, daubing the walls with slogans including “End miscegenation” and “No coexistence with cancer.” The three received sentences of about three years in prison. Fighting mixed marriages abroad In his other role as minister of diaspora affairs, Bennett funnels money to programs aimed at stamping out relationships between Jews and non-Jews overseas as well. When Bennett took over the diaspora affairs ministry in 2013, its budget from the government was about $8 million a year. Now Bennett is talking about spending $1 billion annually on projects around the world described as promoting “the future of the Jewish people.” In June 2016, Bennett told a committee of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, that the marriage of Jews to non-Jews in modern times is a disaster on par with four other tragedies of Jewish history, including the Nazi Holocaust. Five months later, two young Israelis beat to death Sudanese asylum-seeker Babikir Adham-Uvdo in a Tel Aviv suburb. Angered that a non-Jewish Black man had stopped to talk to a group of young Israeli Jewish women, the killers crushed his face so badly that his own brother was unable to recognize him. In February, one of Adham-Uvdo’s killers received a maximum jail sentence of 10 years for manslaughter, in a plea bargain, although he will probably be released in just a few years. Sentencing of the other killer, a minor at the time of the incident, has yet to be determined. “A plague” Trying to win political points by bashing mixed relationships is not exclusive to right-wing parties in Israel. In a televised interview in Hebrew in June, Isaac Herzog, the former leader of Israel’s ostensibly left-wing Zionist Union and Labor parties, called mixed families “a plague” for which he hoped to find “a solution.” VIDEO now with English subtitles: On the day he is named Jewish Agency chair, Isaac Herzog – Israel's "Leader of the Opposition" for the last 5 years – slams romantic relationships between Jews and non-Jews in the USA as “an actual plague” for which he hopes to find "a solution" pic.twitter.com/NQMMOdUtSi — David Sheen (@davidsheen) June 25, 2018 On the same day, Herzog also headed to Jerusalem to pay his respects to Israel’s Sephardic Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef – a powerful religious official with a long history of racist statements. There, Israeli media reported, Herzog thanked Yosef for his personal blessing, which included an instruction to “defend the Jewish people from assimilation.” David Sheen is an independent writer and filmmaker.

News article:
Contributing Columnist Dany Bahar July 24, 2018 It is time for the Jewish Diaspora to update some of its favorite lines for advocating on behalf of Israel. For example, “Arabic is one of Israel’s two official languages” is now a factually incorrect statement after Israel’s new Nation-State bill was passed by the Knesset last week. The bill downgraded Arabic from an official language to having “special status.” More broadly, the bill defines Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish people without mentioning the equality of all its citizens anywhere in the law. So much for the only democracy in the Middle East. Another catchy Hasbara talking point refers to Israel’s full freedom of religion. This, too, is outdated, after Rabbi Dov Haiyun was taken from his home at 5 a.m. and detained by police for performing weddings outside the auspices of the state-run Chief Rabbinate. Moreover, proudly referring to Israel as a country with full freedom of expression is nowadays, likely, an inaccurate statement, after Meyer Koplow, chair of Brandeis University’s board of trustees, was questioned on his way out of Ben-Gurion Airport over a Palestinian brochure in his luggage. The nature of the interrogation was not about him posing a security threat, but rather about his political positions. Last week also saw the erosion of one of Israel’s biggest achievements — equal rights for the LGBTQ community — which were attacked by the government coalition last week when it voted against a clause that would allow surrogate births for same-sex couples. It was a bad week for Israeli democracy, to say the least. But it was also not surprising. The weakening of Israel’s democracy is a trend that has been happening for a while now. A recent report by the V-Dem institute downgraded Israel from being a “Liberal Democracy” in 2007 to an “Electoral Democracy” in 2017, as a result of a weakening of the legislative and judicial oversight of the executive and the deterioration of protection of individual liberties and minorities. Like a cancer, the deterioration of democracy is spreading through the different institutions that, since the foundation of the state, have guaranteed the existing (and unique) balance of Israel as a democracy and a homeland to the Jewish people. For instance, it is more and more common for Arab representatives in the Knesset, who represent the largest minority in the country, to be disqualified in one way or another. And in 2016, a bill was introduced enabling their suspension from their elected positions if a qualified majority of their fellow parliamentarians decide so. More recently, a conference on the occupation held at the Knesset — organized by several opposition MKs — was disrupted and severely condemned by members of the government, some of them describing the conference organizers as a “fifth column.” Similarly, the government, through Minister of Justice Ayelet Shaked, has engaged in a battle to “change the face of the Supreme Court” as “part of a process of returning the court to its basic function: interpreting the norms that parliament decides, not replacing it.” Esther Hayut, Israel’s Supreme Court President, reacted to a bill limiting the power of the High Court of Justice by saying that Israel’s Judiciary is “under unprecedented attack” and that the bill threatens the human rights of every individual in Israeli society. Some important institutions of civil society have endured constant attacks by the government. For instance, Minister of Culture Miri Regev — a close political ally of Netanyahu — has made government funding to cultural institutions conditional on political stances. Recently, she responded to a funding request by the well-regarded Israel Museum by insisting the cash be used to pay for an extravagant fundraising gala, with Sara Netanyahu as the guest of honor. In parallel, the press has also been under constant attack by Prime Minister Netanyahu himself, who has on several occasions dubbed Israeli media outlets as “fake news.” This has only intensified with the media reporting the ongoing investigations against Netanyahu and his wife on open corruption cases. In 2017 Freedom House ranked Israel 33 out of 100 in terms of freedom of the press. The only significant establishment of the state apparatus that has been, so long, untouched is the defense establishment (whose recommendations very often contradict the current government’s political philosophy). It would come as no surprise were they to be the next ones attacked for their professionalism. On almost every front, Israeli democracy is under attack. Those Israelis who are fighting for democracy — hopefully a majority — cannot do it alone. They need the help of all Jews around the world who believe Israel’s democratic character is an essential part of it. This attack is, perhaps, the most important threat to the future of Israel as it was envisioned by its founders and all the Jewish people. Thus, maybe the best course of action for Jews in the Diaspora is not to worry about updating or replacing now-outdated Hasbara lines, but rather, to be first to acknowledge this systematic attack on Israel’s democracy, ironically led by its own government. We cannot keep defending the indefensible. It is time for Jews in the Diaspora who love Israel to confront Netanyahu and his government for slowly destroying Israel’s democracy. The future of Israel depends on it. Dany Bahar is an Israeli and Venezuelan economist. He is currently a David M.

News article:
It would be shamefully embarrassing for Western officials, particularly the Americans, to lecture Arabs from now on that Israel is ‘the region’s democratic oasis’ or ‘the only democracy in the Middle East.’ The Israeli state has not only uncovered its deep-rooted racist nature by adopting the latest ‘Nation-State Law’, but it has also officially ‘legalised’ its racism by parliamentary legislation. The ‘law’ gives Jews, wherever they are on the planet, exclusive rights to self-determination in Israel. Israel has constitutionally put its Jewishness ahead of its so-called democracy. Last week, the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) voted 62 in favour and 55 against with 2 abstentions, to pass the most racist legislation ever known that directly aims to discriminate against its Palestinian inhabitants. Frankly, the vote won’t change much of the life of Palestinians who are 22 per cent of Israel’s population and have always experienced Israel’s brutality since its creation in 1948. The only difference now after the vote is that discrimination against Arabs in Israel has become officially legal. The legislation clearly reveals the ugly face of racism in Israel by declaring that the country is “the historic homeland of the Jewish people” (…) and that “the rights to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” Also, the new law specifically establishes Hebrew as the “official language” downgrading Arabic to what the law calls “special status”. More dangerously the law also claims the internationally illegal “Jewish settlements [colonies]”, including those built in the occupied territories after 1967 war in Palestine and Syria’s Golan Hight, are “of a national value”. Chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee Avi Dichter, who sponsored the law, viciously insulted the protesting 17 Arab members of the Knesset on the day of passing the bill and said: “We (the Jews) were here before you, and we will be here after you.” Dichter, who represents Likud party, continued: “We are shrining this important bill into law to prevent the slightest thought, let alone attempt, to transfer (presumably he meant to turn) Israel to a country for all its citizen (sic).” What Dichter is really saying that Israel’s purpose of existence is to cater to Jews not only inside Israel but wherever they live and regardless whether if there were citizens of Israel or not. Dichter’s is reminiscent of many racial statements issued by Zionist leaders throughout Israel’s history, including that of the Likud’s co-founder and former prime minister, the infamous Menachem Begin. “The (British) partition of Palestine is illegal” he once stated in the Knesset, “and it will never be recognised.” Begin, who co-signed Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in March 1979 with former president Anwar Sadat, added: “Jerusalem was and will forever be our capital … Eretz Israel will be restored to the people of Israel. All of it … and forever.” No more pretence However, Israel has eventually opted for the religiousness of its identity rather than its own controversial brand of democracy. The bill was, before it became a law, first introduced a little less than seven years ago, but never went through to become legislation because of its decisiveness nature. The pretence of being a democracy has reached its final limits because of the Israeli government’s failure to maintain the delicate balance between appearing as a democracy and its true racist identity. Since its founding in 1948, Israel miserably failed under a left or right rule to maintain the Jewishness concept and a well-respected democracy. In fact, Israel was never a democracy even though it managed to pretend to be one for a long time. Now, the mask has fallen and the pretence to be both Jewish and democratic is no longer sustainable. The fact that bill was rejected few times since it was first introduced in 2011, clearly reflects the predicament of the Apartheid nature of the regime in general. The world has clearly seen that criminal practice in South Africa in the not distant past. But in the case of Israel, this discriminative practice against its sizeable Arab minority, successive Israeli governments have continued, unhindered, under the protection of the United States. However, as far the as the Arabs in Israel [Palestinians in 1948 areas] are concerned, they have been subjected to Israel’s brutality since the creation of the state. Therefore, any changes that the recent law brings along are only symbolic. In fact, the notorious British colonial document, known as ‘Balfour Declaration’ of 1917, recognisably confirmed the establishment of a “homeland for the Jews” in Palestine without even uttering a word about the future fate of its Arab citizens. Arabs in Palestine remained the majority till their great expulsion from their homeland in 1948 in what was known as ‘Nakba’ (Catastrophe). Therefore, the Nation-State Law is clearly a definite statement to those citizens of Israel who are not Jews, informing them: you are legally now second-class citizens. In other words, the Israeli establishment is challengingly telling the world: we are Jewish first … and this is supreme. That’s it.

Dichter’s is reminiscent of many racial statements issued by Zionist leaders throughout Israel’s history, including that of the Likud’s co-founder and former prime minister, the infamous Menachem Begin. “The (British) partition of Palestine is illegal” he once stated in the Knesset, “and it will never be recognised.” Begin, who co-signed Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in March 1979 with former president Anwar Sadat, added: “Jerusalem was and will forever be our capital … Eretz Israel will be restored to the people of Israel. All of it … and forever.” No more pretence However, Israel has eventually opted for the religiousness of its identity rather than its own controversial brand of democracy. The bill was, before it became a law, first introduced a little less than seven years ago, but never went through to become legislation because of its decisiveness nature. The pretence of being a democracy has reached its final limits because of the Israeli government’s failure to maintain the delicate balance between appearing as a democracy and its true racist identity. Since its founding in 1948, Israel miserably failed under a left or right rule to maintain the Jewishness concept and a well-respected democracy. In fact, Israel was never a democracy even though it managed to pretend to be one for a long time. Now, the mask has fallen and the pretence to be both Jewish and democratic is no longer sustainable. The fact that bill was rejected few times since it was first introduced in 2011, clearly reflects the predicament of the Apartheid nature of the regime in general. The world has clearly seen that criminal practice in South Africa in the not distant past. But in the case of Israel, this discriminative practice against its sizeable Arab minority, successive Israeli governments have continued, unhindered, under the protection of the United States. However, as far the as the Arabs in Israel [Palestinians in 1948 areas] are concerned, they have been subjected to Israel’s brutality since the creation of the state. Therefore, any changes that the recent law brings along are only symbolic. In fact, the notorious British colonial document, known as ‘Balfour Declaration’ of 1917, recognisably confirmed the establishment of a “homeland for the Jews” in Palestine without even uttering a word about the future fate of its Arab citizens. Arabs in Palestine remained the majority till their great expulsion from their homeland in 1948 in what was known as ‘Nakba’ (Catastrophe). Therefore, the Nation-State Law is clearly a definite statement to those citizens of Israel who are not Jews, informing them: you are legally now second-class citizens. In other words, the Israeli establishment is challengingly telling the world: we are Jewish first … and this is supreme. That’s it.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will reportedly convene a meeting to re-examine the controversial nation-state law passed last week after an outcry by the Druze community. Earlier on Wednesday, Education Minister and Jewish Home Party leader Naftali Bennett said the nation-state law “deeply hurt” the Druze community, an influential ethno-religious minority group in Israel, adding that the government must “find a way to heal this wound.” “After discussions with many of our Druze brothers, it appears that the way the nation-state law was legislated deeply hurt the very people who have linked their fate to the Jewish state,” Bennett wrote on Twitter. “This, of course, was not the intent of the government of Israel. These are our blood brothers, who stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us on the battlefield and have forged a life-covenant with us. It is our responsibility, as the government of Israel, to find a way to heal this wound.” According to reports, Bennett may push for an amendment to the nation-state law for the Druze. However, Israel’s Channel 10 reported that Netanyahu will not consider amending the law, but is open to over ideas on reviewing the situation for the Druze. Druze officials and Knesset member Akram Hasson of the Kulanu Party filed a petition on Sunday asking Israel’s Supreme Court to strike down the nation-state law.

The bill codifies many of Israel’s national symbols, such as the national anthem, the Israeli flag, national holidays and the calendar as Jewish. Some objected to the new law, saying that it unfairly discriminates against Israel’s non-Jewish minority, which comprise about 20 percent of the population. A unique ethno-religious group, Israel is home to around 135,000 Druze. Unlike other Arabic-speaking minority groups, Druze are drafted in the Israel Defense Forces, and also serve in top positions in the Israeli government and police force.

News article:
Israelis watch fireworks over Jerusalem on April 18, 2018, at the start of the country's annual Independence Day celebrations Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks with lawmakers from the minority Druze community on Thursday after a court challenge over a deeply controversial law declaring Israel the nation state of the Jewish people. Opponents have called the law "racist" as it makes no mention of equality and Israel's democratic character, implying the country's Jewish nature takes precedence. It speaks of Israel as the historic homeland of the Jews and says they have a "unique" right to self-determination there. Members of Israel's 130,000-strong Druze community -- who serve in the police and military -- have been among those strongly denouncing the legislation. Community leaders have filed a court challenge to the law, given final passage in the middle of the night on July 19. It becomes part of Israel's so-called basic laws, a de facto constitution. Two key ministers have called for changes to the law in response to concerns from the Druze. Netanyahu held a meeting with Druze lawmakers on the issue, along with Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, Tourism Minister Yariv Levin and Communications Minister Ayoob Kara. Kara, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud, is Druze but voted in favour of the law. He has since reportedly received death threats. Netanyahu planned another meeting on Friday with Druze community leaders and a plan would later be developed to express Israel's "profound commitment" to the Druze, the prime minister's office said. Kahlon called for changes, saying the law had been "passed in haste". "The last thing that we want is to harm the Druze community," Kahlon, whose Kulanu party is the second-largest in Netanyahu's coalition, told army radio. - 'Heal the rift' - His comments followed similar ones on Wednesday by Education Minister Naftali Bennett of the religious nationalist Jewish Home party. Bennett, who was a prominent advocate for the law, said he had now realised damage was done, adding that the Druze were "our brothers who stand shoulder to shoulder with us on the battlefield". "We, the government of Israel, have a responsibility to find a way to heal the rift," he said. The law has sparked international criticism of Israel and intense controversy at home. A freelance cartoonist for a local magazine who drew Netanyahu and other politicians as pigs alongside a reference to George Orwell's "Animal Farm" after the passing of the law has become a subject of criticism. The Jerusalem Report magazine decided to stop publishing Avi Katz's cartoons "after a number of them in recent months sparked angry reactions", a statement from the magazine's owner, The Jerusalem Post Group, said Thursday. "A cartoon showing Israeli leaders with pigs' heads causes harm and incitement, and has no place in any of our publications," it said. Some said the cartoon contained anti-Semitic images even though it was a clear reference to Orwell's book, with the quote: "All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others." Press freedom advocates criticised the magazine's move to let him go. The controversy over the new law is set to continue in the coming days, with Druze leaders planning a demonstration against the law in central Tel Aviv on August 4. The Druze are an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Officials say there are 110,000 of them in northern Israel and another 20,000 in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The legislation makes Hebrew the country's national language and defines the establishment of Jewish communities as being in the national interest. Arabic, previously considered an official language, was granted only special status. Arab Israelis have also denounced the law, saying it encourages discrimination and racism. Arab citizens make up some 17.5 percent of Israel's more than eight million population. The Palestinian leadership has lashed out at the passage of the law. Palestine Liberation Organisation secretary-general Saeb Erekat told journalists Thursday that "this law was introduced to constitute the basis of cancelling the concept of a two-state solution and to officially replace it with one state, two systems -- apartheid."

Leaders of the Druze community in Israel have voiced their anger with the Israeli Jewish-nation state law which was voted into law last week, describing it as "betrayal" following the sacrifices they made for Israel, Safa news agency reported yesterday. In a letter, retired Israeli Druze army officer Amal Asaad said that what happened was a "stab in the back and betrayal for the sacrifices made by Druze since 1948. They fought side by side with the Jews against the Arab enemy." He added: "The Jewish nationality law, which considers Israel a nation state for Jews without considering the Druze, means the Druze are an unrecognised group and deals with them as an emergent entity; however, their roots in this land dates back hundreds of years." Asaad said that the Druze are to file a petition to the High Court to appeal against the legality of this law.

Last week Israel approved the "Jewish nation state bill" which considers that only Jews have the right of self-determination in the country, it also strips Arabic of its designation as an official language alongside Hebrew, downgrading it to a "special status" that enables its continued use within Israeli institutions.

News article:
Eight years ago, a journalist friend and I had an idea for a YouTube video. We were living in Jerusalem and the Israeli Parliament was about to hear a reading of a loyalty oath bill. The bill, which targeted Palestinian citizens of Israel, was part of a wave of right-wing legislation designed to entrench the Jewish character of the country at all costs into the country’s public institutions. The political climate was toxic. A nominally democratic state was drunk on nationalism and sliding towards fascism. Given the nationalist sentiment flying around, would people on the street happily read a loyalty oath used by fascist governments on camera if the terms Israel and Jewish were inserted into the text? Had the nationalist fever reached such a level? The answer was yes. As we walked around the centre of West Jerusalem, everyone we approached was happy to read our oath and most people enthusiastically added their own lines slamming Palestinians and Arabs. When we told them they were reading from a 1930s fascist loyalty oath, few seemed to care. That was nearly a decade ago and the seed planted in those earlier bills has blossomed into fully fledged parliamentary laws. This month the Knesset passed the so-called Nation State Bill as law. Among other provisions, the bill enshrines the rights of Jewish citizens of Israel, above all others. Legally speaking, self-determination is now the sole domain of Jewish people in Israel. Arabic, which had been an official language since the founding of the country, was demoted to a “special status”. Because Israel lacks a constitution, this bill will have far-reaching implications across society and could be used to enact further legislation eroding the rights of Israel’s minority citizens. This will be clear in the work of the Israeli high court. In the absence of a constitution, the court often determines exactly what “Jewish and democratic” mean in practice. This law gives the country’s Jewish character far more weight than its democratic one and that will likely be reflected in future high court rulings. Unsurprisingly, minority groups have strongly pushed back against the legislation. The Palestinian-led Joint List party pushed for its own "State of All Its Citizens" law, which attempted to "anchor in constitutional law the principle of equality for every citizen while recognizing the existence and rights of two national groups, Jews and Arabs, who live within the state's internationally recognized borders". The bill was rejected by the Knesset. Highlighting the intent of the nation state law, early versions of the bill allowed communities to be segregated along religious and national lines. That language was removed because of its obvious similarity to segregationist legislation from the Jim Crow era in the US. Since the founding of the country, a deep tension over how an ethno-religious state could function as a democracy, with provisions for all its citizens, has hung over the Israeli government. One reason Israel never formally established a constitution was to avoid having to resolve this tension. The current right-wing leadership, propelled by an American president willing to support all of Israel's worst tendencies, believes the time for hollow talk about democracy is over. Israel's leaders don't care about the condemnations emanating from the international community – and why should they? Israel’s colonisation project over the Palestinians has accelerated over the last 25 years with no clear penalty. In practice, the country has annexed most of the West Bank while isolating Gaza from the rest of Palestine and the world. Despite effectively destroying the two-state solution, Israel has been awarded de facto American recognition of its control over Jerusalem. Israel has never been interested in creating an equitable democracy for all its citizens. The Palestinians that ended up as Israeli citizens in 1948 have been subject to the same forms of discrimination as their brethren in the West Bank. While it is tempting to claim the nation state bill is a sign that Israel is sliding towards apartheid, in which separate and unequal is enshrined in law, the fact is that nothing has fundamentally changed since 1948. Israel has been a Jewish and democratic state for Jews since its founding. Palestinian citizens of Israel have faced institutional discrimination from the beginning. West Bank and Gazan Palestinians have been deprived of their basic human and civil rights from the start. The nation state bill is a step towards codifying this process. As similar bills pass into law, it will become more difficult for Israel to hide behind the illusion of liberal democracy. Nothing much will change on the ground but Israel's public relations campaign will suffer. From this vantage point, the lawmakers who passed this bill have done a great disservice to the Israeli state project and given the country’s critics all the ammunition they need to reveal the true face of Israeli “democracy”.

© Yonkers Tribune I think it was not a necessary law to pass. Look everybody knows Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people. If you want to pass a basic law, you just pass a law incorporating the brilliant declaration of independence of Israel, which talks about equal rights for all. I don't think there was a need to have a basic law declaring what everybody knows. It only gives ammunition to the opposition. People who think this will help in Israeli Diaspora relations are wrong. Look I don't think anybody doubts that Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people. Of course the criticism of it is hypocritical, coming from the Palestinians. They declare Palestine to be an Islamic state governed by sharia law, where no Jew can buy property or be a citizen. That's really racist. I mean, almost all the Arab countries are Muslim states. But I didn't see any reason for enacting this law on Israel's 70th anniversary. I think it was a mistake. "we are troubled by the fact that the law, which celebrates the fundamental Jewish nature of the state, raises significant questions about the government's long-term commitment to its pluralistic identity and democratic nature." There was no need for this legislation: Israel was already a Jewish homeland....

Its main purpose appears to be shoring up Prime Minister Netanyahu's status with right-wing voters ahead of possible elections later this year or next. The state shall act to preserve the cultural, historical and religious heritage of the Jewish people among Jews in the Diaspora.

News article:
Why Israel’s Nation-State Law Matters BY: David Isaac https://freebeacon.com/blog/israels-nation-state-law-matters/ On Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared that the “spirit of Hitler has been revived, Israel is the most fascist and racist state.” He then called on—well, everybody—”to work against Israel.” What sent Erdogan into orbit was Israel’s newly minted Nation-State Law, which passed last week by a vote of 62 to 55 after a boisterous Knesset debate lasting over eight hours. The law declares the Land of Israel is the Jewish people’s historic homeland. It identifies symbols of the state—the flag with its Star of David, the menorah, the national anthem Hatikvah (“the Hope”). It codifies certain official holidays like the Sabbath, recognizes Hebrew as the official language and proclaims encouragement for Jewish immigration and Jewish settlement. Much of this sounds ho-hum. The law in good part is a reprise of Israel’s Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that it is the “natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate, like all other nations, in their own sovereign State.” Nevertheless, the Nation-State Law is significant: 1) It gives the 1948 declaration the force of law. As the first president of Israel’s Supreme Court said: “The Declaration expresses the vision and credo of the people; but it is not a constitutional law making a practical ruling on the upholding or nullification of various ordinances and statutes.” For many years, Israeli legal scholars have called for turning the Declaration into a Basic law—Basic Laws in Israel have greater force than other laws as they cannot be easily overturned. Israel has about a dozen such laws. They are akin to a Bill of Rights in a country that has yet to pass a constitution. 2) The Nation-State Law makes clear that Israel is a Jewish state. It will be surprising to some that such a thing needs to be clarified at all. But in Israel, a battle rages over whether Israel should be a Jewish state or a ‘state for all its citizens.’ In June, three Arab MKs attempted to introduce a law called “Basic Law: The State for all its Citizens.” If it was just an Arab minority which held such a position, that would be one thing. But as Yoram Hazony, president of the Herzl Institute, details in his 2001 book, The Jewish State: The Struggle for Israel’s Soul, there is a concerted effort on the part of Israel’s elites to break with their Jewish past and erase their Jewish future. A stronghold of these elites is Israel’s Supreme Court, whose justices espouse a progressive, universalist, and post-Zionist worldview. There’s little doubt this worldview has shaped the Court’s decisions, as recently documented in a report by the Israeli group Regavim. In one of the rare thoughtful responses to the Nation-State law, Dror Eydar, opinion-page editor of Israel Hayom, points out that the law returns balance to the equation a “Jewish-democratic” state. Basic Laws already exist defending the rights of every Israeli citizen. Yet, until last week no Basic Law existed to protect Israel’s Jewish character. As Eydar writes: Not only do people have rights, but the Jewish people have the right to a state of their own in the Land of Israel. … Individual rights, human rights, civil rights – everyone has those. … But national rights in the State of Israel belong to only one nation: the Jewish people. Israel cannot be a state of all its nationalities – a Jewish, Muslim and Christian state. We returned to Israel in order to establish our one state. In the last three thousand years, there has been no separate political entity in this country, which was not Israeli or Jewish. Within the state, everyone has equal rights – as individuals; not as a nationality. Only in this way will our future be assured. It’s not just right. It is also moral. Eydar’s words should embarrass the law’s Jewish critics, from opposition politicians like Meretz MK Tamar Zandberg who decried it as “coercive and belligerent jingoism” to Israeli media pundits who denounced it as “racist,” “destructive,” “a moral collapse.” The pile-on extended to the United States where the American Jewish Committee, the Union for Reform Judaism, and the ADL jumped in before the ink was dry, the first saying it was “deeply disappointed,” the second saying it causes “enormous damage to the legitimacy of the Zionist vision,” and the last declaring the law “raises significant questions” about Israel’s commitment to its “democratic nature.” The shrill attack of Erdogan is one thing. Dreamer of a new Caliphate, he invests heavily in Arab areas of Jerusalem to play custodian of the Muslim sites. The Nation-State Law offers him one more opportunity to posture as leader of all Muslims. Equally comprehensible is the reaction of Israel’s anti-Jewish Arab parliamentarians, who shouted ‘Allahu Akbar” after the law passed, tore up their draft copies and had to be forcibly escorted from the hall. But as Martin Sherman, executive director of the Israel Institute for Strategic Studies, notes, “far more inexplicable, unacceptable, and inexcusable is the fact that over 40 self-professed “Zionist” MKs voted against the bill—including the perversely named “Zionist Union,” Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, as well as the left-wing Meretz faction.” Indeed, that Jewish Knesset members, Israeli pundits and American Jewish leaders should share a position with an Islamist dictator ought to give them pause, or at least, give second thoughts to those who would heed them. If anything, it proves that the need for the Nation-State Law was acute. Comments are closed.

News article:
In an Army Radio interview on Sunday, Israel’s incoming opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, said she had repeatedly urged government legislators in the run-up to July 19’s passage of Israel’s new Jewish nation-state law to add in a single crucial phrase. She had, she made clear, no objection to the text declaring Israel to be “the national home of the Jewish people.” Quite the reverse. But to ensure that the law fully reflected modern Israel’s founding principles, she argued, it also needed to include Israel’s commitment to “equality for all its citizens.” In the Declaration of Independence, she noted, Israel promises “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.” Few if any of Israel’s Arab Knesset members would have voted for the bill even in the form she wanted, Livni acknowledged — since rather than a Jewish and democratic state, they seek to designate Israel as the state of all its citizens. But had that “equality” phrase been inserted, most or all the rest of the opposition would have supported it, and the law would have garnered about 100 of the 120 Knesset members’ votes, rather than squeezing through, as it did, by 62 votes to 55. How impressive such overwhelming support would be, she argued to coalition members, how resonant an endorsement of Israel’s central principles. Livni said coalition MKs derided her for her naivete. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t want opposition support for the law. Rather, she said they told her, he wanted to send a message to the Israeli public that he and his coalition colleagues were the dependably nationalist defenders of Jewish Israel. Echoing her assertion, Yohanan Plesner, a former Kadima MK and today the head of the Israel Democracy Intstitute, charged Sunday that Likud legislators had sought to create a picture of “patriots and non-patriots” by means of the law and its divided support in the Knesset. “The current legislation was politically motivated, as a precursor to an election campaign where Netanyahu and the Likud could create a situation of patriots and non-patriots,” he claimed. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In the 10 days since the law was passed, the controversy surrounding it, rather than dissipating fairly quickly, as most controversies do, has intensified. Some critics consider the law to constitute the legislative codifying of discrimination, and therefore bitterly interpret it as the beginning of — or another slip in the continuing slide toward — the end of Israeli democracy. Others share Netanyahu’s declared assertion that it marks a positive “pivotal” moment in the history of the modern state, with the belated formalized legislation of Israel as the state of the Jews, and argue that Israel’s democratic principles are already entrenched elsewhere, in existing legislation such as the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty of 1992. This Basic Law establishes “the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state” and provides that “there shall be no violation of the life, body or dignity of any person as such.” (A 1994 amendment to the law also states that “fundamental human rights” in Israel be upheld “in the spirit of the principles set forth” in the Declaration of Independence.) While none of Israel’s Basic Laws specifies “equality,” this 1992 law is considered by some jurists to provide for it. Until Saturday night, the most resonant objections to the law came from Israel’s 130,000-strong Druze community. While several MKs from the Joint (Arab) List protested the law as discriminatory, vowed to seek international intervention, and even enlisted Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in their battle against it, their criticisms made little impression on the Israeli Jewish mainstream; they are not Zionists. Advertisement But complaints of discrimination from the Druze, who fight alongside the Jews in the Israel Defense Forces and have paid a heavy price in lost lives in the defense of the nation, were internalized and even endorsed by some government ministers. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon (Kulanu) called the final wording of the law hasty and mistaken; the hawkish education minister and Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett said the government had to find a way to heal the wounds it had inflicted on “our brothers who stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us on the battlefield and made a covenant with us.” Both ministers called for the law to be amended. Netanyahu, who held a meeting Friday with Druze leaders, and another on Sunday, made no commitment to doing so. If some ministers consider the law problematic and a mistake because of Druze objections to its purported discriminatory provisions, why are those provisions any less problematic, and any less mistaken, for any other Israeli minority? The empathetic response in government to the heartfelt complaints from the Druze community may be understandable, but it is not particularly logical. If some ministers consider the law problematic and a mistake because of Druze objections to its purported discriminatory provisions, why are those provisions any less problematic, and any less mistaken, for any other Israeli minority? As of Saturday, however, argument over the law shifted into the familiar battleground of partisan politics. In a live television interview that night, Zouheir Bahloul, an Arab member of a Zionist political party, the Zionist Union, announced his resignation from the Knesset — branding the law a “drastic act… that makes the Arab population officially, constitutionally outside the realms of equality in Israel.” Bahloul was a somewhat controversial figure within the Zionist Union. Its leader, Avi Gabbay, had reportedly indicated last year that he did not see a future for Bahloul in the party, after Bahloul said he would not attend a Knesset ceremony marking the 100th year anniversary of the Balfour Declaration because that would mean celebrating the Zionist character of the state when part of his own identity as a Palestinian remained unrecognized. “I do not think it would be appropriate to participate when I myself am not free,” Bahloul said. Tellingly, while the former Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog expressed dismay at Bahloul’s departure, stating that “the voices of the minorities in Israel have to be heard,” Gabbay did not rush to empathize with Bahloul when he resigned on Saturday, and was refusing interview requests on Sunday. Advertisement The opposition’s discomfort and division may be music to the ears of the Netanyahu coalition — and a welcome distraction from the central question of the law’s threat to Israeli democracy. Netanyahu, at the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, robustly insisted that criticism of the law, which he called the “essence of the Zionist vision,” was “nonsense.” “The State of Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people, with full equality of rights for all its citizens,” he said. “This is the meaning of the words ‘Jewish and democratic state,’” he said. “Does the fact that our flag has a Star of David invalidate the individual right of any Israeli citizen? Nonsense — this statement ensures that there will be no other flag,” he added. “Does the statement that ‘Hatikva’ is our national anthem detract from the personal rights of anyone in Israel? Nonsense — it says there will be no other anthem.” Except, of course, that those phrases — “full equality of rights for all its citizens” and “Jewish and democratic state” — do not appear in the Jewish nation-state law, despite the efforts of the likes of Livni and the maverick Likud MK Benny Begin. Netanyahu on Sunday also rounded on his critics from the Left, calling their objections to the law hypocritical. “Over decades the opposition has preached to us that we must withdraw to the 1967 lines in order to ensure that Israel remains the national state of the Jewish people in which there is a Jewish majority in the state. Then suddenly when we pass a basic law to ensure exactly this, the Left cries out in protest? What hypocrisy.” He also sought to portray his left-wing opponents as ostensibly “ashamed” of Zionism: “The Israeli Left must search within itself. It needs to ask itself why the basic term of Zionism, ‘a Jewish national state of the Jewish people in its land’, has become a rude term for it — a rude word, a principle that one should be ashamed of. We are not ashamed of Zionism,” said Netanyahu. “We are proud of our state, that it is a national home for the Jewish people, which strictly upholds – in a manner that is without peer – the individual rights of all its citizens. The Knesset’s new Jewish nation-state law is, inevitably, being appealed to the Supreme Court, which may find a basis to intervene, or may consider the law’s provisions to be declarative and/or not contradictory to Israel’s already legislated Jewish and democratic principles. In this context, it might be noted that the composition of the Supreme Court has been slowly changing in recent years, with Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, a member of Bennett’s Orthodox-nationalist Jewish Home party, working to advance justices who she considers to be broadly comfortable with her political philosophy. Enshrining in Israel’s Basic Laws, the closest thing we have to a constitution, principles such as Israel as the “historical homeland of the Jewish people” with Jerusalem as its capital, the Star of David on its flag, and Hatikvah as its anthem, may well have been overdue. But in a country that, absolutely legitimately, grants automatic citizenship under the Law of Return to Jews, the equality of all Israeli citizens is a commitment that also requires the firmest establishment. There is no contradiction in being a Jewish state that opens its doors wide to all Jews, and in being a democracy that stands for full equality for all who live here. Indeed, the capacity to reconcile those two principles goes to the heart of Israel; it makes Israel unique and rightly celebrated. Advertisement Those foundational principles must flourish together. Passing a piece of landmark legislation that needlessly and deliberately — as shown by the legislative process — omitted one of them is plainly harmful to Israel’s reputation. Time will tell if it has practical implications, as a legislative cover for discrimination, but it is also, by dint of what it omits, potentially harmful to Israel’s sense of itself and what we stand for. Earlier iterations of the legislation did include references to Israel as a democracy. And three years ago, Begin drafted a proposed text of the law that stated: “Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, based on the foundations of freedom, justice and peace as envisioned by the prophets of Israel, and upholds equal rights for all its citizens.” In its final, very deliberate wording, the law smacks of narrow political interest outweighing the national good. Rush-writing the nascent state’s core principles 70 years ago, amid pandemonium and with war imminent, Israel’s founders, patriots all, did a far better job.

Time will tell if it has practical implications, as a legislative cover for discrimination, but it is also, by dint of what it omits, potentially harmful to Israel’s sense of itself and what we stand for. Earlier iterations of the legislation did include references to Israel as a democracy. And three years ago, Begin drafted a proposed text of the law that stated: “Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, based on the foundations of freedom, justice and peace as envisioned by the prophets of Israel, and upholds equal rights for all its citizens.” In its final, very deliberate wording, the law smacks of narrow political interest outweighing the national good. Rush-writing the nascent state’s core principles 70 years ago, amid pandemonium and with war imminent, Israel’s founders, patriots all, did a far better job.

Right-wing Israeli parties Likud and Jewish Home have rejected requests to modify the racist Nation State bill, Anadolu news agency reported yesterday. This position was announced after the leader of the Israeli party Kulanu, Moshe Kahlone, announced that he would work to modify the bill. Reporting the Israeli government news network KAN, Anadolu said that the leaders of Likud told Kahlone, who is the finance minister and representative of the Druze sect, that there would be no modifications. Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennet strongly rejects modifying the bill, noting there could be a confrontation between the two parties and Kulanu in the Knesset. READ: Israel bans Gaza families from visiting detainees KAN reported Kahlone saying: "The nation state bill was prepared recklessly and it will be modified." Bennet and the Israeli Justice Minister Aylet Shaked have said that they would never accept any form of modification of the bill. On 19 July the Israeli Knesset passed a bill which stipulates that Israel is a nation state for the Jewish people, giving the right to self-determination only to the Jews, making Hebrew the official language and downgrading Arabic to a second language.

Israeli MPs are to return from summer recess next week to discuss mounting criticism of a new law proclaiming the country the nation state of the Jewish people, parliament said Tuesday.President Reuven Rivlin has meanwhile reportedly said he will sign the law in Arabic, in an apparent protest against the language's loss of official status alongside Hebrew under the legislation.Rivlin's office did not confirm the reports in the Israeli media.Parliament announced it will meet on August 8 at the demand of 52 of its 120 members, more than twice the number required to call a special session.The session is for debate only and no votes will be taken, although some MPs have called for urgent changes to a law that they say legalises discrimination against the Israel's Arab minority.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended the legislation, saying there are other laws on the books that guarantee equality for non-Jews and define Israel as democratic.But Arabs have strongly criticised it, particularly those from Israel's 130,000-strong Druze community, who, unlike most other Arabs, serve in the police and military alongside Jewish Israelis.Arab lawmakers have branded the law 'racist.'A growing number of Jewish politicians have called for changes to address the concerns of the Druze.Eight former police chiefs, three ex-armed forces chiefs of staff and dozens of retired senior officers have signed petitions denouncing the law.The legislation's sponsor, Avi Dichter of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, ruled out any changes to the law."I don't see any reason to change the basic law to take into account the Druze community," Dichter told army radio, adding that he could support separate legislation related to the Druze.The reported comments by Rivlin on the sidelines of an event Monday come after he openly criticised an earlier version of the legislation many said would have allowed for Jewish-only communities. That clause was eventually modified.The law was passed in the middle of the night on July 19 and is part of Israel's so-called basic laws, a de facto constitution.It makes no mention of equality or democracy implying the country's Jewish character takes precedence.It speaks of Israel as the historic homeland of the Jews and says they have a "unique" right to self-determination within its borders.The law defines the establishment of Jewish communities as being in the national interest and makes Hebrew the sole official language.Arabic, previously considered an official language, was granted only special status.Arab citizens make up some 17.5 per cent of Israel's more than eight million population.Netanyahu leads what is seen as the most right-wing government in Israel's history.A poll by the respected Israel Democracy Institute found that 52 percent of Jewish Israelis believe there was a need for the law compared to seven percent of Arab Israelis.The poll included a sample of 600 people with a margin of error of 4.1 per cent.

News article:
* Iran was India’s third biggest oil supplier * U.S. reimposes sanctions after quitting Iran deal * SBI wants to protect U.S. operations - source (Adds comments from SBI source, BPCL) NEW DELHI, June 15 (Reuters) - India’s imports of Iranian oil may be hit from the end of August after the State Bank of India informed refiners it would not handle payments for the crude from November, the finance chief of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said on Friday. The move by the state-controlled bank, India’s biggest, comes after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran last month, pledging to reimpose tough sanctions within 180 days. “(Oil) loading will be affected from end-August under the current mechanism unless a new payment route is established,” IOC’s A. K. Sharma told Reuters in a telephone interview on Friday. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably affecting the petroleum sector, after a 180-day period ending on Nov. 4. Although New Delhi had cut imports from Tehran in 2017/18 due to a dispute over a giant gas field, Iran remained its third-biggest oil supplier. Iran supplied about 458,000 barrels per day (bpd), or about a 10th of India’s more than 4.5 million bpd of imports, in the fiscal year to March 2018. SBI has written to the Indian refiners and the government that it would not be able to handle oil payments to Iran from Nov 4, an official at SBI said. “We have said that we cannot handle oil payments to Iran in any currency as that will have an immediate impact on our U.S. operations,” this source said. An SBI spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India’s refiners currently use SBI and Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to buy Iranian oil in euros, according to IOC and other companies. MORE DISCOUNTS? India, Iran’s top oil client after China, was one of the few nations that continued to trade with Tehran during a previous round of Western sanctions. The South Asian nation has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions, but companies and banks with links to the U.S. financial system could face penalties if they do not comply. Iran offers Indian refiners a 60-day credit period on oil sales, which means payment for cargoes loaded from the end of August will be due in November. Analysts feel Iran may have to offer more incentives to protect its oil sales to India. “Indians may ask Iran for more discount in exchange for early payment for oil purchases instead of a 60-day credit period,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil at consultancy FGE. Seeking to safeguard oil imports from Iran and scout for alternate payment avenues, an Indian delegation last week visited officials and bankers in France, Germany, Britain and Brussels, the base for the European Union. “That visit was only exploratory in nature ...we are still watching the situation,” Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Reuters this week. Apart from banks, shipping firms and insurance companies have already begun distancing themselves from Iran. IOC’s Sharma said his firm received very few responses to inquiries on hiring tankers to import Iranian oil. “Only NITC (National Iranian Oil Company) and a few others participated, ” he said, adding freight rates for transportation of Iranian oil have also gone up due to the threat of sanctions. ALTERNATE OPPORTUNITIES IOC previously said it would look at buying oil from traditional suppliers mostly in the Middle East to compensate for any cut in supplies from Iran related to U.S. sanctions. Indian state-refiners previously drew up plans to almost double oil imports from Iran, which had offered deep discounts on shipping of crude. Officials at other state refiners Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum Corp confirmed receiving the SBI letter. Mumbai-based refiner Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, while Rosneft-promoted Nayara Energy has started cutting purchases from this month, sources previously told Reuters. BPCL’s head of refiners R. Ramachandran said there were other potential suppliers, including Canada and the United States or other Middle East states, that cold replace Iranian crude. “We hope suppliers like Iraq and Saudi Arabia will fill the gap,” he said. “We will get alternatives similar to Iranian oil but we will have to pay extra”.

News article:
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer As US sanctions against of Iran take effect in November, India will not be able to use European banks to make payments for the crude oil it buys from the Iran, senior officials said today. According to Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Finance Director A. K. Sharma, the State Bank of India (SBI) told oil refiners that the Euro payment route will be not available after November 3rd. Oil firms currently transfer funds to SBI, who then uses Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to pay in Euros to Iran. When US President pulled out of the landmark Iran nuclear deal last month, he said sanctions will be re-imposed on the Iranian Regime within 180 days. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) Finance Director R. Ramachandran said that alternate crude oil sources in the Middle East, the US, and Russia can be tapped, should Iranian supplies dry up due to payment problems. “Once the current payment channel is blocked, supplier (Iranian Regime) has to decide if it wants to trade with us in rupee or sell oil on credit in anticipation of channels re-opening in future,” Sharma said, and added that imports can continue on alternate modes. In 2012, when the EU joined the US to impose financial restrictions on Iran, India used a Turkish bank to pay Iran for the oil it bought. But, by February 2013, India paid nearly half of the oil import bill in rupees, and kept the remainder pending until the payment routes reopened. In 2015, when the restrictions were eased, it cleared its debt. At that same time, the EU also placed restrictions on insurance of Iranian oil and the ships that carried it. Iran supplied oil in its own tankers to resolve the problem. New Delhi has already found a way around the restrictions by bartering goods like wheat, soybean meal, and consumer products to Iran in exchange for oil. “Our refineries are flexible and a large number of options are available (to replace Iranian oil). We have suppliers, the Middle East, US and Russia,” said Ramachandran in reference to available alternatives. “It is not doomsday for us.” India can seek a waiver from US sanctions on condition that it will cut down Iranian imports. Sharma said that it is for the government to decide on whether or not India will pursue a waiver. While Iraq and Saudi Arabia supply much of India’s oil, Iran is India’s third largest oil supplier, furnishing the country with 18.4 million tons of crude oil during April 2017 and January 2018. Until 2010-11 Iran was India’s second largest supplier of crude oil. After the sanctions over its suspected nuclear program, it dropped to 7th place. After the sanctions were lifted, Iran moved up to 6th place, during 2015-16. The next year, the Iranian supplies jumped to the third spot. Iran grants refiners 60 days of credit for purchases, which is twice the amount of time given by other producers, which made it an attractive investment. However, Trump’s announcement forbids companies from entering into new deals in the Iranian oil and energy sector. Deals involving Iran’s oil and energy sector, shipping and ports, and insurance services will be prohibited come November.

Ramachandran said that alternate crude oil sources in the Middle East, the US, and Russia can be tapped, should Iranian supplies dry up due to payment problems. “Once the current payment channel is blocked, supplier (Iranian Regime) has to decide if it wants to trade with us in rupee or sell oil on credit in anticipation of channels re-opening in future,” Sharma said, and added that imports can continue on alternate modes. In 2012, when the EU joined the US to impose financial restrictions on Iran, India used a Turkish bank to pay Iran for the oil it bought. But, by February 2013, India paid nearly half of the oil import bill in rupees, and kept the remainder pending until the payment routes reopened. In 2015, when the restrictions were eased, it cleared its debt. At that same time, the EU also placed restrictions on insurance of Iranian oil and the ships that carried it. Iran supplied oil in its own tankers to resolve the problem. New Delhi has already found a way around the restrictions by bartering goods like wheat, soybean meal, and consumer products to Iran in exchange for oil. “Our refineries are flexible and a large number of options are available (to replace Iranian oil). We have suppliers, the Middle East, US and Russia,” said Ramachandran in reference to available alternatives. “It is not doomsday for us.” India can seek a waiver from US sanctions on condition that it will cut down Iranian imports. Sharma said that it is for the government to decide on whether or not India will pursue a waiver. While Iraq and Saudi Arabia supply much of India’s oil, Iran is India’s third largest oil supplier, furnishing the country with 18.4 million tons of crude oil during April 2017 and January 2018. Until 2010-11 Iran was India’s second largest supplier of crude oil. After the sanctions over its suspected nuclear program, it dropped to 7th place. After the sanctions were lifted, Iran moved up to 6th place, during 2015-16. The next year, the Iranian supplies jumped to the third spot. Iran grants refiners 60 days of credit for purchases, which is twice the amount of time given by other producers, which made it an attractive investment. However, Trump’s announcement forbids companies from entering into new deals in the Iranian oil and energy sector. Deals involving Iran’s oil and energy sector, shipping and ports, and insurance services will be prohibited come November.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer As US sanctions against of Iran take effect in November, India will not be able to use European banks to make payments for the crude oil it buys from the Iran, senior officials said today. According to Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Finance Director A. K. Sharma, the State Bank of India (SBI) told oil refiners that the Euro payment route will be not available after November 3rd. Oil firms currently transfer funds to SBI, who then uses Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to pay in Euros to Iran.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer Indian imports of Iranian oil may be heavily affected after August, according to the finance chief of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) on Friday, as the State Bank of India (SBI) has informed refiners that it will not handle payments for the crude from November. The IOC’s A. K. Sharma said: “(Oil) loading will be affected from end-August under the current mechanism unless a new payment route is established.” This move by India’s biggest bank, comes after Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in May and pledged to renew tough sanctions on the Regime within 180 days. Some sanctions, like those on the auto industry, will take effect on August 6 (90 days after the withdrawal), while those targeting the petroleum sector will come into force on November 4. The reason that Indian refiners will face penalties on August shipments is that payment on them will be due in November. Although India had reduced imports from in Iran in 2017/18, following a dispute over a gas field, Iran remained its third-biggest oil supplier, supplying about 10% (458,000 barrels per day) of India’s oil needs. SBI has already told Indian refiners that it will not be able to handle oil payments to Iran from November 4, as it will impact on their US operations. Indian refiners also use Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to handle their payments and there is no word yet on whether the EIH will withdraw. Is India turning against Iran? India, which is Iran’s second-biggest oil purchaser, was one of few nations that continued to trade with Tehran during previous sanctions. The country says that they do not follow US sanctions, but Indian companies with ties to the US could face financial penalties if they continue to trade with Iran. Some oil firms in India are seeking out alternative payment methods, through banks that do not operate in the US, but some have speculated that Indian firms will push for bigger discounts from Iran to guarantee their continued trade. It would be better if these firms pulled out of Iran altogether, not just for the companies but for the world as a whole. It would mean less money going to the Iranian Regime’s suppressive forces and less ability for the Regime to threaten the world with its proxy militias and nuclear weapons. Many companies from across the world have already pulled out or announced plans to do so by the deadline, including sporting brand Nike, energy conglomerate Total, and carmaker PSA. There are also very few shipping companies that are now willing to transport Iranian oil, most citing that insurers will not cover the shipment. Indian oil companies should pull out of Iran and purchase oil from other suppliers in the Middle East. Some have already made plans to end or reduce their imports from Iran, including Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy. But abiding by US sanctions and pushing the Iranian economy to the breaking point, firms that pull out of Iran will be helping to usher in regime change, which is the will of the Iranian people. Regime change will be the major topic of discussion at the Free Iran gathering in Paris later this month.

NEW DELHI: US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday it was important India cut Iranian oil use, but said the United States would work to allow India to use an Iranian port as corridor to Afghanistan. "Sanctions are coming (on Iran) and we´re going forward on that, and with India and the US building strong relationships we hoped that they would lessen their dependence on Iran," Haley, a member of US President Donald Trump´s cabinet, told two reporters after her meeting with Modi in New Delhi. The United States said on Tuesday it has told countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November and is unlikely to offer any exemptions as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on allies to cut off funding to Iran. India is one of the largest importers of Iran´s oil. "There´s a will, a political will, from both sides to figure out how to make this work," Haley said. "Prime Minister Modi very much understands where we are with Iran, he didn't question it, he didn't criticize it, he understood it and he also understands that (India´s) relationship with the US is strong and important and needs to stay that way. "The US push to curb countries´ imports of Iranian oil comes after Trump in May withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers aimed at stalling Tehran´s nuclear capabilities in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Trump ordered the re imposition of US sanctions that were suspended under the accord. Haley said the implications of Iran-related sanctions would be discussed when the foreign and defence ministers of India and the United States meet shortly. Japan and South Korea, also major buyers of Iranian oil, are in talks with the US government in a bid to avoid the adverse effects of sanctions. Haley said she also discussed with Modi the Indian-backed Chabahar port complex in Iran, being developed as part of a new transportation corridor for landlocked Afghanistan and which could open the way for millions of dollars in trade and cut Afghanistan´s dependence on Pakistan. "We know the port has to happen and the US is going to work with India to do that," Haley said. "We know that they’re being a great partner with us in Afghanistan and really trying to assist the US and trying to do more. The port’s vital in trying to do that. " "We realize we’re threading a needle when we do that," said Haley, describing a balancing act of ensuring Indian use of the port in Iran while Washington is at the same time trying to once again cut Tehran off from international markets. Haley has used her role at the UN to regularly attack and ramp up pressure on Iran, accusing it of meddling in Syria and Yemen. She said she spoke with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early on Wednesday, before meeting with Modi. Despite rising trade tensions between the United States and India, Haley - the daughter of Indian immigrants - said "the idea of a trade war wasn’t even an option. "Bilateral trade rose to $115 billion in 2016, but the Trump administration wants to narrow its $31 billion deficit with India, and is pressing New Delhi to ease trade barriers. Haley said she also discussed military cooperation with Modi as the Trump administration has launched an effort to deepen military and economic ties with India as a way to balance China´s assertive posture across Asia.

News article:
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s oil ministry has asked refiners to prepare for a ‘drastic reduction or zero’ imports of Iranian oil from November, two industry sources said, the first sign that New Delhi is responding to a push by the United States to cut trade ties with Iran. FILE PHOTO: A worker walks atop a tanker wagon to check the freight level at an oil terminal on the outskirts of Kolkata, India November 27, 2013. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File Photo India has said it does not recognize unilateral restrictions imposed by the United States, and instead follows UN sanctions. But the industry sources said India, the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, will be forced to take action to protect its exposure to the U.S. financial system. India’s oil ministry held a meeting with refiners on Thursday, urging them to scout for alternatives to Iranian oil, the sources said. “(India) has asked refiners to be prepared for any eventuality, since the situation is still evolving. There could be drastic reduction or there could be no import at all,” said one of the sources, who has knowledge of the matter. Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters in Mumbai that the country would attend to its interests while deciding on oil imports. “We know (that) to have a healthy energy mix, we can get oil from anywhere. The rest depends on geopolitics, and those decisions will be taken based on the situations,” he said. “We will go by our interests. When we decide anything on Iran, we will inform you.” During the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to buy Iranian oil, although it had to reduce imports as shipping, insurance and banking channels were choked due to the European and U.S. sanctions. The source said this time the situation is different. “You have India, China and Europe on one side, and U.S. on the other... At this moment we really don’t know what to do, but at the same time we have to prepare ourselves to face any eventuality,” said the source. While a State Department official has said that Washington wants Iranian oil buyers to halt imports from November, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lessen dependence on Iranian oil. Haley, currently in Delhi, spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early on Wednesday, before meeting Modi. The U.S. push to curb countries’ imports of Iranian oil comes after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers and ordered a reimposition of sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably in the petroleum sector, following a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. OUTPUT BOOST FROM OPEC Under pressure from the U.S. sanctions, Reliance Industries Ltd RELI.NS, the operator of the world's biggest refining complex, has decided to halt imports. Nayara Energy, an Indian company promoted by Russian oil major Rosneft ROSN.MM, is also preparing to halt Iranian oil imports from November after a communication from the government, a second source said. The company has already started cutting its oil imports from this month. Indian Oil Corp IOC.NS, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd MRPL.NS and Nayara Energy, the top three Indian buyers of Iranian oil, did not respond to Reuters's request for comments. Removing Iranian oil from the global market by November as called for by the United States is impossible, an Iranian oil official told the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. The options to find replacements to Iranian oil have widened after OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies last week to raise output from July by about 1 million bpd, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. Saudi Arabia’s plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in July would mark a new record, an industry source familiar with Saudi oil production plans told Reuters on Tuesday. The second source said there were plenty of options available in the market to replace Iranian oil. “There are companies and traders that are willing to give you a 60 day credit, crude is available in the market,” the source said. To boost its sales to India, Iran recently offered virtually free shipping and an extended credit period of 60 days. “We can buy Basra Heavy, Saudi or Kuwait oil to replace Iran. Finding replacement barrels is not a problem, but it has to give the best economic value,” a third source in New Delhi said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s oil ministry has asked refiners to prepare for a ‘drastic reduction or zero’ imports of Iranian oil from November, two industry sources said, the first sign that New Delhi is responding to a push by the United States to cut trade ties with Iran. FILE PHOTO: A worker walks atop a tanker wagon to check the freight level at an oil terminal on the outskirts of Kolkata, India November 27, 2013. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File Photo India has said it does not recognize unilateral restrictions imposed by the United States, and instead follows UN sanctions. But the industry sources said India, the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, will be forced to take action to protect its exposure to the U.S. financial system. India’s oil ministry held a meeting with refiners on Thursday, urging them to scout for alternatives to Iranian oil, the sources said. “(India) has asked refiners to be prepared for any eventuality, since the situation is still evolving. There could be drastic reduction or there could be no import at all,” said one of the sources, who has knowledge of the matter. Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters in Mumbai that the country would attend to its interests while deciding on oil imports. “We know (that) to have a healthy energy mix, we can get oil from anywhere. The rest depends on geopolitics, and those decisions will be taken based on the situations,” he said. “We will go by our interests. When we decide anything on Iran, we will inform you.” During the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to buy Iranian oil, although it had to reduce imports as shipping, insurance and banking channels were choked due to the European and U.S. sanctions. The source said this time the situation is different. “You have India, China and Europe on one side, and U.S. on the other... At this moment we really don’t know what to do, but at the same time we have to prepare ourselves to face any eventuality,” said the source. While a State Department official has said that Washington wants Iranian oil buyers to halt imports from November, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lessen dependence on Iranian oil. Haley, currently in Delhi, spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early on Wednesday, before meeting Modi. The U.S. push to curb countries’ imports of Iranian oil comes after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers and ordered a reimposition of sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably in the petroleum sector, following a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. OUTPUT BOOST FROM OPEC Under pressure from the U.S. sanctions, Reliance Industries Ltd RELI.NS, the operator of the world's biggest refining complex, has decided to halt imports. Nayara Energy, an Indian company promoted by Russian oil major Rosneft ROSN.MM, is also preparing to halt Iranian oil imports from November after a communication from the government, a second source said. The company has already started cutting its oil imports from this month. Indian Oil Corp IOC.NS, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd MRPL.NS and Nayara Energy, the top three Indian buyers of Iranian oil, did not respond to Reuters's request for comments. Removing Iranian oil from the global market by November as called for by the United States is impossible, an Iranian oil official told the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. The options to find replacements to Iranian oil have widened after OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies last week to raise output from July by about 1 million bpd, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. Saudi Arabia’s plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in July would mark a new record, an industry source familiar with Saudi oil production plans told Reuters on Tuesday. The second source said there were plenty of options available in the market to replace Iranian oil. “There are companies and traders that are willing to give you a 60 day credit, crude is available in the market,” the source said. To boost its sales to India, Iran recently offered virtually free shipping and an extended credit period of 60 days. “We can buy Basra Heavy, Saudi or Kuwait oil to replace Iran. Finding replacement barrels is not a problem, but it has to give the best economic value,” a third source in New Delhi said.

"[India] has asked refiners to be prepared for any eventuality, since the situation is still evolving. There could be drastic reduction or there could be no import at all," said one source. The warning to refiners comes as the US urges countries around the world, including India, to comply with the sanctions the US is reimposing on Iran following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. On Thursday, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called on India to rethink its relationship with Iran. Haley said she understood India "can't change its relationship with Iran in a day" but said she used a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi to encourage a reassessment. "I also think for the future of India, and the future of being able to get resources and who they're dependent on, I would encourage them to rethink their relationship with Iran," she was quoted as having told local broadcaster NDTV after an address in New Delhi. "I think as a friend, India should also decide is this a country that they want to continue doing business with," added Haley. India imports the overwhelming majority of its oil and Iran is the third-largest supplier to the nation of 1.25 billion. India was one of the few counties that continued to buy Iranian oil under the previous round of US and international sanctions which ended with the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal.

News article:
By Dr. Bawa Singh* The unilateral withdrawal from Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the imposition of Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) have no directly bearings on India. However, with these two steps, perhaps it is perceived that once again the tumultuous political global landscape would haunt not only the stakeholders rather the allied countries including India as well. The JCPOA and CAATSA are being put in practice in respect of Iran and Russia. These countries are figuring prominently in the radar of Indian foreign policy. Given its connectivity, energy and geopolitical salience, Iran has been embedded in the Indian strategic psyche. Former Soviet Union (FSU) has remained a strategic partner of India since the latter’s independence. Even today, about 60% weapon requirements are being supplied by Russia. Unilateral withdrawal from JCPOA and passage of CAATSA would put Iran and Russia on tenterhooks with the US. In this background, India’s Eurasian policy is likely to face horns of a dilemma as for how to deal with it? How would India come out of this quagmire? Could India pursue assertive diplomacy to come out of this flummoxed position to protect its strategic and economic interests particularly in the Eurasian region? FSU has remained a major player of India’s Eurasian region, particularly during the Cold War. With the inclusion of security clauses, the “Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation” (1971), the bilateral relations have witnessed the crescendo of cordiality. On the other hand, the US-Pak-China strategic partnership had further concertized the Indo-Russia strategic partnership. Whereas on the other hand, the Cold War geopolitics of the Eurasian region like China-US quasi-strategic partnership (1975s-1980s), had moved Russia towards India. The breakdown of FSU was a major set back for India’s Eurasian policy. Consequently, the policy has undergone metamorphic changes, waning of the crescendo of cordiality that had experienced during the Cold War. Currently, again both countries have started moving in the same direction of concretizing bilateral relations despite some geopolitical and geostrategic irritants. These irritants include strategic proximity of Russia with China and Pakistan. Russia’s dubious stance on Afghan Taliban and passive response over Pakistan’s alleged role in transnational terrorism further added irritation in the bilateral relations. However, both the countries have learned to live with these irritants in the Eurasian cauldron. The Indo-US relations have been improved significantly in the post-Cold War. The existence of about 50 dialogue mechanisms from diplomatic to ministerial levels shows that how both countries needed each other and engaged each other to heighten their multifaceted relations. After the breakdown of the FSU in 1991, except a few unpropitious incidents, more or less the Indo-US relations have been remained warm and cordial. However, under the America First Policy, Trump regime has taken some very harsh economic and strategic steps in terms of protectionism and nationalism. Under these two legal and diplomatic steps like the unilateral withdrawal and passage of the CAATSA have become major critical irritants in India’s Eurasian policy. Given the beginning of the New Great Game in Central Asia and resurgence of Russia, India’s Eurasian Policy has once again been rejuvenated and invigorated which manifested through the policy frameworks starting from ‘Extended Neighbourhood’ to Connect Central Asia Policy (2012). Under the Connect Central Asia Policy, India had identified about 12 major areas of cooperation in general and political, security, economic and energy in particular. Central Asia is landlocked for India. Upon this backdrop, Iran’s role in providing connectivity between India and Eurasia through Chabahar port and International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC) have become crucial for the former. Consistent supply of energy is oxygen for an emerging economy like India. Hence, Iran as a major energy supplier has a catalyst for the Indian economy. Russia and India had remained strong strategic partners. Despite India has reorientation of its foreign policy towards the Western world, still Russia has maintained and retained its place in the India defence procurement including research and technology sector. JCPOA and CAATSA In order to put America First, President Trump had drastically reoriented the US foreign policy, which was designed by his predecessors like Bill Clinton, Bush, and Obama. Recently, the same foreign policy has been undergone metamorphosis, by making nationalism and protectionism as the major planks of the same under the rubric of America First Policy. The major focus of the same is to protect and promote the economy and security interests of the US. For making the economy strong, providing jobs to the people, protectionism has already been put into practice. Trump perceives Iran, Russia, and North Korea as major threats for country’s strategic interests. Therefore, JCPOA and CAATSA have been put in place to check threats from these countries. The JCPOA was signed in 2015, under which Iran was agreed to eradicate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, reduce the stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and the two-thirds number of its gas centrifuges in the next 13 years. During the next 15 years, it would enrich uranium only up to 3.67%; and agreed not to build any new heavy-water facilities. Most important provision of the JCPOA is that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would have regular access to all the Iranian nuclear facilities to monitor the same. The agreement provides that in return for verifiability commitments on part of Iran, it would receive relief from the US, European Union, and United Nations Security Council nuclear-related economic sanctions. For Trump, the JCPOA was a decaying and rotten structure by which, Iran cannot be prevented from making the bomb. Ultimately, Trump has decided to unilaterally withdraw from the same to fulfill his presidential campaign pledge. However, on the other hand, UK, France and Germany, the other signatories to the agreement issued a joint statement and expressed their “regret and concern,” and assured their “continuing commitment” to the deal. But, now the question is, how Iran could be prevented from making/testing bombs without any control/inspection given the cancellation of JCPOA? Could Trump get the endorsement of the same on part of the other signatories? Would Trump remain a trustworthy partner in the international agreements/treatises/doctrines etc.? The passage of CAATSA is another step to promote US’s security and economic interests. The CAATSA was signed in August 2017 and come into effect in January 2018. Under this act, the Trump administration was authorized to restore sanctions against Iran for its nuclear programme including the sale/transfer of military equipment to the latter. Under Section 231 (CAATSA), Russia would face penalties/sanctions if any third-country firm or individual would get engaged in a “significant transaction” with its defense or intelligence sectors. Implications of JCPOA and CAATSA With the introduction of structural economic reforms, India is on the higher trajectory of economic growth. It is said that energy is a lifeline of an emerging economy. India is dependent on Iran for its energy demand, whereas the latter is also an important factor in India’s Eurasian foreign policy given energy and connectivity (INSTC, Chabahar) factors. President Trump has unilaterally withdrawn from JCPOA on 8 May 2018. After the withdrawal, he signed an executive order, by which he restored economic sanctions on Iran. However, these sanctions will be implemented in the phased manner to give adequate time to the MNCs to complete or withdraw their business from Iran. Under these economic sanctions, the other countries/MNCs are banned to have any economic engagements in terms of import, export, investment etc. India is major importer of Iranian oil. It is being anticipated that withdrawal of the US from JCPOA will not only create problems for peace and prosperity of Iran and the Middle East, rather the other regions/countries are also likely to be considerably impacted. The imposed economic sanctions can create problems for India’s oil import and connectivity projects like Chabahar port and INSTC. India and Russia have remained strong strategic partners since the Indian independence. Russia has been remained a tested and tried partner of India. Defence cooperation has remained as one of the key areas of the bilateral cooperation. About 60% of the Indian Military’s hardware demands are used to met by Russia. Currently several major Indo-Russian joint military programmes are going on which included BrahMos cruise missile; 5th generation fighter jet programme; Sukhoi Su-30MKI programme and frigates etc. The list of purchased/leased various military equipment is included submarines to aircraft carrier like INS Vikramaditya. Currently, India had signed an agreement worth over $4.5 billion with Russia on October 15, 2016, to purchase the S-400 Triumph Air Defence System for its Air Force. This deal has not been going well with the US government institutions, politicians etc. In this regard, it is worth to quote one congressman Republican Mac Thornberry (the Chairman of the House Armed Services), who briefed the journalists in Delhi, “There is a lot of concern in the US in both the administration and the Congress regarding the S-400 (missile) system. And, there is concern that any country, and it is not just India that is looking at clearing it, but any country that acquires that system will complicate our ability to work out interoperability.” The CAATSA is meant for stopping the countries to get engaged with Russia for any defence deal. Although till now, no clear signal has been given in the context of India’s defence deals with Russia, there is a probability that the US authorities in the coming time would pursue an assertive diplomacy to put pressure on India to rethink its defence deals with Russia. Consequently, it is going to effect strategic assistance, supply/purchase of raw materials, spare parts, components from Russia. As per some media reports, the US is in a fix what to do about India as the latter had signed a deal of the S-400. There is an anticipation of indelible impacts over India like Make in India and Indo-Russia joint defence cooperation. The Eurasian regions hold a significant position in the Indian foreign policy, given its pivotal place in the latter’s connectivity, energy, geopolitical and geostrategic interests. Probably, the economic sanctions out of JCPOA and CAATSA would have considerable impacts over the Indian economic and strategic interests in context of the Eurasian region in general and Iran and Russia in particular. Either India could take the JCPOA and CAATSA easy way or it could get engaged with Iran and Russia for its national interests, seems to put the former’s Eurasian policy between the devil and deep blue sea? Whereas on the other hand, India is emerging as one of the major economies, therefore, it can pursue assertive diplomacy to counter the same. If not, then soft diplomacy is more than sufficient as India has a substantial share (one and half bn people) in the world market of the seven bn people. Moreover, by walking tightrope and controlling its market by India for those countries which are not following the international laws, may help the latter to deal with such erratic behaviors of the countries. Strategically, Eurasia is a very significant region for India. At the same time, the US is also needed a balanced approach, so that the strategic partnership with India should not be weakened. *Dr. Bawa Singh is teaching at the Centre for South and Central Asian Studies, School of Global Relations, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, India.

Despite India has reorientation of its foreign policy towards the Western world, still Russia has maintained and retained its place in the India defence procurement including research and technology sector. JCPOA and CAATSA In order to put America First, President Trump had drastically reoriented the US foreign policy, which was designed by his predecessors like Bill Clinton, Bush, and Obama. Recently, the same foreign policy has been undergone metamorphosis, by making nationalism and protectionism as the major planks of the same under the rubric of America First Policy. The major focus of the same is to protect and promote the economy and security interests of the US. For making the economy strong, providing jobs to the people, protectionism has already been put into practice. Trump perceives Iran, Russia, and North Korea as major threats for country’s strategic interests. Therefore, JCPOA and CAATSA have been put in place to check threats from these countries. The JCPOA was signed in 2015, under which Iran was agreed to eradicate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, reduce the stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and the two-thirds number of its gas centrifuges in the next 13 years. During the next 15 years, it would enrich uranium only up to 3.67%; and agreed not to build any new heavy-water facilities. Most important provision of the JCPOA is that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would have regular access to all the Iranian nuclear facilities to monitor the same. The agreement provides that in return for verifiability commitments on part of Iran, it would receive relief from the US, European Union, and United Nations Security Council nuclear-related economic sanctions. For Trump, the JCPOA was a decaying and rotten structure by which, Iran cannot be prevented from making the bomb. Ultimately, Trump has decided to unilaterally withdraw from the same to fulfill his presidential campaign pledge. However, on the other hand, UK, France and Germany, the other signatories to the agreement issued a joint statement and expressed their “regret and concern,” and assured their “continuing commitment” to the deal. But, now the question is, how Iran could be prevented from making/testing bombs without any control/inspection given the cancellation of JCPOA? Could Trump get the endorsement of the same on part of the other signatories? Would Trump remain a trustworthy partner in the international agreements/treatises/doctrines etc.? The passage of CAATSA is another step to promote US’s security and economic interests. The CAATSA was signed in August 2017 and come into effect in January 2018. Under this act, the Trump administration was authorized to restore sanctions against Iran for its nuclear programme including the sale/transfer of military equipment to the latter. Under Section 231 (CAATSA), Russia would face penalties/sanctions if any third-country firm or individual would get engaged in a “significant transaction” with its defense or intelligence sectors. Implications of JCPOA and CAATSA With the introduction of structural economic reforms, India is on the higher trajectory of economic growth. It is said that energy is a lifeline of an emerging economy. India is dependent on Iran for its energy demand, whereas the latter is also an important factor in India’s Eurasian foreign policy given energy and connectivity (INSTC, Chabahar) factors. President Trump has unilaterally withdrawn from JCPOA on 8 May 2018. After the withdrawal, he signed an executive order, by which he restored economic sanctions on Iran. However, these sanctions will be implemented in the phased manner to give adequate time to the MNCs to complete or withdraw their business from Iran. Under these economic sanctions, the other countries/MNCs are banned to have any economic engagements in terms of import, export, investment etc. India is major importer of Iranian oil. It is being anticipated that withdrawal of the US from JCPOA will not only create problems for peace and prosperity of Iran and the Middle East, rather the other regions/countries are also likely to be considerably impacted. The imposed economic sanctions can create problems for India’s oil import and connectivity projects like Chabahar port and INSTC. India and Russia have remained strong strategic partners since the Indian independence. Russia has been remained a tested and tried partner of India. Defence cooperation has remained as one of the key areas of the bilateral cooperation. About 60% of the Indian Military’s hardware demands are used to met by Russia. Currently several major Indo-Russian joint military programmes are going on which included BrahMos cruise missile; 5th generation fighter jet programme; Sukhoi Su-30MKI programme and frigates etc. The list of purchased/leased various military equipment is included submarines to aircraft carrier like INS Vikramaditya. Currently, India had signed an agreement worth over $4.5 billion with Russia on October 15, 2016, to purchase the S-400 Triumph Air Defence System for its Air Force. This deal has not been going well with the US government institutions, politicians etc. In this regard, it is worth to quote one congressman Republican Mac Thornberry (the Chairman of the House Armed Services), who briefed the journalists in Delhi, “There is a lot of concern in the US in both the administration and the Congress regarding the S-400 (missile) system. And, there is concern that any country, and it is not just India that is looking at clearing it, but any country that acquires that system will complicate our ability to work out interoperability.” The CAATSA is meant for stopping the countries to get engaged with Russia for any defence deal. Although till now, no clear signal has been given in the context of India’s defence deals with Russia, there is a probability that the US authorities in the coming time would pursue an assertive diplomacy to put pressure on India to rethink its defence deals with Russia. Consequently, it is going to effect strategic assistance, supply/purchase of raw materials, spare parts, components from Russia. As per some media reports, the US is in a fix what to do about India as the latter had signed a deal of the S-400. There is an anticipation of indelible impacts over India like Make in India and Indo-Russia joint defence cooperation. The Eurasian regions hold a significant position in the Indian foreign policy, given its pivotal place in the latter’s connectivity, energy, geopolitical and geostrategic interests. Probably, the economic sanctions out of JCPOA and CAATSA would have considerable impacts over the Indian economic and strategic interests in context of the Eurasian region in general and Iran and Russia in particular. Either India could take the JCPOA and CAATSA easy way or it could get engaged with Iran and Russia for its national interests, seems to put the former’s Eurasian policy between the devil and deep blue sea? Whereas on the other hand, India is emerging as one of the major economies, therefore, it can pursue assertive diplomacy to counter the same. If not, then soft diplomacy is more than sufficient as India has a substantial share (one and half bn people) in the world market of the seven bn people. Moreover, by walking tightrope and controlling its market by India for those countries which are not following the international laws, may help the latter to deal with such erratic behaviors of the countries. Strategically, Eurasia is a very significant region for India. At the same time, the US is also needed a balanced approach, so that the strategic partnership with India should not be weakened. *Dr. Bawa Singh is teaching at the Centre for South and Central Asian Studies, School of Global Relations, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, India.

By Dr. Bawa Singh* The unilateral withdrawal from Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the imposition of Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) have no directly bearings on India. However, with these two steps, perhaps it is perceived that once again the tumultuous political global landscape would haunt not only the stakeholders rather the allied countries including India as well. The JCPOA and CAATSA are being put in practice in respect of Iran and Russia. These countries are figuring prominently in the radar of Indian foreign policy. Given its connectivity, energy and geopolitical salience, Iran has been embedded in the Indian strategic psyche. Former Soviet Union (FSU) has remained a strategic partner of India since the latter’s independence. Even today, about 60% weapon requirements are being supplied by Russia. Unilateral withdrawal from JCPOA and passage of CAATSA would put Iran and Russia on tenterhooks with the US. In this background, India’s Eurasian policy is likely to face horns of a dilemma as for how to deal with it? How would India come out of this quagmire? Could India pursue assertive diplomacy to come out of this flummoxed position to protect its strategic and economic interests particularly in the Eurasian region? FSU has remained a major player of India’s Eurasian region, particularly during the Cold War. With the inclusion of security clauses, the “Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation” (1971), the bilateral relations have witnessed the crescendo of cordiality. On the other hand, the US-Pak-China strategic partnership had further concertized the Indo-Russia strategic partnership. Whereas on the other hand, the Cold War geopolitics of the Eurasian region like China-US quasi-strategic partnership (1975s-1980s), had moved Russia towards India. The breakdown of FSU was a major set back for India’s Eurasian policy. Consequently, the policy has undergone metamorphic changes, waning of the crescendo of cordiality that had experienced during the Cold War. Currently, again both countries have started moving in the same direction of concretizing bilateral relations despite some geopolitical and geostrategic irritants. These irritants include strategic proximity of Russia with China and Pakistan. Russia’s dubious stance on Afghan Taliban and passive response over Pakistan’s alleged role in transnational terrorism further added irritation in the bilateral relations. However, both the countries have learned to live with these irritants in the Eurasian cauldron. The Indo-US relations have been improved significantly in the post-Cold War. The existence of about 50 dialogue mechanisms from diplomatic to ministerial levels shows that how both countries needed each other and engaged each other to heighten their multifaceted relations. After the breakdown of the FSU in 1991, except a few unpropitious incidents, more or less the Indo-US relations have been remained warm and cordial. However, under the America First Policy, Trump regime has taken some very harsh economic and strategic steps in terms of protectionism and nationalism. Under these two legal and diplomatic steps like the unilateral withdrawal and passage of the CAATSA have become major critical irritants in India’s Eurasian policy. Given the beginning of the New Great Game in Central Asia and resurgence of Russia, India’s Eurasian Policy has once again been rejuvenated and invigorated which manifested through the policy frameworks starting from ‘Extended Neighbourhood’ to Connect Central Asia Policy (2012). Under the Connect Central Asia Policy, India had identified about 12 major areas of cooperation in general and political, security, economic and energy in particular. Central Asia is landlocked for India. Upon this backdrop, Iran’s role in providing connectivity between India and Eurasia through Chabahar port and International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC) have become crucial for the former. Consistent supply of energy is oxygen for an emerging economy like India. Hence, Iran as a major energy supplier has a catalyst for the Indian economy. Russia and India had remained strong strategic partners. Despite India has reorientation of its foreign policy towards the Western world, still Russia has maintained and retained its place in the India defence procurement including research and technology sector.

The South Korean embassy in Tehran on Saturday denied that the country has stopped oil imports from Iran, IRAN Daily reported. On Friday, western media reported that South Korea will not lift any Iranian crude and condensate in July, halting all shipments for the first time in six years amid U.S. pressure to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November. "The embassy of the Republic of Korea denies any claims that it would not lift any Iranian crude and condensate in July," the South Korean embassy responded to the report. "The Korean government is negotiating with the United States to get exemptions from the restrictions on Iranian oil purchases," it said. South Korea has bought nearly 296,000 barrels of oil from Iran in the first five months of the Iranian calendar year (starting on March 21), and is the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China and India.

News article:
Indian officials are scheduled to discuss at length the US sanctions on Iran with a delegation of US experts, which is expected to arrive in New Delhi on July 16, Sputnik news reported. India's minister of petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, has stated that the country's requirement will be the deciding factor before any steps are taken in line with the US sanctions on Iran. Pradhan added that there was no contradiction within the government and that it would make a decision before the US sanctions are implemented. "There is no contradiction in our thinking on any issues. We will first ensure that our energy demands are met. Priority will be given to national interest," said Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, as quoted by Business Line. India is Iran's second-largest buyer and the latter's share in India's import volumes stands at 10.4 percent in the current financial year. "We will first look at our national interest. India's energy basket has multiple sources now. Our focus will be to see that our requirement is not affected, and to ensure this, we will do what we have to do. But, we will also keep a watch on global geopolitics," Pradhan said. The statement comes after The Tehran Times, in a scathing attack on the Indian government, criticized the flip-flop policy and blamed New Delhi for turning its back on a promise made by the minister of external affairs, Sushma Swaraj, a few weeks ago. Swaraj had rebuked the Trump administration and declared that India would not recognize sanctions unilaterally imposed by any entity other than the United Nations. "A few days ago, less than a month after Swaraj's statement, India buckled under the overwhelming U.S. pressure, betraying national interest and confirming its status as a pygmy, rather than a giant," The Tehran Times wrote in a recent article. The Indian government has indicated that it will make a decision on crude imports from Iran after discussing the issue with the Trump administration. Besides expecting some kind of waiver from the US, the Narendra Modi government is also examining options such as stepping up its rupee-rial arrangement for oil imports from Iran.

Rahaghi said that Iran has so far done its best to ensure the security of its oil supply to India and offered flexibility through longer-term credits and discounted prices as well as oil payments in rupees, and insurance coverage for oil shipments that facilitate bilateral trade and significantly increase Indian exports to Iran. The envoy's statement is being seen as a strong indication of Iran's displeasure over New Delhi's mixed reaction to US sanctions. While the minister of external affairs, Sushma Swaraj, had categorically said earlier this year that India would not follow any country-specific sanctions and would continue its trade with Iran, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan recently stated that the country's requirement would be the deciding factor for oil imports from Iran. Meanwhile, the Iranian envoy Massoud Rezvanian Rahaghi has also expressed unhappiness over the tardy progress in the Chabahar project, which New Delhi considers a gateway to Central Asia and Afghanistan. READ MORE: India to Open Chabahar Port by 2019 Despite US Sanctions on Iran "It's unfortunate that Indian investment promises for the expansion of Chabahar port and its connectivity projects have not been accomplished so far, and it is expected that India takes immediately necessary measures in this regard if its cooperation and engagement in Chabahar port is really of strategic nature," the Iranian diplomat said.

News article:
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer The US State Department recently announced that the United States expects foreign countries to reduce their imports of Iranian regime’s oil to zero by later in the year. Some countries have already committed to do so; others are preparing to do so. The news came just a matter of weeks after US President Donald Trump announced that the United States would be exiting the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The nuclear agreement was supposed to make Iran curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The other signatories of the deal – the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Russia – urged Trump to remain in the deal, but he refused, stating that Iran’s belligerence across the Middle East must not be ignored. Trump announced that sanctions would return and that fresh ones would be applied. India – Iran regime’s second biggest oil client after China – is already starting to cut imports and Indian refiners have started to wean their plants off Iranian crude oil. The country is said to be taking the necessary steps to ensure that it does not get tangled up in sanctions imposed by the United States. Refiners in India have also said that they wish to comply with the limits set by the United States so that they do not lose access to the U.S. financial system. Last month, the monthly oil imports into India from Iran decreased by just over 15 per cent from the month before. Industry data shows that India imported 598,888 barrels per day (bpd) in June. A few weeks ago, the Indian government asked its refiners to prepare for a major cut in imports, and perhaps even a complete halt. The US sanctions will not all come into effect at the same time and it has provisioned a 180 day wind down period that will end on 4th November. The lighter sanctions will take effect at the beginning of August. After a backlash when the State Department announced that it wants foreign companies to reduce imports of Iranian oil to zero, a major price change led the administration to roll back on its rhetoric, saying that each country would be dealt with on a case to case basis. However, the State Department still insists that no waivers will be granted. Refiners in India will find out more about what is expected of them in a meeting that has been scheduled for the beginning of next week. The refiners are due to meet with U.S. officials where their concerns will be addressed. The Iranian regime has hit back against the United States by saying that it is going to block access to the Strait of Hormuz. The strategic waterway is essential for much of the international community and the Iranian regime is trying to exploit this. Several top officials have said that if Iranian oil exports are cut, then no oil will pass through the Strait. However, it is most likely just an empty threat considering that the Strait has a huge role in Iranian imports and exports too.

News article:
The withdrawal of the US from the Iran nuclear deal is likely to deal a blow to India’s strategic investments in energy-rich Iran and land-locked Afghanistan, while the Chinese strategic footprint there grows. Maintaining good relations with both Riyadh and Tehran will also become more challenging for New Delhi. The Iran dilemma materialized at the wrong time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as India is preparing for parliamentary elections in less than a year. The pressure being exerted by the Trump administration on the Modi government to stop all oil imports from Tehran is set to complicate India’s diplomatic ties with Iran. It remains to be seen how India will secure its interests in Afghanistan and Central Asia without Iranian support. Following Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear drama continues to trigger geopolitical reconfigurations and strategic realignments. Washington’s latest decision to postpone the high-level inaugural 2+2 dialogue with New Delhi, scheduled for July 6 in Washington, is not helpful to the generally favorable atmosphere in Indo-US relations. The 2+2 dialogue format was one of the major takeaways from Modi’s landmark visit to the US in June 2017. India’s external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman were scheduled to visit Washington to hold joint talks with their counterparts, Mike Pompeo and James Mattis. Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... The postponement comes at a time when New Delhi has been asked to “go to zero” in Iranian oil imports by November 4. This tough message was delivered by Nikki Haley, the US permanent representative to the UN, during her recent India visit. It is not clear if the Trump administration’s abrupt decision is linked to India’s reported reluctance to cut down on oil supplies from Iran, but it clearly indicates the uncertainty characterizing Indo-US relations regarding the Islamic republic. India is also facing tremendous pressure following the categorical message from the Trump administration to all American allies and partners to stop all oil imports from Tehran. Trump wants to see visible steps taken in this direction, in the wake of the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Given the huge geopolitical and geo-economic stakes for India in Iran, this is a serious challenge for New Delhi. Trump’s message to India is clear. As declared by Haley in New Delhi, “The Tehran regime is the hidden — and sometimes not-so-hidden — force behind most of the conflict in the region. … Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon threatens all of us.” In an interview, Haley reiterated the message: “I think for the future of India, future of resources, we would encourage them to rethink their relationship with Iran.” In this line of thinking, the US has its most enthusiastic partner in Saudi Arabia, India’s close ally in the Middle East. New Delhi has thus far been able to maintain warm ties with both Riyadh and Tehran, though it means walking a tightrope. Iran is currently India’s third-largest supplier after Iraq and Saudi Arabia. India would prefer to hold this course of pragmatic and balanced engagement, which has allowed it to deftly play both sides’ geopolitical needs in a highly volatile region. However, things will not remain the same after the withdrawal from the nuclear deal. The fast-changing geostrategic dynamics of the region make the continuation of such a policy far more complicated. Modi has been supportive of the Iran nuclear deal. During Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s India visit in early 2018, their joint statement reflected New Delhi’s support for the full implementation of the agreement. Following the 2015 signing of the deal, India enhanced its business, economic, and strategic engagement with Iran. Indian businesses are now worried that their ties with Iran could come under stress. Moreover, Indo-Iranian ties are not confined to oil and business. New Delhi believes that India’s strategic ambitions in Central Asia cannot be realized without Iranian backing. India’s commitment to build Iran’s Chabahar Port on the Gulf of Oman, connecting India to Afghanistan, through which it can gain access to Central Asia and Eurasia bypassing Pakistan, is a case in point. Despite diplomatic pressure, Pakistan has not acted decisively against India-focused Islamist terror groups, which are the single largest hurdle to a cordial relationship between Islamabad and New Delhi. Regional trade and connectivity have been major victims of Pakistan’s anti-India strategic culture, as well as deep Afghan-Pakistani animosity. Hence, India’s immediate challenge is to improve its energy security and ensure regional connectivity in order to reach landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asia by developing the Chabahar Port. This is also important for the Afghan economy as it would slash Kabul’s dependence on foreign aid and put a major dent in the illicit opium trade. Even as it presses India to lessen its oil dependence on Iran, the US has favored the India-backed Chabahar Port. However, Washington’s view on Chabahar is not surprising, as it is intimately connected with America’s continuing war effort in Afghanistan. Though India’s strategic community has often projected Chabahar Port as India’s geopolitical response to the China-backed Gwadar Port in Pakistan, the reality is somewhat different. As Iran has accepted China’s massive participation for the sake of economic development, there is nothing to suggest that Tehran would allow Chabahar Port to be used for anything other than trade. The fallout of the nuclear deal’s demise will likely also be felt in India’s emerging defense connections with Iran. In February of this year, New Delhi and Tehran vowed to step up maritime cooperation. Attempts are also being made for regular and institutionalized consultations between Indian and Iranian agencies on terrorism, organized crime, money laundering, drug trafficking, and cybercrime. These interactions will now come under intense American scrutiny. If the Saudi-Iranian competition escalates further, it will likely lead to further Islamist radicalization in South Asia, with a likely spillover effect on India. If Tehran decides to increase its support to the Taliban insurgency, it will be a huge blow to regional peace and security. The Taliban has been historically considered by Tehran as one of its enemies. During its initial military campaign to take control of Afghanistan in the 1990s, the Taliban used to target the Afghan Shiite population due to their religious affiliation. Iran was also a part of the regional grouping — including India and Russia — that supported the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. However, with the advent of ISIS in Khorasan Province (ISKP), Iran sees the utility of its long-time rival as a partner. There are reports of Tehran providing small arms and training to the Afghan Taliban. For its part, the Taliban has attempted to demonstrate solidarity with Afghan Shiites when the latter were targeted by the Sunni-dominated ISKP. Post-nuclear deal withdrawal, Tehran may pursue the policy of denying a victory to the US-led coalition in Afghanistan with more vigor. If Afghanistan becomes a theater of US-Iranian confrontation, a politically negotiated settlement with the Taliban will become even more difficult. Afghanistan may also witness renewed rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration cannot be expected to remain a mute spectator in the face of possible Iranian disruption. Regime change in Tehran may be President Trump’s ultimate aim, but America’s options for taking military action against Iran from Afghan soil are currently constrained due to the Pakistan factor. Despite vowing to pressure Islamabad to crack down on terrorists on Pakistani soil who target Americans in Afghanistan, the Trump administration has not been able to follow through with the major punitive measures it had suggested could be in the offing. The US is worried that taking harsh measures could prompt Pakistan to strike back by shutting down vital supply lines on its soil used by the American military in Afghanistan. Islamabad is aware of both its ability to use supply lines as a powerful instrument of leverage and Washington’s inability to find alternate supply routes in Central Asia. It remains to be seen how New Delhi and Kabul will keep working with energy-rich Iran despite the sanctions regime. If both are left with no option but to reduce their economic engagements with Tehran, this is bound to dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region.

The Iran dilemma materialized at the wrong time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as India is preparing for parliamentary elections in less than a year. The pressure being exerted by the Trump administration on the Modi government to stop all oil imports from Tehran is set to complicate India’s diplomatic ties with Iran. It remains to be seen how India will secure its interests in Afghanistan and Central Asia without Iranian support. Following Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear drama continues to trigger geopolitical reconfigurations and strategic realignments. Washington’s latest decision to postpone the high-level inaugural 2+2 dialogue with New Delhi, scheduled for July 6 in Washington, is not helpful to the generally favorable atmosphere in Indo-US relations. The 2+2 dialogue format was one of the major takeaways from Modi’s landmark visit to the US in June 2017. India’s external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman were scheduled to visit Washington to hold joint talks with their counterparts, Mike Pompeo and James Mattis.

The postponement comes at a time when New Delhi has been asked to “go to zero” in Iranian oil imports by November 4. This tough message was delivered by Nikki Haley, the US permanent representative to the UN, during her recent India visit. It is not clear if the Trump administration’s abrupt decision is linked to India’s reported reluctance to cut down on oil supplies from Iran, but it clearly indicates the uncertainty characterizing Indo-US relations regarding the Islamic republic. India is also facing tremendous pressure following the categorical message from the Trump administration to all American allies and partners to stop all oil imports from Tehran. Trump wants to see visible steps taken in this direction, in the wake of the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Given the huge geopolitical and geo-economic stakes for India in Iran, this is a serious challenge for New Delhi. Trump’s message to India is clear. As declared by Haley in New Delhi, “The Tehran regime is the hidden — and sometimes not-so-hidden — force behind most of the conflict in the region. … Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon threatens all of us.” In an interview, Haley reiterated the message: “I think for the future of India, future of resources, we would encourage them to rethink their relationship with Iran.” In this line of thinking, the US has its most enthusiastic partner in Saudi Arabia, India’s close ally in the Middle East. New Delhi has thus far been able to maintain warm ties with both Riyadh and Tehran, though it means walking a tightrope. Iran is currently India’s third-largest supplier after Iraq and Saudi Arabia. India would prefer to hold this course of pragmatic and balanced engagement, which has allowed it to deftly play both sides’ geopolitical needs in a highly volatile region. However, things will not remain the same after the withdrawal from the nuclear deal. The fast-changing geostrategic dynamics of the region make the continuation of such a policy far more complicated. Modi has been supportive of the Iran nuclear deal. During Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s India visit in early 2018, their joint statement reflected New Delhi’s support for the full implementation of the agreement. Following the 2015 signing of the deal, India enhanced its business, economic, and strategic engagement with Iran. Indian businesses are now worried that their ties with Iran could come under stress. Moreover, Indo-Iranian ties are not confined to oil and business. New Delhi believes that India’s strategic ambitions in Central Asia cannot be realized without Iranian backing. India’s commitment to build Iran’s Chabahar Port on the Gulf of Oman, connecting India to Afghanistan, through which it can gain access to Central Asia and Eurasia bypassing Pakistan, is a case in point. Despite diplomatic pressure, Pakistan has not acted decisively against India-focused Islamist terror groups, which are the single largest hurdle to a cordial relationship between Islamabad and New Delhi. Regional trade and connectivity have been major victims of Pakistan’s anti-India strategic culture, as well as deep Afghan-Pakistani animosity. Hence, India’s immediate challenge is to improve its energy security and ensure regional connectivity in order to reach landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asia by developing the Chabahar Port. This is also important for the Afghan economy as it would slash Kabul’s dependence on foreign aid and put a major dent in the illicit opium trade. Even as it presses India to lessen its oil dependence on Iran, the US has favored the India-backed Chabahar Port. However, Washington’s view on Chabahar is not surprising, as it is intimately connected with America’s continuing war effort in Afghanistan. Though India’s strategic community has often projected Chabahar Port as India’s geopolitical response to the China-backed Gwadar Port in Pakistan, the reality is somewhat different. As Iran has accepted China’s massive participation for the sake of economic development, there is nothing to suggest that Tehran would allow Chabahar Port to be used for anything other than trade. The fallout of the nuclear deal’s demise will likely also be felt in India’s emerging defense connections with Iran. In February of this year, New Delhi and Tehran vowed to step up maritime cooperation. Attempts are also being made for regular and institutionalized consultations between Indian and Iranian agencies on terrorism, organized crime, money laundering, drug trafficking, and cybercrime. These interactions will now come under intense American scrutiny. If the Saudi-Iranian competition escalates further, it will likely lead to further Islamist radicalization in South Asia, with a likely spillover effect on India. If Tehran decides to increase its support to the Taliban insurgency, it will be a huge blow to regional peace and security. The Taliban has been historically considered by Tehran as one of its enemies. During its initial military campaign to take control of Afghanistan in the 1990s, the Taliban used to target the Afghan Shiite population due to their religious affiliation. Iran was also a part of the regional grouping — including India and Russia — that supported the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. However, with the advent of ISIS in Khorasan Province (ISKP), Iran sees the utility of its long-time rival as a partner. There are reports of Tehran providing small arms and training to the Afghan Taliban. For its part, the Taliban has attempted to demonstrate solidarity with Afghan Shiites when the latter were targeted by the Sunni-dominated ISKP. Post-nuclear deal withdrawal, Tehran may pursue the policy of denying a victory to the US-led coalition in Afghanistan with more vigor. If Afghanistan becomes a theater of US-Iranian confrontation, a politically negotiated settlement with the Taliban will become even more difficult. Afghanistan may also witness renewed rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration cannot be expected to remain a mute spectator in the face of possible Iranian disruption. Regime change in Tehran may be President Trump’s ultimate aim, but America’s options for taking military action against Iran from Afghan soil are currently constrained due to the Pakistan factor. Despite vowing to pressure Islamabad to crack down on terrorists on Pakistani soil who target Americans in Afghanistan, the Trump administration has not been able to follow through with the major punitive measures it had suggested could be in the offing. The US is worried that taking harsh measures could prompt Pakistan to strike back by shutting down vital supply lines on its soil used by the American military in Afghanistan. Islamabad is aware of both its ability to use supply lines as a powerful instrument of leverage and Washington’s inability to find alternate supply routes in Central Asia. It remains to be seen how New Delhi and Kabul will keep working with energy-rich Iran despite the sanctions regime. If both are left with no option but to reduce their economic engagements with Tehran, this is bound to dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region.

India today finds itself in the center of a tug of war. If the United States, a strategic partner, is pushing it to drastically reduce its oil imports from Iran; then Iran, an old ally, is asserting its strategic value in terms of not just oil but also the Chabahar port. This week saw first the visit of the Iranian Foreign Minister to India, quickly followed by the visit of a delegation from the United States. It is learnt that both visits had one common agenda and that was to discuss India’s import of oil from Iran. Advertisement President Trump pulled out of the Iran Nuclear deal in May this year and brought back the economic sanctions against the country, which has placed allies like India in a tricky situation. The US has told India and other countries to cut oil imports from Iran to “zero” by November 4 or face sanctions. The first set of US sanctions will kick in from August 6. Iran is India’s third-largest oil supplier after Iraq and Saudi Arabia. ALSO READ: US envoy Haley tells Modi important to cut imports of Iranian oil Iran supplied 18.4 million tons of crude oil between April 2017 and January 2018 (first 10 months of fiscal 2017-18). India has also committed to an investment of $500 million for the development of the Chabahar port. Despite the pull and push that is being exerted on India by both the US and Iran, indications are that India is likely to balance things out. While it is likely to reduce the oil imports from Iran, zero is not going to be the aim. The US has also been told, according to sources, that for India maintaining its ties with Iran are vital because of the Chabahar port, which offers India connectivity to Central Asia bypassing Pakistan. India can ill afford to upset Iran. The US also seems to be toning down expectations and some sort of waiver might be offered to countries like India. The first signs that the US is now considering waivers for countries like India came earlier this week when US treasury secretary Steven Munchin told journalists that some countries could get waivers. “We want people to reduce oil purchases to zero, but in certain cases if people can’t do that overnight, we’ll consider exemptions,” he said. Balancing act When asked if India would be able to balance its ties with Iran and the US on this issue, Amar Sinha, a former Indian diplomat who served as ambassador to Afghanistan and now works as Distinguished Fellow with Research and Information Systems for Developing Countries (RIS), said: “I think yes if we apply the filter of Indian interests”. According to him, India’s dependency on imports is close to 80 percent of its oil needs. “Thus it is a major global buyer. It cannot be a fickle customer in a market that also relies on long-term G to G contracts. What is needed is to clearly articulate what both partners seek from any relationship. Understanding of each other is a key element of any durable friendship,” says Sinha. ALSO READ: India BPCL seeks extra Iran oil amid sanctions threat India is also closely watching how the European Union and China are going to deal with Iran in the immediate future. Many analysts believe that the US decision to walk away from the Iran Nuclear Deal has pitted China, India and the EU in one group against the US. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal on July 16, three European states, namely France, Germany and the UK plan to activate bank accounts or activate old accounts for the Iranian Central Bank in spite of US sanctions. If that happens, it will be a concrete pushback by these European states against the US decision on the Iran nuclear deal. Iranian bank India too recently gave permission to an Iranian bank to open its branch in Mumbai. The government has approved a proposal from Iranian private lender Bank Pasargad to open a branch in Mumbai. This is likely to help India in reviving the rupee-rial arrangement to import oil from Iran that it has used in the past. India had effectively used the rupee-rial arrangement to buy oil from Iran before US sanctions were lifted against it three years ago. The mechanism then was that India paid in Euros to clear 55 percent of its dues, while the remaining 45 percent payment was remitted in rupees into accounts Iranian oil companies had with UCO Bank. India, it would seem is planning a similar strategy this time too, to counter US sanctions. VIDEO: India minister on UAE oil storage deal, energy equations with Arab world Ashok Sajjanhar, a former Indian diplomat who served in Iran and was ambassador to Sweden said that he is reasonably confident about a waiver from the US in this regard as the US is also aware of the strategic importance of the Chabahar port. “We could arrive at some arrangement that would be acceptable to both the US and Iran. I am certain that the US realises what India brings to the table and India’s long term strategy regarding Chabahar connectivity”, he said. Sajjanhar also said that it would seem that initially Trump was calling for a regime change in Iran. Getting to the table He had forced North Korea to come to table and was hoping that the same technique would work with Iran or that there would be domestic turmoil “but now going forward I feel because of pressure from his advisors, there is a change in strategy and following that some countries will get waiver.” In a media briefing last week, the spokesperson of India’s Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar said, responded to a question on whether there was any development on the US reaching out to India over the issue of reduction of imports from Iran. ALSO READ: India, Saudi Arabia discuss oil price, energy investment opportunities “They had indicated. In fact, a statement was made by the US State Department that they would like to get in touch with or they are prepared to engage in discussions with various countries in the matter.

One thing is very clear that whatever is mandated to be done in our national interest, those things we will be doing,” he said. And therein might lie the best signal as to how India plans to move forward. Keeping its “national interests” in mind, India will balance a strategic partnership with the US while maintaining its ties with Iran, with a sharp eye on Chabahar.

German minister requests India to keep buying Iran’s oil, despite US pressure Tasnim – The German minister of state for International Affairs Neils Annen in an interview with Indian TV on Wednesday expressed hope that India will continue buying oil from Iran. “It will be India’s sovereign decision. I am not a salesman for Iran but I have an impression that India is willing to continue buying oil from Iran and this will be a very important statement,” the German minister said, adding that Germany will act in its own interest and hopes that India, too, will continue buying Iranian oil. Germany has called US pressure exerted on its allies to comply with sanctions on Iran “irritating, to put it mildly” and expressed hope that India will continue buying oil from Iran. The German Minister Niels Annen was on a two-day visit to New Delhi on Tuesday and Wednesday and his observations came a day after India and US agreed to continue consultations on the proposed American sanctions on Iran. Germany is one of the US allies in Europe which has developed differences on several issues in recent past including Iran nuclear deal, NATO funding and Paris Climate treaty. The US administration had set a deadline for reducing oil trade with Iran to “zero” by November 4, when Washington implements second layer of sanctions against that country. Less than three weeks before the first wave of US sanctions against Iran kicks in, India’s Minister of State for External Affairs V K on Thursday made it clear that its bilateral relations with Tehran in terms of both oil imports and investment in Chabahar port in the wake of the US sanctions against Iran stand on their own and are not influenced by its ties with any third country. Iran’s embassy in New Delhi released a statement last week, saying, “Iran understands the difficulties of India in dealing with (an) unstable energy market and it has done and will do its best to ensure security of oil supply to India.” Iran is the third-biggest oil supplier to India and has offered refiners incentives including almost-free shipping and an enhanced credit period on oil sales.

Iran’s embassy in New Delhi released a statement last week, saying, “Iran understands the difficulties of India in dealing with (an) unstable energy market and it has done and will do its best to ensure security of oil supply to India.” Iran is the third-biggest oil supplier to India and has offered refiners incentives including almost-free shipping and an enhanced credit period on oil sales.

German minister requests India to keep buying Iran’s oil, despite US pressure Tasnim – The German minister of state for International Affairs Neils Annen in an interview with Indian TV on Wednesday expressed hope that India will continue buying oil from Iran. “It will be India’s sovereign decision. I am not a salesman for Iran but I have an impression that India is willing to continue buying oil from Iran and this will be a very important statement,” the German minister said, adding that Germany will act in its own interest and hopes that India, too, will continue buying Iranian oil. Germany has called US pressure exerted on its allies to comply with sanctions on Iran “irritating, to put it mildly” and expressed hope that India will continue buying oil from Iran. The German Minister Niels Annen was on a two-day visit to New Delhi on Tuesday and Wednesday and his observations came a day after India and US agreed to continue consultations on the proposed American sanctions on Iran. Germany is one of the US allies in Europe which has developed differences on several issues in recent past including Iran nuclear deal, NATO funding and Paris Climate treaty. The US administration had set a deadline for reducing oil trade with Iran to “zero” by November 4, when Washington implements second layer of sanctions against that country.

News article:
KABUL: Sustained power cuts from Iran have badly affected everyday life in Afghanistan’s western Herat province, where traders have lost millions of dollars as a result, Afghan officials said on Saturday. An Afghan delegation was set to travel on Saturday to Iran to discuss the power shedding which began more than 10 days ago. Iranian officials cited growing warm weather as the reason, saying the country has also cut exports of electricity to Pakistan and Iraq. Total power imports from Iran for Herat and Nimroz stand at 100 megawatts. Herat, the second largest city in Afghanistan with an industrial park consisting of scores of factories, has taken the brunt of the power cuts, according Ahmad Khadem, an official for the chambers of commerce. The Afghan officials described the load shedding as a violation of the agreement struck with Iran. “People have been suffering a lot. People in Herat and Nimroz are facing lots of problems from production. Poultry and other businesses have lost millions,” said Wahidullah Tawhidi, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s national power company. Jailani Farhad, a spokesman for Herat’s governor, told Arab News that local authorities have activated two tribunes of Salma Dam in Herat to cover part of the load shedding. Afghanistan relies on imports of power from Central Asia and Iran. Years of low rain and snowfall have led to a drought in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan where temperatures have risen in recent months, pushing the need for electricity in the summer hot season in the region.

News article:
NEW DELHI/NEW YORK: Facing the threat of US oil sanctions on Iran, India continued to rely on Iraq as its top oil supplier in the April-June quarter, followed by Iran and Saudi Arabia, the oil minister said Monday. Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said India bought 7.27 million metric tons of oil from Iraq, 5.67 million tons from Iran and 5.22 million tons from Saudi Arabia during the three-month period. India’s state-run refineries bought 9.8 million tons of Iranian oil in financial 2017-18 compared to 13.04 million tons a year earlier, a nearly 25 percent decline. In a statement submitted to Parliament on Monday, Pradhan didn’t say what steps India is taking in response to the US sanctions on Iran, which are to come into force on Nov. 4. “Indian refineries import crude oil from diverse sources including Iran, depending on technical and commercial considerations,” he said. The biggest importer of Iranian oil last year was China, accounting for 24 percent of Iran’s oil exports. India purchased 18 percent of Iran’s oil exports, according to the US Energy Department. Increasing tensions between Iran and the US helped push up oil prices on Monday. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday backed a suggestion by President Hassan Rouhani that Iran could block Gulf oil shipments if its exports were stopped. The Iranian leadership was responding to the threat of US sanctions after President Donald Trump in May pulled out of a multinational agreement to trade with Tehran in return for its commitment not to develop nuclear weapons. Late on Sunday night, Trump tweeted that Iran risked dire consequences “the like of which few throughout history have suffered before” if the Islamic Republic made more threats against the US. “Attention is being focused on geopolitical tensions, particularly between US and Iran,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “Fundamentally, we do have a tighter picture than we had twelve months ago.” Benchmark Brent crude oil rose 42 cents a barrel to $73.49 by 2:26 p.m. GMT, after earlier strenghtening to a high of $74.50. The rise also followed news of a 24-hour strike by 40 rig workers on three oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. The dispute curbed gas flows to shore, but stored crude was expected to mitigate any oil supply disruption. Moderating supply worries were concerns about the impact on global economic growth and energy demand of the escalating trade dispute between the US and its trading partners. Finance ministers and central bank governors from the world’s 20 biggest economies ended a meeting in Buenos Aires over the weekend calling for more dialogue to prevent trade and geopolitical tensions from hurting growth.

READ MORE: Germany: Up to India to Go Ahead With Iranian Oil Imports Amid US Sanctions Last week, Indian commerce ministry officials had conveyed to US trade representatives in New Delhi that it was not possible for Indian refiners to stop purchasing oil from Iran, citing several reasons. Although the meeting did not provide solutions to India's concerns, India had firmly conveyed that the state-owned refiners were not going to cut imports to zero due to the sanctions. "Buying oil is a commercial activity and Indian oil importers should continue to import from Iran if ships are available from international ship-owners and oil shipments can find insurers," Narendra Taneja, India's leading energy expert, told Sputnik. Sputnik discussed the payment issue with several government officials in the last few days and most of them exuded confidence that a solution would be found in the next few days.

Earlier, citing data from industry and shipping sources, Reuters had reported that India's monthly oil imports from Iran had declined 16 percent in June this year as compared to May. Meanwhile, the Indian Oil Ministry has revealed that India and China have discussed the possibility of forming an "oil buyers' club" that can negotiate better terms with sellers. "Meetings have been held between India and China, both at ministerial and company levels. During these meetings both sides expressed interest to cooperate and collaborate to deal with high crude oil and gas prices, including through increased communication between companies to work towards control and reduce spikes in prices," Minister Pradhan stated in parliament. READ MORE: India, Iran Agree to Continue Momentum in Bilateral Trade Including Crude Import Despite several requests and threats from the Trump administration to cut trade ties with Iran, the Indian government has insisted that its trade decision would be guided by the country's interest and won't be compromised for any third country. In May the Trump administration announced that it was walking out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran popularly known as the nuclear deal and released a detailed plan of the re-imposition of sanctions on entities engaged with Iran, including the imports of crude oil from Tehran.

News article:
Tehran, Iran, July 27 By Temkin Jafarov - Trend: The economic relations between Azerbaijan and Iran will expand in the near future, Iranian ambassador to Azerbaijan Mohsen Pak Ayeen told Trend July 27. "After the West's sanctions are lifted, Iran will continue developing rapidly as it was before their imposition," he said. The ambassador said that the countries with strong economy are interested in the development of relations with Iran. "The visit of German vice-chancellor with a delegation consisting of 100 people to Iran last week can be cited as an example," he said. "Removing of unnecessary barriers creates a basis for strengthening the relations among Iran and all world's countries, especially with friendly and fraternal Azerbaijan." The diplomat said in the near future the relations between Baku and Tehran will develop in the economic sphere. "The UN Security Council's recent resolution demonstrates the determination of the world's countries to participate in the economic programs in Iran," he said. "We consider this achievement as the success of all independent countries, in particular neighboring countries." Stressing the importance of resolving the conflicts in the region, the ambassador said that the agreement reached between Iran and "Six" international mediators allows using the potential of Iran in the settlement of regional conflicts, as well as in the fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations. He called the agreement reached between Iran and "Six" international mediators as the success of diplomacy. "Cancelling of UN Security Council's six resolutions against Iran and removing of Tehran's peaceful nuclear program from the UN Chapter VII are the most significant achievements reached in the negotiations in Vienna," he said.

Tehran, Iran, July 27 By Temkin Jafarov - Trend: Iran's Deputy Minister of Energy Houshang Falahatian intends to pay a visit to Azerbaijan. The objectives of the upcoming visit are to complete the conducted work on the synchronization of energy systems of the two countries and to sign a new treaty in this area, Falahatian told Trend July 27. "The setting of electricity tariffs will be discussed at the meetings to be held in Azerbaijan," he said. "Previously Iran and Azerbaijan have distributed all work on the synchronization of energy systems among themselves." "The power plants and transmission lines have been built," he said. "The infrastructure is fully ready. We hope that a final agreement will be reached and an agreement on the synchronization of the energy systems will be signed during this visit." He said Iran informed the Azerbaijani side about its readiness to sign an agreement on the purchase of electric power in Azerbaijan after the synchronization of energy systems of the two countries. "Moreover, Azerbaijan has expressed interest in investing in Iran's renewable energy, including the construction of geothermal power plants and we welcome this," he said. "Earlier, Iran officially announced the electricity tariffs, which will be generated at the new power plants," he said. "Moreover, the power plants guarantee the electricity provision for 20 years." Falahatian stressed that Iran invites Azerbaijani investors to invest in Iran. "By synchronizing their energy systems, Azerbaijan and Iran are creating the basis for the future electricity exchange with third countries, including Russia," he said. "The electric power can be transferred between Iran and Azerbaijan on the territory of Azerbaijan," he added. After the synchronization of energy systems of the two countries, Iran will be able to share power with Russia, and Azerbaijan through Iran - with Afghanistan and Iraq. Earlier, Iranian ambassador to Azerbaijan Mohsen Pak Ayeen said that the two countries agreed on the electricity transfer from Azerbaijan to Iraq and Afghanistan through Iran.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 5 By Elmira Tariverdiyeva - Trend: The recent deal on Iran's nuclear program suggests new opportunities for development of trade and economic cooperation with the Islamic Republic, and may bring good dividends, if its advantage is taken in time. Azerbaijan is one of the first counties to use the new opportunities and discuss with Iran the future mutually beneficial cooperation in various areas. The two neighboring countries can undoubtedly have considerable benefit from the new political realities. Earlier this week an Azerbaijani governmental delegation, led by the country's Minister of Economy and Industry Shahin Mustafayev, made a working visit to Iran. During the visit, the parties discussed cooperation in the oil and gas industry, the investment sector and railway projects. The sanctions on Iran will be lifted gradually, but it is obvious that the sooner agreements are reached before their removal, the faster the joint projects will launch. During the meetings held as part of the visit, Azerbaijan offered Iran use of its infrastructure to export oil and gas to world markets. Following the lifting of sanctions and increased hydrocarbon production, Iran will be able to use the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline to export its oil. In the future, the country can join the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) that has been initiated by Azerbaijan and is meant to transport gas from the Caspian Sea region to Europe in coming years. Moreover, Azerbaijan has proposed Iran use its gas storage facilities and use the stored gas when their consumption grows. During the meeting with Azerbaijan's Economy and Industry Minister Shahin Mustafayev, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said that Iran is ready to carry out swap deliveries of Azerbaijan's oil to the Persian Gulf region. Zanganeh said oil could be transported from Iran's Neka port on the Caspian Sea via pipeline (with a pumping capacity of 500,000 barrels per day) to the Tehran Oil Refinery. In exchange for this, Azerbaijan will get oil on the southern borders of Iran, Zanganeh added. Nevertheless, all the legal formalities will be complied with in advance in order to start the project's implementation immediately once the sanctions imposed on Iran are lifted. Iran could also cooperate with Azerbaijan in the oil and gas sector in the Caspian Sea, according to Zanganeh. The Iranian minister's proposal about the joint production of oil equipment, as well as at the enterprises, opened on the territory of Azerbaijan, is interesting. This will allow opening over 100 jobs in our country. Minister Mustafayev said that Azerbaijan and Iran are ready for joint investments in the production of petroleum equipment. Moreover, Azerbaijan and Iran discussed the possibility of joint investing in other countries' gas sectors. Of course, this can also become one of the more profitable areas of cooperation. The synchronization of electric power systems of Iran and Azerbaijan, the construction of a hydroelectric power station on the border or within the country is an interesting item on the agenda of the visit of the Azerbaijani delegation. The electricity generated by new power plants will be used in Azerbaijan and Iran and sold to other countries. During the Azerbaijani delegation's visit to Iran, the sides reached an agreement on the establishment of a working group to analyze the current situation and the coordination of positions on the North-South railway project. The "North-South" railway will connect Northern Europe with South East Asia and will serve as a bridge to connect the railways of Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia. This railway project is going to be very beneficial for all sides. The capacity of the railway will be 1.4 million passengers and 5 million to 7 million metric tons of cargo a year, making the project one of the most important in the region, according to preliminary estimates. Today, Azerbaijan, which didn't impose sanctions against Iran and always maintained good relations with it, turned out to be in a more advantageous position than the West, as the country will not need confidence-building measures and won't have to start cooperation from scratch. Baku will try to use this chance 100 percent as Iran, which has now become the most interesting field for investment, because of the circumstances, was the only country in the region except Armenia, where Azerbaijan didn't invest. Now, together with major investments in Turkey, Georgia and other countries, Baku can implement large investment projects in Iran, which will bring considerable profits to the Azerbaijani treasury in the future.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 6 By Rufiz Hafizoglu - Trend: First, the recent events in the southeastern provinces of Turkey caused problems with the transportation of goods from the country to Iran and the markets of Central Asia. Iran has been periodically closing the border with Turkey due to security concerns. This is another consequence of these events. Of course, this causes great damage to the Turkish side. Ankara perceives the expected lifting of sanctions against Tehran very positively. But Ankara is not convinced that Iran can become the single and non-alternative corridor for the transportation of goods to the markets of Central Asia. Sooner or later this will lead to the fact that Turkey will be forced to seek alternative routes to enter the markets of Central Asia. In an interview with Turkish media, Seray Ozkan, researcher at Caspian Strategy Institute (HASEN) emphasized the importance of diversifying the Central Asian markets in order to avoid risks which the Iranian market can be fraught with. Earlier, Cetin Nuhoglu, head of Turkey's International Transporters Association said that Iran creates artificial barriers for Turkish transporters. "The delivery of 70 percent of Turkish cargoes is delayed due to the Iranian side," Nuhoglu added. Moreover, member of the executive board of Turkey's International Transporters Association Elif Sevim told Trend that Turkey is considering the possibility of using the Georgia-Azerbaijan route for cargo transportation to Turkmenistan bypassing Iran. Given the existence of serious problems today in Iran, which is a transit country for the transportation of goods from Turkey, Azerbaijan can become such a country. Currently, Turkish trucks spend the time standing on the Turkish-Iranian and Iranian-Turkmen border for a long period, sometimes up to 10 days. If Azerbaijan becomes a transit country, it will make it possible to reduce this period twice, and that is in the interests of Turkey. Against the background of the real problems with the delivery of goods via Iran to the markets of Central Asia, one must remember that Turkey and China agreed on the joint use of roads, and the parties will sign an agreement on this issue in February 2016. There remains only to choose a final route for importing goods to Turkey, and Azerbaijan has extensive potential to become a transit country. Taking this into account, it is possible to say that sooner or later Azerbaijan will become a transit country for transportation of goods from Turkey to Turkmenistan on ro-ro vessels. In other words, Azerbaijan's importance for Turkey, as well as for the region is growing.

Iranian Minister of Industry, Mines, and Trade Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh left Tehran on Wednesday for the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat to open Iran's exclusive fair in the central Asian country, Tasnim reported. The Iranian minister is due to attend the opening ceremony of the exhibition, which will be held from August 19 to 21. Over 100 Iranian companies and 300 participants are scheduled to take part in the exhibition in Ashgabat Exhibition and Conference Palace.

The value of bilateral trade between Iran and Turkmenistan reached over $4 billion last year, Meredow said at the time, stressing that the figure can further increase. Earlier in March, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani made a two-day official visit to Ashgabat at the invitation of his Turkmen counterpart.

Ukraine’s economy minister says he will follow his European colleagues to Iran seeking business opportunities from the anticipated easing of sanctions on the isolated Islamic Republic. Economy Minister Aivaras Abromavicius says his three-day trip starting September 14 will include a “large group of industrial leaders” as well the war-torn state’s agriculture minister. Abromavicius tells a Ukrainian cabinet meeting that the former Soviet nation wanted to “improve relations with (Iran) after what we hope will be the lifting of sanctions by the US Congress.” A range of European countries — including economic powerhouse Germany — have already either sent business delegations to Tehran or lifted some of their unilateral trade restrictions on Iran. Kiev’s state statistics service says trade between the two countries only reached $756 million last year. Ukrainian exports accounted for more than 90 percent of that amount. — AFP

News article:
Ukraine's minister of economy and trade says he will soon pay an official visit to Iran to discuss the existing grounds for economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. The announcement by the Ukrainian minister comes at a time that high-ranking officials from other European countries have already visited Iran following the conclusion of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear talks with the P5+1 group of countries in the Austrian capital, Vienna, on July 14. Speaking to a cabinet meeting in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on Wednesday, Aivaras Abromavicius said his three-day visit to Iran is scheduled to start on September 14, AFP reported. The minister added that during his trip to Iran, he will be heading a delegation consisting of a "large group of industrial leaders" as well the Ukrainian agriculture minister. “On September 14-16, I'm likely to go [to Iran] with the agricultural minister and a large group of entrepreneurs and industrialists to establish cooperation with the country,” he was quoted by the Interfax News Agency as saying. Abromavicius stated that his country is willing to "improve relations with (Iran) after what we hope will be the lifting of sanctions by the US Congress." The minister added that when international sanctions against Iran are lifted, there will be “huge opportunities” for cooperation between the two countries, adding, “Last week we discussed the cooperation directions with the [Iranian] ambassador [to Kiev]. Mainly it concerns companies on metro engineering and other types of engineering." On July 14, Iran and the P5+1 group of countries — the US, the UK, Germany, France, China, and Russia — reached the conclusion of negotiations over Tehran’s civilian nuclear program, with the Islamic Republic and the sextet sealing an agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Based on JCPOA, the sextet agreed to remove all sanctions imposed on Iran’s economic and energy sectors in return for certain restrictions in Iran's nuclear program. According to Ukraine’s state statistics service, the volume of trade between the two countries stood at USD 756 million last year with Ukraine’s exports to Iran accounting for more than 90 percent of that figure.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 25 Trend: A rapporteur of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) will address the parliament with a report on Armenia's "water terrorism". Azerbaijani Deputy Minister of Agriculture Ilham Guliyev met with a delegation headed by the Rapporteur of the PACE Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development Milica Markovic August 25. The aim of the delegation's visit is to prepare a report entitled "Intentional deprivation of the inhabitants of Azerbaijani border regions of water." During the meeting Guliyev informed the guests that historically Azerbaijan is an agrarian country. After gaining independence, the economy is being rapidly developed. The country's leadership attaches great importance to the agrarian sector. Important decisions and orders related to the development of this industry are made, the Ministry of Agriculture told Trend. "As a result of the occupation of the Sarsang reservoir by Armenian aggressors, water has not been supplied for many years for irrigating the Tartar, Barda, Goranboy, Yevlakh and Agjabadi districts," Guliyev said. "This causes irreparable damage to the economy of this region." "Armenians deliberately use water in an excess volume, particularly, in autumn and winter at night, by posing a threat of flooding the villages in these areas and thereby sowing fear and panic among people," he said. "As a result of care of the head of state for this area, 586 artesian wells were drilled on the area within the scope of Sarsang reservoir in order to improve water supply to crops. This requires additional budgetary funds," said the deputy minister. He went on to add that construction of many facilities of land reclamation and water industry remained unfinished in the zone of occupation, and over time they all have been destroyed and put out of action. "About 500,000 residents in the flood zone of Tartar and Barda districts, as well as those residing in more than 130 settlements of Agdere, Barda, Tartar, Zardab and Agdash districts are living under a real threat as a result of targeted actions and provocations of the Armenians," Guliyev said. The deputy minister informed the guests that the water resources of the Samur transboundary river are used in full accordance with the intergovernmental agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan, while the use of water and energy resources of the Araz river is governed by a joint Iranian-Azerbaijani commission. PACE rapporteur expressed gratitude for a warm reception and said that this is her second visit to Azerbaijan. She also noted that she is familiar with the difficulties in water supply of the residents of regions bordering with Armenia. Milica Markovic went on to add that on the basis of the collected materials she will give a speech in the parliament with a report on the deliberate deprivation of water of the inhabitants of bordering regions.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Sept. 3 By Anvar Mammadov - Trend: Leading specialists of Iran's Khazar Exploration and Production Co. (KEPCO) had a discussion with the first vice president of Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR Khoshbakht Yusifzadeh about their visit to Azerbaijan, said SOCAR on its website. Iranian company's delegation, who arrived in Baku in late August, also reviewed the promising areas of cooperation with Azerbaijan in the oil and gas sector. SOCAR said the members of KEPCO delegation led by the company's director for exploration affairs, Yousef Etemadi spoke about their meetings with Azerbaijani colleagues from the Geology and Geophysics Department, the Oil and Gas Research and Design Institute, and the Azneft Production Union of SOCAR. Etemadi said that the new technologies used in Azerbaijan's oil and gas industry are of great interest in Iran. He noted that during the meeting, Iranian specialists exchanged views with Azerbaijani colleagues who have great experience in searching, exploring and developing offshore and onshore oil and gas fields, became familiar with technical and technological procedures conducted by them and touched upon the possibility of joint cooperation. "We are very interested in the work of Azerbaijani land-surveyors and hydrographers," Etemadi said. "The occurrence of mud volcanoes and their impact on the drilling work, the exploration of deep-sea gas hydrates and assessing of their reserves, joint study of modern computer programs used in the oil and gas industry were determined as promising areas of cooperation between Azerbaijani and Iranian oil industry workers. The joint research of regional seismic data and study of the general stratigraphy and structural-tectonic features, as well as other issues were also among these areas." In his turn, Yusifzade said that cooperation in the oil and gas sphere between Azerbaijan and Iran has long history. He also stressed the importance of using the joint cooperation opportunities between Azerbaijan and Iran in the field of exploration and development of oil and gas fields after a long break. "There are very good prospects to strengthen relations in the energy sector between our countries," said the first vice-president of SOCAR, stressing the importance to further hold such meetings. "I am confident that the relations in this sphere will strengthen the economic development of our countries." It was earlier reported that in August 2014, an Azerbaijani delegation led by the first vice-president of Azerbaijani State Oil Company (SOCAR), academician Khoshbakht Yusifzadeh visited Iran at an invitation from Iran's Khazar Exploration and Production Company (KEPCO). A memorandum of understanding was signed between SOCAR and Iranian KEPCO following the meeting and negotiations. The importance of periodic bilateral meetings and exchange of experience for the development of cooperation in the oil and gas sector was noted in the memorandum.

Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev has arrived in the Iranian capital, Tehran, on an official visit that will mainly focus on expansion of mutual relations, Press TV reported. Heading a high-ranking politico-economic delegation, Atambayev is in Tehran upon the official invitation of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. During his three-day stay in Tehran, the Kyrgyz president is to exchange views with his Iranian counterpart and other top officials on ways to further improve mutual ties in political, economic and cultural fields. Iranian and Kyrgyz officials are also scheduled to sign documents for cooperation in different sectors. The construction of a new railway track connecting Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and China is an important issue on the agenda of talks between the Iranian and Kyrgyz presidents. Chief of the Kyrgyz presidential administration's foreign affairs department Sapar Isakov had earlier said ties between Kyrgyzstan and Iran "have been developing in a favorable manner." He said Atambayev's visit to Iran "will open new prospects for cooperation, including in the sphere of investment in the Kyrgyz economy." President Rouhani paid an official visit to Kyrgyzstan in September 2013 to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. On the sidelines of the summit, he held talks with his Kyrgyz counterpart and a number of other senior officials taking part in the event. Kyrgyzstan, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are the six permanent members of the SCO.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Congress should reconsider the nation’s immigration enforcement system and possibly “start from scratch” by eliminating the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. “There’s no question that we’ve got to critically reexamine ICE and its role, and the way that it is being administered, and the work it is doing,” Harris said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “And we need to probably think about starting from scratch.” Harris’ remarks came in response to a question from host Kasie Hunt about whether she supports abolishing ICE. Advertisement Progressive activists have pushed Democratic lawmakers to support abolishing ICE, the government’s chief immigration enforcement arm that was established in 2002 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in response to President Donald Trump’s push to reduce the numbers of immigrants coming to the U.S. from Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. Trump’s efforts range from banning citizens from certain countries from entering the U.S. to ramping up deportations of undocumented immigrants, shrinking the number of refugees accepted into the country, cracking down on students who overstay their visas and the “zero tolerance” policy at the border with Mexico that led to children being separated from their parents. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Congress may need to "start from scratch" on immigration enforcement. Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Some Democratic candidates have embraced the “abolish ICE” mantra to spotlight their opposition to Trump’s policies and distinguish themselves from their rivals in party primaries. Advertisement Cynthia Nixon, an actress and activist hoping to derail Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York’s primary in September, called for abolishing ICE at a rally in Brooklyn last week. Two other candidates waging insurgent primary campaigns against entrenched House Democrats in New York City districts ― Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Suraj Patel ― have either called for ICE to be abolished or defunded. Harris is the most prominent elected Democrat to endorse sweeping change to the immigration enforcement apparatus. Her Sunday comments also represent a change in position for the freshman senator and potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender. In March, she responded to a similar question posed on MSNBC by noting her past experience as a prosecutor who worked to lock up criminals and saying, “ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist. But let’s not abuse the power. Let’s not extend it to areas that are not posing a threat to the safety and the public safety of these communities.” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), also appearing on “Meet the Press,” did not echo Harris’ call for starting from scratch in revising immigration enforcement practices and agencies, but he did say Congress needs to consider changes. “I don’t know how you abolish an agency without abolishing the function, and I think the function is necessary,” King said. “I don’t know if I say abolish, I don’t think that makes a lot of sense. But I do think looking at it makes a hell of a lot of sense.” Advertisement

Advertisement Cynthia Nixon, an actress and activist hoping to derail Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York’s primary in September, called for abolishing ICE at a rally in Brooklyn last week. Two other candidates waging insurgent primary campaigns against entrenched House Democrats in New York City districts ― Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Suraj Patel ― have either called for ICE to be abolished or defunded. Harris is the most prominent elected Democrat to endorse sweeping change to the immigration enforcement apparatus. Her Sunday comments also represent a change in position for the freshman senator and potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender. In March, she responded to a similar question posed on MSNBC by noting her past experience as a prosecutor who worked to lock up criminals and saying, “ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist. But let’s not abuse the power. Let’s not extend it to areas that are not posing a threat to the safety and the public safety of these communities.” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), also appearing on “Meet the Press,” did not echo Harris’ call for starting from scratch in revising immigration enforcement practices and agencies, but he did say Congress needs to consider changes. “I don’t know how you abolish an agency without abolishing the function, and I think the function is necessary,” King said. “I don’t know if I say abolish, I don’t think that makes a lot of sense. But I do think looking at it makes a hell of a lot of sense.” Advertisement

News article:
By Dave Goldiner June 27, 2018 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the insurgent firebrand who Tuesday toppled the No. 4 Democrat in the House of Representatives, is a strong critic of Israel who denounced the killings of Palestinian protesters as a “massacre.” This is a massacre. I hope my peers have the moral courage to call it such. No state or entity is absolved of mass shootings of protesters. There is no justification. Palestinian people deserve basic human dignity, as anyone else. Democrats can’t be silent about this anymore. https://t.co/wJGATOtDsR — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) May 14, 2018 Ocasio-Cortez, 28, stunned the political world by decisively beating Joe Crowley, a Queens powerbroker who had been mentioned as a possible future candidate for Speaker of the House. With about 90% of precincts reporting, Ocasio-Cortez was ahead by 58%-to-42%, making Crowley the first incumbent Democrat to lose his seat this year. Ocasio-Cortez said she feels as strongly about the killings in Gaza as she would if the slain protesters were in Ferguson, Missouri or in Puerto Rico, where her family has roots. “Especially in New York people say this is political suicide,” Ocasio-Cortez told Glenn Greenwald of the Intercept, referring to her criticism of Israel. “But I had a lot of my constituents thanking me for taking that position. I had a lot of Jewish Americans who thanked me.”

News article:
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had never run for political office, but her primary victory against long-time New York congressman Joe Crowley illustrates how the changing face of the Democratic base can help bring the party back to its roots. Though the young Latina from the Bronx is being noted for her leftist politics as a self-described socialist, Ocasio-Cortez told NBC News her message simply resonated because voters could relate to many of the issues she campaigned on: criminal justice reform, tuition-free college and trade school and health care for all. "These the issues that win," said Ocasio-Cortez, who described herself as a working-class American, "because these are the issues that speak to people's hearts and to their futures." Working-class is not just "white" Julia Hellwege, an assistant professor of Political Science at the University of South Dakota said there is a stigma that equates minority candidates like Ocasio-Cortez with identity politics. “Identity politics does not mean minority politics. Whiteness is an identity. Motherhood is an identity. We have multiple layers to who we are," said Hellwege. Democrats are “still stuck on the narrative that they messed up [in 2016] by not concentrating on the working class, which is largely viewed as a white perspective," said Celeste Montoya, a professor of Political Science and Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder. "Ocasio-Cortez represents one of the most loyal demographics for the Democrats," said Montoya. Almost half of the Ocasio-Cortez's district is Latino; over 11 percent is black and 16 percent is Asian. "The working class is not just a white male experience," said Montoya. Ocasio-Cortez "connected with her voters on working class issues, the problems of homelessness, motherhood, and discrimination in the workplace.” Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi warned against drawing any broad conclusions from Ocasio-Cortez’ politics in a press conference following Crowley’s loss. "They made a choice in one district, so let’s not get yourself carried away,” she said. But Christina Bejarano, associate professor of Political Science at Kansas University, said Ocasio-Cortez's election could be a sign of things to come and has the potential to shake up the Democratic Party. "Her election is a way to let the party know that women of color are key as voters and candidates. The party "shouldn’t take them for granted", she said. "Now we're more visible" Ocasio-Cortez is no stranger to politics; she worked in the late Senator Ted Kennedy’s office on foreign affairs and immigration while she was a student at Boston University and was an organizer for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election. Ocasio-Cortez has worked as a community activist and protested the pipeline at Standing Rock. But like other women this year, this is the first time she ran for office. Latinas in particular have done well in this election cycle. New Mexico Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham won her Democratic primary earlier this month in her quest to become governor and Lupe Valdez will be representing the Democratic Party in the race for Governor in Texas. Late last year, Elizabeth Guzmán and Hala Ayala made history in Virginia as the first Hispanic women elected to the state's House of Delegates. One takeaway from this election cycle is that these wins will result in more Latinas seeing themselves as part of the viable pool of candidates who can run for office, said Hellwege. A key barrier to running is visualizing oneself in the race, and with the growing number of Hispanic women winning their races, more Latinas will likely draw on their inspiration. “Now we’re more visible,” says Hellwege. But Montoya warned that the Democratic party has sometimes been "lukewarm" in their support of minority, and especially progressive, candidates. "Identity politics is not the reason movements fail, it is a result of movement failures," said Montoya. The key, she said, is for the party to reach out "equally" to candidates like Ocasio-Cortez. For her part, Ocasio-Cortez said her message resonated because so many could identify with it. “I’m a working-class American, my mom cleaned homes and drove school buses to make sure we could make ends meet and I spent time during the financial crisis waiting tables," she said. "So I understand what it means to be a real, working-class person in America and that is so important to have that perspective in our leadership.” FOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.

News article:
Batya Ungar-Sargon July 16, 2018 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise win over 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley in a congressional primary in New York provoked a predictable response from the right. It wasn’t just her avowedly socialist views. Since the day of her victory, the Republican Jewish Coalition has been trying to smear the candidate as bad for the Jews, thanks to a tweet during the Gaza March of Return protest over the summer: This is a massacre. I hope my peers have the moral courage to call it such. No state or entity is absolved of mass shootings of protesters. There is no justification. Palestinian people deserve basic human dignity, as anyone else. Democrats can’t be silent about this anymore. https://t.co/wJGATOtDsR — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) May 14, 2018 But as of today, Ocasio-Cortez has inspired ire from the opposite side of the aisle: the far left, who once championed her. Her crime? Stating that she supports Israel’s right to exist. On Friday night, PBS aired an interview with Ocasio-Cortez. The interview was half an hour long, and touched on many of the candidate’s policy issues like free college and free healthcare. None of this made news on Monday morning Twitter, though. Instead, an unflattering clip of the candidate struggling to explain her thoughts about Israel quickly went viral. The right immediately pounced, doubling down on its initial pronouncement of Ocasio-Cortez as dangerous and anti-Israel. She was now dangerous, anti-Israel, and ignorant, too. But the clip did a disservice to the candidate, who explained her views about Israel in greater detail, and was honest about her desire to learn more and evolve. Crucially, while Ocasio-Cortez stood strong on the question of Palestinian human rights, she also insisted on something else. “I believe absolutely in Israel’s right to exist,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I’m a proponent of the two state solution. For me, this is not a referendum on the state of Israel.” Her view that Israel has a right to exist but its occupation of the Palestinians is wrong and should be denounced is not only reasonable; it’s the very position that the majority of American Jews take on Israel. This was not enough, however, to stop the criticism from the political right. “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bashes Israel while admitting she is clueless about what is going on there,” tweeted the RJC. “She simply toes the far-left, radical agenda.” More surprising than the hypocrisy of the RJC, which has yet to condemn all of the nine white supremacists and Nazi sympathizers running for office on the GOP ticket, is the fact that Ocasio-Cortez’s comments about Israel have brought her scorn from erstwhile friends on the left. Corey Robin, writing in Jacobin, described a bitter fight on his Facebook page about the interview, with one side taking Ocasio-Cortez’s comments as “confirmation that she is no real leftist, that she is turning right, that she’s been absorbed into the Democratic Party machine, that she’s a fake, a phony, and a fraud.” (The other side pleaded her youth, and that she had been set up.) A tweet from the anti-Israel site Mondoweiss accused Ocasio-Cortez of having “all but apologized” for her earlier remarks about the massacre in Gaza: Rising Democratic star @Ocasio2018, soon to go to Congress from NY, all but apologized for using words massacre and occupation about Israel, saying she spoke as an activist, and she is no expert on the Middle East and is willing to learn and evolve. https://t.co/pDfwwf4yG9 pic.twitter.com/MnFJA6E9r8 — Mondoweiss (@Mondoweiss) July 16, 2018 The tweet was picked up by others expressing dismay that their star candidate did not toe the party line on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, who helped get her elected and endorsed her candidacy. But the DSA has also endorsed the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel. And after Ocasio-Cortez’s comments about Israel this weekend, one person even suggested that the DSA put out an official statement criticizing her. Robin ends his piece hopefully, confident that the same DSA activists who got Ocasio-Cortez through her primary in the first place “are talking to her now about getting a better line on this.” The implication seems clear: Woe is to Ocasio-Cortez if Robin is wrong, if opposing the occupation but insisting on Israel’s right to exist are exactly where she wants to be politically. Israel has long been the third rail of American politics. The right will oppose anyone who dares speak up against the occupation, even if they do so from a place where they acknowledge Israel’s right to exist. And the far left will oppose anyone who dares acknowledge Israel has a right to exist, even if they are committed to solving Israel’s civil rights abuses against the Palestinians. Usually in opposition to one another, the bigotries of both the far left and the right have converged on the young socialist candidate. It’s a shame. But it’s one we know all too well. Like her views on Israel, being a target for the left and the right is now one more thing Ocasio-Cortez has in common with the Jews. I hope as she learns more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, she is able to find the right voices on both sides of the conflict to guide her. There are certainly enough people on both sides who wish her to fail. Correction: An earlier draft of this article said that the RJC had not condemned the white nationalists and nazi-sympathizers running for office. They have condemned a few of them. We regret the error. Batya Ungar-Sargon is the opinion editor of the Forward.

News article:
By Yochonon Donn NEW YORK — Rising Democratic star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez botched her first national interview Sunday night when she slammed Israel’s actions in Gaza before admitting she was not aware of the situation there. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic socialist who has in the past said that Israel was committing a “massacre” in Gaza, was interviewed by PBS’s Firing Line. Margaret Hoover, the host, asked her for her thoughts on Israel. Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated top-ranking Rep. Joe Crowley in a major upset last month, referenced the Black Lives Matter movement and alleged police brutality in the U.S and her native Puerto Rico before circling back to Gaza. “I also think that what people are starting to see in the occupation of Palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian conditions,” Ocasio-Cortez responded, “and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue.” Pressed on the term “occupation of Palestine” — there is no such country — Ocasio-Cortez struggled to give a coherent response. “I think what I meant,” she said, “is that the settlements that are increasing in some of these areas and places where Palestinians are experiencing difficulty in access to housing and homes.” “Do you think you can expand on that?” Hoover asked. “Yeah, I think (laughing) I am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “You know, for me, I’m a firm believer in finding a two-state solution in this issue. And I’m happy to sit down with leaders on both of these. For me, I just look at things through a human-rights lens, and I may not use the right words.” She concluded with “I know this is a very intense issue.” The Simon Wiesenthal Center blasted her in a tweet, saying she “knows zero about 3,500 yr relationship of Jewish people to Land of Israel.” She also got blasted from the left by fellow socialists who said she offered “liberal platitudes about a two-state solution.” Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro tweeted: “If she were a Republican, she’d now be labeled stupid by every major media outlet in America. But she’s a democratic socialist, which is itself inherently stupid, so she will instead be given a free pass.” Ocasio-Cortez is considered a shoo-in for election in the heavily Democratic Queens district.

By Yochonon Donn NEW YORK — Rising Democratic star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez botched her first national interview Sunday night when she slammed Israel’s actions in Gaza before admitting she was not aware of the situation there.

News article:
Former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) is urging voters in the general election to vote for Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) instead of Democratic nominee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who upset him in the party primary. “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise primary victory over Rep. Joe Crowley seems likely to hurt Congress, America and the Democratic Party. It doesn’t have to,” Lieberman wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal. {mosads} “Because the policies Ms. Ocasio-Cortez advocates are so far from the mainstream, her election in November would make it harder for Congress to stop fighting and start fixing problems.” Lieberman noted that Crowley’s name will still be on the ballot as the nominee of the Working Families Party. “Thanks to a small percentage of primary votes, all of the people of New York’s 14th Congressional District stand to lose a very effective representative in Washington,” Lieberman wrote. “Fortunately, Joe Crowley and the voters in his district can prevent this damage.” Ocasio-Cortez defeated Crowley by 15 percentage points in the June 28 Democratic primary. Her stunning upset rattled the Democratic establishment in Washington, D.C. The two rivals also feuded on Thursday, with Ocasio-Cortez accusing Crowley of mounting a third-party challenge. She said he had failed to make time for a concession call and was refusing take his name off the ballot for the Working Families Party. Crowley responded that he had made his support for her “clear” and that “Democrats need to come together.” He also claimed that his name could only be removed from the ballot if he moves out of New York, is convicted of a crime, accepts a nomination for another office in a different district, or dies. In his op-ed, Lieberman recounted how he faced a similar, “difficult” choice when he lost the Democratic nomination for the Senate in 2006 to Ned Lamont. But Lieberman eventually won reelection in the general as an independent candidate. “I ran as an independent because I wanted all the voters to decide whether I deserved to continue to serve them in the Senate,” Lieberman wrote. “It was a risk, but I concluded it was worth it to know that I had taken my fight for the kind of government I believed in as far as I possibly could.” Lieberman, viewed by many as an independent voice in politics, continued to caucus with Democrats, but endorsed Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) presidential run at the 2008 Republican National Convention. The former 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee also attacked Ocasio-Cortez’s policies for being “more socialist than Democratic.” “She has received the most attention for calling to ‘Abolish ICE,’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” he wrote. “This makes no sense unless you no longer want any rules on immigration or customs to be enforced.” Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign declined to comment to The Hill.

News article:
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is hitting the national campaign trail this week with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to stump for other left-wing candidates, even as the upstart 28-year-old democratic socialist's rising profile continues to rankle top Democrats. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are expected to campaign on July 20 for two congressional candidates seeking to unseat Republican incumbents in Kansas: James Thompson in Wichita, and former Sanders delegate Brent Welder in the suburbs of Kansas City. But Ocasio-Cortez is also set to support several progressives seeking to supplant Democratic incumbents elsewhere -- alarming Democratic leaders and pundits who worry that her rising national profile and far-left politics might fracture the party ahead of critical midterm elections. DEFEATED 10-TERM INCUMBENT JOE CROWLEY SEEKS TO EASE TENSIONS AFTER OCASIO-CORTEZ'S SHOCK WIN On July 28 and 29, Ocasio-Cortez will visit Michigan to lend her national spotlight to Abdul El-Sayed, 33, a progressive candidate for governor. She will travel throughout Michigan, stopping in places including Grand Rapids, Flint and Detroit. El-Sayed is Detroit’s ex-public health commissioner, and looks to upset Democratic former State Sen. Gretchen Whitmer. "Alexandria’s victory was a proof of concept for campaigns like ours,” El-Sayed told The Washington Post. "If her win makes her into ... the new face of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party's not going to have a very bright future." — Former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman Ocasio-Cortez has also endorsed other progressives seeking to take down incumbent Democratic lawmakers, including and Delaware Sen. Tom Carper and Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Adam Smith of Washington, and Michael Capuano of Massachusetts. WATCH: JOE LIEBERMAN SAYS DEMS WON'T HAVE A 'BRIGHT FUTURE' IF OCASIO-CORTEZ IS THEIR MODEL In Kansas' Republican-leaning 4th District, where Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will team up Friday, Thompson came close to winning in a special election last year, and is taking his second shot at unseating GOP Rep. Ron Estes. Meanwhile, far-left Welder is running against GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder, whom President Trump endorsed on Twitter this week as someone who has voted for "$5 BILLION for Border Security" and who "loves our Military and Vets." Welder, who worked as a labor lawyer and wants a $15 minimum wage and touts a "Medicare for All" platform, has polled ahead of Yoder, and his 3rd District went to Hillary Clinton by a slim margin in 2016. Primaries in both Kansas and Michigan take place Aug. 7. “It’s a huge boost to our campaign to welcome Senator Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to Wichita,” Thompson said in a statement. “The interest and enthusiasm here has been electric.” But even as the progressive pair seek to export their brand of progressive politics to the Sunflower State and beyond, top Democratic leaders have increasingly sounded the alarm. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., charged this week that Ocasio-Cortez was overly idealistic. "Meteors fizz out,” Hastings said. “What she will learn in this institution is that it’s glacial to begin with, and therefore no matter how far you rise, that’s just how far you will ultimately get your comeuppance. “You come up here and you’re going to be buddy-buddy with all the folks or you’re going to make them do certain things? Ain’t happening, O.K.?” Hastings added. And Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said that Ocasio-Cortez's decision to pubicly feud with longtime Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., even after she defeated him in a shocking primary contest last month was upsetting Democrats in the House. "She’s not asking my advice,” Pascrell said. "I would do it differently, rather than make enemies of people.” Rep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo. -- who is facing a primary challenge from the left by community activist Cori Bush, who has Ocasio-Cortez's backing -- was more direct. “Once an election is over and you win, why are you still angry?” Clay asked. “I think it’s a lack of maturity on her part, and a lack of political acumen, for her to be that petty." That sentiment was echoed by former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who was the Democratic Party's candidate for vice president in 2000, in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday. "When I see somebody who really says she's a socialist -- she's a very captivating, charismatic candidate -- when you look at those policies, those policies will not be supported in many places across America," Lieberman said. "If her win makes her into what Kellyanne Conway called the new face of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party's not going to have a very bright future," he added. Lieberman wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed calling for voters to reject Ocasio-Cortez in the November elections. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

News article:
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - The new face of an emerging democratic socialist movement joined its patriarch in the most unlikely place Friday, calling on Kansans unhappy with the direction of the country to get off the sidelines in a pivotal Republican-held congressional district. "We know that people in Kansas, just like everywhere else in this country, just like families in the Bronx, just want a fair shake," Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the surprise winner in a New York House primary last month, told a frenetic crowd of more than 3,000 in a Kansas suburb of Kansas City. Headlining a rally with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez sought to infuse the final weeks of Democrat Brent Welder's congressional primary campaign with the enthusiasm that lifted her over 20-year Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley last month. Kansas congressional candidate James Thompson, left, U.S Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congressional candidate from New York, stand together on stage after a rally, Friday, July 20, 2018, in Wichita, Kan. (Jaime Green/The Wichita Eagle via AP) In an election year defined by energized Democratic voters seeking to send President Donald Trump a message, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were betting they could stir up liberals in places where the left rarely competes. The 28-year-old Latina from New York and the 76-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont struck a stark contrast in the hotel ballroom, though they reflected the range of people in the racially and ethnically mixed crowd, weighted toward millennials but including gray-haired activists and parents with children. Their combined messages sought to unite not just the diverse group in the hall, but restless liberals around the country. "Whether you live in Kansas or Vermont or New York City, you want your children to have a decent life," Sanders said. "And yes, we have differences. But despite these huge differences, we have a hell of a lot more in common." Kansas, where Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2016, would seem inhospitable for a duo championing strikingly progressive positions such as universal, single-payer health care and government-paid tuition to public college. But Democrats see reasons for hope in a campaign year in which progressive candidates have won competitive primaries in GOP-leaning districts in suburban Philadelphia, metropolitan Omaha and Orange County, California, this year. Thirty-two-year-old registered nurse Kristen Burroughs said she'd grown tired of feeling locked out of representation in Kansas. "I wasn't sure when I'd have the chance to vote for someone this liberal in Kansas," Burroughs said, referring to Welder, a Sanders campaign activist and labor lawyer. Kansas' 3rd District, where Welder is competing, represented by four-term Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, is on Democrats' target list as they aim to seize the GOP-controlled House in November. Nationally, the party must pick up at least 23 Republican-held seats to claim the House majority, and they are focusing on 25 districts where Clinton won, or Trump won narrowly. Democrats have been shut out of statewide and congressional races in Kansas since 2010. Earlier Friday, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders headlined a rally in Wichita for Democrat James Thompson, a civil rights lawyer running in Kansas' 4th District. He also was an activist for Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. Sherri Lower, a 67-year-old retired emergency medical technician, showed up at the Wichita rally wearing a t-shirt that read: "We Care. We Vote. Do You?" "This is the most important year we've ever had, and Thompson is one of our main guys," Lower said. "I want Democrats to go out and vote." But Democrats have higher hopes in the 3rd District, one of only a handful Democrat Hillary Clinton won in the general election and Sanders won in the presidential nominating caucuses. Republicans in the 3rd District outnumber their Democratic counterparts by more than 50,000, while unaffiliated voters also edge Democrats. Republicans outnumber Democrats by 2-to-1 in the 4th District. Liberals argue that they are not just convincing moderate Democrats or disaffected Republicans but also engaging new primary voters, as Ocasio-Cortez did in New York this summer and as Sanders did in his insurgent 2016 presidential campaign. While the Kansas campaign swing created a lot of buzz, Republicans were skeptical it would help Democrats make inroads in a conservative state. State Rep. Tom Cox, a moderate Kansas City-area Republican, said there are pockets of liberal Democrats in the Kansas City suburbs but questioned whether Sanders' message will resonate more broadly. He said Democrats tend to be split between liberals and moderates, with some union members and supporters holding conservative views on social issues. "Even our Democrats around here are not socialist democrats," he said. "If someone would describe the 3rd District, I would say center right." Leading candidates in the Democratic primary for governor have said their party must rebuild its brand in rural, heavily GOP areas. And despite surging energy among lefist Democrats in the Trump era, it was unclear if there were enough votes in the 3rd District for a liberal Democrat to win. Before Yoder won in 2010, it had been held for 12 years by centrist Democrat Dennis Moore, who relied on moderate Republicans during his tenure. Yet Sanders and his brand of liberalism have proved popular. He won more than two-thirds of the votes in the state's 2016 presidential caucuses, surpassing Barack Obama's 2008 vote total. And Ocasio-Cortez said it can be done in Kansas by broadening the electorate to include previously less active voters, rather than trying to convert moderates. "It is going to take every single person in this room knocking on 10, 50, 100 doors apiece," she said. "So, if you have never knocked on a door before, I am talking to you." ___ Hegeman contributed reporting Wichita, Kansas. Correspondent John Hanna contributed from Topeka, Kansas.

KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - The new face of an emerging democratic socialist movement joined its patriarch in the most unlikely place Friday, calling on Kansans unhappy with the direction of the country to get off the sidelines in a pivotal Republican-held congressional district. "We know that people in Kansas, just like everywhere else in this country, just like families in the Bronx, just want a fair shake," Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the surprise winner in a New York House primary last month, told a frenetic crowd of more than 3,000 in a Kansas suburb of Kansas City. Headlining a rally with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez sought to infuse the final weeks of Democrat Brent Welder's congressional primary campaign with the enthusiasm that lifted her over 20-year Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley last month. Kansas congressional candidate James Thompson, left, U.S Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congressional candidate from New York, stand together on stage after a rally, Friday, July 20, 2018, in Wichita, Kan. (Jaime Green/The Wichita Eagle via AP) In an election year defined by energized Democratic voters seeking to send President Donald Trump a message, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were betting they could stir up liberals in places where the left rarely competes. The 28-year-old Latina from New York and the 76-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont struck a stark contrast in the hotel ballroom, though they reflected the range of people in the racially and ethnically mixed crowd, weighted toward millennials but including gray-haired activists and parents with children. Their combined messages sought to unite not just the diverse group in the hall, but restless liberals around the country. "Whether you live in Kansas or Vermont or New York City, you want your children to have a decent life," Sanders said. "And yes, we have differences. But despite these huge differences, we have a hell of a lot more in common." Kansas, where Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2016, would seem inhospitable for a duo championing strikingly progressive positions such as universal, single-payer health care and government-paid tuition to public college. But Democrats see reasons for hope in a campaign year in which progressive candidates have won competitive primaries in GOP-leaning districts in suburban Philadelphia, metropolitan Omaha and Orange County, California, this year. Thirty-two-year-old registered nurse Kristen Burroughs said she'd grown tired of feeling locked out of representation in Kansas. "I wasn't sure when I'd have the chance to vote for someone this liberal in Kansas," Burroughs said, referring to Welder, a Sanders campaign activist and labor lawyer. Kansas' 3rd District, where Welder is competing, represented by four-term Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, is on Democrats' target list as they aim to seize the GOP-controlled House in November. Nationally, the party must pick up at least 23 Republican-held seats to claim the House majority, and they are focusing on 25 districts where Clinton won, or Trump won narrowly. Democrats have been shut out of statewide and congressional races in Kansas since 2010. Earlier Friday, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders headlined a rally in Wichita for Democrat James Thompson, a civil rights lawyer running in Kansas' 4th District. He also was an activist for Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. Sherri Lower, a 67-year-old retired emergency medical technician, showed up at the Wichita rally wearing a t-shirt that read: "We Care. We Vote. Do You?" "This is the most important year we've ever had, and Thompson is one of our main guys," Lower said. "I want Democrats to go out and vote." But Democrats have higher hopes in the 3rd District, one of only a handful Democrat Hillary Clinton won in the general election and Sanders won in the presidential nominating caucuses. Republicans in the 3rd District outnumber their Democratic counterparts by more than 50,000, while unaffiliated voters also edge Democrats. Republicans outnumber Democrats by 2-to-1 in the 4th District. Liberals argue that they are not just convincing moderate Democrats or disaffected Republicans but also engaging new primary voters, as Ocasio-Cortez did in New York this summer and as Sanders did in his insurgent 2016 presidential campaign. While the Kansas campaign swing created a lot of buzz, Republicans were skeptical it would help Democrats make inroads in a conservative state. State Rep. Tom Cox, a moderate Kansas City-area Republican, said there are pockets of liberal Democrats in the Kansas City suburbs but questioned whether Sanders' message will resonate more broadly. He said Democrats tend to be split between liberals and moderates, with some union members and supporters holding conservative views on social issues. "Even our Democrats around here are not socialist democrats," he said. "If someone would describe the 3rd District, I would say center right." Leading candidates in the Democratic primary for governor have said their party must rebuild its brand in rural, heavily GOP areas. And despite surging energy among lefist Democrats in the Trump era, it was unclear if there were enough votes in the 3rd District for a liberal Democrat to win. Before Yoder won in 2010, it had been held for 12 years by centrist Democrat Dennis Moore, who relied on moderate Republicans during his tenure. Yet Sanders and his brand of liberalism have proved popular. He won more than two-thirds of the votes in the state's 2016 presidential caucuses, surpassing Barack Obama's 2008 vote total. And Ocasio-Cortez said it can be done in Kansas by broadening the electorate to include previously less active voters, rather than trying to convert moderates. "It is going to take every single person in this room knocking on 10, 50, 100 doors apiece," she said. "So, if you have never knocked on a door before, I am talking to you." ___ Hegeman contributed reporting Wichita, Kansas. Correspondent John Hanna contributed from Topeka, Kansas.

News article:
Ron Desantis, a Republican in the House of Representatives and a candidate for Governor of Florida took aim at political newcomer and rising progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a campaign event Saturday. "You look at this girl Ocasio-Cortez, or whatever she is, I mean, she's in a totally different universe," he said during the event in Orange Park, as first reported by the Huffington Post. "It's basically socialism wrapped in ignorance." Ocasio-Cortez responded to Desantis's comments on Twitter Monday with the statement: "Rep DeSantis, it seems you're confused as to 'whatever I am.' I am a Puerto Rican woman. It's strange you don't know what that is, given that ~75,000 Puerto Ricans have relocated to Florida in the 10 mos since Maria," she said. "But I'm sure these new FL voters appreciate your comments!" Rep DeSantis, it seems you‘re confused as to “whatever I am.” I am a Puerto Rican woman. It‘s strange you don’t know what that is, given that ~75,000 Puerto Ricans have relocated to Florida in the 10 mos since María. But I’m sure these new FL voters appreciate your comments! https://t.co/xJlroSe5Hs — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 23, 2018 Ocasio- Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist from New York, rocketed into the national political scene last month after she beat high-ranking Congressman Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary win that saw her progressive message resonate with constituents. "The only time we create any kind of substantive change is when we reach out to a disaffected electorate and inspire and motivate them to vote," Ocasio Cortez told In These Times, a progressive magazine last month. "That is how Obama won and got re-elected, and that's how Bernie Sanders did so well." Desantis'z criticism of Ocasio-Cortez centered around an interview she did with PBS News earlier this month in which she described Israel's presence in the West Bank as an "occupation." "There's never been a Palestinian state. You're just repeating these canned, left-wing talking points, and you're somehow the savior of the Democratic Party? Good lord," Desantis said. "She has no clue what she's talking about." Desantis did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment on his statements. DeSantis' website describes him as a politician who has "helped drain the swamp." He leads the Republican race for governor by a 12 point margin over Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, according to a Politico poll. In June, Trump endorsed Densantis on Twitter and said he would make a "great governor." "Congressman Ron DeSantis, a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School, is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida. Ron is strong on Borders, tough on Crime & big on Cutting Taxes- Loves our Military & our Vets," he said. "He will be a Great Governor & has my full Endorsement!"

News article:
NEW YORK (JTA)—Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decried the “occupation of Palestine” during a television interview. Appearing July 13 on PBS’s “Firing Line,” Ocasio-Cortez, 28, also described herself as “a firm believer in finding a two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, upset 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in last month’s primary in New York’s 14th Congressional District, which straddles Queens and the Bronx. Although she has commented infrequently on foreign affairs, in May she called the killing of Palestinian protesters by Israeli troops at the Gaza fence a “massacre.” On “Firing Line,” host Margaret Hoover asked Ocasio-Cortez “What is your position on Israel?” Ocasio-Cortez responded, “I believe absolutely in Israel’s right to exist” She added: “I am a proponent of a two-state solution.” The candidate said her previous position on the Gaza clashes “is not a referendum on the State of Israel.” “The lens through which I saw this incident, as an activist, as an organizer – if 60 people were killed in Ferguson, Missouri, if 60 people were killed in the South Bronx, unarmed, if 60 people were killed in Puerto Rico – I just look at that [Gaza] incident more through just, as an incident, and to me, it would just be completely unacceptable if that happened on our shores,” she said. “Of course the dynamics there, in terms of geopolitics... is very different than people expressing their First Amendment right to protest,” Hoover replied. Israel and its supporters have noted that among those killed in Gaza were members of the Hamas terrorist group, which encouraged its followers to breach the border fence. Hamas has acknowledged that at that May demonstration, 50 of the 61 killed were its members. “Yes,” Ocasio-Cortez conceded, adding, “But I also think that what people are starting to see at least in the occupation... of Palestine [is] just an increasing crisis of humanitarian condition and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue.” When Hoover, a former aide to President George W. Bush, asked Ocasio-Cortez to clarify what she meant, Ocasio-Cortez paused and answered: “I think what I meant is like the settlements that are increasing in some of these areas in places where Palestinians are experiencing difficulty in access to their housing and homes.” After Hoover asked Ocasio-Cortez to expand on her comments, the candidate said: “I am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue,” and “I just look at things through a human rights lens and I may not use the right words... Middle Eastern politics is not exactly at my kitchen table every night.” Her comments on Israel have prompted criticism from the right and left. “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing a great service. Her argument is twofold: Israel a colonizing occupier of Palestine, and that she doesn’t know anything about the conflict,” wrote Seth Mandel, op-ed editor of the New York Post, on Twitter. “Accurate: those who think this have no idea what they’re talking about. At least she’s honest.” The Republican Jewish Coalition tweeted: “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bashes Israel while admitting she is clueless about what is going on there. She simply toes the far-left, radical agenda. Elected Democrats are endorsing this when they endorse her.” Asad Abukhalil, a professor in political science at California State University, Stanislaus, lamented that Ocasio-Cortez’s comments about a two-state solution and support for Israel’s right to exist are “a sign that you have become an already mainstream Democratic candidate.” “’Israel’s right to exist’ is a euphemism for Israel’s right to occupy Palestine,” Abukhalil added. “@Ocasio2018 should have known that.” Although the Democratic Socialists of America endorses the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, Ocasio-Cortez has not discussed her position on the boycott. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has called Ocasio-Cortez the “future of our party.”

News article:
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded questions about her 2020 plans on Friday during an appearance at a historically black college, where she emphasized a renewed focus on political activism after President Trump’s election. Speaking at Dillard University in New Orleans, Warren was asked what may have changed since she opted not to run for president in 2016, The Associated Press reported. {mosads} “Two words: Donald Trump,” Warren responded during a Q&A panel hosted by Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Warren then shifted to discussing other topics including the upcoming midterm elections in November, saying they are an opportunity to halt the president’s agenda in Congress. Warren gets a question about why she didn’t run in 2016 and whether anything has changed since then. “Two words: Donald Trump.” But she then pivots to attacking the Kavanaugh nomination. — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) August 3, 2018 The Massachusetts senator is among several Senate Democrats widely viewed as potential candidates during the next White House race. Warren, 69, is up for reelection to her Senate seat this year and had told reporters in April that she planned to serve her full six-year term if reelected in November. “I am not running for president of the United States. That’s my plan,” Warren said at the time. Warren, a progressive firebrand, is considered a top potential Democratic contender in 2020, along with fellow Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Warren was one of several potential candidates, including Booker and Harris, who spoke at the progressive Netroots Nation conference in New Orleans this week. The annual gathering has been a top speaking spot for past Democratic contenders, including former President Obama and Sanders during his 2016 bid. Also speaking at Netroots Nation this week was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), the self-described democratic socialist who won a surprise victory over longtime Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), the No. 4 House Democrat, in a Democratic primary in New York in June.

News article:
Socialist star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez saw a majority of her primary candidates go down in flames in Tuesday night's contests, with four out of the six contenders she supported losing their bids to become the Democratic Party nominee in their respective races. Ocasio-Cortez, a self-proclaimed socialist Democrat who defeated Rep. Joe Crowley in a stunning primary upset in June, tried to leverage her new star power into helping other candidates follow her path to victory. And several of Tuesday's contests echoed the bitter 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, where establishment Democratic groups fought against liberal activists in a fight for the party's soul. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez backed six candidates in Tuesday's contests and only two one Michigan Gubernatorial Abdul El-Sayed was one of the tough losses of the night Ocasio-Cortez tried to help Missouri candidate Cori Bush repeat her feat in toppling an incumbent Bush failed in her contest Tuesday Ocasio-Cortez stayed positive about the defeats. 'Wins in the short-term are important milemarkers and necessary to building power. But you can't be afraid of loss. Fear keeps people from accomplishing great things,' she wrote on Twitter Wednesday afternoon. In Missouri, Ocasio-Cortez had backed candidate Cori Bush in her bid to do what she did earlier in the summer - topple a sitting member of Congress. But Bush, a pastor and civil rights activist, failed to bring down longtime Rep. William Lacy Clay. She lost by 20 points, earning 37 percent of the vote to Clay's 57 percent. The results could cause the remaining Democratic incumbents to breath a little easier as they head into their primary contests, given Clay's slam-dunk win. Clay has strong ties to the St. Louis House district, where he has been the congressman for two decades and that his father, who helped found the Congressional Black Caucus, represented before him. But some of Ocasio-Cortez's toughest loses came in Michigan, where Sanders defeated Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Two of her candidates went down in flames: progressive gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed came in second in his contest and House candidate Fayrouz Saad came in a disappointing fourth in her primary. Ocasio-Cortez stayed positive about the defeats She praised her candidates for running strong races El-Sayed was hoping to become the nation's first Muslim American governor. There are around 90 Muslim-Americans running for federal or statewide office this year. Ocasio-Cortez said the El-Sayed and Bush ran 'incredible first-time campaigns.' 'They built power and experience at home that can be used to build on. For them to be this competitive their 1st time running for office, while heavily outspent, is proof of their extraordinary talents,' she wrote on Twitter Wednesday afternoon. El-Sayed came in second to the frontrunner, state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer, who received key endorsements from labor groups and from EMILY's List, a political action committee that aims to elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates. In the contest for retiring Republican Rep. David Trott's seat, Clinton's Democratic firing power shown through over Ocasio-Cortez's rising star buzz. Ocasio-Cortez had endorsed Saad in that contest while Clinton endorsed and recorded a robo call for Haley Stevens, who won the Democratic nomination Tuesday night. Trott's seat is one Democrats want to win in November as part of their effort to gain the 23 seats the party needs to regain control of the House of Representatives. But another House candidate in Michigan, Rashida Tlaib, gave Ocasio-Cortez one of her two wins for the night. Tlaib — who was once kicked out of a luncheon for heckling President Donald Trump — won the Democratic nomination and, given that Republicans didn't field a candidate, she will be the first Muslim woman in Congress. She is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants and defeated five other candidates to win the nomination. Like Ocasio-Cortez, she belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America. House candidate Fayrouz Saad, backed by Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, came in a disappointing fourth in her primary Rashida Tlaib won her primary and was one of Ocasio-Cortez's two wins of the night The 13th district in Michigan is deep blue - as blue as New York's 14th, the district Ocasio-Cortez won in June, showing the power liberals have in heavily Democratic turf. A House candidate in Kansas gave Ocasio-Cortez her second victory. James Thompson won the Democratic nomination and will take on Republican Rep. Ron Estes in November. Thompson and Estes had battled it out in an April 2017 special election to replace Mike Pompeo, who left to be President Donald Trump's CIA director (he's now secretary of state). Estes won by six points. The tougher loss was likely candidate Brent Welder in Kansas City, a former Sanders 2016 campaign staffer who was fighting to unseat Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders held a rally in Kansas for their two House contenders last month. Welder came in second to Sharice Davids, who was endorsed by EMILY's List and would be the first openly lesbian Native American in Congress if elected in November. Brent Welder, a former Sanders campaign staffer, lost his contest Democratic Kansas congressional candidate James Thompson was endorsed by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; he won his contest Tuesday night Democrats are eying Yoder's seat as one of their top pickup opportunities this year. Clinton won Yoder's House district by one percent in 2016. But there are still primary contests to compete in. Ocasio-Cortez is backing Congressional candidate Kaniela Ing in Hawaii, which holds its primary contest on August 11.

News article:
Socialist star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez saw a majority of her primary candidates go down in flames in Tuesday night's contests, with four out of the six contenders she supported losing their bids to become the Democratic Party nominee in their respective races. Ocasio-Cortez, a self-proclaimed socialist Democrat who defeated Rep. Joe Crowley in a stunning primary upset in June, tried to leverage her new star power into helping other candidates follow her path to victory. And several of Tuesday's contests echoed the bitter 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, where establishment Democratic groups fought against liberal activists in a fight for the party's soul. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez backed six candidates in Tuesday's contests and only two one Michigan Gubernatorial Abdul El-Sayed was one of the tough losses of the night Ocasio-Cortez tried to help Missouri candidate Cori Bush repeat her feat in toppling an incumbent Bush failed in her contest Tuesday Ocasio-Cortez stayed positive about the defeats. 'Wins in the short-term are important milemarkers and necessary to building power. But you can't be afraid of loss. Fear keeps people from accomplishing great things,' she wrote on Twitter Wednesday afternoon. In Missouri, Ocasio-Cortez had backed candidate Cori Bush in her bid to do what she did earlier in the summer - topple a sitting member of Congress. But Bush, a pastor and civil rights activist, failed to bring down longtime Rep. William Lacy Clay. She lost by 20 points, earning 37 percent of the vote to Clay's 57 percent. The results could cause the remaining Democratic incumbents to breath a little easier as they head into their primary contests, given Clay's slam-dunk win. Clay has strong ties to the St. Louis House district, where he has been the congressman for two decades and that his father, who helped found the Congressional Black Caucus, represented before him. But some of Ocasio-Cortez's toughest loses came in Michigan, where Sanders defeated Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Two of her candidates went down in flames: progressive gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed came in second in his contest and House candidate Fayrouz Saad came in a disappointing fourth in her primary. Ocasio-Cortez stayed positive about the defeats She praised her candidates for running strong races El-Sayed was hoping to become the nation's first Muslim American governor. There are around 90 Muslim-Americans running for federal or statewide office this year. Ocasio-Cortez said the El-Sayed and Bush ran 'incredible first-time campaigns.' 'They built power and experience at home that can be used to build on. For them to be this competitive their 1st time running for office, while heavily outspent, is proof of their extraordinary talents,' she wrote on Twitter Wednesday afternoon. El-Sayed came in second to the frontrunner, state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer, who received key endorsements from labor groups and from EMILY's List, a political action committee that aims to elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates. In the contest for retiring Republican Rep. David Trott's seat, Clinton's Democratic firing power shown through over Ocasio-Cortez's rising star buzz. Ocasio-Cortez had endorsed Saad in that contest while Clinton endorsed and recorded a robo call for Haley Stevens, who won the Democratic nomination Tuesday night. Trott's seat is one Democrats want to win in November as part of their effort to gain the 23 seats the party needs to regain control of the House of Representatives. But another House candidate in Michigan, Rashida Tlaib, gave Ocasio-Cortez one of her two wins for the night. Tlaib — who was once kicked out of a luncheon for heckling President Donald Trump — won the Democratic nomination and, given that Republicans didn't field a candidate, she will be the first Muslim woman in Congress. She is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants and defeated five other candidates to win the nomination. Like Ocasio-Cortez, she belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America. House candidate Fayrouz Saad, backed by Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, came in a disappointing fourth in her primary Rashida Tlaib won her primary and was one of Ocasio-Cortez's two wins of the night The 13th district in Michigan is deep blue - as blue as New York's 14th, the district Ocasio-Cortez won in June, showing the power liberals have in heavily Democratic turf. A House candidate in Kansas gave Ocasio-Cortez her second victory. James Thompson won the Democratic nomination and will take on Republican Rep. Ron Estes in November. Thompson and Estes had battled it out in an April 2017 special election to replace Mike Pompeo, who left to be President Donald Trump's CIA director (he's now secretary of state). Estes won by six points. The tougher loss was likely candidate Brent Welder in Kansas City, a former Sanders 2016 campaign staffer who was fighting to unseat Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders held a rally in Kansas for their two House contenders last month. Welder came in second to Sharice Davids, who was endorsed by EMILY's List and would be the first openly lesbian Native American in Congress if elected in November. Brent Welder, a former Sanders campaign staffer, lost his contest Democratic Kansas congressional candidate James Thompson was endorsed by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; he won his contest Tuesday night Democrats are eying Yoder's seat as one of their top pickup opportunities this year. Clinton won Yoder's House district by one percent in 2016. But there are still primary contests to compete in. Ocasio-Cortez is backing Congressional candidate Kaniela Ing in Hawaii, which holds its primary contest on August 11.

News article:
Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro challenged Democratic House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to a debate on Wednesday and offered $10,000 for her campaign if she accepted the challenge. In a segment on “The Ben Shapiro Show,” he noted that Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has called Ocasio-Cortez “the future of the party.” “Miss Ocasio-Cortez, I’m really excited that you’ve been elevated to that position and I would love to have a real conversation with you about the issues,” Shapiro said. “You’ve noted that you think Republicans are afraid to debate you or talk to you or discuss the issues with you. Not only am I eager to discuss the issues with you, I’m willing to offer $10,000 to your campaign today for you to come on our Sunday special,” he continued. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, a former staffer on Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) 2016 presidential campaign, shocked the political world by upsetting 10-term Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley in the primary for New York’s 14th Congressional District. Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, ran on a platform that includes “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public college education. Shapiro’s offer came after Ocasio-Cortez appeared for an interview on “Pod Save America,” a podcast hosted by former Obama administration staffers. Shapiro, who has become a leading voice for conservative millennials, offered Ocasio-Cortez one hour for a debate to discuss “all the topics under the sun” in an effort to probe “her belief system.” “I would love to debate her because I have one question for her,” Shapiro continued later. “Name an industry you would not nationalize; which ones should the government not run and why? Alright, can she name any of them?” Shapiro also offered to donate the money to charity instead of the campaign. “So let’s make this happen! Let’s make America a more civil and interesting place. Let’s do this thing,” he concluded. Ocasio-Cortez has not responded to Shapiro’s offer as of Thursday morning.

News article:
Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – the New York congressional candidate many in the media have fallen in love with – was handed rejection when many of the candidates she endorsed lost in Tuesday’s elections. But her radical and totally impractical ideas continue to pose a threat. The 28-year-old candidate advocates for guaranteed federal jobs, free college for all, Medicare for all, and the abolishment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. She’d like to turn Uncle Sam into Santa Claus, handing out freebies 365 days a year – all paid for by crushing taxes on all of us, a skyrocketing national debt or … hey, whatever. The surprising primary victory that turned this grossly unqualified and woefully uninformed young woman into a candidate likely to be elected to Congress in a heavily Democratic district shows that the real battleground this election cycle is in the classroom. If we continue to laugh off Ocasio-Cortez as an ignorant and delusional radical, we will be blindsided by the soon-to-be largest voting bloc in America – a generation of indoctrinated millennials. As a fellow millennial, I know firsthand that Ocasio-Cortez’s college experience probably taught her that being a socialist absolves her of knowing much at all. All she needs to know is that anyone who opposes her is evil. And she needs to memorize a few bumper sticker slogans about the cruel and greedy 1 percent who aren't “paying their fair share.” Ocasio-Cortez is among the majority of millennials who now say they would prefer to live in a socialist or communist country over a capitalist one. That’s a troubling revelation to older generations. But can young people be blamed for having no memory of the widespread failures of socialism and communism if we never learned about them? Each year, more and more schools are doing away with basic economics and history courses and replacing them with anti-American, progressive propaganda. A survey by U.S. News & World Report found that 53 out of the 76 “best” colleges and universities in America no longer require history majors to take a single course on U.S. history. Meanwhile, the Communist Manifesto is among the three most frequently assigned readings at American universities and Karl Marx is the most studied economist. Never mind that his economic ideas make about as much sense as the economic theories of Groucho Marx. Campuses across the country are creating a breeding ground for an entire generation of socialist-embracing voters. The University of Massachusetts currently offers a course on “resistance” to capitalism. California State University recently held a “teach-in” charging that America was "built on a racist capitalist system, meant to weaken the minority." At Ocasio-Cortez’s alma mater, Boston University, only three out of the 49 outside speakers invited to the campus last year were identifiably conservative. This is the same school that hosted a panel on the premise that Israel and America are “fascist states.” It's almost as if Ocasio-Cortez used those panel notes to prepare for her cringe-worthy “Firing Line” interview , where she slammed Israel as an oppressor and then backtracked in embarrassment when asked to elaborate. "I’m not the expert on geopolitics on this issue," admitted the recent college graduate. No argument on that point. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez is “not the expert” on most of the issues she will have to deal with when she likely becomes a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in January. But did anyone expect her to be? Today’s college students spend an average of just under three hours a day on education-related activities. They are learning significantly less than college students did years ago, and the little that they do learn is taught through a progressive lens that often gives them a warped perspective of reality. They learn how to memorize talking points and slogans – but if you ask them to dive in and explain what they’re saying they can’t, because there’s no substance. So long as they are virtuously fighting the hateful and the cruel, their grades remain high and they are never challenged to explain the validity of their opinions. As a result, we see an entire generation quick to adopt socialism, but slow to define what it is or what it looks like throughout history. They’re simply clueless. “I think my strength is I’m honest and authentic,” Ocasio-Cortez told “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah. To understand the mind of a millennial is to understand that he or she believes virtues like these absolve you from needing to possess any real knowledge. This is why we see radical ideas that fall apart on close examination becoming mainstream. The problem is that the millennials never give socialism a close examination. Universities have been held unaccountable for far too long and their agenda is now coming to fruition on a national platform. In 2016, a Cornell University history professor was filmed telling students that “capitalism is an anti-human system,” and then urging them to build a grassroots movement to “defeat capitalism altogether because it’s not going to happen at the ballot box.” Fast-forward two years to Ocasio-Cortez’s upset primary victory over 10-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in New York and you find that it is in fact happening at the ballot box. This should be a wake-up call for Americans to stop writing off millennials as a hopeless generation of bleeding-heart Bernie-lovers. With a continuation of far-far left indoctrination in our schools and colleges, the American Dream might be replaced by a nightmare. Crazy as it sounds, some people are even talking about Ocasio-Cortez running for president someday. Will America put her in the White House with the slogan “Make America Socialist?” If the majority of millennials truly embrace socialism, candidates like Ocasio-Cortez are only one successful voter registration drive away from getting elected to our highest offices. And if that happens, we and future generations will get to experience the nightmare of economic failure and lack of freedom that the citizens of Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, the Soviet Union, East Germany and other socialist and communist states have suffered through.

News article:
New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has excited the liberal base with her media blitz touting Medicare-for-all, the elimination of ICE and more. But the Democrat's rapid-fire claims about the state of the economy and other issues have fact-checkers scrambling to provide a reality check. The Washington Post was the latest to put her myriad claims under the microscope. The newspaper took issue, for instance, with her claim that unemployment is low “because everyone has two jobs.” The Post shot this down, noting the number of people working two jobs is down from the recession -- and has remained steady at around 5 percent in recent years. Other claims it summarily dismissed include a May 30 interview statement that ICE is “required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night.” Both the Post and Politifact note that this is an “urban legend” and that ICE was only required to maintain that many beds -- not fill them. Additionally, the Post called her out for saying a recent study found Medicare-for-all would cut health expenditures, when it found the plan would raise government expenditures by $32.6 trillion over 10 years. A separate fact check by The Associated Press aimed at this claim, made by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., notes it only cuts spending if hospitals accept Medicare-based payments of 40 percent less for those who have private insurance. Some claims didn’t warrant a check, including one appearance on CNN where she asked, “Why aren’t we incorporating the cost of all the funeral expenses of those who died because they can’t afford access to health care?” “Huh?” was the only response from the Post’s fact-checkers. Ocasio-Cortez has been on the interview circuit ever since her shock primary victory over Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y. But the 28-year-old swiftly encountered some difficulties, starting with her interview with PBS’ “Firing Line,” in which she went in hot on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and talked about the “occupation of Palestine.” Asked to “expand” on her thoughts, she said, “I am not the expert at geopolitics on this issue.” OCASIO-CORTEZ STARTS CONTROVERSY WITH COMMENTS ON ISRAELI 'OCCUPATION,' ADMITS SHE'S 'NOT THE EXPERT' Less than two weeks later, in an appearance on “The Daily Show,” the candidate made a number of questionable statements on how she would pay for her big spending agenda. "Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for,” she said. “They were like, ‘we don’t want another fighter jet. Don’t give us another nuclear bomb.’ They didn’t even ask for it. And we gave it to them." This caught the eye of Politfact, which gave her a “false” rating, noting that the $700 billion tag was the total defense budget for 2018, not the increase, and that the amount was “more than the Defense Department settled in negotiations for Trump’s budget request ($668 billion), but exactly what they requested in their annual wishlist to Congress.” Ocasio-Cortez has been pushing back against the critics. Last week, she appeared to make fun of fact-checkers criticizing her for what she called a “small slip on a budgetary figure during [an] extemporaneous interview.” “This girl is SO uninformed! She needs to stay quiet until she knows everything!” she tweeted, while claiming they shrugged off GOP Sen. James Inhofe’s 2015 decision to bring a snowball to the Senate floor in a debate about climate change -- a move that was mocked by a number of outlets at the time, including The Washington Post. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has pledged to do everything possible to secure the release of a charity worker jailed in Iran, after talks with her husband. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 after being accused of spying. Mr Hunt met the British-Iranian woman’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, on Thursday to discuss the “shocking and desperate” situation. Good to meet Richard Ratcliffe and his family yesterday. It’s a shocking and desperate situation and they are showing extraordinary strength and resilience, as is Nazanin. We will do everything we can to bring her home. pic.twitter.com/tPTfg6SZFL — Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) August 3, 2018 He said: “Good to meet Richard Ratcliffe and his family yesterday. “It’s a shocking and desperate situation and they are showing extraordinary strength and resilience, as is Nazanin. We will do everything we can to bring her home.” Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson faced criticism over his handling of attempts to free the mother-of-one. In April, Mr Ratcliffe spoke of his disappointment at Mr Johnson’s failure to secure his wife’s release. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and their daughter, Gabriella (PA) The former Cabinet minister faced a backlash for telling a parliamentary committee that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to train journalists, which he later acknowledged was not the case. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, is facing a further hearing over an unspecified security charge which her family believes will include an accusation of spreading propaganda against Tehran’s Islamist regime. She has consistently denied all allegations, insisting she was on holiday to introduce her daughter to her family. Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s director, said: “The Foreign Secretary’s pledge over trying to secure Nazanin’s release is very welcome, as is the fact he’s had a face-to-face meeting with Richard relatively early into his new job. “We’d now like to see the UK Government at all levels pushing hard for Nazanin’s release. “This has gone on far too long. Nazanin is a prisoner of conscience who should never have been jailed in the first place. She should be freed and allowed to travel back to the UK with her young daughter Gabriella.”

News article:
Tokyo (AFP) - The wife of a Japanese journalist kidnapped in Syria more than three years ago broke her silence Tuesday to plead for his release after he appeared in a hostage video. Jumpei Yasuda, a 44-year-old freelancer, was kidnapped in the war-torn country in June 2015, and appeared in a rare video that emerged last week warning that he was in a bad situation. "There are a lot of people in Japan -- his family, relatives, friends -- waiting for my husband," his wife Myu told a news conference in Tokyo. "Please return my husband safe as soon as possible," she said tearfully. "As his wife, as his family, I want him... to set foot back on Japanese soil." Last week Yasuda and captured Italian national Alessandro Sandrini appeared in two separate videos that were similar in their staging. Both men were wearing orange outfits similar to those of captives in jihadist hostage videos, with armed men whose faces were covered standing behind them. The videos did not identify which group was holding the men or include specific demands. Myu, who married Yasuda in 2008, said she had previously avoided speaking publicly about his abduction for fear she could affect negotiations for his release. But she said when she watched the video, she felt her husband's situation was "not optimistic but urgent" and decided to publicly seek his release. The video also prompted some of the journalist's friends and family to form a group to free him, campaigning to boost public awareness of the abduction. Yasuda is thought to have been seized by the group previously known as the Al-Nusra Front, a former Al-Qaeda affiliate, in northern Syria. But with the shifting territory of Syria's complicated conflict, it is unclear whether he is still being held by his original abductors or has been transferred to other captors. In the latest video, he identified himself as Korean and gave a different name, but spoke in Japanese. Story continues He gave the recording date as July 25, saying he was in a bad situation and asking for help. His wife said she had no idea why Yasuda had identified himself as Korean in the video, but confirmed that it showed him and that he is Japanese. She said Japanese government officials were in frequent contact with her but she was not aware if a ransom had been demanded. In 2015 militants from the Islamic State group beheaded Japanese war correspondent Kenji Goto and his friend Haruna Yukawa in Syria. The Japanese government was criticised for what detractors saw as its flat-footed response to the crisis at the time, including apparently missed opportunities to free both men.

News article:
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer The Iranian Regime has sentenced every member of a church to a year in prison for practising Christianity, according to an organization that supports Iranian Christians. Article 18 tweeted on Thursday: “A Christian couple have reported that a court in Boushehr has just sentenced them and ten other Iranian Christians to one year in prison each for ‘Propagating against the Islamic Republic in favour of Christianity.’ This group of Christian converts was arrested on April 7, 2015.” Mohabat News, a Christian website, reported last week that the Iranian Christian couple was charged with “orientation toward the land of Christianity”, while Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern, confirmed on Friday that each member of the congregation was also sentenced to a year in prison. King said: “Getting information on the arrests of Christians is incredibly challenging given the heavily censored nature of Iran. But based on the cases we have been tracking, this is the first time this year that we’ve seen a jail sentence being given based on the charge of ‘inclination to the land of Christianity.’ This could be interpreted as a reference to Israel, the birthplace of Christianity and also a country that Iran has adopted a very aggressive stance towards.” Iran does legally recognise Christianity as a religion, but according to the US State Department’s 2017 report on International Religious Freedom in Iran, this does not include Christians who convert from Islam. In fact, the report notes that the Iranian penal code allows the death sentence for any non-Muslims who attempt to convert Muslims, anyone who creates hostility against God, and anyone who insults the prophet. These are intentionally vague charges that are used against anyone who questions the Regime and often against political prisoners. The report also advises that the Iranian Regime has a long history of continuing to harass, intimidate, and arrest religious minorities in the country. Open Doors USA reports that Iran is home to 800,000 Christians; a number significantly underreported by the Iranian Regime, who wish to marginalise its Christians even more. The organisation lists Iran as the 10th worst country in the world to be a Christian. This is just one more example of the kinds of human rights abuses perpetrated by the Iranian Regime. People should be free to worship how they wish, with no intrusion from the Regime and certainly no prison sentences (or worse). This is just one more reason why the people of Iran are rising up against the regime, demanding change.

A British-Iranian charity worker detained in an Iranian prison on espionage charges since 2016 has been temporarily released, Iran's ambassador in London said. "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been granted a three-day release from prison in Iran to reunite with her family," Hamid Baeidinejad said on Twitter. "She immediately joined her 4-year-old daughter, Gabriella, who welcomed her mom with flowers." The temporary release was intended to allow her to see her family, particularly her daughter, the ambassador said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to jail for five years in 2016. Her husband told Britain's Press Association (PA) news agency that her lawyer was hopeful for an extension to the three-day release. "This was a very happy surprise after a number of false dawns recently, which had been increasingly unsettling," PA quoted her husband as saying. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also confirmed her release in a tweet, praising the "tireless campaigning" of her husband and friends. "But being in prison AT ALL is gross injustice and she must be PERMANENTLY released for which every effort will continue," he said. The British arm of Amnesty International also celebrated her temporary release as an "amazing news." "We must keep up the pressure on Iran by demanding her freedom," a tweet by the rights watchdog read. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, along with her 22-month-old daughter, was arrested in April 2016 by the Iranian security forces in Tehran and charged with conspiring to overthrow the regime by running a programme to train journalists in Iran. Zaghari-Ratcliffe denies the charges. A gaffe by Hunt's predecessor, Boris Johnson, in the British parliament in September led Iranian authorities to claim he had confirmed that Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who was on holiday in Iran to introduce her baby daughter to her parents - had trained journalists while in the country. Johnson later travelled to Tehran to try and repair the damage, but was unsuccessful in securing her release. Her now 4-year-old daughter lives with her grandparents in Iran, while her husband has been barred from entering the country. Her jail term became a cause of diplomatic tensions between Britain and Iran.

News article:
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, pictured with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella, has been in an Iranian prison for more than two years Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman who has been in prison in Tehran for more than two years following a conviction for sedition, was freed for three days on Thursday. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with members of her family including her young daughter outside the Iranian capital after her surprise release. "Nazanin was released from Evin prison on furlough this morning. Initially the release is for three days -- her lawyer is hopeful this can be extended," her husband Richard Ratcliffe said in a statement. Ratcliffe said his wife, who has denied all charges filed against her in Iran, was currently with her parents and their four-year-old daughter Gabriella in Damavand, a mountain resort near Tehran. "I cried so much. I felt so overwhelmed," she said of the reunion, according to a statement released by The Free Nazanin campaign, which is run by her husband. Her husband voiced thanks to those in Tehran and London involved in making the release happen, including Britain's new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. "This was a very happy surprise after a number of false dawns recently, which had been increasingly unsettling," her husband said. Hunt, who met Ratcliffe in London earlier this month after he was appointed as Britain's top diplomat in July, called her temporary release "really good news" and paid tribute to the "tireless campaigning by husband Richard and her friends". "But being in prison AT ALL is gross injustice and she must be PERMANENTLY released for which every effort will continue," he wrote on Twitter. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation -- the media organisation's philanthropic arm -- was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016. She is serving a five-year jail sentence for sedition -- a charge she has always contested. Hunt's predecessor Boris Johnson came under heavy criticism after appearing to jeopardise her defence last year by saying she was training journalists during her visit -- something her employer and family strongly deny. Johnson later clarified his remarks, saying it was clear that she was only on holiday. Campaigners have staged protests to demand the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe Ratcliffe and his supporters have held multiple protests and vigils in London to seek her release, attracting celebrity support from the likes of Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson. - 'Had to borrow a phone' - The Free Nazanin campaign said she was told on Thursday she had just 10 minutes to get ready because she was being released. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not allowed to call her family and had to borrow a phone from someone outside the prison to call her brother, who lives in Tehran, to pick her up. She then called her husband and the British embassy and travelled to join the rest of her Iranian family, including her grandmother and daughter, in Damavand. "I wasn't expecting it at all when it was mentioned two weeks ago," she was quoted as saying by the campaign. "I didn't tell Gabriella or for a long time my mum -- so if it didn't happen I would be the only one to suffer." Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told she must return to prison on Sunday and the two conditions of her release are that she not give any media interviews or visit the grounds of any foreign embassy. Bail for her temporary release was set at one billion rials ($23,800, 20,600 euros), with her family's home in Tehran used as collateral, the campaign said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's lawyers will on Saturday ask the authorities to extend her furlough, it added. "Nazanin has a number of cellmates who were released initially for three days, but who are still on furlough over a month later," the campaign statement said.

London (AFP) - Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed in Tehran for more than two years on sedition charges, was taken to the prison clinic after blacking out on Wednesday, her husband said. Richard Ratcliffe said she had suffered a series of panic attacks and Iranian authorities were considering requests for her to go to hospital. "Nazanin had a panic attack today and yesterday, and passed out today," he told AFP in an email. "She was at the prison clinic, and there are various requests for her to be hospitalised, but this has not yet been approved." Zaghari-Ratcliffe was unexpectedly released for a three-day furlough on Thursday, and was reunited with members of her family outside the Iranian capital. She was returned to prison on Sunday after the temporary release ended. "She had the panic attack, got taken down to the clinic and they said... she had very low blood pressure," her husband added to Britain's Press Association. "I think it feels like the physical symptoms of crushing disappointment since she went back into prison." The family had hoped that the furlough would be extended. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation -- the media organisation's philanthropic arm -- was arrested at Tehran airport on April 3, 2016. She is serving a five-year jail sentence for alleged sedition. She has denied all charges filed against her.

News article:
During his first press conference as foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi stated that our foreign policy will be based on a ‘Pakistan first’ approach. In light of this statement, he directed all Pakistani missions to “treat our overseas Pakistanis with respect [as] this is the duty of all our embassies abroad”. A ‘Pakistan first’ approach should also involve putting overseas Pakistanis first. They have long been neglected by our corridors of power when it comes to protecting their rights. This is why there are more Pakistani prisoners in foreign jails than Indian inmates. According to some estimates, Pakistan has 9,364 prisoners abroad as compared with India’s 7,737 inmates in foreign prisons. From 2015 to 2017, there have been six reported cases of Pakistani citizens being executed in Iran on drug charges. However, official figures for the number of Pakistanis on death row in Iran are unknown. There is no better occasion to gauge the sincerity and seriousness of our foreign minister’s ‘Pakistan first’ claim than during Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s visit to the country between August 30 and August 31. During this official visit, the plight of Pakistani prisoners in Iran should be addressed. This visit is especially important for the new administration and the determined foreign minister to prove that Pakistan will not only continue and strengthen its bond with Iran, but also cement its ‘Pakistan first’ approach. One way to accomplish this goal is to aid the most vulnerable overseas Pakistanis in Iran. Pakistanis on death row are specifically eligible for a reduction in their sentences under Iran’s newly-amended anti-narcotics law. In 2017, the anti-drugs law in Iran was amended to apply retroactively to prisoners on death row and sought to replace the death penalty with prison sentences (of around 30 years) and fines. The amended anti-narcotics law has reduced the minimum possession of drugs – which includes their production or distribution – that results in a death sentence from 30 grammes to two kilogrammes for industrial narcotics, and from five kg to 50 kg for traditional drugs. This marks a major step forward as previous amendments that were made in 2007 and 2011 had increased the severity of sanctions for drug offences and broadened the death penalty. As of July 6, 2018, Iran’s courts received 3,000 requests for review. They have reviewed 1,700 requests, with 1,300 others pending review. Iran has one of the highest incarceration rates for drug offences. Prior to the 2017 amendment to the anti-narcotics law, the country had the second highest rate of drug-related executions in the world such that around 70 percent of all death sentences in the country were for drug-related offences. The amendments to the anti-narcotics law could potentially save more than 4,700 lives of the 5,300 inmates on death row for drug offences. For the first time over the past eight years, drug offences didn’t account for the majority of executions in 2017. Between January 1, 2018 and May 20, 2018, Iran has executed at least 77 people, of which one person was executed for a drug-related offence. During the same period in 2017, at least 203 people were executed, of which 112 were executed for drug offences. This proves that the new amendments will substantially decrease the death row population that was previously convicted in narcotics cases. It also shows that the justice system in Iran is implementing the new changes efficiently. The benefits of this amendment should be extended to the Pakistanis who are on death row in Iran. There are currently over 189 Pakistanis imprisoned in Iran and a significant majority of them are part of the 5,300 prisoners on death row in Iran for drug-related crimes. The desire to implement the amended anti-drug law is a sign that Iran might be willing to treat Pakistanis sentenced to death in a more humane manner. We can no longer refuse to help Pakistanis on death row in Iran by using the excuse that these matters fall under a foreign law and jurisdiction. Aiding those on death row in Iran has now become simpler and the Foreign Office needs to help Pakistanis in Iran’s jails by providing legal counsel in this regard. The process of reviewing punishments isn’t automatic and has to be applied for – a hurdle that our Foreign Office can overcome. However, the opportune moment of the Iranian foreign minister’s visit can be used to make matters easier for Pakistanis on death row in Iran.

News article:
During his first press conference as foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi stated that our foreign policy will be based on a ‘Pakistan first’ approach. In light of this statement, he directed all Pakistani missions to “treat our overseas Pakistanis with respect [as] this is the duty of all our embassies abroad”. A ‘Pakistan first’ approach should also involve putting overseas Pakistanis first. They have long been neglected by our corridors of power when it comes to protecting their rights. This is why there are more Pakistani prisoners in foreign jails than Indian inmates. According to some estimates, Pakistan has 9,364 prisoners abroad as compared with India’s 7,737 inmates in foreign prisons. From 2015 to 2017, there have been six reported cases of Pakistani citizens being executed in Iran on drug charges. However, official figures for the number of Pakistanis on death row in Iran are unknown. There is no better occasion to gauge the sincerity and seriousness of our foreign minister’s ‘Pakistan first’ claim than during Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s visit to the country between August 30 and August 31. During this official visit, the plight of Pakistani prisoners in Iran should be addressed. This visit is especially important for the new administration and the determined foreign minister to prove that Pakistan will not only continue and strengthen its bond with Iran, but also cement its ‘Pakistan first’ approach. One way to accomplish this goal is to aid the most vulnerable overseas Pakistanis in Iran. Pakistanis on death row are specifically eligible for a reduction in their sentences under Iran’s newly-amended anti-narcotics law. In 2017, the anti-drugs law in Iran was amended to apply retroactively to prisoners on death row and sought to replace the death penalty with prison sentences (of around 30 years) and fines. The amended anti-narcotics law has reduced the minimum possession of drugs – which includes their production or distribution – that results in a death sentence from 30 grammes to two kilogrammes for industrial narcotics, and from five kg to 50 kg for traditional drugs. This marks a major step forward as previous amendments that were made in 2007 and 2011 had increased the severity of sanctions for drug offences and broadened the death penalty. As of July 6, 2018, Iran’s courts received 3,000 requests for review. They have reviewed 1,700 requests, with 1,300 others pending review. Iran has one of the highest incarceration rates for drug offences. Prior to the 2017 amendment to the anti-narcotics law, the country had the second highest rate of drug-related executions in the world such that around 70 percent of all death sentences in the country were for drug-related offences. The amendments to the anti-narcotics law could potentially save more than 4,700 lives of the 5,300 inmates on death row for drug offences. For the first time over the past eight years, drug offences didn’t account for the majority of executions in 2017. Between January 1, 2018 and May 20, 2018, Iran has executed at least 77 people, of which one person was executed for a drug-related offence. During the same period in 2017, at least 203 people were executed, of which 112 were executed for drug offences. This proves that the new amendments will substantially decrease the death row population that was previously convicted in narcotics cases. It also shows that the justice system in Iran is implementing the new changes efficiently. The benefits of this amendment should be extended to the Pakistanis who are on death row in Iran. There are currently over 189 Pakistanis imprisoned in Iran and a significant majority of them are part of the 5,300 prisoners on death row in Iran for drug-related crimes. The desire to implement the amended anti-drug law is a sign that Iran might be willing to treat Pakistanis sentenced to death in a more humane manner. We can no longer refuse to help Pakistanis on death row in Iran by using the excuse that these matters fall under a foreign law and jurisdiction. Aiding those on death row in Iran has now become simpler and the Foreign Office needs to help Pakistanis in Iran’s jails by providing legal counsel in this regard. The process of reviewing punishments isn’t automatic and has to be applied for – a hurdle that our Foreign Office can overcome. However, the opportune moment of the Iranian foreign minister’s visit can be used to make matters easier for Pakistanis on death row in Iran. Both states could agree to conduct a review of all Pakistani prisoners in Iran to determine their eligibility for the amended law and the benefits extended to them. Trips by foreign ministers are mostly reported in newspapers and aired on TV channels through images of handshakes between dignitaries in a room filled with members of the press. After that, these trips are forgotten. If this policy is implemented, this particular visit will have a monumental impact and will be forever etched on the history of both nations.

News article:
Alistair Burt (file pic) will discuss the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, days after she was taken away from her four-year-old daughter Gabriella and sent back to jail after a brief spell on temporary release A Foreign Office Minister is today flying out to Tehran to hold talks with Iranian officials about the 'cruel' imprisonment of a British mother. Alistair Burt will discuss the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, days after she was taken away from her four-year-old daughter Gabriella and sent back to jail after a brief spell on temporary release. The charity worker was rushed to hospital with a panic attack after being separated from her young daughter. She has been languishing in prison since April 2016 when she was arrested for plotting to overthrow the Iranian Government - accusations she strongly denies. Mr Burt said he is determined to 'push for the resolution we all want to see in the cases of the British dual nationals detained in Iran' - such as Mrs Zaghari Ratcliffe. Mrs Zaghari Ratcliffe's husband Richard told MailOnline he has urged the minster to demand answers from Iran over why his wife was released last week but then suddenly sent back to her cell. He said: 'This felt like a cruel power game.' Mrs Zaghari Ratcliffe, a charity worker, from Hampstead, north London, suffered a panic attack and passed out after being sent back inside. What is the timeline of events in the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case? April 2016: Arrested by the Revolutionary Guard in Tehran Airport after visiting her parents in Iran with her young daughter Gabriella. She was taken to prison and held in solitary confinement for 45 days before being moved to a women's wing. The mother-of-one was not given access to legal counsel or medical treatment, and the lights in her cell remained permanently switched on. As a result,Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe experienced problems walking, weight loss, and hair loss. September 2016: She was sentenced to five years in prison for spying following a trial campaigners have branded 'secret and unfair'. April 2017: Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe lost her appeal to overturn her sentence. November 2017: She is hit with fresh charges of spreading propaganda just days after Boris Johnson told British MPs she has been training journalists in Iran. August 2018: She is temporarily released so she can spend time with her young daughter Gabriella, but is quickly sent back to prison where she suffers a panic attack. March 2020: Released on house arrest after Covid-19 started sweeping through Iran. March 2021: Released from house arrest at the end of her sentence but banned from leaving the country. April 2021: She is sentenced to a new term in jail on charges of propaganda against Iran's ruling system, charges she denies. March 2022: She remains stuck in Iran, banned from leaving the country. Her second sentence has not yet begun. Reports emerge Britain may have paid the £400million debt tied to Zaghari-Ratcliffe's detention in order to secure her release. Her lawyer says he is 'hopeful' for good news of her release 'in the next few days'. Advertisement It came after heart-breaking images of the mother hugging her young daughter during her brief release were published. Gabriella burst into tears when she was told her mother was returning to prison. Mr Burt will also hold high-level talks with Iran on the nuclear deal, which faces collapse after Donald Trump pulled America out of it. And he will try to pile pressure on the country to stop meddling in the Middle East amid warnings the country is destabilising the region by backing militia groups in Syria. He said: 'This is a crucial moment for Iran's relationship with the UK, and the wider world. 'Since the US withdrew from the nuclear deal we, along with European and international partners, have reiterated our support for the deal and have underscored this support through mechanisms such as EU blocking legislation. 'As long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal, we remain committed to it as we believe it is the best way to ensure a safe, secure future for the region. 'Our support for the nuclear deal, though, does not prevent us strongly challenging Iran on issues where we disagree. 'During my visit this week I will stress that Iran's ballistic missile programme and its destabilising activities in the Middle East must be addressed. 'I will also use the opportunity of my visit to push for the resolution we all want to see in the cases of the British dual nationals detained in Iran.' Mrs Zaghari Ratcliffe was seized by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in Tehran Airport in April 2016 after visiting her parents in Iran with her young daughter Gabriella. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe (pictured with her daughter Gabriella), who is British-Iranian, was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 after being accused of spying by Tehran’s Islamist regime She was imprisoned for spying against the regime on charges she and her family have dismissed as trumped up and without proof. Her husband Richard has battled to try to get her freed, but the case suffered an embarrassing set-back in November 2017 when then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson incorrectly told British MPs that she had been in Iran training journalists. His comments were seized upon by hardliners in the Iranian regime who used them to hit her with fresh charges.

Prominent director Maryam Kazemi and venue manager Saeed Asadi were detained on Sunday on the orders of the judiciary, said Shahram Karami of the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance, according to the semi-official news agency ISNA. Advertisement Karami, who heads the ministry’s performing arts department, said the “type of music played” and the actors’ “movements” were the main problem with the trailer, which was widely shared on social media. Men and women are banned from dancing together in Iran. Kazemi and Asadi were ordered to post bail of three billion rials (roughly $23,000 at the current unofficial rate) each, and were due to be released from detention on Tuesday, according to state news agency IRNA. The play had already been showing for seven nights at City Theatre, one of Tehran’s most famous venues, and only had one night left to run when the pair were arrested. “The issue was with the trailer they released and not the play’s content,” Karami added.

News article:
The UN Working Group concluded that the Iranian Regime had “no legal basis for the arrest and detention” of Xiyue Wang and that the Regime had violated his right to a fair trial, in an opinion (Number 52/2018) adopted on August 23. Their report read: “The Working Group requests the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr. Wang without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms…. [T]he appropriate remedy would be to release Mr. Wang immediately.” These findings were in response to a petition filed earlier this year by Wang’s wife, Hua Qu, and his mother. Wang, a naturalized US citizen, had travelled to Iran, with the full knowledge and permission of the Iranian Regime, to study Farsi and do research on documents dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, held in Iran’s National Archives for his doctoral dissertation. He was arrested in August 2016 and imprisoned in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison, where many political prisoners are held, before being wrongfully convicted of espionage and sentenced to 10 years in prison during a closed trial. The Working Group said that Wang was not spying, citing Iran’s intentionally vague and broad espionage laws, but conducting historical research for academic purposes, which posed no threat to the Iranian Regime. In fact, Wang was arrested as part of a campaign by the Regime to arrest and hold hostage foreign nationals. They said that Wang should not have been put on trial at all, let alone one that did not meet standards for impartiality and independence. The Working Group assessed a response from the Iranian Regime about Wang’s imprisonment and said that it “did not explain … how Mr. Wang had cooperated with a foreign state … against the Islamic Republic of Iran, nor how accessing historical archives relating to a period of governance over 100 years ago could amount to an attempt to overthrow the Iranian Government”. The Working Group said: “There are several facts that lead the Working Group to conclude that Mr. Wang’s detention was motivated by the fact that he is a United States citizen.” Princeton Vice President and Secretary Robert K. Durkee said: “Xiyue Wang has been unjustly imprisoned and separated from his wife and young child for more than two years. The Working Group makes it clear that Wang was in Iran solely to do scholarly work, and that the charges against him were entirely without merit. We hope these findings by the Working Group and its call for his immediate release will, in fact, expedite his release so he can return to his family and come back to campus to complete his Ph.D.”

Iran environment head seeks answers on detained activists Bourse and Bazaar | AFP – Iran’s vice-president in charge of environmental affairs has called for an explanation on the fate of more than a dozen activists arrested this year, state news agency IRNA reported Sunday. “We are not asking for their release or for their execution, we just want their fate to be clarified. This is part of their citizenship rights,” Isa Kalantari, who heads Iran’s environment department, told IRNA. “This was supposed to have happened by the end of this summer but their trial hasn’t even started yet,” he added. Iran has arrested at least a dozen environmental activists since January on charges of spying for foreign intelligence agencies, but few details have been released. One of them, Kavous Seyed Emami, a 63-year-old professor and renowned environmentalist, allegedly committed suicide in prison in February, a fortnight after his arrest. The judiciary has prepared indictments against five of the detainees, according to state media, but a court date has yet to be set. “We have cited the intelligence minister that these activists are not spies, and that the ministry is the sole official authority on whether someone is a spy,” Kalantari said. In May, Mahmoud Sadeghi, a reformist member of parliament, also tweeted that the intelligence ministry had not found any proof that the environmentalists were spies. Iran’s judiciary, however, considers itself as the only authority on settling the question of spying and has warned other bodies not to interfere.

(Adds background, details) GENEVA, Sept 12 (Reuters) - A Iranian former vice president was sentenced to six and a half years in prison on Wednesday for threatening national security and other charges, the Tasnim news agency reported. Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie was sentenced to five years for threatening national security, one year for spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic and six months for insulting judiciary officials, according to Tasnim. Rahim Mashaie has long been a lightning rod for criticism from Iran's hardliners, in part because of a 2008 comment that the Islamic Republic is friendly with the people of its sworn foe Israel. When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appointed Rahim Mashaie as his vice president in 2009, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, objected. Ahmadinejad then appointed Rahim Mashaie, whose daughter is married to Ahmadinejad's son, as chief of staff. A top press aide to Ahmadinejad, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, also received a sentence of four years for threatening national security as part of the same case, Tasnim reported. Tasnim did not provide any further details on the cases involving the aides to Ahmadinejad, who was president from 2005 until 2013, or when the offences they were convicted of occurred. Rahim Mashaie was arrested in March and Javanfekr in August, the Iranian Students' News Agency reported Rahim Mashaei faces further charges, Gholamhossein Esmaili, the head of the justice department in Tehran province said Wednesday, according to Tasnim, without giving further details.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Iran posed a "formidable" threat to Europe, accusing its proxy Hizbullah of operating cells across the continent. Just last month, a member of the Lebanese group was jailed in Cyprus for plotting attacks on Israeli targets on the Mediterranean island. Netanyahu, on an official visit to Nicosia, said "Iran and Hizbullah organize a terrorist network that covers over 30 countries on five continents, including just about every country in Europe." Iran and leading world powers signed a deal this month on Tehran's controversial nuclear program, an accord the Israeli leader criticized as a "stunning, historic mistake". Netanyahu said Israel and Cyprus were faced with the dual dangers of Iran and the extremist attacks perpetrated by the Islamic State group, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria. "ISIS obviously endangers European societies, Western societies, African societies, the whole world," the premier said, using an alternative acronym for IS. "These are two formidable dangers. They are expressed in many weapons, in many attacks, but the most prevalent one that concerns Cyprus and Europe is of course the terrorism that emanates from these areas," he added. Last month, a Cypriot court jailed a Lebanese-Canadian man for six years after he pleaded guilty to terror charges linked to 8.2 tonnes of potential bomb-making material found in his home. Authorities said the man was a member of the military wing of Hizbullah and had helped the group plan "terrorist attacks" on "Israeli interests in Cyprus". Cyprus is not known for its militant activity despite its proximity to the Middle East. But in 2013, a Cypriot court sentenced a Lebanon-born Swedish man who admitted he was a Hizbullah member, to four years in jail after he was found guilty of targeting Israelis on the island. A botched bomb attack on the Israeli embassy in 1988 claimed the lives of three people. Israel has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal and insists it is not bound to respect Tehran's accord with the West. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said he and Netanyahu had discussed the accord, adding that Cyprus expressed "hope that this deal will help generate stability... and assist in addressing the security concerns of the State of Israel". Tuesday's talks also focused on security, defense and the exploration of oil and gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, according to Anastasiades. The Aphrodite field, discovered off Cyprus' southeast coast in 2011, is estimated to contain between 3.6 trillion and 6 trillion cubic feet (102 billion-170 billion cubic meters) of gas. Israel has found large reserves off its own shoreline and the two countries are looking to cooperate on energy issues such as exporting Israeli nature gas. "We think that by cooperating with each other we think that we can take it (natural gas) out more easily and market it better to the betterment of both our societies," Netanyahu said.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Iran posed a "formidable" threat to Europe, accusing its proxy Hezbollah of operating cells across the continent. Netanyahu, on an official visit to Nicosia, said "Iran and Hezbollah organise a terrorist network that covers over 30 countries on five continents, including just about every country in Europe." Netanyahu said Israel and Cyprus were faced with the dual dangers of Iran and the extremist attacks perpetrated by the Islamic State group, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria. "ISIS obviously endangers European societies, Western societies, African societies, the whole world," the premier said, using an alternative acronym for IS. "These are two formidable dangers. They are expressed in many weapons, in many attacks, but the most prevalent one that concerns Cyprus and Europe is of course the terrorism that emanates from these areas," he added.

News article:
NEW YORK (JTA) – When the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles came out with a strongly worded statement last week opposing the Iran nuclear deal, it became one of a handful of federations across the country to stake out a clear position on the agreement. “This Iran deal threatens the mission of our Federation as we exist to assure the continuity of the Jewish people, support a secure State of Israel, care for Jews in need here and abroad and mobilize on issues of concern,” the federation said in its July 21 statement. The accord, reached July 14 in Vienna, places limits on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Unlike in some other communities where federation leaders came out against the deal (none has come out in support), there was strong, public pushback in Los Angeles. In a column titled “Federation: Take it back,” Rob Eshman, the editor-in-chief and publisher of the L.A. Jewish Journal, called the federation’s action a mistake. “The Los Angeles Federation made a wholly unnecessary but completely reparable mistake by urging its members to defeat the Iran deal,” Eshman wrote in his piece published Sunday. “In doing so, it misrepresented the people it purports to represent, alienated a good chunk of them, and clouded, rather than clarified, the Iran deal debate.” Federation CEO Jay Sanderson has since canceled his planned vacation to talk to community members upset about the federation decision. “We are not a voice of the entire Jewish community. We just aren’t. Nobody is. And we don’t make political statements. But this is an extraordinary moment,” Sanderson told JTA. “Sometimes when you take positions, you do so recognizing that one of the results will be a louder, more interesting communal conversation. At the very least the community is thinking and talking about this in a way it hadn’t a week ago.” The kerfuffle in Los Angeles highlights the apparent gap on the Iran deal between American Jews as a whole and American Jewish organizations. READ: The Iran deal and the hubris of certainty According to a telephone survey of American Jews sponsored by the Jewish Journal and carried out July 16-20 by a reputable polling firm using scientific methodology, far more American Jews support the deal than oppose it: Of the 501 Jewish respondents, about 48 percent said they favored the deal, compared to 28 percent against; 25 percent said they didn’t know. At the same time, 54 percent said they were not confident the deal would prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons over the next decade or so, compared to 43 percent who said they were confident. The survey was conducted by Steven M. Cohen, a research professor at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, and carried out by SSRS Omnibus, which culled Jewish respondents from the lists it has assembled from nationwide weekly telephone surveys on a variety of issues. The margin of error was 6 percent. By contrast, all seven Jewish federations that came out with position statements on the deal — Boston, Miami, Detroit, Dallas, Florida’s South Palm Beach, Phoenix and Los Angeles — oppose it. The federation umbrella group, the Jewish Federations of North America, has not taken a formal position. It’s not uncommon for federations to take policy positions, but the issues usually are matters of broad consensus within their communities, such as bills that would affect the social safety net or increased U.S. assistance for Israel. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, an umbrella group for 51 national Jewish organizations that is meant to be the Jewish community’s voice on foreign policy, also has not taken a position on the Iran deal. Nevertheless, the organization’s executive vice chairman, Malcolm Hoenlein, made his position on the deal clear in an interview. “We believe it is a dangerous deal and the implications are extremely serious,” Hoenlein told JTA. “This is not some minor piece of legislation. This really goes to the core of concerns that we have been involved with for 20 years regarding Iran’s nuclear program. The more people study the deal, the more questions people have and the more concerns are raised.” Hoenlein said that while an “overwhelming” majority of organizations in the Presidents Conference oppose the deal, the umbrella group, which is meant to operate on the basis of consensus decision-making, isn’t yet ready to take a formal position. “We will take a position,” he said, “but we will come to it in a way that keeps the community unified.” In Boston, the local Jewish federation, Combined Jewish Philanthropies, was the first to publicly oppose the Iran deal after it was announced. The decision followed a unanimous vote in a conference call with board members, the federation’s president, Barry Shrage, told JTA. “We took this to our full board, and it’s got Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives. It was unanimous in opposition to the deal,” Shrage said of the 24 of 40 board members who participated in the call. “Of course, there are lots of different opinions about what we did. We don’t think we’re speaking for the whole Jewish community. We expressed the opinion of our board.” So far, the only Jewish organizations to express public support for the deal have been those identified with the political left-wing, such as J Street and Americans for Peace Now. Meanwhile, right-wing organizations like the Zionist Organization of America and Orthodox groups such as the Orthodox Union have come out against the agreement as has the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). READ: AIPAC fly-in launches major push against Iran nuclear deal The Jewish Journal isn’t the only poll of U.S. Jewish sentiment on the deal, but it’s the only scientific one to be carried out by a nonpartisan group. The Israel Project released its own survey on Tuesday conducted online by a Republican pollster showing slightly more Jews opposing the deal, 47 percent, than supporting it, 44 percent. Also Tuesday, J Street released a poll showing U.S. Jewish support for the deal at 60 percent, compared to 40 percent opposed. Meanwhile, national surveys of Americans also show some divergence. In a telephone survey of 1,017 Americans sponsored by CNN and carried out July 22-25 by ORC International, 52 percent of respondents said that Congress should reject the deal, compared to 44 percent who said it should be approved. By contrast, a Washington Post telephone survey conducted a few days earlier, July 16-19, found 56 percent support for the deal and 37 percent opposed. It’s not clear whether the different findings are the result of methodological differences or whether Americans are growing increasingly opposed to the deal the more they learn about it. In Israel, a poll conducted by Israel’s Channel 10 shortly after the agreement’s announcement found 69 percent of Israeli respondents opposed to the deal and 10 percent in favor. Cohen, who did the Jewish Journal survey, said the divergence between American Jewish opinion on the Iran deal and the positions of American Jewish organizations reflected how the constituencies of Jewish organizations differ from average American Jews: Jewish organizational supporters tend to be older, more traditional and more affiliated. “We live in an elitist bubble of Jewish insiders, and we forget that the rest of the Jewish world doesn’t think like us,” Cohen said. “Jewish organizations are doing what they’re supposed to be doing: representing their membership. That makes sense.” As for the wide difference between American and Israeli Jews, Cohen, who holds dual Israeli and American citizenship and divides his time between the two countries, chalked it up to the Israelis’ heightened sense of their own vulnerability. “Israeli Jews have a strong sense of their vulnerabilities and their imminent destruction, given who their neighbors are,” he said. “American Jews’ neighbors aren’t trying to kill them; they’re marrying them.”

News article:
July 28, 2015 The debate about the P5+1 agreement with Iran on its nuclear program has already produced a storm of angry rhetoric and a tsunami of opinion pieces. But one issue is notably absent from the debate: the fact that Israel has a nuclear weapons arsenal and sophisticated delivery systems that are decades ahead of anything Iran could develop in the foreseeable future. Iran should be constrained by a global regime from getting the bomb, but the notion that Israel is a weak powerless state like Czechoslovakia in 1938 is ludicrous. The American intelligence community first detected the development of the Israeli nuclear weapons program through U-2 overhead imagery at the end of the 1950s. President John F. Kennedy pressed Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion very hard not to proceed with a weapons program, arguing it would precipitate a regional nuclear arms race. Under pressure from Kennedy, Israel agreed to American inspections of its French-supplied Dimona reactor, but then systematically blocked any serious inspection process. Israel has never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has never admitted it has a nuclear weapons arsenal. The United States stopped protesting the Israeli program in the Nixon administration. Neither Jerusalem nor Washington publicly discusses Israel’s arsenal. If pressed, US officials refer to an alleged nuclear arsenal. The Economist this year estimated Israel has 80 nuclear weapons in its arsenal. That puts it just behind India and far ahead of North Korea in terms of the number of bombs. Israel has a triad of nuclear delivery systems. Its US-supplied F-15 and F-16 aircraft can deliver nuclear weapons anywhere in the Middle East. The Israeli air force has a well-deserved reputation as the best air force in the region with the best pilots. It has twice destroyed incipient nuclear programs in Iraq (1981) and Syria (2007). France provided the early Israeli missile program with the technology for what is now the Jericho medium-range missile system. The latest version of the Jericho has a range of 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), according to experts. The German magazine Der Spiegel has written about the third leg of the triad: German-built submarines. According to Der Spiegel, these U-boats called Dolphins are equipped with nuclear-armed cruise missiles. Five Dolphins have been delivered so far, a sixth is due in 2017. They can target Iran from the Mediterranean and from the Arabian Sea. Israel has a right to develop a nuclear arsenal; it has been at war since its birth. It lives in a dangerous neighborhood that is getting more dangerous and chaotic. It has chosen to adopt an ambivalent posture about its deterrent for decades. But it is not an impotent defenseless country. To suggest it is a Czechoslovakia-like weak state facing Hitler’s Germany in 1938 is to completely ignore the real balance of power in the Middle East. The Iranian deal may be flawed, but it is not Munich redux. Moreover, Israel has the benefit of enormous amounts of American intelligence and military support, including more than $3 billion in grant aid every year. President Barack Obama has been very proactive in assuring Israel’s qualitative edge over any combination of foes. He has made clear he is prepared to do more if Israel asks. The Iran nuclear deal will allow Tehran to increase its support to Hezbollah and Hamas. Both pose a threat to Israel. The Israeli military has demonstrated repeatedly that it is capable of dealing with these threats. The balance of power in both cases favors the Israel Defense Forces. Additional Iranian aid to Hezbollah will probably be used more in Syria to prop up Bashar al-Assad than to fight Israel. Some have argued the Vienna deal will start a nuclear arms race in the region. In fact, a nuclear arms race has been underway in the Middle East for 65 years. Israel won it. Others allege Iran is a crazy state that cannot be deterred like normal states. The history of the Islamic Republic demonstrates that Iran is a rational actor, however, not a suicidal one. For example, in the Iran-Iraq War, when Israel secretly armed Iran, the ayatollahs demonstrated a rational approach to war with Saddam Hussein. When confronted by a superior Iraqi army backed by the United States, Iran accepted defeat. Iran’s preferred method of warfare is proxy wars where Iran fights to the last Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, Iraqi or Yemeni. The debate about the Iran deal should be conducted within the context of an understanding of the balance of power in the Middle East. A comprehensive and thorough discussion of the balance of power should include Israel’s real strategic situation. Hysteria is not the answer when the stakes are high.

News article:
July 28, 2015 The debate about the P5+1 agreement with Iran on its nuclear program has already produced a storm of angry rhetoric and a tsunami of opinion pieces. But one issue is notably absent from the debate: the fact that Israel has a nuclear weapons arsenal and sophisticated delivery systems that are decades ahead of anything Iran could develop in the foreseeable future. Iran should be constrained by a global regime from getting the bomb, but the notion that Israel is a weak powerless state like Czechoslovakia in 1938 is ludicrous. The American intelligence community first detected the development of the Israeli nuclear weapons program through U-2 overhead imagery at the end of the 1950s. President John F. Kennedy pressed Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion very hard not to proceed with a weapons program, arguing it would precipitate a regional nuclear arms race. Under pressure from Kennedy, Israel agreed to American inspections of its French-supplied Dimona reactor, but then systematically blocked any serious inspection process. Israel has never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has never admitted it has a nuclear weapons arsenal. The United States stopped protesting the Israeli program in the Nixon administration. Neither Jerusalem nor Washington publicly discusses Israel’s arsenal. If pressed, US officials refer to an alleged nuclear arsenal. The Economist this year estimated Israel has 80 nuclear weapons in its arsenal. That puts it just behind India and far ahead of North Korea in terms of the number of bombs. Israel has a triad of nuclear delivery systems. Its US-supplied F-15 and F-16 aircraft can deliver nuclear weapons anywhere in the Middle East. The Israeli air force has a well-deserved reputation as the best air force in the region with the best pilots. It has twice destroyed incipient nuclear programs in Iraq (1981) and Syria (2007). France provided the early Israeli missile program with the technology for what is now the Jericho medium-range missile system. The latest version of the Jericho has a range of 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), according to experts. The German magazine Der Spiegel has written about the third leg of the triad: German-built submarines. According to Der Spiegel, these U-boats called Dolphins are equipped with nuclear-armed cruise missiles. Five Dolphins have been delivered so far, a sixth is due in 2017. They can target Iran from the Mediterranean and from the Arabian Sea. Israel has a right to develop a nuclear arsenal; it has been at war since its birth. It lives in a dangerous neighborhood that is getting more dangerous and chaotic. It has chosen to adopt an ambivalent posture about its deterrent for decades. But it is not an impotent defenseless country. To suggest it is a Czechoslovakia-like weak state facing Hitler’s Germany in 1938 is to completely ignore the real balance of power in the Middle East. The Iranian deal may be flawed, but it is not Munich redux. Moreover, Israel has the benefit of enormous amounts of American intelligence and military support, including more than $3 billion in grant aid every year. President Barack Obama has been very proactive in assuring Israel’s qualitative edge over any combination of foes. He has made clear he is prepared to do more if Israel asks. The Iran nuclear deal will allow Tehran to increase its support to Hezbollah and Hamas. Both pose a threat to Israel. The Israeli military has demonstrated repeatedly that it is capable of dealing with these threats. The balance of power in both cases favors the Israel Defense Forces. Additional Iranian aid to Hezbollah will probably be used more in Syria to prop up Bashar al-Assad than to fight Israel. Some have argued the Vienna deal will start a nuclear arms race in the region. In fact, a nuclear arms race has been underway in the Middle East for 65 years. Israel won it. Others allege Iran is a crazy state that cannot be deterred like normal states. The history of the Islamic Republic demonstrates that Iran is a rational actor, however, not a suicidal one. For example, in the Iran-Iraq War, when Israel secretly armed Iran, the ayatollahs demonstrated a rational approach to war with Saddam Hussein. When confronted by a superior Iraqi army backed by the United States, Iran accepted defeat. Iran’s preferred method of warfare is proxy wars where Iran fights to the last Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, Iraqi or Yemeni. The debate about the Iran deal should be conducted within the context of an understanding of the balance of power in the Middle East. A comprehensive and thorough discussion of the balance of power should include Israel’s real strategic situation. Hysteria is not the answer when the stakes are high.

News article:
In 2007, during the Olmert government's term, I participated in a ministerial committee meeting about the Iranian nuclear threat. At the end of the meeting I told a senior defense establishment official: "Look at the map of Iran. Can we guarantee that this spacious country, which is 80 times the size of Israel, won't succeed in hiding at least a significant part of its nuclear armament effort and scatter it in different places?" Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter I reminded him that Israel had no idea about the details of Muammar Gaddafi's nuclear program until the revelation of an agreement with the United States in which Libya gave up the program. I further reminded him that according to foreign sources, not a single Arab country knew about the establishment of the Syrian reactor, until Israel exposed its existence at around the time it became operational. Iran Deal World powers' moral failure Sever Plocker Op-ed: The Western states which signed the nuclear agreement with Iran signed it on Israel's behalf as well, although they were not authorized to do so. World powers often decide what is good for small nations, but they usually make the wrong decision. World powers' moral failure Even if Netanyahu 'succeeds' and the US Congress doesn’t ratify the agreement, Iran will have the best of both worlds (Photo: Reuters) And indeed, at the time, foreign sources spoke about operational and technological cooperation which had disrupted the Iranian systems and delayed the development of the nuclear ability by several years. In addition, discussions were held between Israel and the US about strategic, military and diplomatic compensation if Iran were to become a nuclear threshold state. In 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came along and changed his predecessors' smart policy. Bibi launched his nuclear march of folly, which is coming to its end these days in a colossal failure. Immediately after his election, he put himself at the lead of the global battle against Iran and announced that Israel could thwart the Iranian nuclear program on its own. That was baseless and unfounded arrogance. His intention to bomb the nuclear facilities in Iran was met with opposition from nearly all leaders of the defense establishment. It was clear that bombing facilities in Iran would not terminate the nuclear program, just like what happened in Iraq and Syria (again, according to foreign sources). On the contrary: Even if the operation would succeed militarily, it would delay the Iranian program by a year or an year and a half, but then Iran would feel free to declare to the world that it is developing a nuclear bomb in order to defend itself against the Israeli threat. But Bibi kept going. He invested about NIS 11 billion (roughly $2.8 billion) in the preparations for a strike in Iran, which was never executed of course, and most of this huge sum went down the drain. Netanyahu brags to this very day that his actions led to sanctions against Iran. It's true that the sanctions hurt the Iranian economy, but not only did they fail to slow down the Iranian race – they made it even more determined. In 2009, Iran was not a clear nuclear threshold state; in 2015, it is only two or three months away from a first nuclear bomb. Bibi's nuclear policy led to a strategic, military, economic, diplomatic and social disaster. Unfortunately, his conduct after the "Vienna agreement" adds insult to injury. The agreement is an established fact, and even if Bibi "succeeds" and the US Congress doesn’t ratify it, Iran will have the best of both worlds, as the entire world – from China and Russia to the European countries – will comply with the decisions of the Security Council and the Council of the European Union and lift the sanctions. The restrictions on Iran, according to the Vienna agreement, will not be implemented – and Israel will not be able to enjoy a full "compensation package" from the American administration. In addition, the illusion that Bibi and his people are trying to sell, that Israel will received a significant compensation package even if the battle against US President Barack Obama fails and the agreement is approved by the Congress, will be shattered. I would like to also dedicate a few words to Opposition Chairman Isaac Herzog , whose conduct on the Iranian issue is puzzling. First of all, he must firmly and decisively slam the foolish attempt to gain the Congress' support against the agreement and against the ongoing conflict with the American administration. Secondly, he must try to convince Obama and his administration to give Israel a strategic and security-related compensation package, mainly concerning the war on terror, including Iranian terror. Buji must stop Bibi's disastrous march of folly rather than become part of it. After the failure of the Yom Kippur War, then-Opposition Chairman Menachem Begin launched a focused, scathing attack on the Golda Meir government. That's the way an opposition leader should act. Herzog must wage only one campaign, consistently, seriously and clearly: Bibi, resign!

News article:
The nuclear deal between the West and Iran gives Tehran up to three months to hide illicit nuclear activity in hitherto undeclared locations, and not 24 days as claimed by the accord’s backers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday. If Iran honors the agreement, it will be able to build numerous nuclear weapons with the blessing of the international community, he lamented during a briefing for Israeli diplomatic correspondents in his Jerusalem office. “The inspections regime is full of holes,” Netanyahu said. “This deal is terrible. It’s preferable to have no deal than this deal.” Under the Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action that the world powers signed with Iran earlier this month, Iran has 24 days before it needs to grant international inspectors access to hitherto undeclared sites they suspect host nuclear activity. But, Netanyahu said, if no agreement has been reached after that time elapses, the deal says that the complaint is to go to another committee trying to bridge the dispute, which will deal with the issue for another 30 days. If Iran still refuses to let inspectors into the site and the United Nations Security Council is involved, it will take another 30 days before any action is taken, the prime minister said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “It could take a total of three months,” Netanyahu said. During an in-depth briefing, interrupted by a phone call during which Netanyahu discussed the Iran deal and other regional issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the prime minister vociferously attacked the deal, saying it endangers Israel’s existence. “In another 10 to 15 years, Iran will become a nuclear threshold country with the potential to build nuclear weapons — with permission and authorization,” he said. Advertisement If US Congress rejects the deal, “it will avert the greatest danger of Iran becoming a legitimate nuclear threshold power in 10 years,” Netanyahu added. The opposition to the deal is growing steadily, he said, especially among Americans. “With every passing day there are more and more opponents to this deal. The more a person learns about the agreement, the more he opposes it,” Netanyahu said. This is true among the American public as well. The American conversation is important and you see it moving.” The prime minister pointed to a critical article by Leon Wieseltier, a frequent critic of Netanyahu’s policies, as proof that Jews and Americans were united in opposition to the deal. “It shows that you don’t have to be right wing Jew to criticize this agreement. You also don’t have to be a Jew at all to reject this agreement.” Recent polling has shown Americans, as well as American Jews, split on whether to support the deal. Religious Jews are most likely to oppose the agreement, according to most surveys. Advertisement He said that Sunni Arab states in the region shared his concerns about the pact. “Most Sunni Arab states don’t just criticize the deal, they fully reject it. They are outraged by the agreement,” he said. “There are very concrete threats on our existence. We’re not the only ones who understand that. Others understand it too.” The comments seemed to contradict US Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who earlier this month said Saudi Arabia had offered some support for the accord. In the UN Security Council, Jordan, another Sunni Arab state, voted for the deal. Netanyahu also said that Israel is not privy to all the content of the secret supplements of the agreement signed by Iran and the world powers. “We didn’t receive all the parts of the deal,” he said, refusing to elaborate. On Wednesday, national security adviser Yossi Cohen told Knesset lawmakers that Israel was being kept in the dark on the annexes. “Contrary to promises, Israel has not yet received all the written supplements to the agreement signed between Iran and the world powers,” Cohen, a former deputy head of the Mossad, told members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. The nuclear deal is currently being weighed by Congress, which will likely vote on whether to support it in September. Netanyahu has indicated he will lobby against the deal in the US, even at the cost of ruffling feathers with the White House. Advertisement During the talk with Putin, the Russian president said the agreement “provided reliable guarantees” that Iran’s nuclear program is exclusively peaceful, according to the Kremlin. Putin said that the agreement would help secure nuclear non-proliferation and “have a positive impact on security and stability in the Middle East.”

By JTA July 30, 2015 The Orthodox Union is asking hundreds of rabbis to fly to Washington in September to lobby against the Iran nuclear deal. “We are confident that hundreds of rabbis traveling to Washington on the eve of this vote and just days before Rosh Hashanah will have a highly visible and real impact upon this fateful vote in Congress,” said a save-the-date notice sent this week by the Orthodox Union’s Washington office to rabbis affiliated with the umbrella group and with the Rabbinical Council of America. “We will only have this impact with your participation. The scheduled date for the fly-in is Sept. 9. Rosh Hashanah starts the evening of Sept. 13. Congress has until mid-to-late September to consider whether to kill the deal. President Barack Obama meanwhile is speaking on a phone call about the deal on Thursday evening. Invitations to call in went out through liberal groups backing the deal, including J Street, a Jewish Middle East policy group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes the deal, will be addressing Americans through a live webcast next Monday organized by the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Much of the jockeying is aimed at Congress, where opponents must muster two-thirds majorities in both chambers to kill the deal. A key target is congressional Democrats; most Republicans are already declared against the deal. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., whose Queens-area district has a heavy Jewish presence, on Wednesday said she would oppose the deal. “I am deeply concerned that almost all of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure would remain intact,” Meng said in her statement. “This leads me to believe Iran would simply resume its pursuit of a nuclear weapon at the conclusion of the deal in a decade’s time.” Earlier this week, Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.), the longest serving Jew in Congress, said he backed the deal. Also backing the deal is Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., who represents a heavily Jewish Chicago-area district and who is chief deputy whip for the minority Democratic caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Kerry Skips Israel on his Mideast Trip, but is Grilled for Keeping Secret Side Agreements Between Iran and the IAEA from Americans By: Lori Lowenthal Marcus http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/bibi-on-iran-deal-we-arent-partners-at-the-table-we-are-a-meal-on-the-menu-video/2015/07/30/ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu learned that U.S. Secretary of State will be making a trip to the Middle East to sell the Iran deal, but is skipping Israel. Kerry will be visiting Egypt and Qatar and other Gulf State representatives, but won’t stop in the Jewish State, which until recently was considered America’s closest ally in the Middle East. The Prime Minister’s response to the snub was, “Really, Kerry has no reason to come here.” Expanding upon that response, Netanyahu said of the Iran deal, “This deal has nothing to do with us. We are not influenced by this deal at all. We aren’t partners at the table, we are a meal on the menu.” These comments were made to reporters on Tuesday, July 28, during a return flight to Israel from Cyprus, as reported by Israel Hayom. It isn’t only America’s erstwhile BFF Israel that is expressing dismay at the nuclear deal concluded by the U.S., along with its other P5+1 partners, and Iran. Appearing before the House Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, Kerry and other deal cheerleaders were grilled on the likelihood of Iran honoring the commitments under the deal. “Iran has cheated on every agreement they’ve signed,” Rep. Ed Royce (R), chairman of the committee said. Royc continued, asking whether Iran “has earned the right to be trusted.” Kerry responded that “nothing in this deal is built on trust. Nothing.” SIDE DEAL DETAILS KEPT SECRET FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC On Wednesday, during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Iran deal, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) queried Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz about the so-called “side agreements” between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Commission, responsible for inspecting Iranian nuclear sites. Cotton badgered Kerry as to why the contents of the side agreements cannot be made known to the American people, despite the Iranians knowing the content of the agreements. Cotton wanted Kerry to answer why this agreement was classified and kept from the American public. Kerry’s response was, “because we respect the process of the IAEA and we don’t have their authorization to reveal what is a confidential agreement.” Respect for another party can be admirable. However, according to Cotton: “But U.S. law requires any deal, between any party, not just the United States, be submitted to Congress before the 60 day clock begins to tick.” Watch the video of Sen. Cotton questioning Secretary of State Kerry who admits he has not read the text of the side agreements. About the Author: Lori Lowenthal Marcus is the US correspondent for The Jewish Press.

Skip to comments. Iran’s foreign minister: Israel should disarm, too The Politico ^ | July 31, 2015 | Adam B. Lerner Posted on by 2ndDivisionVet Now that Iran has agreed to curb its nuclear program, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif says its time for Israel to follow suit and abandon its long-rumored nuclear arsenal. Irans push for a ban on weapons of mass destruction in its regional neighbourhood has been consistent, Zarif wrote in an editorial for the Guardian. And while Iran has received the support of some of its Arab friends in this endeavour, Israel  home to the Middle Easts only nuclear weapons programme  has been the holdout. The nuclear deal signed in Vienna by Iran and the P 5 + 1 countries earlier this month, which dismantles much of Irans nuclear infrastructure and allows for an inspections regime to monitor the Islamic republics compliance, should be symbolically significant enough to kickstart [a] paradigm shift, Zarif said. Today, in light of the Vienna deal, it is high time that the nuclear haves remedied the gap by adopting serious disarmament measures and reinforcing the non-proliferation regime, Irans top diplomat added, referring to the Non-Proliferation Treaty which established a framework for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons in 1970. The NPT recognizes only the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia as nuclear armed states, though in the decades since its signing Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea have all reportedly conducted successful nuclear tests. Israels government has never publicly admitted to possessing a nuclear weapon, even though most analysts believe the country developed nuclear technology in the 1960s and now has a significant number of nuclear warheads. Zarif denounced Israels absurd and alarmist campaign against the Iranian nuclear deal despite of the countrys undeclared nuclear arsenal and a declared disdain towards non-proliferation. He added that in a globalised security environment the cold war era asymmetry between states that possess nuclear weapons and those that dont is no longer remotely tolerable. For too long, it has been assumed that the insane concept of mutually assured destruction would sustain stability and non-proliferation. Nothing could be further from the truth. He suggested start[ing] negotiations for a weapons elimination treaty, backed by a robust monitoring and compliance-verification mechanism. Eventually, Zarif wrote, the goal should be to establish a WMD-free zone in the Middle East. Though President Barack Obama has asserted that the Vienna deal will keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, to date he has not attempted to leverage the deal into larger plans for disarmament. A majority of Republicans in Congress and on the 2016 campaign trail have come out against the deal, saying that they do not believe it will ultimately keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and its failure will result in a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. In order to scuttle the deal, Republicans will need to muster enough Democrats to override a presidential veto of any legislation disapproving of the accord. With that in mind, the Obama administration has been lobbying Democrats to support the deal, with Obama making a direct and personal appeal to members of his own party.

In Israel, both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief political rival, opposition leader Isaac Herzog, have come out against the deal. Netanyahu has called the agreement a historic mistake, not only because he does not believe that in the long-term it will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but also because the sanctions relief for Iran included in the deal will allow the country to continue to finance terrorist organizations around the Middle East. On Thursday, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Netanyahu said that the tide is turning and more and more Americans are coming out against the deal. This is true about the American public, the Israeli leader added. The debate in the U.S. is important, and you can see the shift. TOPICS: Foreign Affairs Government Israel War on Terror KEYWORDS: iran israel kerry obama Who saw this coming?

Zarif denounced Israels absurd and alarmist campaign against the Iranian nuclear deal despite of the countrys undeclared nuclear arsenal and a declared disdain towards non-proliferation. He added that in a globalised security environment the cold war era asymmetry between states that possess nuclear weapons and those that dont is no longer remotely tolerable. For too long, it has been assumed that the insane concept of mutually assured destruction would sustain stability and non-proliferation. Nothing could be further from the truth. He suggested start[ing] negotiations for a weapons elimination treaty, backed by a robust monitoring and compliance-verification mechanism. Eventually, Zarif wrote, the goal should be to establish a WMD-free zone in the Middle East. Though President Barack Obama has asserted that the Vienna deal will keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, to date he has not attempted to leverage the deal into larger plans for disarmament. A majority of Republicans in Congress and on the 2016 campaign trail have come out against the deal, saying that they do not believe it will ultimately keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and its failure will result in a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. In order to scuttle the deal, Republicans will need to muster enough Democrats to override a presidential veto of any legislation disapproving of the accord. With that in mind, the Obama administration has been lobbying Democrats to support the deal, with Obama making a direct and personal appeal to members of his own party.

In Israel, both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief political rival, opposition leader Isaac Herzog, have come out against the deal. Netanyahu has called the agreement a historic mistake, not only because he does not believe that in the long-term it will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but also because the sanctions relief for Iran included in the deal will allow the country to continue to finance terrorist organizations around the Middle East. On Thursday, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Netanyahu said that the tide is turning and more and more Americans are coming out against the deal. This is true about the American public, the Israeli leader added. The debate in the U.S. is important, and you can see the shift. TOPICS: Foreign Affairs Government Israel War on Terror KEYWORDS: iran israel kerry obama Who saw this coming?

Topic: Security Region: Middle East Tags: IranIsraelDefense "The name of the game for Iran is to maximize the damage on Israeli and U.S. interests without provoking a conventional military assault." Ask U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry why the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is so important to the foreign policy interests of the United States and its allies, he would likely tell you that the pact averts the possibility of yet another U.S.-led confrontation in the Middle East. Whether you like all of the agreement’s provisions or not, Kerry has hit that message home as he makes the rounds on television, classified briefings, and testimony in front of Congress: the JCPOA, he argues, is the only lever that the international community has to prevent the Iranians from assembling a nuclear weapons capability over the next 15 years. Anything other than a negotiated settlement, in the administration’s mind, will be a stepping-stone to a war with dramatic repercussions. And what about the prospects of a unilateral Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities? That would be a mistake of unimaginable proportions, according to Secretary Kerry. Asked exactly this question by NBC’s Matt Lauer recently on the Today Show, Kerry was blunt in his warnings. An Israeli military operation on Tehran’s program “would be an enormous mistake,” Kerry said, “a huge mistake with grave consequences for Israel and for the region.” But how much of a mistake would the military option be? How would Iran respond in the event of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran’s nuclear enrichment and research facilities? Would Iranian retaliation really be that devastating to the United States and its allies? 1. Use Diplomatic Channels at the United Nations For understandable reasons, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu genuinely believes that the Islamic Republic of Iran is run by a collection of unreasonable, unconstrained, irrational men who are too deceptive and/or crazy to deal with. Yet if past history is any guide, the first response from the Iranian Government is likely to be a full-court press at the United Nations against Israel and a formal complaint to the United Nations Security Council, the General Assembly, and the Human Rights Council that Israel’s aggression is a violation of their national sovereignty and a direct infringement of Article 2 in the United Nations Charter. Using diplomatic channels would be an especially appealing option for President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif—both of whom have devoted their tenure to improving Tehran’s image in the eyes of the world. A formal Iranian complaint would be dead-on-arrival once it hits the desk of the Security Council, but it would nonetheless serve its intended purpose: demonstrate to the developing world (Russia and China in particular) that the Iranian Government is a responsible power whose sovereignty was targeted by the aggressive actions of another state without sufficient cause. The objective, therefore, is not to actually pass a resolution in favor of Iran, but rather to embarrass Israel and depict it as a belligerent to a wide swath of the global community. 2. Redoubling support to its proxies According to a 2013 profile in The New Yorker on Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp-Quds Force, Iran contributed $100 million to Lebanese Hezbollah every year from 2000-2006. Hundreds of millions of additional dollars have been given to the organization since that time — a consistent pool of resources that has permitted Hezbollah to stockpile a conservative estimate of 50,000 missiles in southern Lebanon in preparation for another war with Israel. Tens of millions more have been transferred to Hamas’ Izz al-Din al-Qassam brigades since the two began a reconciliation after a falling out over support for the Assad regime. “Apart from using Iranian aid to rebuild the [Hamas] tunnel network,” writes Con Coughlin of the Telegraph, “the Palestinian brigades are also replenishing their depleted stocks of medium-range missiles…” Because Iran doesn’t share a land border with Israel, you can expect Tehran to extend its material and arms support to both of these organizations after an Israeli air campaign against its nuclear program (Iran would have more resources to do so, given the sanctions relief that it is receiving for implementing the JCPOA). Through improved technology and successful defense research with the United States, Israel has been able to render many of Hamas’ rockets ineffective. Yet even with Israel’s sophisticated anti-missile defense system, it would be difficult to counteract a coordinated attack from Hezbollah in the north and Hamas in the west simultaneously. Iran, meanwhile, would still be afforded some small degree of plausible deniability. 3. You’re welcome, Al-Qaeda It may seem like an incredibly odd thing for Iran to do given its Shia composition, but the country has tacitly worked with Al-Qaeda in the past—a Sunni jihadist group that has killed thousands of people just because they happened to be worshipping in the wrong way. The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned numerous Al-Qaeda commanders for using Iran as a staging ground to transfer fighters and money to and from South Asia and the Middle East. And the ayatollahs in Tehran have largely looked the other way when Al-Qaeda is working to target the United States or American interests. An October 2012 notice from the Treasury Department summarizes the Al-Qaeda-Iran relationship quite well. “This [Al-Qaeda] network uses Iran as a critical transit point and operates under an agreement between al-Qa’ida and the Iranian government,” former U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury (and now Deputy CIA Director) David Cohen writes. “Under the terms of the agreement between al-Qa’ida and Iran, al-Qa’ida must refrain from conducting any operations within Iranian territory and recruiting operatives inside Iran while keeping Iranian authorities informed of their activities. In return, the Government of Iran gave the Iran-based al-Qa’ida network freedom of operation and uninhibited ability to travel for extremists and their families.” Al-Qaeda’s own operatives have confirmed through internal correspondence that Iran was once thought of as a perfect base to re-establish itself after its expulsion from Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001 attacks. While those plans were shelved due to expense, it is not inconceivable that the group would be offered expanded freedom of movement inside Iran if Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the IRGC believed such a partnership would serve their interests. 4. Kidnap more Americans Iran has a habit of sweeping up American citizens who reside in or travel to the country, charging them with espionage, locking them up in Evin prison, putting them on trial, and convicting them for being members of the CIA. Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer, Joshua Fattel, Robert Levinson, Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Jason Razaian have all been picked up by Iranian authorities (or, in the case of Levinson, disappeared) and accused of being U.S. government agents. In each of these cases, the detention of an American was an international headline that made the United States look feckless and unable to guarantee the safety of its citizens. Even if Israel chose to act alone during a military operation against Tehran’s nuclear program, Iran would likely assume that Washington was involved in some fashion — either through intelligence channels or military enablers. This is why Iranian authorities would likely view the arrest and prosecution of more Americans as justified under the circumstances. The imprisonment of even one additional American in an Iranian detention facility for a lengthy sentence would be a black eye to the United States and would elicit an uproar among members of Congress. 5. Make Afghanistan a living hell If you think Afghanistan is chaotic today, it can get a lot bloodier if the IRGC-Quds Force increases its covert support to insurgent groups fighting the Afghan national security forces. Whereas Iran and the Taliban were once bitter enemies in the late 1990s (Iran was all but ready to launch military action against the Taliban in 1998 after nine Iranian diplomats were slaughtered by the movement), the two have turned into allies of convenience—if only because both consider the United States to be a major irritant in the region. Thanks to Chelsea Manning’s disclosure of hundreds of thousands of “war logs” to the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks, we know how extensive that cooperation has been in the past: Taliban fighters training across the border in eastern Iran; Iranian agents providing money and weapons to anti-government insurgent groups; millions of dollars in bribes given to senior Afghan government officials, among other cases. Defense Secretary Robert Gates lambasted Iran in 2010 for “playing a double game” in Afghanistan—supporting the Afghan government with cash, while at the very same time building contacts among the various Afghan insurgent factions. At a time when the United States is closing out its fourteen-year engagement in Afghanistan, the last thing that Washington wants is an Iraq-style disintegration of that country’s security situation. Yet this is exactly what Tehran could foment in order to retaliate against an Israeli attack. Such a decision would also have the effect of jeopardizing another multi-year U.S. military engagement in a country where Americans have fought and died. Conclusion However Iran chooses to respond to an Israeli attack on its nuclear program, Khamenei will instruct the IRGC-QF to do its work as discreetly as possible. Any overt missile attack on an American ally in the Arab world — let alone a conventional missile attack on Israel — would prompt the U.S. armed forces to scramble the fighter jets and deploy the aircraft carriers. This is not something Iran wants and a full U.S. military operation is certainly not something that they can afford to confront.

Make Afghanistan a living hell If you think Afghanistan is chaotic today, it can get a lot bloodier if the IRGC-Quds Force increases its covert support to insurgent groups fighting the Afghan national security forces. Whereas Iran and the Taliban were once bitter enemies in the late 1990s (Iran was all but ready to launch military action against the Taliban in 1998 after nine Iranian diplomats were slaughtered by the movement), the two have turned into allies of convenience—if only because both consider the United States to be a major irritant in the region. Thanks to Chelsea Manning’s disclosure of hundreds of thousands of “war logs” to the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks, we know how extensive that cooperation has been in the past: Taliban fighters training across the border in eastern Iran; Iranian agents providing money and weapons to anti-government insurgent groups; millions of dollars in bribes given to senior Afghan government officials, among other cases. Defense Secretary Robert Gates lambasted Iran in 2010 for “playing a double game” in Afghanistan—supporting the Afghan government with cash, while at the very same time building contacts among the various Afghan insurgent factions. At a time when the United States is closing out its fourteen-year engagement in Afghanistan, the last thing that Washington wants is an Iraq-style disintegration of that country’s security situation. Yet this is exactly what Tehran could foment in order to retaliate against an Israeli attack. Such a decision would also have the effect of jeopardizing another multi-year U.S. military engagement in a country where Americans have fought and died. Conclusion However Iran chooses to respond to an Israeli attack on its nuclear program, Khamenei will instruct the IRGC-QF to do its work as discreetly as possible. Any overt missile attack on an American ally in the Arab world — let alone a conventional missile attack on Israel — would prompt the U.S. armed forces to scramble the fighter jets and deploy the aircraft carriers. This is not something Iran wants and a full U.S. military operation is certainly not something that they can afford to confront.

US official says deal never aimed to address Iran terror support WASHINGTON — The United States never considered addressing in the nuclear agreement with Iran the issue of Tehran’s sponsorship of terrorism and its calls for Israel’s annihilation, a senior US administration says. Israel knew this all along but then decided to turn these issues into make-or-break conditions for support of the deal, the official tells Israeli reporters. Jerusalem’s insistence that any deal address these issues would have killed any prospect of reaching an agreement, the senior official continues, adding that the conditions that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined in his contentious Congress speech in March made plain that Israel would object to any nuclear deal with Iran. “This has been a nuclear negotiation for over two years with the P5+1 and Iran, with very vigorous consultations with successive Israeli governments about the details of that negotiation,” the senior official says, referring to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany. “Frankly, in none of our conversations with Israel over the years about the Iran nuclear negotiations were we contemplating bringing in those other elements of Iranian behavior.” Iranian nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi had a different take on the matter, telling Iranian journalists on Saturday: “We said during the talks that we cannot not provide weapons to Hezbollah, and we are not willing to sacrifice them for our nuclear program. Therefore, if you want to keep the weapon sanctions as part of the agreement, we will continue with our efforts. We discussed this matter for a while.” — Raphael Ahren with Times of Israel staff

News article:
Jerusalem – President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were making dueling appeals to the American Jewish community Tuesday as they sought to rally support for their opposing positions on the Iranian nuclear deal. Netanyahu made his case in a live webcast with more than 10,000 participants, according to the U.S. Jewish groups that organized the event. The prime minister railed against the agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief, calling it a “bad deal” that leaves Tehran on the brink of a bomb. “The nuclear deal with Iran doesn’t block Iran’s path to the bomb,” he said. “It actually paves Iran’s path to the bomb.” He also pushed back against the Obama administration’s counter-argument that the deal was the only way to avoid eventual war with Iran. Netanyahu, one of the fiercest critics of the nuclear accord, also disputed Obama’s assertion that opponents of the diplomatic deal favor war. He called that assertion “utterly false,” saying Israel wants peace, not war. “I don’t oppose this deal because I want war. I oppose this deal because I want to prevent war. And this deal will bring war,” he said. “This is a time to stand up and be counted. Oppose this dangerous deal.” Should Congress vote against the deal, the United States might lose out while the five other big-power signatories re-engage with Iran, including in lucrative trade deals. Netanyahu sought to play down this concern, saying international firms would think twice about entering Iranian markets if it meant losing bigger U.S. business opportunities. Having infuriated the Obama administration by speaking against Iran in Congress in March at the invitation of the Democratic president’s Republican rivals, Netanyahu cast himself as the emissary of an Israeli public that, polls show, mostly shares his misgivings about the deal with Iran. Obama was to hold a private meeting at the White House later Tuesday with Jewish leaders — some who support the deal, some who oppose it, and others whose organizations are undecided. The direct appeals from Obama and Netanyahu come amid an intense lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers plan to vote on the nuclear deal next month. The vote will be one of Congress’ most significant national security decisions in recent years. The White House is preparing for the likelihood that lawmakers will vote against the deal and is focusing its lobbying efforts on getting enough Democrats to sustain a veto. Only one chamber of Congress is needed to sustain a veto. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that the White House is confident it can sustain a veto “at least in the House.” The president got a boost in the Senate Tuesday with Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia — both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — announcing their support for the deal. Obama also planned to give a speech Wednesday outlining what he sees as the strengths of the nuclear deal.

News article:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to the Web on Tuesday to call on American Jews to publicly oppose the nuclear deal with Iran signed in Vienna last month. In his address, picked up at some 100 Jewish communities throughout the United States, Netanyahu urged his listeners to judge the nuclear agreement on its merits and not through a partisan lens. “Don’t let the deal’s supporters quash the real debate,” Netanyahu said. “The issue here is too important." Netanyahu’s address is part of the effort to get the U.S. Congress to reject the deal in a vote scheduled for September. The White House, senior Republican figures, the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC and Israeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer have all been putting pressure on those Democratic legislators who have not yet made up their minds. Netanyahu noted that opposition leader Isaac Herzog, “who ran against me in this year’s election and who works every day in the Knesset to bring down my government, Herzog has said that there is no daylight between us when it comes to the deal with Iran. This is simply not a partisan issue in Israel It shouldn’t be a partisan issue in the United States either." Shortly before Netanyahu’s address, Democratic senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Barbara Boxer of California and Bill Nelson of Florida announced their support for the deal, which is considered an achievement for U.S. President Barack Obama. On the other hand, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, one of Israel’s greatest friends in Congress, has yet to express his opinion on the issue, though various American news outlets say he was leaning toward opposing the deal. What’s more, public opinion polls issued recently show opposition to the deal growing. If Schumer declares his opposition, other congressional Democrats might follow suit. To make rejection of the deal veto-proof would require 13 Democratic senators and 44 Democratic representatives to join the Republican majority and vote against the president. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas told a delegation of Israeli diplomatic correspondents that he believes enough votes can be obtained to override an Obama veto. “The momentum is moving in our direction,” Cotton said. “I hope the more we know about this deal the more people would oppose this deal. Most Americans don’t believe the words ‘ayatollahs’ and ‘uranium’ go well together. I think more and more Democrats will be convinced to oppose this deal." Obama is also fighting for Jewish American hearts. A few hours after Netanyahu's speech Obama met with a group of 16 leaders and prominent activists from the U.S.-Jewish community – a few of them support the deal and some of them oppose it or have yet to express their position. In recent weeks, since the deal was declared U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the head of the U.S. nuclear negotiating team Wendy Sherman and other American officials met with representatives of Jewish groups in the U.S. On Wednesday, Obama will address the nation at the American University in Washington, in an attempt to stop the drop in U.S. public support for the deal. Netanyahu, in his address, said he had a responsibility to make sure the Israeli position against the nuclear agreement is heard. “The days when the Jewish people could not or would not speak up for themselves, those days are over,” he said. He denied that his objections to the agreement stem from the tense relationship between himself and Obama, insisting his opposition was based on the substance of the agreement’s contests. “This isn’t about me and it’s not about President Obama,” he said. “It’s about the deal. Judge the deal on its substance and on its substance alone." The prime minister also denied claims by the White House that he would object to any deal with Iran of any kind. He also denied that Israel is interested in seeing the United States go to war with Iran. “The claim that we oppose this deal because we want war is not just false. It’s outrageous,” he said. “Israel wants to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program and Israel wants peace. This deal will advance neither goal." Netanyahu stressed that the alternative to this nuclear deal is not war, as Obama has argued, but a better deal. He said that if Congress rejects this nuclear deal, the Iranians would come back to the negotiating table, “because they need this deal."

By JTA August 4, 2015 U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told Israeli reporters, “If I were Israeli, I would support the Iran deal.” In response to Moniz’s comments on Monday during a special briefing for Israeli diplomatic correspondents visiting Washington, his Israeli counterpart, Yuval Steinitz, countered from Jerusalem, “If I were American, I would oppose the agreement.” Steinitz and Moniz met about two months ago in Washington for talks on the Iranian nuclear issue and other energy matters. Moniz told the Israeli reporters on Monday that the agreement is “a commitment from Iran to never have nuclear weapons. It’s not for 10 or 15 years – it’s forever.” He added that the deal does not “change one iota who our friends and allies are in the region – Israel, Gulf States and some Arab states.” He also reminded the reporters that Iran was a nuclear threshold state before the agreement. In his statement Tuesday, Steinitz said that he would oppose the agreement “because it ensures from the outset Iran’s becoming a nuclear power capable of producing dozens of atomic bombs per month, ten years from today,” and ” because it harms the national security of the United States, Israel and every Western country.” The sanctions relief for nuclear restrictions deal reached July 14 between Iran and six major powers still must be approved by the U.S. Congress. Israel’s government vehemently opposes the deal and wants Congress to use its power to kill it by the end of September. President Barack Obama has vowed to veto any anti-agreement legislation.

News article:
By JTA August 4, 2015 U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told Israeli reporters, “If I were Israeli, I would support the Iran deal.” In response to Moniz’s comments on Monday during a special briefing for Israeli diplomatic correspondents visiting Washington, his Israeli counterpart, Yuval Steinitz, countered from Jerusalem, “If I were American, I would oppose the agreement.” Steinitz and Moniz met about two months ago in Washington for talks on the Iranian nuclear issue and other energy matters. Moniz told the Israeli reporters on Monday that the agreement is “a commitment from Iran to never have nuclear weapons. It’s not for 10 or 15 years – it’s forever.” He added that the deal does not “change one iota who our friends and allies are in the region – Israel, Gulf States and some Arab states.” He also reminded the reporters that Iran was a nuclear threshold state before the agreement. In his statement Tuesday, Steinitz said that he would oppose the agreement “because it ensures from the outset Iran’s becoming a nuclear power capable of producing dozens of atomic bombs per month, ten years from today,” and ” because it harms the national security of the United States, Israel and every Western country.” The sanctions relief for nuclear restrictions deal reached July 14 between Iran and six major powers still must be approved by the U.S. Congress. Israel’s government vehemently opposes the deal and wants Congress to use its power to kill it by the end of September. President Barack Obama has vowed to veto any anti-agreement legislation.

News article:
Washington – President Barack Obama launched a blistering denunciation of opposition to his Iran deal Wednesday, arguing that none of the criticism stands up to scrutiny and warning that if Congress blocks the accord it will put the U.S. on the path to another Middle East war. “The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war,” Obama said in an address at American University. “Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.” Seeking to isolate his critics, Obama said the rest of the world supports the Iran accord, with the notable exception of Israel. He reaffirmed his support for Israel’s security and said he doesn’t doubt the sincerity of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of the fiercest opponents of the agreement. But in a blunt assessment of Netanyahu’s views, Obama said “I believe he is wrong.” The president’s address, which lasted nearly an hour, was part of an intense summer lobbying campaign by both supporters and opponents of the nuclear deal. Members of Congress will vote next month on a resolution either approving or disapproving the pact. Opponents of the deal say it would leave too much of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in place and allow Tehran to start rebuilding its program after a decade. Critics also contend Iran will use an influx of funds now frozen under international sanctions to boost terrorist activity around the Middle East. The White House has urged lawmakers to vote solely on the deal’s ability to prevent Iran from building a bomb, not on its other destabilizing activities or anti-American sentiments. Obama said that while Iranian hardliners may chant “Death to America” in the streets of Tehran, that’s not the belief of all Iranians. “In fact, it’s those hardliners who are most comfortable with the status quo,” he said. “It’s those hardliners chanting “Death to America” who have been most opposed to the deal. They’re making common cause with the Republican caucus.” Republicans, who are largely united in their opposition to the diplomatic deal, appeared unmoved by the president’s lengthy address. Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina accused him of relying on “endless strawmen to divert attention from his failed policies.” Obama drew on history to bolster support, saying the accord builds on an American tradition of “strong, principled diplomacy” with adversaries, including the former Soviet Union. He spoke at the same university where John F. Kennedy called for Cold War diplomacy and nuclear disarmament. Recalling more recent American history, Obama cast the upcoming vote in Congress as the nation’s most consequential foreign policy debate since the 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war. He said many of those who oppose the Iran pact are the same as those who pushed for the war, which is now known to have been based on flawed intelligence. While Obama was an early opponent of the Iraq war, several of his top foreign policy advisers voted for the 2002 authorization, including Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. They now say the war was a mistake. The agreement between the U.S., Iran and international powers aims to dismantle much of Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from economic sanctions. The White House says the deal would cut off all of Iran’s pathways to a bomb and mandate robust inspections that would catch Tehran if it cheats. Challenging those who say the U.S. should have layered tougher sanctions on Tehran and held out for a better deal, Obama said they “are either ignorant of Iranian society or they’re just not being straight with the American people.” “If Congress were to kill this deal, they would not only pave Iran’s pathway to a bomb, they would accelerate it,” Obama said. The White House is preparing for the likelihood that lawmakers will vote against the deal next month and is focusing its lobbying efforts on getting enough Democrats to sustain a veto. Only one chamber of Congress is needed to sustain a veto and keep the deal in place. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that the White House is confident it can sustain a veto “at least in the House.” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, announced his support on Wednesday, saying there is “no credible path to a better deal if the sanctions get weaker and Iran’s nuclear program gets stronger. The agreement has flaws, but the prospect that a better deal would result from congressional rejection seems like pure fantasy to me.” Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California, a former member of the House Intelligence Committee and a Vietnam War veteran, also announced his support.

In an attempt to appeal to American Jewish leaders, President Obama warned of the consequences Israel would face should Congress reject the Iran nuclear deal. "I can assure that Israel will bear the brunt of the asymmetrical response that Iran will have to a military strike on its nuclear facilities," Obama told roughly 20 American Jewish leaders during a two hour meeting at the White House Tuesday night. "It would be destructive both to the U.S. and to Israel," Obama warned. "An American military action against Iran's nuclear facilities will not result in Iran deciding to have a full-fledged war with the United States. Iran's defense budget is $15 billion. The American defense budget is $600 billion. What Iran would do, and could do, is respond asymmetrically by increasing its support for terrorism." "You'll see Hezbollah rockets falling on Tel Aviv," Obama added. Michael Kassen and Lee Rosenberg of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is strongly opposed to the deal, were among the leaders who joined Obama in the Cabinet Room. Jeremy Ben-Ami of J Street, who is among the deal's most vocal advocates, as well as representatives from the Orthodox Union, the Reform Movement, the World Jewish Congress and the Anti-Defamation League also attended the meeting, which was part of the president's 54th birthday celebration. Hours prior, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave an online address to American Jewish leaders as well, in which he denounced this nuclear deal. Some 10,000 people participated. "Israelis are going to be the ones who pay the highest price if there's war and if Iran gets the bomb," Netanyahu said, adding, "I oppose this deal because I want to prevent war, and this deal will bring war. It will spark a nuclear arms race in the region and it would feed Iran's terrorism and aggression. That would make war, perhaps the most horrific war of all, far more likely." Obama and Netanyahu are expected to meet within the next two months, however, not before the prime minister's speech at the United Nation General Assembly meeting in New York in September. The White House is currently in selling mode, as it tries to bolster enough support in Congress so that lawmakers do not strike down the deal. The deal, reached in mid-June between Iran, the U.S., Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany gives Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program. It has drawn mixed support from both Capitol Hill and Americans in general. Obama is also set to give a speech at American University in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, in which he is expected to vehemently defend the deal and stress its importance.

President Reuven Rivlin warned of the dire consequences of the Iran nuclear agreement in a meeting with US Democrats on Wednesday. “We fear that this agreement is a first step in the legitimization of Iran’s policies and strategies, and only acts to further destabilize a chaotic region,” Rivlin told the delegation. After emphasizing the two countries’ shared commitment to democracy and human rights, Rivlin cautioned that the Iran deal threatens these values. “The current Iranian regime, act with a dangerous combination of aggressiveness, fundamentalism, and state sponsored terrorism – threatening even without nuclear weapons, freedom and democracy in this region and around the world,” Rivlin said. The president was speaking to a delegation of Democrats, lead by House Minority Whip, Rep Steny Hoyer, visiting Israel as part of a trip organized by US pro-Israel lobby AIPAC. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Rivlin stressed that the US-Israel alliance would remain strong even if Congress approves the Iran nuclear deal, and that Israel trusted its allies, especially the US, for support “in this crucial time.” In response, delegation leader Hoyer spoke of “the unbreakable bond” between the US and Israel and said that at the time the two countries need to be “united and not divided.” Hoyer also praised Rivlin’s strong condemnation of last week’s terror attacks, where an ultra-Orthodox man stabbed six at the Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade, killing one, and two Palestinian homes were firebombed, allegedly by Jewish settlers, killing an 18-month old. Advertisement Israeli lawmakers had voiced strong opposition to the landmark nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers last month, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning that the agreement was “a historic mistake.” Congressional Democrats were increasingly confident Monday that they will have the one-third votes in either chamber to defend a presidential veto against any legislative bid to overturn the Iran nuclear deal. Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to push through a “resolution disapproval,” effectively keeping the US out of the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran by a US-led group of six world powers. But US President Barack Obama has promised to veto such a bill, forcing Congress to produce a two-thirds majority in both houses to override the veto. While Republicans control a majority in both chambers, they cannot muster a two-thirds veto-proof majority without at least 44 Democratic House representatives and 13 Democratic senators. Times of Israel Staff, Tamar Pileggi and Jonathan Beck contributed to this report.

News article:
Obama: If Congress kills Iran Deal, Rockets will Fall on Tel Aviv By Raphael Ahren http://www.timesofisrael.com/obama-if-congress-kills-iran-deal-rockets-will-rain-on-tel-aviv/ President warns US Jews that without nuclear pact, America will have to attack Iran — and Israel will bear the brunt of the response. WASHINGTON — If the US Congress shoots down the Iranian nuclear deal, America will eventually be pressured into a military strike against Tehran’s nuclear facilities, which will in turn increase terror against Israel, US President Barack Obama told Jewish leaders Tuesday, a source who was present at the meeting said. During the two-hour meeting, Obama said it was legitimate for opponents of the deal to lobby lawmakers to reject it, but added that a discussion focused on personal attacks, rather than the merits of the deal, could jeopardize the coherence of the American Jewish community and ultimately the resilience of US-Israel relations, according to Greg Rosenbaum, the chair of the National Jewish Democratic Council. In a bid to convince the US Jewish community to support the deal, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden hosted 20 Jewish leaders from across the political and religious spectrum at the White House’s Cabinet Room, hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged members of the Jewish Federations of North America in a video address to fight the deal. Speaking to the Israel Diplomatic Correspondents Association after the meeting with the president, Rosenbaum said that Obama had meticulously tried to debunk the arguments against the Iran deal, while acknowledging that the agreement was “by no means perfect.” Some of the opponents of the deal have complained that the administration has been portraying them as warmongers, by asserting that the only alternative to the deal — signed last month in Vienna between Iran and six world powers — is war, according to several officials who attended the meeting. Obama replied that he truly believes that if the deal will be rejected by Congress, the ultimate result will be a military strike, Rosenbaum said. If Congress succeeds in killing the deal and Iran were to subsequently walk away from the agreement and start enriching uranium again to weapons-grade levels, the opponents of the deal will pressure the US government into launching a preemptive strike against the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities, the president was said to have argued. “But the result of such a strike won’t be war with Iran,” Rosenbaum said, quoting the president. Iran is not going to launch a full-fledged assault on America, knowing that its military, with an annual budget of $15 billion, stands no chance against the US Army and its budget of close to $600 billion, the president said. Rather, Iran’s terrorist proxies will attack American and Israeli targets, for instance by ramming aircraft carriers or arming terrorist groups along Israel’s borders. “They will fight this asymmetrically. That means more support for terrorism, more Hezbollah rockets falling on Tel Aviv,” Rosenbaum quoted Obama as saying. “I can assure that Israel will bear the brunt of the asymmetrical response that Iran will have to a military strike on its nuclear facilities.” During the White House briefing, Obama indicated that he was ready and willing to meet Netanyahu and discuss, “in more than general terms,” upgrading Washington’s military assistance to Israel, but that the Israeli leader has been unwilling to do so at this point, Rosenbaum said. The president also implied that he had offered a meeting with Netanyahu – similar to his meeting with leaders of the Arab Gulf states – but that the prime minister had rebuffed the overture, according to Rosenbaum. The president believes that Netanyahu refuses to hold discussions about financial compensation because he intends to fight the deal, he said. During the White House briefing, which was characterized by participants as “serious” and “contentious,” opponents and advocates of the deal clashed verbally, each side accusing the other of badmouthing it. Opponents said the administration portrayed them as seeking war with Iran, while those in favor of the deal said they had been accused of being kapos and helping to prepare for a second Holocaust. Obama said he was under no illusion that he could convince all Jewish leaders to agree with him on the Iran issue, and that opponents have a legitimate right to spend as much money as they wish in lobbying against the agreement. If, however, the debate is not held on the merits of the deal but with name-calling, invective, and misleading and false facts, “I fear you are going to weaken the coherence of the Jewish community and ultimately the strength of the US-Israel relationship,” Obama said, according to Rosenbaum. In a prolonged back-and-forth with Lee Rosenberg, chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Obama reportedly said it was fine for the organization to spend millions of dollars on efforts to kill the deal. But, he added, AIPAC’s newspaper ads should not say that Jews who support the deal are bad Jews or hurting Israel’s security. The heated debate over the deal’s risks is tearing the Jewish community apart and causing “irreparable” damage, he said. Indeed, the president told AIPAC that the newspaper ads and fact sheets it has been handing out are “inaccurate” and that he has to spend nearly an hour with every legislator that AIPAC approached to set the record straight, according to Rosenbaum. During his video address earlier Tuesday to American Jews, Netanyahu warned that, if ratified, the nuclear deal would lead to war and a “nightmare” regional nuclear arms race. “This deal will bring war,” he cautioned. “Iran can keep the deal or Iran can cheat on the deal,” Either way, it will have the bomb, Netanyahu said, before adding, “hundreds of bombs.” Furthermore, he said, addressing the audience, Iran has been building intercontinental ballistic missiles in order “to hit you,” not Israel. The American Jewish community is seen as a key barometer for the fate of the deal, as Congress enjoys a 60-day review period of the agreement ahead of a crucial vote on a resolution of disapproval or approval in September. A number of Jewish organizations have called on members to lobby their representatives to oppose the agreement, which critics say won’t prevent Tehran from becoming a nuclear power and enables it to bolster its support for extremist regional elements. Other organizations, like the American Jewish Committee, say that they are still reviewing the details of the agreement, and have yet to determine an official stance on it. J Street has been at the vanguard of advocacy efforts for the deal, quickly announcing its support for the agreement and arguing that it presents the best opportunity for reining in Iran’s centrifuges.

Obama: If Congress kills Iran Deal, Rockets will Fall on Tel Aviv By Raphael Ahren http://www.timesofisrael.com/obama-if-congress-kills-iran-deal-rockets-will-rain-on-tel-aviv/ President warns US Jews that without nuclear pact, America will have to attack Iran — and Israel will bear the brunt of the response. WASHINGTON — If the US Congress shoots down the Iranian nuclear deal, America will eventually be pressured into a military strike against Tehran’s nuclear facilities, which will in turn increase terror against Israel, US President Barack Obama told Jewish leaders Tuesday, a source who was present at the meeting said. During the two-hour meeting, Obama said it was legitimate for opponents of the deal to lobby lawmakers to reject it, but added that a discussion focused on personal attacks, rather than the merits of the deal, could jeopardize the coherence of the American Jewish community and ultimately the resilience of US-Israel relations, according to Greg Rosenbaum, the chair of the National Jewish Democratic Council. In a bid to convince the US Jewish community to support the deal, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden hosted 20 Jewish leaders from across the political and religious spectrum at the White House’s Cabinet Room, hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged members of the Jewish Federations of North America in a video address to fight the deal. Speaking to the Israel Diplomatic Correspondents Association after the meeting with the president, Rosenbaum said that Obama had meticulously tried to debunk the arguments against the Iran deal, while acknowledging that the agreement was “by no means perfect.” Some of the opponents of the deal have complained that the administration has been portraying them as warmongers, by asserting that the only alternative to the deal — signed last month in Vienna between Iran and six world powers — is war, according to several officials who attended the meeting. Obama replied that he truly believes that if the deal will be rejected by Congress, the ultimate result will be a military strike, Rosenbaum said. If Congress succeeds in killing the deal and Iran were to subsequently walk away from the agreement and start enriching uranium again to weapons-grade levels, the opponents of the deal will pressure the US government into launching a preemptive strike against the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities, the president was said to have argued. “But the result of such a strike won’t be war with Iran,” Rosenbaum said, quoting the president. Iran is not going to launch a full-fledged assault on America, knowing that its military, with an annual budget of $15 billion, stands no chance against the US Army and its budget of close to $600 billion, the president said. Rather, Iran’s terrorist proxies will attack American and Israeli targets, for instance by ramming aircraft carriers or arming terrorist groups along Israel’s borders. “They will fight this asymmetrically. That means more support for terrorism, more Hezbollah rockets falling on Tel Aviv,” Rosenbaum quoted Obama as saying. “I can assure that Israel will bear the brunt of the asymmetrical response that Iran will have to a military strike on its nuclear facilities.” During the White House briefing, Obama indicated that he was ready and willing to meet Netanyahu and discuss, “in more than general terms,” upgrading Washington’s military assistance to Israel, but that the Israeli leader has been unwilling to do so at this point, Rosenbaum said. The president also implied that he had offered a meeting with Netanyahu – similar to his meeting with leaders of the Arab Gulf states – but that the prime minister had rebuffed the overture, according to Rosenbaum. The president believes that Netanyahu refuses to hold discussions about financial compensation because he intends to fight the deal, he said. During the White House briefing, which was characterized by participants as “serious” and “contentious,” opponents and advocates of the deal clashed verbally, each side accusing the other of badmouthing it. Opponents said the administration portrayed them as seeking war with Iran, while those in favor of the deal said they had been accused of being kapos and helping to prepare for a second Holocaust. Obama said he was under no illusion that he could convince all Jewish leaders to agree with him on the Iran issue, and that opponents have a legitimate right to spend as much money as they wish in lobbying against the agreement.

News article:
Tehran – Speaking to an audience west of the capital, Tehran, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani predictably singled out Israel as the only country disappointed with its recent nuclear agreement with the international community, according to FARS news. “Today you observe that the only regime which is crying out from morning to night is the usurper Zionist regime,” he said, referring to the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has repeatedly appealed to world leaders, as well as American politicians and most recently American Jewry, to oppose the deal. Netanyahu has argued that the deal officially, brokered between US Secretary of State John Kerry on behalf of the P5 +1 nations and Iran’s chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, provides Iran with multiple means of becoming a nuclear threshold state and infuses it with billions of dollars with which to finance its proxies throughout the Middle East. Dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, both sides agreed on the plan reached on July 14. A week later, it was endorsed by the United State Security Council and became international legislation. However, in the American political arena, the deal still faces an obstacle in the form of a Congressional vote and politicians hostile to the deal, who Rouhani referred to as “American warmongers,” hail from either side of the Republican- Democrat divide. “Today all the regional nations and the great Iranian nation, except the usurper Zionist regime and the American warmongers, are happy with this big agreement.” On Thursday, opponents of the deal, who need the support of 44 House Democrats and 13 Senate Democrats to strike down the JCPA, won a significant victory whenSenator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, expressed his intention to vote against the President Barack Obama’s landmark diplomatic achievement. The Senior Jewish Senator was also joined by another ranking Jewish figure, Congressman Eliot Engel, from New York, in his opposition to the agreement, which Schumer said “would allow Iran, after ten to fifteen years, to be a nuclear threshold state with the blessing of the world community.”‎

News article:
Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon implied that Israel may seek to assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists in order stop Iran's nuclear program in an interview with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, released on Friday. In response to the question "So will we see further deaths of Iranian nuclear scientists through attacks or malware compromising Iranian computer networks?", Ya'alon said: "We should be ready to defend ourselves. I'm not responsible for the lives of Iranian scientists." Ya'alon also didn't rule out the possibility that Israel would bomb Iranian nuclear facilities should Iran violate the deal and resume its military nuclear program. "In such a case, we will have to discuss it," Ya'alon told Der Spiegel. "At the end, it is very clear. One way or another, the Iranian military nuclear ambitions should be stopped. "We can in no way tolerate an Iran with nuclear weapons. We prefer for this to be done through a deal or sanctions, but in the end, Israel should be able to defend itself." In the Der Spiegel interview, Ya'alon reiterated Israeli objections to the deal, reached between Iran and world powers in July. Ya'alon warned that the deal would make Iran into a nuclear threshold state, and that lifting the sanctions would lead to an increase in the funds Iran transfers to terrorist groups around the Middle East. Five Iranian scientists were reportedly assassinated between 2012 and 2014, and though Israel has never commented officially on these killings, major Western media, quoting off-the-record Israeli intelligence sources, have attributed them to the Mossad. In March 2014, CBS News reported that following pressure from the Obama administration, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had ordered the Mossad to stop the assassinations. CBS national correspondent Dan Raviv, an expert on Israeli intelligence, reported that the Mossad "ran an assassination campaign for several years aimed at Iran's top nuclear scientists. The purpose was to slow the progress made by Iran, which Israel feels certain is aimed at developing nuclear weapons; and to deter trained and educated Iranians from joining their country's nuclear program." "Remarkably, the Israeli assassins were never caught, obviously having long-established safe houses inside Iran – although several Iranians who may have helped the Mossad were arrested and executed," the CBS report stated.

News article:
Israel's defense minister hinted on Friday that the Jewish state's intelligence services were behind the rash of killings of Iranian nuclear scientists. In an interview with the German-language Der Spiegel, Moshe Ya'alon said that he bore no responsibility "for the life expectancy of Iranian scientists." "Ultimately it is very clear, one way or another, Iran’s military nuclear program must be stopped,” Ya’alon said. “We will act in any way and are not willing to tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. We prefer that this be done by means of sanctions, but in the end, Israel should be able to defend itself." Ya'alon told Der Spiegel that he believed historians would one day look back on the Iran nuclear agreement as an instance in which Western politicians sought to "kick the can down the road" by preferring to avoid dealing with the issue. The defense minister compared the nuclear deal to other examples in which Western leaders sought the path of reconciliation in an attempt to find a solution, only to discover that they paid a hefty price afterward - a reference to the Munich agreement between Britain and Germany just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. In the interview with Der Spiegel, Ya'alon repeated his stance that the nuclear negotiations between the world powers and Iran were "a historic mistake." The defense minister maintained that the agreement with Iran would enable it to remain a "nuclear threshold state" that would be permitted to enrich uranium within a decade. Ya'alon said that the lifting of economic sanctions against Iran would provide the Islamic Republic with a windfall of hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can more easily "export the revolution." That means more money to Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Houthis in Yemen, and Shi'ites in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, Ya'alon said. The defense minister lamented the fact that the agreement did not address "missiles that endanger Israel and parts of Europe." He told Der Spiegel that the only effective strategy against Iran would be to leave the regime with a choice - either it acquires nuclear weapons or it is permitted to survive. Earlier this year, a senior Iranian security official said that the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps thwarted a Mossad assassination attempt against one of its nuclear scientists. “In the last two years, the Zionist enemy was trying hard to assassinate an Iranian nuclear scientist, but the timely presence of the IRGC security forces thwarted the terrorist operation,” Col. Ya’qoub Baqeri, the deputy chief liaison officer of the Flight Guards Corps, told the country’s Fars News Agency. The Revolutionary Guards is “duty-bound to protect the lives of the country’s nuclear scientists,” said Baqeri. According to a report by CBS News last year, the Obama administration pressured Israel to stop carrying out assassinations inside Iran against the country’s nuclear scientists. Israel has never admitted to carrying out such killings. At least five scientists have been killed, mostly by car bombs. Mossad officials concluded that the assassination campaign became too dangerous for its spies, said the report. This came amidst Washington’s attempt to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. Meanwhile, Baqeri also told Fars that Iranian air marshals from the IRGC have foiled Islamic State plots to hijack Iranian passenger planes in recent years. “The ISIL [Daesh] and other Salafi groups sought to hit a blow to our country this way, but fortunately, they couldn’t put their plots into practice,” Baqeri said.

News article:
Israel's defense minister hinted on Friday that the Jewish state's intelligence services were behind the rash of killings of Iranian nuclear scientists. In an interview with the German-language Der Spiegel, Moshe Ya'alon said that he bore no responsibility "for the life expectancy of Iranian scientists." "Ultimately it is very clear, one way or another, Iran’s military nuclear program must be stopped,” Ya’alon said. “We will act in any way and are not willing to tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. We prefer that this be done by means of sanctions, but in the end, Israel should be able to defend itself." Ya'alon told Der Spiegel that he believed historians would one day look back on the Iran nuclear agreement as an instance in which Western politicians sought to "kick the can down the road" by preferring to avoid dealing with the issue. The defense minister compared the nuclear deal to other examples in which Western leaders sought the path of reconciliation in an attempt to find a solution, only to discover that they paid a hefty price afterward - a reference to the Munich agreement between Britain and Germany just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. In the interview with Der Spiegel, Ya'alon repeated his stance that the nuclear negotiations between the world powers and Iran were "a historic mistake." The defense minister maintained that the agreement with Iran would enable it to remain a "nuclear threshold state" that would be permitted to enrich uranium within a decade. Ya'alon said that the lifting of economic sanctions against Iran would provide the Islamic Republic with a windfall of hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can more easily "export the revolution." That means more money to Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Houthis in Yemen, and Shi'ites in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, Ya'alon said. The defense minister lamented the fact that the agreement did not address "missiles that endanger Israel and parts of Europe." He told Der Spiegel that the only effective strategy against Iran would be to leave the regime with a choice - either it acquires nuclear weapons or it is permitted to survive. Earlier this year, a senior Iranian security official said that the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps thwarted a Mossad assassination attempt against one of its nuclear scientists. “In the last two years, the Zionist enemy was trying hard to assassinate an Iranian nuclear scientist, but the timely presence of the IRGC security forces thwarted the terrorist operation,” Col. Ya’qoub Baqeri, the deputy chief liaison officer of the Flight Guards Corps, told the country’s Fars News Agency. The Revolutionary Guards is “duty-bound to protect the lives of the country’s nuclear scientists,” said Baqeri. According to a report by CBS News last year, the Obama administration pressured Israel to stop carrying out assassinations inside Iran against the country’s nuclear scientists. Israel has never admitted to carrying out such killings. At least five scientists have been killed, mostly by car bombs. Mossad officials concluded that the assassination campaign became too dangerous for its spies, said the report. This came amidst Washington’s attempt to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. Meanwhile, Baqeri also told Fars that Iranian air marshals from the IRGC have foiled Islamic State plots to hijack Iranian passenger planes in recent years. “The ISIL [Daesh] and other Salafi groups sought to hit a blow to our country this way, but fortunately, they couldn’t put their plots into practice,” Baqeri said.

News article:
BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA — At a somber, well-attended Birmingham Jewish Federation Board of Directors meeting August 6, members of the board unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Iran agreement, amid fears that it could be highly dangerous for our country, Israel and the entire world. “This is a defining moment,” the resolution stated. “As Americans, as Jews and as people who love and support Israel, we are deeply concerned that this agreement leaves the entire Middle East less stable and the entire world more vulnerable to Iran’s radical agenda.” The resolution was modeled on a similar resolution passed recently by the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston. About a dozen other Jewish Federations throughout the country, including some of the largest ones, have passed such resolutions. Other Federations are in the process of considering such measures. During the meeting, board members were pensive, listening to one another respectfully, as a wide range of people shared their views, with virtually all of them opposing the nuclear agreement with Iran. Among those encouraging board members to oppose the Iran agreement was Temple Emanu-El’s Rabbi Jonathan Miller, a Reform rabbi who met with Members of Congress in Washington recently to urge them to vote against the accord. At the meeting, Temple Beth-El Rabbi Randall Konigsburg, a Conservative rabbi, questioned whether adopting such a resolution was the best strategy right now. He said he feared that the intensifying debate over the Iran deal has “pitted the Jewish community against the White House,” something that could result in negative consequences. Others shared his concern but felt that the potential danger of the deal justified taking that risk. A question was raised as to whether passing such a resolution would alienate members of the Jewish community who support the Iran deal. Board member Lisa Engel, a veteran volunteer leader, answered by explaining that the resolution did not purport to speak for the Birmingham Jewish community but rather to only express the sentiments of The Birmingham Jewish Federation’s Board of Directors. Federation President Jerry Held led the meeting, stressing the historic nature of the issue and providing ample time for everyone to speak. When the time came to vote, it passed unanimously. The resolution will be sent to Alabama’s Members of Congress, the general Alabama media and Jewish Federations of North America, our Federation’s national organization. At the start of the meeting, Jerry told the board that the Executive Committee felt adopting such a resolution was important to demonstrate to our elected officials and the general public how our Federation board feels about the Iran deal. TEXT OF RESOLUTION The Birmingham Jewish Federation’s Board of Directors believes the proposed nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is cause for great concern; we are deeply disappointed with the details of the plan. Regretfully, we have no choice but to oppose it, and we urge others to join us. Advertisement We share the goal of achieving a negotiated peaceful solution to Iran’s nuclear activities. Additionally, we support the efforts of the United States and its allies to arrive at a diplomatic solution, and we are grateful for their efforts. We also acknowledge that there are diverse views within our community, but ultimately this issue must remain above politics and reflect our collective determination to ensure a stronger agreement with one of the world’s most dangerous regimes. There is simply too much at stake, not only for Israel, but also for the United States and indeed the world, to remain silent about our concerns. The proposed agreement, the success of which is dependent on questionable verification of Iranian compliance, puts Israel and others in harm’s way against a sworn enemy in the world’s most volatile region. Advertisement As it currently stands, the proposed agreement only serves to delay critical aspects of Iran’s nuclear ambitions, affirming Iran’s place as a threshold nuclear state. We must heed the large, diverse and growing number of independent and nonpartisan experts and organizations who have raised serious concerns since the release of the details of the agreement. In particular, critical issues have been raised relating to inspections and verification, weaponization activity, dismantlement of nuclear infrastructure, and the duration of some of the most sensitive components in the agreement. These issues, and the resulting vulnerabilities, are sufficient reasons to let our elected officials know that the existing agreement is too risky to approve and tougher terms will be needed. Therefore, it is critical that we urge their disapproval of the agreement. The Iranian regime has clearly stated and acted on its desire to wipe Israel off the map by providing potentially devastating and increasingly sophisticated, accurate and powerful missile technology to Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Its intentions were also apparent at public rallies calling for Israel’s destruction and “death to America.” These very real dangers seem to have been ignored in the negotiation to curb Iran’s nuclear weapon-building capacity. Leaders from across the Israeli political spectrum, from Labor Party head Yitzhak Herzog to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have expressed grave concerns about the proposed deal and what it could mean for Israel’s security. In the very short term, lifting sanctions on Iran will mean a boon for Hamas and Hezbollah and will provide even more money to fuel even greater Iranian sponsored terrorism around the world. This is a defining moment. As Americans, as Jews and as people who love and support Israel, we are deeply concerned that this agreement leaves the entire Middle East less stable and the entire world more vulnerable to Iran’s radical agenda.

News article:
The debate on the Iran Deal is getting heated all around, as more and more U.S Representatives make their intentions clear vis-a-vis the upcoming vote in September. Many have already expressed deep concerns about the deal, most prominent of whom so far has been United States Senator for New York, Charles Schumer, who explained his objection by stating: "To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great". And as soon as Senator Schumer spoke against the position of the current U.S Administration, all hell broke loose. The New York Times' Editorial page sends him a direct message of vendetta from the White House: Advertisement "New York's senior senator, Chuck Schumer, has cast his lot with Republican presidential candidates, other hardliners and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in declaring his opposition to the nuclear agreement ... Given Mr. Schumer's wrong-headed and irresponsible decision, Democrats may want to reconsider whether he is the best candidate to be their next leader in the Senate, a job he desperately wants". Senator Schumer, who has been in office for over 16 years, has made it clear that this was not an easy decision for him, one that he reached after serious deliberations: "Every several years or so a legislator is called upon to cast a momentous vote in which the stakes are high and both sides of the issue are vociferous in their views. Over the years, I have learned that the best way to treat such decisions is to study the issue carefully, hear the full, unfiltered explanation of those for and against, and then, without regard to pressure, politics or party, make a decision solely based on the merits". Schumer put his finger on the one thing that is missing from the debate on the Iran Deal: judge it by its MERITS! Advertisement Those who oppose the deal, make a very clear case against it, based on concrete and visible elements in the deal itself. Commentary Magazine reported last week (Aug 3) of a testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Amb. Robert G. Joseph, Ph.D, formerly Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, and the person who in 2003 led the nuclear negotiations with Libya. Dr. Joseph testified the Iran deal is a "bad agreement" and indicated some of its fatal flaws - it does not effectively detect cheating unless Iran decides to do it openly; it leaves a large‐scale nuclear infrastructure in place that could be used to break out with a "virtually zero" breakout time; it has "snap‐back" provisions that are illusory and Iran is permitted to continue work on long-range ballistic missiles that have no use other than eventual deployment of nuclear weapons. His conclusion was unambiguous: "As a result, the threat to the U.S. homeland and to our NATO allies of an Iran armed with nuclear tipped ballistic missiles will increase not decrease under the anticipated agreement". And yet, those who support the deal, or better yet - support the dealmakers - do not bother to get into these "technical" insignificancies, but rather focus on the bigger picture: anyone who is against the deal is acting "irresponsibly" (NY times above), is a clear-cut "warmonger" who prefers "war" to "diplomacy" and the most heard word of the day? Yes, you got that right: "Iraq", the ultimate debate killer. But this is not their only line of defense. In their desperation, as every day that goes by exposes their shame (resulting in less and less support for the deal with the general public), the deal proponents evoke ugly tools to stifle any debate. Advertisement First and foremost among these is the one targeted at Jewish American legislators: the egregious "dual loyalty" claim. This is an old form of anti-Semitism, which goes hand in hand with words like "lobby" and "millions of dollars", used often to attack those who disagree with the deal and happen to be Jewish. "Dual loyalty" means that Schumer and others made their decision based on "Jewish" or "Israeli" interests alone, and not those of the United States of America and her allies. As if there is ONLY one voice speaking for the American people, and that cannot be that of the "Jews". Words like "traitor" have been spreading all over social media against Senator Schumer, who would have probably been hailed a "hero" by the same people had he stuck by the Administration's position. However, it seems as a Jew, Schumer is not allowed to "break ranks" and make up his own mind based on his clear thinking. In doing so, he is clearly an "Israel-firster" and a "Netanyahu marionette". How have we come to this, that in the United States of 2015, we are breathing new life into the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (the 1903 Russian publication of an anti-Semitic hoax purporting to describe global Jewish domination) ?! Don't get me wrong: yes, Israel has a lot at stake when it comes to the deal with Iran. The regime in Tehran is a terrorist dictatorial one, which calls for Israel's destruction, while executing expansionist policies and financing murderous organizations fighting the West and Israel. Moreover, Israel is staring directly at Iranian weapons of war, hundred of thousands of missiles from the North and the South. However, as Amb. Joseph stated above, it is the U.S homeland and the U.S's NATO allies who are threatened as a result of the deal, whose rejection is an American, not only Israeli, interest.

Words like "traitor" have been spreading all over social media against Senator Schumer, who would have probably been hailed a "hero" by the same people had he stuck by the Administration's position. However, it seems as a Jew, Schumer is not allowed to "break ranks" and make up his own mind based on his clear thinking. In doing so, he is clearly an "Israel-firster" and a "Netanyahu marionette". How have we come to this, that in the United States of 2015, we are breathing new life into the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (the 1903 Russian publication of an anti-Semitic hoax purporting to describe global Jewish domination) ?! Don't get me wrong: yes, Israel has a lot at stake when it comes to the deal with Iran. The regime in Tehran is a terrorist dictatorial one, which calls for Israel's destruction, while executing expansionist policies and financing murderous organizations fighting the West and Israel. Moreover, Israel is staring directly at Iranian weapons of war, hundred of thousands of missiles from the North and the South. However, as Amb. Joseph stated above, it is the U.S homeland and the U.S's NATO allies who are threatened as a result of the deal, whose rejection is an American, not only Israeli, interest.

News article:
The debate on the Iran Deal is getting heated all around, as more and more U.S Representatives make their intentions clear vis-a-vis the upcoming vote in September. Many have already expressed deep concerns about the deal, most prominent of whom so far has been United States Senator for New York, Charles Schumer, who explained his objection by stating: "To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great". And as soon as Senator Schumer spoke against the position of the current U.S Administration, all hell broke loose. The New York Times' Editorial page sends him a direct message of vendetta from the White House: Advertisement "New York's senior senator, Chuck Schumer, has cast his lot with Republican presidential candidates, other hardliners and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in declaring his opposition to the nuclear agreement ... Given Mr. Schumer's wrong-headed and irresponsible decision, Democrats may want to reconsider whether he is the best candidate to be their next leader in the Senate, a job he desperately wants". Senator Schumer, who has been in office for over 16 years, has made it clear that this was not an easy decision for him, one that he reached after serious deliberations: "Every several years or so a legislator is called upon to cast a momentous vote in which the stakes are high and both sides of the issue are vociferous in their views. Over the years, I have learned that the best way to treat such decisions is to study the issue carefully, hear the full, unfiltered explanation of those for and against, and then, without regard to pressure, politics or party, make a decision solely based on the merits". Schumer put his finger on the one thing that is missing from the debate on the Iran Deal: judge it by its MERITS! Advertisement Those who oppose the deal, make a very clear case against it, based on concrete and visible elements in the deal itself. Commentary Magazine reported last week (Aug 3) of a testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Amb. Robert G. Joseph, Ph.D, formerly Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, and the person who in 2003 led the nuclear negotiations with Libya. Dr. Joseph testified the Iran deal is a "bad agreement" and indicated some of its fatal flaws - it does not effectively detect cheating unless Iran decides to do it openly; it leaves a large‐scale nuclear infrastructure in place that could be used to break out with a "virtually zero" breakout time; it has "snap‐back" provisions that are illusory and Iran is permitted to continue work on long-range ballistic missiles that have no use other than eventual deployment of nuclear weapons. His conclusion was unambiguous: "As a result, the threat to the U.S. homeland and to our NATO allies of an Iran armed with nuclear tipped ballistic missiles will increase not decrease under the anticipated agreement". And yet, those who support the deal, or better yet - support the dealmakers - do not bother to get into these "technical" insignificancies, but rather focus on the bigger picture: anyone who is against the deal is acting "irresponsibly" (NY times above), is a clear-cut "warmonger" who prefers "war" to "diplomacy" and the most heard word of the day? Yes, you got that right: "Iraq", the ultimate debate killer. But this is not their only line of defense. In their desperation, as every day that goes by exposes their shame (resulting in less and less support for the deal with the general public), the deal proponents evoke ugly tools to stifle any debate. Advertisement First and foremost among these is the one targeted at Jewish American legislators: the egregious "dual loyalty" claim. This is an old form of anti-Semitism, which goes hand in hand with words like "lobby" and "millions of dollars", used often to attack those who disagree with the deal and happen to be Jewish. "Dual loyalty" means that Schumer and others made their decision based on "Jewish" or "Israeli" interests alone, and not those of the United States of America and her allies. As if there is ONLY one voice speaking for the American people, and that cannot be that of the "Jews". Words like "traitor" have been spreading all over social media against Senator Schumer, who would have probably been hailed a "hero" by the same people had he stuck by the Administration's position. However, it seems as a Jew, Schumer is not allowed to "break ranks" and make up his own mind based on his clear thinking. In doing so, he is clearly an "Israel-firster" and a "Netanyahu marionette". How have we come to this, that in the United States of 2015, we are breathing new life into the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (the 1903 Russian publication of an anti-Semitic hoax purporting to describe global Jewish domination) ?! Don't get me wrong: yes, Israel has a lot at stake when it comes to the deal with Iran.

News article:
Jerusalem – Israel anticipates that the US Congress will heed its call and vote down the Iran nuclear deal against the wishes of the Obama administration, the head of the powerful Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee told Israel Radio on Tuesday. “I’m convinced that the American Congress will reject by a large majority the nuclear agreement with Iran,” MK Tzachi Hanegbi (Likud) said. “There is a plethora of explanations and reasons as to why the agreement weakens the United States.” Hanegbi told Israel Radio that the government in Jerusalem was urging members of Congress to view the agreement through the prism of “what was good for their country, not Israel.” The Israeli government certainly has its work cut out for it, especially after Senator Brian Schatz said on Monday he backs the US-led international nuclear deal with Iran, becoming the 16th senator to do so and moving President Barack Obama one vote closer to locking in enough Senate votes to make the deal fly. A liberal, Jewish-born lawmaker from Hawaii, Schatz had been expected to come down in favor of the deal. But his decision was noteworthy because it came just a few days after another Jewish senator, Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York, announced his opposition to the Iran agreement. Schumer’s decision last week caused an uproar as he usually lines up behind the president. He is the No. 3 senator and wants to become Senate Democratic leader after the 2016 election. In a statement, Schatz said he was backing the pact between six world powers and Iran because it is the best option for keeping nuclear bombs out of Tehran’s hands. “Iran must never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, and that is why I support this agreement,” Schatz said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes the agreement, as do some Jewish groups in the United States. Most Republicans have also said they oppose the deal, which was unveiled on July 14. It is designed to curb Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting of economic sanctions. Republicans plan to push for a congressional “resolution of disapproval” that could cripple the deal. Obama is pinning his hopes on Democrats, in the minority in both houses of Congress. Several key votes on the deal are likely in weeks ahead after Congress returns from its August recess. Schatz said no military option could do what the agreement would do – deny Iran a bomb for at least 15 years. “This agreement should not be compared to an imaginary deal where Iran rolled over and eliminated all its centrifuges and all peaceful nuclear energy generation. That was never seriously on the table,” he said. Congress has until Sept. 17 to vote on any resolution of disapproval of the agreement. After Schumer’s announcement last week, Democrats said they were still confident they could rebuff Republican attempts to sink the agreement. Content is provided courtesy of the Jerusalem Post

News article:
After World War II, Jews everywhere promised that never again would they be silent or sit idly by while evil tries to destroy the Jewish people. Iranian leaders have repeatedly promised to destroy the Jewish state. It appears that the nuclear deal will give them the means to do it. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter American Jews, who are overwhelmingly Democrats, will have to choose the Jewish state’s survival and security over the legacy of and loyalty to a lame duck president from the Democratic Party. They must help stop the Vienna nuclear deal by convincing Democratic senators and congressmen to override a presidential veto. Otherwise, the Jewish promise of "never again" is an empty phrase. Jews Under Attack 'Jewish power' is an illusion Ben-Dror Yemini Op-ed: If opposition to Iran deal continues to grow, it won't be because of successful campaign launched by Netanyahu or Jewish lobby, but because of Obama's failed marketing of agreement. 'Jewish power' is an illusion Israeli Jews feel betrayed by Obama and are hoping that American Jews will join the fight. According to a new poll conducted in Israel, 73 percent of the Jewish Israeli public think President Barack Obama was not looking out for Israel’s interests when negotiating the nuclear deal, and 76 percent of Jewish Israelis believe Israel should fight to torpedo the Iranian nuclear deal in Congress. Thoughtful and reasonable people who have read the 159 pages of the Iran nuclear deal must admit that the deal with Iran is a very bad one. According to the best case scenario, which assumes the unlikely possibility that the Iranians will not cheat, Iran will be free to legitimately have as many nuclear weapons as they desire after 10 years, purchase conventional weaponry in five years, and be able to purchase ballistic missile technology in eight years. Under this agreement, its breakout time, which is the time it would take them to put together enough weapons-grade uranium for one bomb, will be one year. Democratic Senator Eliot Engel (L), who has come out against the Iran nuclear deal, with Secretary of State John Kerry (Photo: AP) According to the more realistic scenario, in which the Iranian Islamic regime will probably cheat as they have cheated for the last 20 years regarding their nuclear program and other international agreements, they could have a nuclear bomb by the end of Obama’s term. After the sanctions relief by the beginning of 2016, if Iran cheats or breaks the agreement, their breakout time will be around two to three months. The details of the deal enable and encourage Iranian cheating. The United States' concessions on inspections of nuclear sites have allowed Iran to pre-approve them and to delay inspections by IAEA for up to 78 days, which many say is clearly more than enough time for Iran to scrub down any possible violations. But under both scenarios, it is much worse. After the initial compliance of the deal by Iran by mid- October and IAEA verification by mid- December, Iran will be given by beginning of 2016, hundreds of billion dollars’ worth of unfrozen assets and sanctions relief allowing it to become a regional conventional military power in the Middle East and to militarily strengthen their terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Syrian President Bashar Assad in their fight against Israel. While Israel has received since its founding 67 years ago a total of $124.3 billion in aid by the US, Iran will be given by the US up to $150 billion as an immediate signing bonus. In recent years, the Israeli economy and daily life was twice paralyzed by Hamas and Hezbollah missiles attacks. Imagine what the next war against Israel will look like. Hezbollah now has more than 100,000 missiles targeting the entire State of Israel from the north and Hamas has thousands more in the south. The Iranian deal will guarantee that Israel will have to face at least two wars in the next decade. In the short term, they will face a more deadly conventional war and in the long run a possible nuclear war. It seems that the main argument Obama supporters use to convince Jews and Democrats to vote for the deal is loyalty for the Democratic Party’s president. With knowledge of these horrible scenarios, how can any Jew vote for or support a deal that will adversely affect many Jewish generations to come in order to salvage Obama’s political legacy? American Jews have experienced this before. In the 1930s and '40s, most Jews in America were reluctant to try and ineffective at rescuing their Jewish brethren in Europe during the Holocaust. The excuse was that most Jews were either new immigrants themselves or first generation Americans, and were afraid of the anti-Semitism that existed in the US at the time. In 2015, US Jews have no such excuses. A two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress is needed to assert congressional dominance over the Presidential veto. There are 54 Republicans in the US Senate and they will all vote against the deal. To override a veto, the Republicans need to convince 13 Democrats to vote against it. There are nine Jewish Democrats in the Senate, including Senators Chuck Schumer (NY), Ben Cardin (MD), Richard Bennet (CO), Richard Blumenthal (CT), Barbara Boxer (CA), Dianne Feinstein (CA), Al Franken (MN), Brian Schatz (HI) and Ron Wyden (OR). Senator Schumer came out as opposing the deal, but Boxer chose liberalism over her Jewish roots. Five non-Jewish Democrats must join in. But till now, it seems that the Democratic Party lacks few righteous gentiles to support Israel. There are 247 Republicans in the House. They need 290 members to override a veto, which means they would need 43 Democrats to abandon Obama. There are 18 Jewish Democrats in the House, including David Cicilline (RI), Stephen Cohen (TN), Susan Davis (CA), Eliot Engel (NY), Lois Frankel (FL), Alan Lowenthal (CA), Jerrold Nadler (NY), Jared Polis (CO), Alan Grayson (FL), Jan Schakowsky (IL), Brad Sherman (CA), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL) and John Yarmuth (KY). Four Jewish congressmen – Steve Israel, Nita Lowey and Eliot Engel of New York and Ted Deutch of Florida – courageously came out as opposing the deal, while two Jewish Congressmen – Sandy Levin from Michigan and Adam Schiff of California –have shamelessly come out as supporting the deal . Even though about 70 percent of American Jews lean Democratic and are ideologically liberal, Jewish Democrats in Congress who are pondering what the Iran vote will mean for their own political futures should remember, that 70 percent of American Jews remain strongly or somewhat strongly attached to the State of Israel. Though some liberal Jews may have, at times, been persuaded by Obama Administration claims that troubles in the relations between the US and Israel are the fault of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that line is less likely to be effective now that all major parties in Israel and major Jewish organizations in the US – like AIPAC, Hadassah, United Jewish Communities and AJC – have united in opposition to the Iran deal. Senators Schumer, Cardin and others will want to bear in mind that the American people and the Jewish community in the US are turning against the agreement the more they learn the horrendous details about it. US Jews will not forgive a vote to strengthen anti-Semitic Iran and its axis of evil while throwing the Jewish state under the presidential bus. Shoula Romano Horing is an attorney.

Democratic Senator Eliot Engel (L), who has come out against the Iran nuclear deal, with Secretary of State John Kerry (Photo: AP) According to the more realistic scenario, in which the Iranian Islamic regime will probably cheat as they have cheated for the last 20 years regarding their nuclear program and other international agreements, they could have a nuclear bomb by the end of Obama’s term. After the sanctions relief by the beginning of 2016, if Iran cheats or breaks the agreement, their breakout time will be around two to three months. The details of the deal enable and encourage Iranian cheating. The United States' concessions on inspections of nuclear sites have allowed Iran to pre-approve them and to delay inspections by IAEA for up to 78 days, which many say is clearly more than enough time for Iran to scrub down any possible violations. But under both scenarios, it is much worse. After the initial compliance of the deal by Iran by mid- October and IAEA verification by mid- December, Iran will be given by beginning of 2016, hundreds of billion dollars’ worth of unfrozen assets and sanctions relief allowing it to become a regional conventional military power in the Middle East and to militarily strengthen their terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Syrian President Bashar Assad in their fight against Israel. While Israel has received since its founding 67 years ago a total of $124.3 billion in aid by the US, Iran will be given by the US up to $150 billion as an immediate signing bonus. In recent years, the Israeli economy and daily life was twice paralyzed by Hamas and Hezbollah missiles attacks. Imagine what the next war against Israel will look like. Hezbollah now has more than 100,000 missiles targeting the entire State of Israel from the north and Hamas has thousands more in the south. The Iranian deal will guarantee that Israel will have to face at least two wars in the next decade. In the short term, they will face a more deadly conventional war and in the long run a possible nuclear war. It seems that the main argument Obama supporters use to convince Jews and Democrats to vote for the deal is loyalty for the Democratic Party’s president. With knowledge of these horrible scenarios, how can any Jew vote for or support a deal that will adversely affect many Jewish generations to come in order to salvage Obama’s political legacy? American Jews have experienced this before. In the 1930s and '40s, most Jews in America were reluctant to try and ineffective at rescuing their Jewish brethren in Europe during the Holocaust. The excuse was that most Jews were either new immigrants themselves or first generation Americans, and were afraid of the anti-Semitism that existed in the US at the time. In 2015, US Jews have no such excuses. A two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress is needed to assert congressional dominance over the Presidential veto. There are 54 Republicans in the US Senate and they will all vote against the deal. To override a veto, the Republicans need to convince 13 Democrats to vote against it. There are nine Jewish Democrats in the Senate, including Senators Chuck Schumer (NY), Ben Cardin (MD), Richard Bennet (CO), Richard Blumenthal (CT), Barbara Boxer (CA), Dianne Feinstein (CA), Al Franken (MN), Brian Schatz (HI) and Ron Wyden (OR). Senator Schumer came out as opposing the deal, but Boxer chose liberalism over her Jewish roots. Five non-Jewish Democrats must join in. But till now, it seems that the Democratic Party lacks few righteous gentiles to support Israel. There are 247 Republicans in the House. They need 290 members to override a veto, which means they would need 43 Democrats to abandon Obama. There are 18 Jewish Democrats in the House, including David Cicilline (RI), Stephen Cohen (TN), Susan Davis (CA), Eliot Engel (NY), Lois Frankel (FL), Alan Lowenthal (CA), Jerrold Nadler (NY), Jared Polis (CO), Alan Grayson (FL), Jan Schakowsky (IL), Brad Sherman (CA), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL) and John Yarmuth (KY). Four Jewish congressmen – Steve Israel, Nita Lowey and Eliot Engel of New York and Ted Deutch of Florida – courageously came out as opposing the deal, while two Jewish Congressmen – Sandy Levin from Michigan and Adam Schiff of California –have shamelessly come out as supporting the deal . Even though about 70 percent of American Jews lean Democratic and are ideologically liberal, Jewish Democrats in Congress who are pondering what the Iran vote will mean for their own political futures should remember, that 70 percent of American Jews remain strongly or somewhat strongly attached to the State of Israel. Though some liberal Jews may have, at times, been persuaded by Obama Administration claims that troubles in the relations between the US and Israel are the fault of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that line is less likely to be effective now that all major parties in Israel and major Jewish organizations in the US – like AIPAC, Hadassah, United Jewish Communities and AJC – have united in opposition to the Iran deal. Senators Schumer, Cardin and others will want to bear in mind that the American people and the Jewish community in the US are turning against the agreement the more they learn the horrendous details about it. US Jews will not forgive a vote to strengthen anti-Semitic Iran and its axis of evil while throwing the Jewish state under the presidential bus. Shoula Romano Horing is an attorney.

News article:
Benjamin Netanyahu’s go-for-broke onslaught in Congress against the Iran nuclear deal has been described as a lose-lose situation that would leave Israel worse off, no matter what happens. One of the most oft-asked questions in recent weeks in Jerusalem and Washington, therefore, is this: “What is he thinking?” According to several sources who are privy to Netanyahu’s most recent discussions with American interlocutors, and based on what they have heard and how they interpret the prime minister’s words, the answer is this: Netanyahu is under no illusion about the ultimate outcome of the campaign. He accepts the prognosis that there won’t be enough Democratic votes in Congress to override a presidential veto. He is getting used to the idea that the Iran nuclear deal, which he has described as a “stunning mistake,” is already a fait accompli. Nonetheless, Netanyahu has refused to engage President Obama or the administration in talks about what the media describes as security “compensation” for the Iran deal. Obama has said that Netanyahu believes that this would signal acceptance of the Iran accord and would weaken the resolve of its potential opponents in Congress. Obama told Jewish leaders that Netanyahu is wasting precious time in which Israel’s defense capabilities against Iran and Hezbollah could have been upgraded. Analysts maintain that Netanyahu would be able to secure higher rewards for Israel now, when his implied acquiescence to a deal is valuable to the Obama administration, rather than later, when the deal is either done or undone and Netanyahu’s attitude is far less important. Netanyahu sees things differently. He believes that passage of the Iran accord by virtue of a Democratic bloc that supports the president will strengthen his hand, not weaken it. According to his view, after the dust settles in Congress, Democrats will be desperate to mend fences with Jewish voters and donors in advance of the 2016 elections and will be pressing the administration to mollify Netanyahu, who will continue to wax indignant for as long as possible. His leverage against an administration that has gotten its way will be far greater than it is against a president who is pulling out all stops to achieve victory, he believes. Netanyahu also sees fringe benefits in his strategy, according to people who have heard him. He believes that the fight over the Iran deal will weaken the Democrats not only with Jews but also with the American public overall. Win or lose in Congress, Americans view the agreement with Tehran’s ayatollahs as an accord with terrorists if not a deal with the devil. For those who aren’t convinced, Netanyahu will gladly provide both proof and argumentation. This could be Netanyahu’s contribution to a Republican victory in November 2016. He would then gain a grateful GOP President who may not scuttle the deal overnight, as he or she now promises, but would certainly adopt a tougher attitude on its implementation, Netanyahu believes. From Netanyahu’s point of view, this could be a win-win rather than a lose-lose situation: he would take credit for extracting the best possible security compensation for Israel’s defense. He would weaken Democrats and in effect punish them for supporting Obama and his terrible deal, and could see a pro-Israel Republican administration taking power to boot. In addition, he would confound all of his critics, detractors and naysayers in Israel and America who have accused him of making the wrong decisions at every turn. Of course, skeptics might think that Netanyahu is being too clever by half. That he is ignoring the effects of lingering resentments in the White House and pent up anger among Democrats, especially moderate ones, who have been caught between a rock and a hard place in recent weeks. Netanyahu is also overlooking the long lasting damage to the American Jewish community, which is now splitting between pro and anti-deal factions, between those who see anti-Semitic motives in the administration’s battle for its policy and others who are outraged by the accusations of Jew-hatred leveled against the U.S. President. And that it is reckless of Netanyahu to wreak all this havoc on Israel-US relations and on American Jews on a campaign that was doomed from the outset. And then there is the issue of Netanyahu banking on a Republican victory in 2016, a subject on which he’s already on record as erring badly, you will recall, the last time around. Netanyahu has surrounded himself with likeminded conservatives to the extent that he is blind to the rest of America, one source told me. He is increasingly out of touch with minorities, millennials and liberals, Jewish and otherwise, the source added, which is why it’s so easy for him to discount their influence and to write them off, with potentially disastrous results.

News article:
The nuclear deal with Iran will give the U.S., Israel and other countries the “freedom” to confront Tehran’s support for terrorism and violations of human rights, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told Jewish groups Thursday. Speaking from Washington in remarks broadcast live online, Moniz said the agreement with Iran could allow the U.S. to increase its attention on “other aspects of Iranian behavior that give us serious problems.” {mosads}“We are trying to increase security cooperation” with Israel and Arab allies, Moniz said in a webcast session coordinated by Jewish Federations of North America. “Doing so with the comfort that Iran does not have and will not have a nuclear weapon — the existential threat of a nuclear weapon — will, if anything, give us more freedom of action, if you like, in addressing all these other problems.” Moniz’s statement about the ability to crack down on Iran’s support for Hezbollah and Houthi rebels in Yemen and its detainment of four American prisoners was coupled with a lengthy discussion about the scientific components of the deal, which limits Iran’s nuclear powers in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. “The bottom line is Iran today is what we call a threshold state — it may not have a weapon today, but it has the capabilities and is very close to getting there if they choose to do so,” he said. “This agreement pulls them way back from that threshold for a substantial period.” The direct lobbying pitch to Jewish groups is part of a weeks-long effort to convince both the American public and members of Congress to back the deal ahead of a congressional vote scheduled for mid-September. The Obama administration is facing stiff opposition to the agreement but is nonetheless notching victories among Democrats who could provide critical votes. Moniz has been a top salesman on the deal and has become a favorite even of members of Congress who are opposed to the accord. Jewish Americans are considered to be particularly skeptical of the deal, due to deep-seated fears about the threat posed by Iran and the vehement opposition from top leaders in the Israeli government. Moniz’s appearance on the Jewish organization’s website Thursday came just more than a week after a similar appearance by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin, who warned that the agreement “actually paves Iran’s path to the bomb.” Critics of the agreement allege its oversight mechanisms are weak, meaning Iran could easily cheat by evading inspectors’ prying eyes. Additionally, they warn that it sets the stage for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon when many of the terms of the deal run out in 10 to 15 years, and that it stays silent on Iran’s other contested actions, such as the support for terror groups.

News article:
“Most especially, we are deeply concerned with the impression that the leadership of the American Jewish community is united in opposition to the agreement,” the letter states. “We, along with many other Jewish leaders, fully support this historic nuclear accord.” The Jewish community around the world, concentrated in the U.S. and Israel, has paid close attention to the nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the U.S., Iran, Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia China and the European Union. It aims to hamper Iran’s ability to produce a nuclear weapon and would lift sanctions on the theocratic regime. Many American Jews, citing Iran’s leaders’ repeated denunciations of the U.S. and threats to destroy Israel, have concluded that no deal with Iran is a good deal. Several national Jewish organizations, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee — as well as many evangelical Christians — are lobbying Congress to vote it down. The rabbis who sent the letter Monday argue that, while they have reason to distrust Iran’s leaders, the deal is the best available strategy to confront the specter of a nuclear Iran. And they want to challenge assumptions that Jews who oppose the deal represent American Jews as a whole. “A wide array of views about the nuclear deal exist among American Jews,” said Rabbi Rachel Mikva of Chicago, who signed the letter. She and others point to a recent poll from the L.A. Jewish Journal, which showed that Jewish Americans support the Iran deal by a larger margin than Americans in general, with 49 percent of American Jews approving of it, and 31 percent disapproving. The poll, of 501 American Jews, had a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. The signatories to the letter include many rabbis in the more liberal Reform movement — the largest stream of Judaism — but also at least 50 rabbis from the more traditional Conservative movement, and at least one Orthodox rabbi, according to organizers of the effort. “There is no denying that there are differences of opinion within the mainstream Jewish community,” said Nathan Diament, executive director for public policy of the Orthodox Union, which represents most of the 10 percent of American Jews who call themselves Orthodox. While the Orthodox Union does not claim to speak for all of American Jews, and while the deal should not be judged on a poll, there is no question that the Orthodox are overwhelmingly opposed to the agreement, he said. “We are planning to bring hundreds of rabbis to Washington in early September to lobby Congress and make this point.” The Reform Jewish movement plans to release a statement on the deal this week.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Iran was advancing its nuclear program in order to destroy Israel, responding to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s declaration that the nuclear deal would not change the Islamic Republic’s belligerent attitude toward the U.S. or the Middle East. "What I said was correct and accurate Iran is advancing its nuclear program in order to destroy Israel." said Netanyahu during a tour of the Israel Defense Force’s Northern Command Unit. "I'm here to examine from up close IDF's readiness to deal with the threats we're facing. The Israeli army is strong, Israel is strong. We are prepared for any scenario. We will hurt those who try to do us harm." Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, told supporters on Saturday that U.S. policies in the region were "180 degrees" opposed to Iran's, in a Tehran speech punctuated by chants of "Death to America" and "Death to Israel". Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon also responded to Khamenei’s remarks, saying Iran was clearly intent on resuming its funding of terror organizations the moment the nuclear deal with the West went into effect. "It isn't quiet on the Golan Heights, and it’s the Iranians ensuring that it does not stay quiet,” Ya’alon said. “They are trying to get their affiliates to carry out terror attacks against us. Representatives of the Revolutionary Guard are biding their time, waiting for the bad agreement with the Western powers to go into effect in order to transfer funds to Hezbollah and other terror organizations.” U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said Tuesday that Khamenei’s vow to defy American policies in the region despite the deal with world powers over Tehran's nuclear program was "very troubling". "I don't know how to interpret it at this point in time, except to take it at face value, that that's his policy," he said. "But I do know that often comments are made publicly and things can evolve that are different. If it is the policy, it's very disturbing, it's very troubling," he added.

"I'm here to examine from up close IDF's readiness to deal with the threats we're facing. The Israeli army is strong, Israel is strong. We are prepared for any scenario. We will hurt those who try to do us harm." Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, told supporters on Saturday that U.S. policies in the region were "180 degrees" opposed to Iran's, in a Tehran speech punctuated by chants of "Death to America" and "Death to Israel". Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon also responded to Khamenei’s remarks, saying Iran was clearly intent on resuming its funding of terror organizations the moment the nuclear deal with the West went into effect. "It isn't quiet on the Golan Heights, and it’s the Iranians ensuring that it does not stay quiet,” Ya’alon said. “They are trying to get their affiliates to carry out terror attacks against us. Representatives of the Revolutionary Guard are biding their time, waiting for the bad agreement with the Western powers to go into effect in order to transfer funds to Hezbollah and other terror organizations.” U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said Tuesday that Khamenei’s vow to defy American policies in the region despite the deal with world powers over Tehran's nuclear program was "very troubling". "I don't know how to interpret it at this point in time, except to take it at face value, that that's his policy," he said. "But I do know that often comments are made publicly and things can evolve that are different. If it is the policy, it's very disturbing, it's very troubling," he added.

News article:
August 18, 2015 Despite the ferocious political attacks between the White House and the Israeli government, one hears from both sides positive ramblings about future relations between the two countries. Governmental spokespeople, mainly in Israel, describe the current rift over the Iranian nuclear deal as an unfortunate incident, or “accident,” in a family with genuinely good relations. This, however, is not the case, and there certainly might be long-term damage to the strategic alliance between the two countries. A senior State Department official involved in US Middle East policy told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that while it is the Barack Obama administration’s intention to uphold good relations between the countries, including upgrading security assistance to Israel after congressional debate on the Iranian agreement, it might take a long time before the past level of trust between the two countries is restored. “The current mistrust toward the Israeli government is such that it may erode the very quality of coordination between the two governments,” he said. One comes away from talking to this State Department source with the impression that the schism is not only in regard to the policy approach on how to deal with Iranian nuclear ambitions, but even more so the result of the Israeli prime minister’s partisanship. Since the last US elections, Washington believes that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been siding with the Republicans. He made little secret of his preference for Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican opponent in the last presidential election, and most probably hopes for a Republican to replace Obama in the 2016 elections. One can conclude from the State Department source that in addition to possible long-term damage, short-term damage can already be seen in US-Israeli relations in several key areas. One involves the nuclear deal itself, as the lack of mutual trust could harm the pace and scope of information exchange in regard to the implementation of the Iran deal. Also, as Netanyahu’s overall Middle East policies are seen as a rejection of any diplomatic process in the region, the United States will be severely critical of any settlement expansion in the West Bank and will not, contrary to the past, block European punitive measures involving Israeli settlements. Although the United States will not initiate an active peace policy given the unwillingness of the parties to negotiate, Washington, said the State Department source, is considering not casting a veto against a French proposal on Palestinian statehood at the UN Security Council. Anti-terror policy coordination in relation to Hezbollah, the Islamic State and Hamas will continue among Israeli and US defense officials, but broader strategic policy coordination will be stalled, even in the likely event of a future Obama-Netanyahu meeting. Even more worrisome are the possible long-term repercussions of the current crisis in US-Israeli relations. The most dangerous among them is damage to the US perception of a values-based strategic partnership between two peace-seeking liberal democracies. Today’s Washington perceives serious erosion in Israel’s commitment to these values. This was once the most basic foundation of the strategic alliance. Another potential issue with longer-term repercussions is that Israel is now perceived as partisan, that is, pro-Republican Party. Israel is also on the wrong side of US demographics, in other words, the growing coalition of minorities that is more represented by the Democratic Party than by the Republicans. Furthermore, Israel will emerge from this crisis with the image of its relationship with the United States as tarnished in the eyes of the Arab world. The image of a strong alliance was always an important part of Israel’s deterrence vis-a-vis its neighbors. So while one might hear positive rhetoric about the re-establishment of a good relationship after the congressional debate, there is much room for concern and soul-searching about the future of Israeli-US relations. This crisis demands a fundamental change in Israeli policy vis-a-vis the United States. An immediate change is called for in the prime minister’s relationship with the White House. Israel must recognize the reality of the Iran deal and work with President Obama and his national security team on its ramifications. Close cooperation is necessary for monitoring Iranian compliance with the agreement. In the immediate future, a security assistance package should be agreed upon for the supply of sophisticated defensive arms and systems. In parallel, the two governments need to coordinate peace policies in the region based on the two-state solution and cooperation with the pragmatic Sunni axis against the fundamentalist terror groups. These elements should lead the United States and Israel to conclude a political-security partnership agreement parallel to the Iranian agreement. The first step in this direction is for the Israeli prime minister to announce that bipartisanship will be the basis for future relations with the United States and release the Jewish lobby from the plague of dual loyalty tests.

What is Israel’s endgame regarding Iran? The nuclear deal will likely be confirmed by the US Congress, yet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is conducting an apparent no-holds-barred campaign against it, hoping to defy Capitol Hill arithmetic and inspire enough American lawmakers to thwart it. Fearing the cementing of the ayatollahs’ regime, increased terrorism, the establishment of Iran as a regional power, and perhaps even mushroom clouds over Israel, Netanyahu has good reasons to be skeptical about the accord six world powers signed with Iran last month. But his relentless and vociferous lobbying against it is causing severe climate change in the already-not-so-warm ties between Washington and Jerusalem. After a series of briefings with senior American and Israeli officials in the course of the last few weeks, this reporter was left in no doubt that even if bilateral ties aren’t taking a direct hit as a consequence of Netanyahu’s approach, they will suffer damage, possibly irreparable, in the long run. It’s a bit like global warming: The effects of Israel’s actions aren’t immediately visible, but their long-term devastating effects are undeniable… or are only denied by people with a particular political agenda. I recently spent a week in Washington and New York for meetings with senior administration officials and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, and have since followed up by speaking to Israeli and American officials about the Iran deal and the effect it has on bilateral ties. The US administration was, is and will remain willing to provide Israel with military assistance, it is clear, and has even pledged to be more generous than usual because of the Iran deal. But Israel’s aggressive lobbying, which includes speaking to US lawmakers about a “moral duty” to oppose the deal, is proving corrosive. US President Barack Obama has openly criticized the Israeli government’s “unprecedented” effort to scuttle the deal, but insists that it will go unpunished. Indeed, security assistance to Israel will increase once Congress approves the deal, he said. Everyone in Washington echoes these pledges, vowing to never gamble with Israel’s security. But future discussions between American and Israeli professionals about what exactly Israel needs from the US are likely to take place in a less friendly atmosphere. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Talks about upgrading Israel’s military capabilities are conducted by human beings, not robots. Israel’s interlocutors in the Pentagon will naturally not be as well-disposed toward the Jewish state as they would have been had Jerusalem not been fighting a bitter campaign seeking to kill the president’s most important foreign policy initiative. And yet Jerusalem remains unfazed. “The deal is so dangerous that other considerations pale before it,” a senior government official told The Times of Israel this week. “We believe making our case, whatever the outcome of the votes in Congress may be, is the right thing to do. The end serves the national interest of the State of Israel.” It’s “not impossible” that Congress would stop the deal, the official said, while admitting that it’s an “uphill battle.” Advertisement It’s hard to believe Netanyahu really sees a chance that Obama could lose the vote. Last week, Haaretz quoted sources “privy to Netanyahu’s most recent discussions with American interlocutors” saying that the prime minister has realized that Congress won’t be able to stop the deal. Rather, according to these sources, Netanyahu believes that his public fight with the administration will lead Democrats to want to “mend fences with Jewish voters,” especially ahead of the 2016 presidential elections, and press the government to be especially generous to Israel when it finally discusses an increase in US military aid. Furthermore, the prime minister is said to believe that his constant highlighting of the Iran deal’s weaknesses will reduce the Democrats’ popularity in general and thus help get a Republican into the White House next year. Whatever Netanyahu believes, however, the fact that Washington keeps vowing that his lobbying will not diminish but actually increase its support for Israel gives Netanyahu a green light to double down on his opposition to the deal. As long as US officials reiterate their willingness to discuss upgrading American aid to Israel at a time of Jerusalem’s choosing, after all, why should he restrain himself? If a ballsy face-off with the leader of the free world comes without a price tag, it’s a win-win for the PM. Except that the anti-deal agitation could create bad blood not only between Israeli and American officials discussing military assistance, but in other fields as well. Netanyahu’s confrontation with the White House and his call on American Jews to oppose the deal is liable to have at least two other undesired side effects. First, it turns support for Israel into a partisan issue, since it forces Democrats to choose between their president and the Israeli foreign minister. Second, it could lead to serious rifts in the American Jewish community. “No policy has threatened to tear our community apart as much as the Iran deal,” according to Greg Rosenbaum, who chairs the National Jewish Democratic Council. Opponents of the accord have compared supporters to Nazis, he noted bitterly, adding that he isn’t sure that this division will heal — that the US-Israel climate change will be reversible — even after the fate of the deal is resolved.

Below is the content of the letter: We, the undersigned rabbis, write as a unified voice across religious denominations to express our concerns with the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran. For more than 20 months, our communities have kept keen eyes on the nuclear negotiations overseas. As our diplomats from Washington worked tirelessly to reach a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear challenge--we have hoped, and believed, that a good deal was possible. Unfortunately, that hope is not yet realized. We have weighed the various implications of supporting--or opposing--this agreement. Together, we are deeply troubled by the proposed deal, and believe this agreement will harm the short-term and long-term interests of both the United States and our allies, particularly Israel. Collectively, we feel we must do better. If this agreement is implemented, Iran will receive as much as 150 billion dollars, without any commitment to changing its nefarious behavior. The Iranian regime denies basic human rights to its citizens, publicly calls for America's downfall and Israel's annihilation, and openly denies the Holocaust. This dangerous regime--the leading state sponsor of terrorism--could now be given the financial freedom to sow even more violence throughout the world. But what do we get in return? Even after flooding Iran with an influx of funds, this deal will not subject Iran to an airtight, comprehensive inspections structure--granting the regime the means to violate the agreement and develop a covert nuclear program. The deal would also lift key arms embargos, so that in eight years Iran will be given international legitimacy to arm terror groups with conventional weapons and ballistic missiles. The agreement also entitles Iran to develop advanced centrifuges after 10 years--all-but paving Iran's path to a nuclear weapons capability with virtually zero "breakout time." We fear the world we will leave our children if this deal is approved. And we fear having to someday bear the responsibility for Iran becoming wealthier, further empowered and better equipped to produce nuclear bombs when we had the chance to stop it. For these reasons, we agree with the assessments of leaders and experts in the United States, along with virtually all Israeli voices across the political spectrum, that we can, and must, do better. We call upon our Senators and Representatives to consider the dangers that this agreement poses to the United States and our allies, and to vote in opposition to this deal. Furthermore, we strongly support and heed the call to action of many Jewish organizations to express our collective opposition to this dangerous agreement. At this historic moment, with so much at stake, we have a critical responsibility to shape the world we pass on to our children. With no less than the safety of future generations hanging in the balance, we must insist on a better deal. We hope and pray that God will assist us in ushering in for the entire world a time promised by Isaiah (2:4) when "nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they engage in war anymore," when peace will prevail. Until then, we simply cannot afford to empower and enrich a regime that continues to lift its sword without mercy towards so many who stand for good, freedom and peace.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said Israel does not object to allowing Iran to have a civilian nuclear program, only a military one. In a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Netanyahu said last month’s nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers allows the Islamic Republic to retain infrastructure that would be unnecessary for a peaceful nuclear program. The prime minister was apparently responding to comments Friday by US President Barack Obama, who suggested critics of the Iran deal were against the Islamic Republic having any sort of nuclear program, “even a peaceful one.” “Let me make clear, Matteo, that Israel doesn’t oppose a civilian nuclear program in Iran. We oppose a military nuclear program in Iran,” Netanyahu said during an official visit to Italy. “And regrettably, the deal with Iran allows it to keep and expand a formidable nuclear infrastructure that is completely unnecessary for civilian nuclear purposes, but is entirely necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.” Under the deal, as various sunset clauses take effect, “Iran within 13 years (will have) the ability to make as many centrifuges as they want, enrich as much uranium as they want to whatever level that they want,” Netanyahu charged. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “And this will put the Iranian Islamic state that practices terrorism worldwide, it will put it on the threshold of an entire nuclear arsenal,” he added. In a Friday address to American Jews, Obama had said: “In the best of all worlds, Iran would have no nuclear infrastructure whatsoever… unfortunately, that’s not a reality that’s attainable.” “Those who say they want a better deal, that this isn’t a good deal, and they want a better deal, typically mean that not only do they want Iran not to have nuclear weapons, but they don’t want it to have any nuclear program at all, even a peaceful one,” the US president said. Advertisement Obama on Friday compared tensions between the US and Israel over the nuclear deal to a family feud and said he expected quick improvements in ties between the longtime allies once the accord was implemented. “Like all families, sometimes there are going to be disagreements,” Obama said in a webcast with Jewish Americans. “And sometimes people get angrier about disagreements in families than with folks that aren’t family.” The president’s comments came as momentum for the nuclear accord grew on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers will vote next month on a resolution to disapprove of the deal. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., became the 30th senator to publicly back the agreement, saying Friday that it was a good deal for America and for allies like Israel. If Senate Democrats can amass 41 votes in favor of the deal, they could block passage of the disapproval resolution. Obama has vowed to veto the resolution if it passes, and Democrats could hold off Republican efforts to override his veto if they get 34 votes — just four more than they have now. The looming congressional confrontation has sparked a summer of intense debate between supporters and opponents of the nuclear accord. The deliberations have also divided Jewish Americans, with leaders of many organizations expressing concern about long-term damage to the community. The president encouraged skeptics of the agreement to “overcome the emotions” that have infused the debate and evaluate the accord based on facts. Advertisement “I would suggest that in terms of the tone of this debate everybody keep in mind that we’re all pro-Israel,” he said. “We have to make sure that we don’t impugn people’s motives.” The US negotiated alongside Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China for nearly two years before finalizing a landmark accord to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. As he has in previous speeches and interviews, Obama sought to refute criticism of the accord point by point. He disputed the notion that Iran would funnel the bulk of the money it receives from the sanctions relief into terrorism, saying Iranian leaders are more likely to try to bolster their weak economy. He also said the agreement wasn’t built on trusting Iran’s government, which frequently spouts anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric. “It’s precisely because we’re not counting on the nature of the regime to change that it’s so important for us to make sure they don’t have a nuclear weapon,” he said. Friday’s webcast was hosted by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and The Jewish Federations of North America. Organizers said thousands of people participated and questions submitted online were selected by the moderators.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he approves of Iran using nuclear energy for civilian purposes. Netanyahu added that he opposes President Obama’s nuclear pact with Iran based only on its military implications. “Allow me to make clear that Israel is not opposed to a civilian nuclear program in Iran,” he said in Florence, Italy, Saturday evening, according to The Jerusalem Post. “We are opposed to a militarized nuclear program in Iran,” Netanyahu said during a visit with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. “Unfortunately, the deal with Iran enables it to preserve — and even to expand — its vast nuclear infrastructure which is completely unnecessary for a civilian nuclear program but is vital to manufacturing nuclear weapons,” the Israeli leader added. Netanyahu’s remarks follow the Obama administration’s announcement that it had achieved a landmark nuclear pact with Iran last month. Netanyahu has since emerged as a vocal critic of the pact, given Tehran’s long history of threatening Israel and its people. “[It lets Iran] enrich as much uranium as they wish at whichever level they wish,” Netanyahu said, citing the expiration date for a cap on Iran’s uranium stockpiles in 13 years. “This will bring the Islamic state of Iran — which is engaging in global terrorism — to the threshold of an entire nuclear arsenal,” he added. Obama’s historic bargain with Iran eases economic sanctions on the Middle Eastern nation in exchange for greater restrictions on its atomic energy capabilities. Iran has vowed to permit more nuclear inspections and caps on its centrifuge and uranium stockpiles as part of the deal. Obama is now lobbying Congress to back the agreement’s language in a vote next month. Lawmakers meet on Sept. 17 for a vote on a resolution either expressing approval or disapproval for the nuclear deal. Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) announced on Sunday that he is voting in favor of the controversial accord. Merkley’s support makes him the 31st senator backing Obama’s diplomatic agreement with Iran.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday held a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Florence, whre he said that Israel was only opposed to an Iranian military nuclear program, not one meant for peaceful purposes. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "Let me make clear, Matteo, that Israel doesn’t oppose a civilian nuclear program in Iran," said Netanyahu. "We oppose a military nuclear program in Iran." The prime minister also told Renzi: "All the people of Israel were moved by your historic speech in the Knesset. I've heard many speeches in the Knesset. Yours was one of the exceptional ones that touched on basic truths that bind our two countries and our common civilization... I look forward to discussing with you this evening how we can further expand the cooperation between Israel and Italy in technology, in agriculture, in culture and science, in fighting terrorism, in security and stability for our world. Netanyahu and Renzi at the City Hall of Florence (Photo: GPO/Getty Images) Netanyahu discussed the threat posed by Iran with Renzi, saying: "The savagery of the Islamic State of ISIS captures the world’s attention, and justifiably so. But I believe that a far more serious threat is posed by another Islamic state, the Islamic State of Iran, and specifically its pursuit of nuclear weapons... And regrettably, the deal with Iran allows it to keep and expand a formidable nuclear infrastructure that is completely unnecessary for civilian nuclear purposes, but is entirely necessary for the production of nuclear weapons. "The deal will give Iran within 13 years the ability to make as many centrifuges as they want, enrich as much uranium as they want to whatever level that they want," continued Netanyahu. "And this will put the Iranian Islamic state that practices terrorism worldwide, it will put it on the threshold of an entire nuclear arsenal. Netanyahu and Renzi shake hands at Palazzo Vecchio in Florence (Photo: AP) Netanyahu further warned that "Iran will get hundreds of billions of dollars of sanctions relief and investments to fuel its aggression and terrorism in the Middle East, in North Africa and beyond that. I think that this will make Iran far richer and far stronger militarily, and it will make it far more difficult to confront its nuclear ambitions in the future." Netanyahu and his wife Sara landed in Milan on Thursday and attended Expo 2015, dedicated to developments in agriculture and food. They continued on to Florence, where Netanyahu also met leaders in the Jewish community.

News article:
By JTA September 2, 2015 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to continue his campaign against the Iran nuclear deal, even as President Barack Obama has secured enough congressional support to sustain a veto of any effort to block it. Hours after Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., announced that she was supporting the agreement, effectively ensuring that the deal will survive attempts in Congress to overturn it, an unidentified “source close to” Netanyahu said that “a clear majority in the American public and in Congress” agree with his opposition, the Times of Israel reported. “Netanyahu is expected to take the line that even though Obama has managed to preserve his right to uphold a veto, the deal with Iran still does not have legitimate public support,” according to Haaretz. The Jerusalem Post reported that a “senior official” in the Israeli government said that Netanyahu “has a responsibility to speak out against the deal” and “will continue to do so.” The Post added that “sources close to the prime minister” said that Netanyahu has no regrets about his battle against the deal, including his decision to speak before a joint session of Congress in March, which was widely seen as an affront to Obama. “The American people get it,” the sources said, according to The Post. “They understand the dangers to Israel. They understand the dangers to the United States. That’s why a clear majority believe the deal should be rejected, which is also reflected in Congress, where a clear majority seems prepared to reject the deal.” The deal, which was reached in July following negotiations between Iran and six world powers, trades sanctions relief for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program. The sources also insisted that the U.S.-Israel relationship is “strong” and that Netanyahu has “no doubt that the United States and Israel will continue to work together to address the enormous challenges confronting both our nations.” Despite the ongoing tensions between the two leaders, Netanyahu may meet with Obama in Washington in November, Israel’s Channel 2 reported Wednesday night. The two have not met face to face since October 2014.

Israel – Former Israeli Mossad spy chief Meir Dagan says it is time for Israel to stop criticizing the United States over the nuclear deal it and world powers struck with Iran. Speaking Monday at the International Institute for Counterterrorism’s annual conference in the coastal city of Herzliya, Dagan said: “The problem is Iran, not President Obama.” Dagan has been a fierce critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line policies regarding Iran. He vocally opposed the prospect of an Israeli military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities that Netanyahu is said to have supported. Dagan said Israel made a “strategic decision” to adopt a policy against the United States and “it is time to end it.” Dagan is a retired military general who headed Israel’s secretive Mossad agency from 2002-2011.

News article:
In recent months, many in the Middle East had assumed -- some in hope, others with concern -- that once the Iranian nuclear issue was resolved, the United States would make another push for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. But the opposite seems more likely. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter After a drawn-out confrontation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iranian nuclear deal, the White House seems to have little appetite for what would almost certainly be a new round of tensions with the Israeli leader over the terms of Palestinian statehood. With the odds of success slim and US elections approaching, President Barack Obama seems more interested in repairing his tattered relationship with Israel, leaving the Palestinian issue to his successor. Obama and Netanyahu in Israel (Photo: Avi Ohayon, GPO) In recent comments, Obama has spoken of boosting security cooperation and providing upgraded military hardware to make up for Israeli misgivings over the nuclear deal. Speaking to the Jewish newspaper The Forward last week, he likened his differences with Israel to a disagreement inside a family and predicted relations would survive the test. "I think it is important for everybody to just take a breath for a moment and recognize that people on both sides of the debate love the United States and also love Israel," Obama said. He made no mention of the Palestinian issue.A U.S. State Department official told The Associated Press that the US is not planning any bold new diplomatic initiatives after the Iran deal makes its way through Congress. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. In Israel, there had been speculation that Obama might act otherwise. "Now that President Barack Obama has got his Iran deal ... he will likely also try, in the year and four months until the presidential elections, to turn his attention to other urgent regional issues, such as Syria, and the talks or lack thereof between Israel and the Palestinian Authority," Israeli commentator Avi Issacharoff wrote in the Times of Israel in July. The Palestinians have also said they have received vague assurances from the US that they have not been forgotten. Several factors argue against another White House push to end Israel's half-century-old occupation of Palestinians. First is Obama's apparent eagerness to make amends after a period of startling acrimony symbolized by Netanyahu's controversial speech to Congress in March, when he railed against the emerging nuclear deal. Netanyahu has only stepped up his criticism since the deal was sealed in Vienna in July, having his ambassador to Washington lobby against the agreement in meetings with American lawmakers. Even after Obama secured the needed support in Congress to uphold the deal last week, Netanyahu vowed to continue fighting it. Barack Obama (Photo:AP) The US-led deal gives Iran relief from economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Netanyahu, with widespread support among the Israeli public, believes Iran will use its newfound funds to promote violence in the region and says the deal will not prevent Iran from ultimately gaining the ability to produce nuclear bombs. Israeli media often depict Obama as naive or even hostile to the country. Netanyahu's conservative government, meanwhile, shows little patience for being cajoled into concessions. Netanyahu himself declared during Israel's election campaign in March that he would not allow a Palestinian state to be established on his watch, though he has since backtracked somewhat and said he is prepared to resume peace talks. The United States, for its part, is entering an election season in which Obama's Democratic Party can ill afford continued friction with Jewish Americans, a key base of support. And one factor may override all others: The problems dividing Israel and the Palestinians seem oddly resistant to negotiation and mediation, at least under current circumstances. Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, experienced this firsthand when they sponsored an ambitious round of talks that consumed much of their attention and collapsed in mid-2014 after nine months of quibbling and vexation. It might have come as no surprise. Intervention efforts by outside powers in the Middle East -- whether attacks in Iraq or Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen or mediation efforts in Syria -- have not fared well of late. But even compared to those quagmires, the century-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be truly a case apart. Two decades of on-again, off-again negotiations have strongly suggested the sides are genuinely unable to meet in the middle on a deal. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip -- territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war -- for an independent state. Many Israelis do seem to accept letting go of the Palestinians and allowing them have a state on most of the lands they seek. But many also insist on continued control of parts of the West Bank, citing security grounds or religious attachment to the territory. The idea of both countries sharing Jerusalem, and its sensitive holy sites, as a joint capital is a challenge, to say the least. And Israel has no intention of accepting the principle of a "right of return" of refugees who fled its territory in 1948 and their descendants, a combined designation that numbers in the millions. Creative efforts to get around the impasse have bedeviled negotiators and mediators for some two decades. Abbas and Obama (Photo: MCT) Tellingly, opponents of Netanyahu can increasingly be heard yearning for outside pressure to move their fellow Israelis. This derives more from concern about the Palestinians than for them. The logic is that unless Israel finds a way to truly partition, its Jewish majority will be doomed by march of demography: Israel plus the West Bank and Gaza together have some 12 million people, equally divided between Jews and Arabs, with the Arab birthrate higher. It is ironic, many say, that Netanyahu's nationalists are the ones who are taking the Zionist project down this path. "An honorable Israeli leadership, if there were one, would ... find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in partnership with the United States and Europe," said Shabtai Shavit, a former director of the Mossad intelligence service, addressing a counterterrorism conference on Monday. On the Palestinian side, the frustration is compounded by a sense that their moment may have passed as the world's attention moves on to the many other wars and crises across the Arab world. President Mahmoud Abbas has hinted in recent weeks at retiring or canceling the existing 1990s peace deals. Under those arrangements, he heads an autonomy government that governs parts of the West Bank and cooperates with Israel on security. Palestinian officials attribute the threats to a hope by Abbas that he can somehow spur the U.S. and international community into action. Indeed, Palestinian officials say US Secretary of State John Kerry called Abbas over the weekend and promised to meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly at the end of the month. But skepticism abounds. "There is no sign that the Americans will present anything new," said Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian official. "They will keep saying that the only solution now is to make President Abbas (and) Netanyahu sit together. But we have been in this process for 22 years, and nothing has happened."

The logic is that unless Israel finds a way to truly partition, its Jewish majority will be doomed by march of demography: Israel plus the West Bank and Gaza together have some 12 million people, equally divided between Jews and Arabs, with the Arab birthrate higher.

"An honorable Israeli leadership, if there were one, would ... find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in partnership with the United States and Europe," said Shabtai Shavit, a former director of the Mossad intelligence service, addressing a counterterrorism conference on Monday. On the Palestinian side, the frustration is compounded by a sense that their moment may have passed as the world's attention moves on to the many other wars and crises across the Arab world. President Mahmoud Abbas has hinted in recent weeks at retiring or canceling the existing 1990s peace deals. Under those arrangements, he heads an autonomy government that governs parts of the West Bank and cooperates with Israel on security. Palestinian officials attribute the threats to a hope by Abbas that he can somehow spur the U.S. and international community into action. Indeed, Palestinian officials say US Secretary of State John Kerry called Abbas over the weekend and promised to meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly at the end of the month. But skepticism abounds. "There is no sign that the Americans will present anything new," said Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian official. "They will keep saying that the only solution now is to make President Abbas (and) Netanyahu sit together. But we have been in this process for 22 years, and nothing has happened."

News article:
In recent months, many in the Middle East had assumed -- some in hope, others with concern -- that once the Iranian nuclear issue was resolved, the United States would make another push for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. But the opposite seems more likely. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter After a drawn-out confrontation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iranian nuclear deal, the White House seems to have little appetite for what would almost certainly be a new round of tensions with the Israeli leader over the terms of Palestinian statehood. With the odds of success slim and US elections approaching, President Barack Obama seems more interested in repairing his tattered relationship with Israel, leaving the Palestinian issue to his successor. Obama and Netanyahu in Israel (Photo: Avi Ohayon, GPO) In recent comments, Obama has spoken of boosting security cooperation and providing upgraded military hardware to make up for Israeli misgivings over the nuclear deal. Speaking to the Jewish newspaper The Forward last week, he likened his differences with Israel to a disagreement inside a family and predicted relations would survive the test. "I think it is important for everybody to just take a breath for a moment and recognize that people on both sides of the debate love the United States and also love Israel," Obama said. He made no mention of the Palestinian issue.A U.S. State Department official told The Associated Press that the US is not planning any bold new diplomatic initiatives after the Iran deal makes its way through Congress. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. In Israel, there had been speculation that Obama might act otherwise. "Now that President Barack Obama has got his Iran deal ... he will likely also try, in the year and four months until the presidential elections, to turn his attention to other urgent regional issues, such as Syria, and the talks or lack thereof between Israel and the Palestinian Authority," Israeli commentator Avi Issacharoff wrote in the Times of Israel in July. The Palestinians have also said they have received vague assurances from the US that they have not been forgotten. Several factors argue against another White House push to end Israel's half-century-old occupation of Palestinians. First is Obama's apparent eagerness to make amends after a period of startling acrimony symbolized by Netanyahu's controversial speech to Congress in March, when he railed against the emerging nuclear deal. Netanyahu has only stepped up his criticism since the deal was sealed in Vienna in July, having his ambassador to Washington lobby against the agreement in meetings with American lawmakers. Even after Obama secured the needed support in Congress to uphold the deal last week, Netanyahu vowed to continue fighting it. Barack Obama (Photo:AP) The US-led deal gives Iran relief from economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Netanyahu, with widespread support among the Israeli public, believes Iran will use its newfound funds to promote violence in the region and says the deal will not prevent Iran from ultimately gaining the ability to produce nuclear bombs. Israeli media often depict Obama as naive or even hostile to the country. Netanyahu's conservative government, meanwhile, shows little patience for being cajoled into concessions. Netanyahu himself declared during Israel's election campaign in March that he would not allow a Palestinian state to be established on his watch, though he has since backtracked somewhat and said he is prepared to resume peace talks. The United States, for its part, is entering an election season in which Obama's Democratic Party can ill afford continued friction with Jewish Americans, a key base of support. And one factor may override all others: The problems dividing Israel and the Palestinians seem oddly resistant to negotiation and mediation, at least under current circumstances. Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, experienced this firsthand when they sponsored an ambitious round of talks that consumed much of their attention and collapsed in mid-2014 after nine months of quibbling and vexation. It might have come as no surprise. Intervention efforts by outside powers in the Middle East -- whether attacks in Iraq or Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen or mediation efforts in Syria -- have not fared well of late. But even compared to those quagmires, the century-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be truly a case apart. Two decades of on-again, off-again negotiations have strongly suggested the sides are genuinely unable to meet in the middle on a deal. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip -- territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war -- for an independent state. Many Israelis do seem to accept letting go of the Palestinians and allowing them have a state on most of the lands they seek. But many also insist on continued control of parts of the West Bank, citing security grounds or religious attachment to the territory. The idea of both countries sharing Jerusalem, and its sensitive holy sites, as a joint capital is a challenge, to say the least. And Israel has no intention of accepting the principle of a "right of return" of refugees who fled its territory in 1948 and their descendants, a combined designation that numbers in the millions. Creative efforts to get around the impasse have bedeviled negotiators and mediators for some two decades. Abbas and Obama (Photo: MCT) Tellingly, opponents of Netanyahu can increasingly be heard yearning for outside pressure to move their fellow Israelis. This derives more from concern about the Palestinians than for them. The logic is that unless Israel finds a way to truly partition, its Jewish majority will be doomed by march of demography: Israel plus the West Bank and Gaza together have some 12 million people, equally divided between Jews and Arabs, with the Arab birthrate higher.

In general, Israeli security institutions are not as alarmed by the Iran nuclear deal as the Netanyahu government. On the other hand, they suspect it won't stick Unlike the position held by the Israeli government, security institutions in Israel do not perceive the final nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers as a bad one. Nevertheless, they believe the Iranian nuclear programme will continue to pose a threat to Israel's national security, and doubt that the Islamic Republic will abide by the terms and conditions of the nuclear deal. As an international agreement on the nuclear issue is now finalised, fears are certainly less than they were in the past. But Israel's security bodies do not all carry the exact same views on the matter. Moshe Yaalon, Israel's defence minister, backs the government position that the deal is a "historic mistake" and believes in the necessity of resorting to military options — involving mainly air strikes — in the case Tehran violates the deal. Yaalon also hinted that Israel might target Iranian scientists, saying he is not responsible for protecting their lives. He expects the deal to fail, which will push Israel to defend its interests. Mossad, meanwhile, has not changed its stance from before the deal. Mossad has been a fierce critic of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s hard-line policies regarding Iran. The present Mossad chief was quoted recently as reiterating that the Palestinian cause is the real threat to Israel's national security, while Iran's nuclear programme does not pose any existential threat to Israel. This is the position of both the current and former heads of Israel's security apparatus, as well as the head of Shin Bet, Israeli domestic intelligence, who has reiterated often the importance of forging a comprehensive settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict while rejecting all attempts to launch a unilateral assault on Iran. Israeli Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot had appointed a committee to study the option of a military strike against Iran, to be headed by his deputy, Yaeir Golan. For a number of reasons, the military option will always be present in the minds of Israeli policymakers, which will lead the country to seek to strengthen its defensive capacities. Meanwhile, Israel sees that a nuclear agreement will not stop Iran from developing its 2000-kilometre range missiles (the distance between the two states is only 1,200 kilometres), capability that the nuclear deal will restrict for eight years as a maximum. Some types of Iranian missiles, such as the solid-fuel Sejil missile and the Safir space launch vehicle, which could be used in ballistic missile development, also represent a source of national security concern for Israel. Iran asserts that such missiles only serve the country's space programme, but defence officials revealed in the past that they will be used for deterrence purposes. Tehran is expected to overcome deficiencies in these missiles within the next three years, mainly by enhancing their accuracy. Meanwhile, Israel's security institutions anticipate that Iran will increase its support to Shia militant groups in the Middle East, especially Hizbullah that is militarily backing the Syrian regime in the ongoing Syrian civil war. The Israeli government can probably attempt to end the state of regional isolation it faces — because of its anti-Palestinian stances — through establishing security cooperation with Sunni players in the Middle East, such as Egypt and the Gulf states. In related developments, Israel presented a list of military-related demands on the United States, which the latter perceives as difficult to meet. On the one hand, Washington is committed to guaranteeing the military superiority of Israel in the region. On the other hand, the United States wants to ensure that the Israeli army will not attack Iran if the Islamic Republic violates the nuclear deal. The Netanyahu government asked the United States to increase its annual military aid to Israel from $1.3 billion to $4 billion. Israel also requested a continuation of US backing for its nuclear programme amid Arab attempts — led by Egypt and the Gulf states — to put Israel's nuclear activities under the terms and conditions of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Furthermore, Israel will work on receiving military support from outside the United States, such as the Dolphin-class submarines deal that Israel finalised with Germany, that will continue until 2017. Israel received the first shipment of submarines in 2013. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
It is now clear that the Iranian nuclear deal will pass Congress. President Obama now has the 34 votes to override any Congressional objections, and is well on the way to being able to prevent any vote at all, if he can achieve the 41 votes needed for a filibuster. It would be logical that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu would now give up his fight against the Iran deal. But at a toast at Israel’s Foreign Ministry for the upcoming Jewish New Year, Netanyahu said he intends to keep fighting against the Iran agreement. “Even in the face of disputes, Israel must be mindful of its traditional allies, chiefly the United States,” Netanyahu said. “And although the majority of Americans see eye to eye with us in terms of the threat Iran poses, it is important that the American public understand the fact that Iran is an enemy of the United States and openly declares it.” “Israel and the United States are allies and this understanding has important implications for our continued security cooperation,” Netanyahu added. Polls show that most Israelis oppose the Iranian nuclear deal, which would lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curtailing its nuclear program. President Obama says it will keep Iran away from a bomb for at least 15 years. But many in Israel are skeptical, saying that Iran has lied to the international community in the past and is likely to do so again. Netanyahu’s campaign has deepened tensions between the US and Israel to one of the highest levels in recent history. An official from the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC is quoted in Israeli media as saying that Netanyahu’s speech in Congress last March was a bad decision. “As soon as he insisted on going ahead with this move, which was perceived as a Republican maneuver against the president, we lost a significant part of the Democratic party, without which it was impossible to block the agreement,” the official, who asked not to be named told the Walla News Agency. Former Israeli Knesset member Dov Lipman (an American-born rabbi) of the Yesh Atid party, which was part of the government coalition in the last government but is currently in opposition, said Netanyahu has made serious mistakes. “That speech in Congress made no sense in what was best for Israel,” Lipman told The Media Line. “We had Democratic congressmen begging us and saying, “don’t make this a partisan issue.” The moment he got up and put the Democrats in that position, we lost it.” Lipman said Netanyahu should admit defeat and try to move on. “We embarrassed the president and the secretary of state and ruined all of these relationships with Jewish organizations,” Lipman said. “It is a colossal failure and the deal is happening anyway.” Some Israeli analysts say that Netanyahu will not give up for several reasons. “Israeli politics are focused on security issues, not economic ones,” Reuven Chazan, a professor of political science at Hebrew University. “Netanyahu’s focus on Iran helped him win the Israeli election, and even if it’s a dead horse he’s going to beat it for political purposes.” But beyond that, he said that Netanyahu deeply believes that the Iran deal is a colossal mistake that lead to a nuclear Iran, rather than preventing that scenario. He says he has heard this from several in Netanyahu’s inner circle. “This is an almost Messianic quest in Netanyahu’s mind,” he said. “He perceives that he was put on this earth to save Israel from the Iranian threat.”

Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami tells the al-Mayadeen TV station that Netanyahu is keeping the Middle East in a perpetual state of conflict to damage the Iranian economy. “I think that Netanyahu is maintaining a tense atmosphere in the region to have an economic impact on the Islamic Republic,” he says, according to Channel 10 news. Hatami tells the TV station that Iran’s air defenses are deterring Netanyahu from striking Iranian forces in Syria. “I think Netanyahu’s threats to attack Iranian forces in Syria are far from reality,” he says. “The Syrian government has the right to respond to any aggression against it, as has happened in the past. Syria’s allies are ready to respond to any aggression,” Hatami says.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded Wednesday to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed that the Israeli military "will continue to act with full determination and strength" against Iran's military entrenchment in Syria. "Iran, a country without nuclear weapons, is threatened with atomic annihilation by a warmonger standing next to an actual nuclear weapons factory. Beyond shameless in the gall," Zarif tweeted. Netanyahu spoke earlier Wednesday at a ceremony in the southern Israeli city of Dimona, which is the site of a nuclear reactor. The prime minister described Iran as a threat looming over the region. "Whoever threatens us with our demise puts himself in similar danger," Netanyahu said. Open gallery view Netanyahu speaking outside the nuclear plant in Dimona, August 29, 2018.

The prime minister also addressed an agreement between Syria and Iran announced earlier this week, stressing that "no threat will deter us." The deal reportedly stipulates that Iran will help Syria rebuild itself in the wake of the civil war.

Zarif slams Netanyahu for 'shameless' threat of 'nuclear annihilation' against Iran Iran Press TV Thu Aug 30, 2018 06:46AM Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has fired back at "warmonger" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for threatening Iran with "atomic annihilation" right from the regime's secretive atomic weapons facility. Speaking during a ceremony at the Dimona nuclear arms facility in the Negev desert on Wednesday, Netanyahu had claimed that the occupying entity faces threats from near and far. "Those who threaten to wipe us out put themselves in a similar danger, and in any event will not achieve their goal," he said. "But our enemies know very well what Israel is capable of doing. They are familiar with our policy. Whoever tries to hurt us – we hurt them," said Netanyahu. Hours later, Zarif took to Twitter to respond to the hawkish Israeli premier's highly aggressive threat, which came on the same day that the world nations were observing the International Day against Nuclear Tests. "Iran, a country without nuclear weapons, is threatened with atomic annihilation by a warmonger standing next to an actual nuclear weapons factory," tweeted the top Iranian diplomat, describing Netanyahu's statements as "beyond shameless." Israel is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, but its policy is to neither confirm nor deny that it has atomic bombs. The Tel Aviv regime is estimated to have 200 to 400 nuclear warheads in its arsenal. Unlike Iran, the regime has refused to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -- whose aim is to prevent the spread of nuclear arms and weapons technology – in defiance of international pressure. Marking the International Day against Nuclear Tests, Foreign Minister Zarif had earlier in the day slammed the Israeli regime and its stalwart supporter, the US, as the sole possessor of nuclear bombs in the region and the "sole user" of atomic weapons in the world, respectively. "Let's also remember that Iran has called for Nuclear Weapon Free Zone since 1974," Zarif said in a tweet. Elsewhere in his comments, Netanyahu said the Israeli military will continue to target Iranian military advisers, who have been assisting the Syrian army in their battles against foreign-backed terrorists. The Israeli military, Netanyahu said, "will continue acting with full determination and with full might against" what he called Iran's attempts "to station forces and advanced weapons systems in Syria." Iran has no troops on the ground in Syria and its anti-terror advisory mission – like that of its ally Russia – comes at the request of the Damascus government. Worried over Syria's gains against terrorists, Israel frequently attacks military targets inside Syria in an attempt to prop up terrorist groups that have been suffering defeats on the battlefield. The regime has also been providing weapons to anti-Damascus militants as well as medical treatment to Takfiri elements wounded in Syria. On April 9, an Israeli airstrike against the T-4 airbase in Syria's Homs Province killed more than a dozen people, including seven Iranian military advisers.

Elsewhere in his comments, Netanyahu said the Israeli military will continue to target Iranian military advisers, who have been assisting the Syrian army in their battles against foreign-backed terrorists. The Israeli military, Netanyahu said, "will continue acting with full determination and with full might against" what he called Iran's attempts "to station forces and advanced weapons systems in Syria." Iran has no troops on the ground in Syria and its anti-terror advisory mission – like that of its ally Russia – comes at the request of the Damascus government. Worried over Syria's gains against terrorists, Israel frequently attacks military targets inside Syria in an attempt to prop up terrorist groups that have been suffering defeats on the battlefield. The regime has also been providing weapons to anti-Damascus militants as well as medical treatment to Takfiri elements wounded in Syria. On April 9, an Israeli airstrike against the T-4 airbase in Syria's Homs Province killed more than a dozen people, including seven Iranian military advisers.

News article:
Zarif slams Netanyahu for 'shameless' threat of 'nuclear annihilation' against Iran Iran Press TV Thu Aug 30, 2018 06:46AM Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has fired back at "warmonger" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for threatening Iran with "atomic annihilation" right from the regime's secretive atomic weapons facility. Speaking during a ceremony at the Dimona nuclear arms facility in the Negev desert on Wednesday, Netanyahu had claimed that the occupying entity faces threats from near and far. "Those who threaten to wipe us out put themselves in a similar danger, and in any event will not achieve their goal," he said. "But our enemies know very well what Israel is capable of doing. They are familiar with our policy. Whoever tries to hurt us – we hurt them," said Netanyahu. Hours later, Zarif took to Twitter to respond to the hawkish Israeli premier's highly aggressive threat, which came on the same day that the world nations were observing the International Day against Nuclear Tests. "Iran, a country without nuclear weapons, is threatened with atomic annihilation by a warmonger standing next to an actual nuclear weapons factory," tweeted the top Iranian diplomat, describing Netanyahu's statements as "beyond shameless." Israel is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, but its policy is to neither confirm nor deny that it has atomic bombs. The Tel Aviv regime is estimated to have 200 to 400 nuclear warheads in its arsenal. Unlike Iran, the regime has refused to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -- whose aim is to prevent the spread of nuclear arms and weapons technology – in defiance of international pressure. Marking the International Day against Nuclear Tests, Foreign Minister Zarif had earlier in the day slammed the Israeli regime and its stalwart supporter, the US, as the sole possessor of nuclear bombs in the region and the "sole user" of atomic weapons in the world, respectively. "Let's also remember that Iran has called for Nuclear Weapon Free Zone since 1974," Zarif said in a tweet. Elsewhere in his comments, Netanyahu said the Israeli military will continue to target Iranian military advisers, who have been assisting the Syrian army in their battles against foreign-backed terrorists.

Jerusalem – Israel’s prime minister says the country is working in “all arenas, near and far” against Iran. Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is working “resolutely” to combat precision weapons that could be used against it and to prevent Iran to establish a military presence in neighboring Syria. He spoke Wednesday at a meeting of his Cabinet. The remarks come a day after an Israeli military official said Israel has struck over 200 Iranian targets in Syria over the past 18 months. Israel is widely believed to have been behind a series of airstrikes mainly targeting Iranian and Hezbollah forces in Syria who are fighting alongside the government. It rarely confirms the attacks. Israel views Iran’s presence in Syria as a growing threat.

News article:
Iran’s nuclear chief told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he hopes the atomic deal between Tehran and world powers survives, but warns the program will be in a stronger position than ever if not. In a veiled threat to Israel, Ali Akbar Salehi also told the AP in an interview in Tehran that the consequences will be “harsh” if there are any new attacks targeting Iran’s nuclear scientists. A string of bombings, blamed on Israel, targeted a number of scientists beginning in 2010 at the height of Western concerns over Iran’s program. Israel never claimed responsibility for the attacks on the scientists, though Israeli officials have boasted in the past about the reach of the country’s intelligence services. “I hope that they will not commit a similar mistake again because the consequences would be, I think, harsh,” Salehi warned. Israel earlier this year removed tens of thousands of documents and other materials from Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program archive, stealing them from under the regime’s nose in a Mossad operation in Tehran. The material proved that Iran lied when claiming it was not seeking to build a nuclear weapons arsenal, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, and showed that it intends to resume its nuclear weapons program if it can. Salehi also said Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw America from the 2015 accord “puts him on the loser’s side” of history. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms He added: “That deal could have paved the way for building the trust and the confidence that we had lost.” Salehi’s comments came after Trump decided to pull the US from the deal in May. The 2015 accord, struck under then-president Barack Obama’s administration, saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. In the wake of Trump’s decision, Western companies from airplane manufacturers to oil firms have pulled out of Iran. Iran’s rial currency, which traded before the decision at 62,000 to $1, now stands at 142,000 to $1. Advertisement “I think [Trump] is on the loser’s side because he is pursuing the logic of power,” Salehi said. “He thinks that he can, you know, continue for some time but certainly I do not think he will benefit from this withdrawal, certainly not.” In his announcement, the US president said the accord would not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear arms and he therefore was exiting the agreement and reimposing sanctions. Trump’s decision was sharply opposed by Iran and the deal’s other signatories — Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China. Those countries are currently working to preserve the accord following the US pullout. Netanyahu was a vocal opponent of the deal as it was being negotiated and when it was reached during the Obama administration. The agreement lifted painful economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Netanyahu has repeatedly argued that the deal will not prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons capability after its restrictions expire in the next decade or so. Salehi also spoke about Iran’s efforts to build a new facility at Natanz’s uranium enrichment center that will produce more advanced centrifuges. Those devices enrich uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas. Advertisement For now, the nuclear accord limits Iran to using a limited number of an older model, called IR-1s. The new facility will allow Iran to build versions called the IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6. The IR-2M and the IR-4 can enrich uranium five times faster than an IR-1, while the IR-6 can do it 10 times faster, Salehi said. Western experts have suggested these centrifuges produce three to five times more enriched uranium in a year than the IR-1s. While building the facility doesn’t violate the nuclear deal, mass production of advanced centrifuges would. Salehi, however, said that wasn’t immediately a plan. “This does not mean that we are going to produce these centrifuges now. This is just a preparation,” he said. “In case Iran decides to start producing in mass production such centrifuges, (we) would be ready for that.” Salehi suggested that if the nuclear deal fell apart, Iran would react in stages. He suggested one step may be uranium enrichment going to “20 percent because this is our need.” He also suggested Iran could increase its stockpile of enriched uranium. Any withdrawal ultimately would be approved by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. While the UN repeatedly has verified Iran’s compliance with the deal, Trump campaigned on a promise to tear it up. In May, he withdrew the US in part because he said the deal wasn’t permanent and didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program and its influence across the wider Middle East. But Trump meanwhile has tweeted he’d accept talks without preconditions with Tehran. Asked what he personally would tell Trump if he had the chance, Salehi chuckled and said: “I certainly would tell him he has made the wrong move on Iran.” “I think (Trump) is on the loser’s side because he is pursuing the logic of power,” Salehi added. “He thinks that he can, you know, continue for some time but certainly I do not think he will benefit from this withdrawal, certainly not.” Advertisement In the wake of Trump’s decision, however, Western companies from airplane manufacturers to oil firms have pulled out of Iran. The rial, which traded before the decision at 62,000 to $1, now stands at 142,000 to $1. Despite that, Salehi said Iran could withstand that economic pressure, as well as restart uranium enrichment with far more sophisticated equipment. “If we have to go back and withdraw from the nuclear deal, we certainly do not go back to where we were before,” Salehi said. “We will be standing on a much, much higher position.”

Advertisement “I think [Trump] is on the loser’s side because he is pursuing the logic of power,” Salehi said. “He thinks that he can, you know, continue for some time but certainly I do not think he will benefit from this withdrawal, certainly not.” In his announcement, the US president said the accord would not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear arms and he therefore was exiting the agreement and reimposing sanctions. Trump’s decision was sharply opposed by Iran and the deal’s other signatories — Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China. Those countries are currently working to preserve the accord following the US pullout. Netanyahu was a vocal opponent of the deal as it was being negotiated and when it was reached during the Obama administration. The agreement lifted painful economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Netanyahu has repeatedly argued that the deal will not prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons capability after its restrictions expire in the next decade or so. Salehi also spoke about Iran’s efforts to build a new facility at Natanz’s uranium enrichment center that will produce more advanced centrifuges. Those devices enrich uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas. Advertisement For now, the nuclear accord limits Iran to using a limited number of an older model, called IR-1s. The new facility will allow Iran to build versions called the IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6. The IR-2M and the IR-4 can enrich uranium five times faster than an IR-1, while the IR-6 can do it 10 times faster, Salehi said. Western experts have suggested these centrifuges produce three to five times more enriched uranium in a year than the IR-1s. While building the facility doesn’t violate the nuclear deal, mass production of advanced centrifuges would. Salehi, however, said that wasn’t immediately a plan. “This does not mean that we are going to produce these centrifuges now. This is just a preparation,” he said. “In case Iran decides to start producing in mass production such centrifuges, (we) would be ready for that.” Salehi suggested that if the nuclear deal fell apart, Iran would react in stages. He suggested one step may be uranium enrichment going to “20 percent because this is our need.” He also suggested Iran could increase its stockpile of enriched uranium. Any withdrawal ultimately would be approved by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. While the UN repeatedly has verified Iran’s compliance with the deal, Trump campaigned on a promise to tear it up. In May, he withdrew the US in part because he said the deal wasn’t permanent and didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program and its influence across the wider Middle East. But Trump meanwhile has tweeted he’d accept talks without preconditions with Tehran. Asked what he personally would tell Trump if he had the chance, Salehi chuckled and said: “I certainly would tell him he has made the wrong move on Iran.” “I think (Trump) is on the loser’s side because he is pursuing the logic of power,” Salehi added. “He thinks that he can, you know, continue for some time but certainly I do not think he will benefit from this withdrawal, certainly not.” Advertisement In the wake of Trump’s decision, however, Western companies from airplane manufacturers to oil firms have pulled out of Iran. The rial, which traded before the decision at 62,000 to $1, now stands at 142,000 to $1. Despite that, Salehi said Iran could withstand that economic pressure, as well as restart uranium enrichment with far more sophisticated equipment. “If we have to go back and withdraw from the nuclear deal, we certainly do not go back to where we were before,” Salehi said. “We will be standing on a much, much higher position.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened his cabinet meeting Wednesday by stressing that the world must unite against not only against the threat of Islamic State, but also against that of Iran. “It is doing so to a certain extent against Islamic State but it is not doing so against Iran,” he said. “On the contrary, what we are seeing is that while Iran is sending terrorist cells to Europe, European leaders are appeasing – and reconciling with – Iran, in the same week that the terrorist cells were due to carry out their operations, which we helped thwart. This is unacceptable.” Netanyahu was presumably referring to intelligence the Mossad passed on to authorities in France, Germany, and Belgium leading to arrests of a cell headed by an Iranian diplomat that planned to bomb a June 30 conference organized by an Iranian dissident group, the People’s Mujahedeen of Iran. The Israeli leader reiterated that “the appeasement of Iran abets the relentless assault on the values and security of the free societies, and the time has come for Western governments to join the strong and clear effort by the Trump administration against the terror regime in Tehran.” The prime minister added that radical Shiites and radical Sunnis were both working to destroy Israel and destroy Western society.

Netanyahu also took the opportunity to mark the 17th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. “Yesterday we marked 17 years since the awful terrorist attack against the American people at the Twin Towers in New York and at the Pentagon in [Greater] Washington,” he said. “This operation was carried out by Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda has passed the torch to Islamic State, even as Iran also promotes international terrorism.” Advertisement The prime minister reiterated his belief that the US “made the correct decision” in closing the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in Washington, DC, on Monday. “The Palestinians refuse to enter negotiations with Israel even as they attack Israel with false claims in international forums,” he said. “Israel very much appreciates the Trump administration decision and supports American actions that are designed to make it clear to the Palestinians that the refusal to enter into negotiations with Israel and the unbridled attacks against Israel will not only not advance peace but will certainly not make things better for the Palestinians.”

LONDON: Iran has asked the United Nations to condemn Israeli threats against Tehran and to bring Israel's nuclear programme under its supervision, state media reported on Thursday. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit to a secretive Israeli atomic reactor in late August to warn the country’s enemies that it has the means to destroy them, in what appeared to be a veiled reference to its assumed nuclear arsenal. "The United Nations’ members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons," Fars news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshrou as saying in letters to the U.N. secretary general and the security council. Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear programme under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN atomic watchdog. Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having the bomb, a decades-old “ambiguity” policy that it says keeps hostile neighbours in check while avoiding the kind of public provocations that can spark regional arms races. Israel is trying to lobby world powers to follow the United States in exiting their 2015 deal with Iran that capped the Islamic Republic’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting of sanctions. The Israelis deem the agreement insufficient for denying their arch-foe the means to eventually get the bomb - something that Tehran, which is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), denies wanting. Since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has preached Israel’s destruction. It backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria’s civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel’s borders. (

Netanyahu reveals 'conclusive proof' of Iranian nuclear weapons program (צילום: רועי עידן) X In Late April, Netanyahu revealed what he said was “conclusive proof” of a secret project underway in Iran for the development of a nuclear weapon—evidence that he said proved that Tehran had lied “big time” to the international community. Israel had obtained, he said, in a “great intelligence achievement,” secrets comprising a giant trove of documents and digital information pertaining to Iran's clandestine Amad nuclear weapons project whose goal was “creating nuclear weapons” The evidence, Netanyahu posited, prove “Iran has been hiding for years from the international community” its nuclear weapons development program. In August 2017, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah marked 11 years to the Second Lebanon War with a speech in which he threatened that "the defeat Israel suffered in 2006, it will suffer again, but it will be a much greater defeat." Nasrallah argued that Israel recognized Hezbollah's strength, "an example of that is the evacuation of the ammonia tank in Haifa. We hope they examine moving the nuclear reactor in Dimona as well, as it is more dangerous and needs to be taken care of." During operation Protective Edge, Israel intercepted three rockets that were launched at Dimona.

News article:
Iran has asked the United Nations to oversee Israel’s secretive nuclear programme and condemns its threats against the Islamic republic, state media reported on Thursday. In August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech from the Dimona atomic reactor, warning the country’s foes that it has the capabilities to destroy them. He was making a reference to Israel’s suspected nuclear programme. The country never admits or denies the existence of a nuclear programme and maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” so as not to allow any sensitive information to fall into enemy hands. “The United Nations members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons,” Fars news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshrou as saying in letters to the UN secretary general and the UN Security Council. Mr Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear programme under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN atomic watchdog. Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having the bomb, a decades-old ambiguity policy that it says keeps hostile neighbours in check while avoiding the kind of public provocations that can spark regional arms races. Iran regularly threatens Israel with destruction but Mr Netanyahu appeared to make a rare admission about his country’s nuclear arsenal. “Those who threaten to wipe us out put themselves in a similar danger, and in any event will not achieve their goal,” he said at the ceremony. On Thursday, Israel said it is upgrading and reinforcing its nuclear facilities to withstand attacks to counter Iranian threats to strike the Israel’s nuclear sites. “We cannot ignore the repeated and explicit threats, made by Iran and its proxies, to attack Israel’s nuclear sites,” Zeev Snir, the head of the country’s Atomic Energy Commission, said in a speech Tuesday to the 62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. “These outrageous threats require Israel to take action and continue to protect and defend its nuclear facilities.” __________ Read more: Hezbollah leader says group will stay in Syria until further notice Hezbollah is flaunting its support for Yemen’s Houthis __________ Iran’s own nuclear ambitions have been the centre of international diplomacy for years. After Israeli lobbying, the US earlier this year withdrew from the landmark nuclear deal signed between Tehran and world powers in July 2015. That deal swapped limits on Tehran’s nuclear programme for the lifting of crippling international sanctions. Israel is now lobbying other world powers to follow US President Donald Trump in leaving the agreement. UAE Ambassador to the IAEA, Hamad Alkaabi, told the nuclear body on Thursday that the nuclear deal was not satisfactory. “In relationship to the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action) concluded with Iran, my country, like many, has hoped that such Agreement would address long held nuclear concerns and moderate Iran’s regional behavior,” he said. “Unfortunately, this was not the case. We call on Iran to build further confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities and to refrain from the actions that continue to threaten the peace and stability of the region.” Israel believes the agreement is insufficient for denying their arch-foe the means to eventually get the bomb. It views Iran as its number one national security concern. The Iranian regime backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian movement Hamas. Both groups have fought four wars with Israel since 2006. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria’s seven-year civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel’s borders.

News article:
Iran has asked the United Nations to oversee Israel’s secretive nuclear programme and condemns its threats against the Islamic republic, state media reported on Thursday. In August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech from the Dimona atomic reactor, warning the country’s foes that it has the capabilities to destroy them. He was making a reference to Israel’s suspected nuclear programme. The country never admits or denies the existence of a nuclear programme and maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” so as not to allow any sensitive information to fall into enemy hands. “The United Nations members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons,” Fars news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshrou as saying in letters to the UN secretary general and the UN Security Council. Mr Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear programme under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN atomic watchdog. Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having the bomb, a decades-old ambiguity policy that it says keeps hostile neighbours in check while avoiding the kind of public provocations that can spark regional arms races. Iran regularly threatens Israel with destruction but Mr Netanyahu appeared to make a rare admission about his country’s nuclear arsenal. “Those who threaten to wipe us out put themselves in a similar danger, and in any event will not achieve their goal,” he said at the ceremony. On Thursday, Israel said it is upgrading and reinforcing its nuclear facilities to withstand attacks to counter Iranian threats to strike the Israel’s nuclear sites. “We cannot ignore the repeated and explicit threats, made by Iran and its proxies, to attack Israel’s nuclear sites,” Zeev Snir, the head of the country’s Atomic Energy Commission, said in a speech Tuesday to the 62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. “These outrageous threats require Israel to take action and continue to protect and defend its nuclear facilities.” __________ Read more: Hezbollah leader says group will stay in Syria until further notice Hezbollah is flaunting its support for Yemen’s Houthis __________ Iran’s own nuclear ambitions have been the centre of international diplomacy for years. After Israeli lobbying, the US earlier this year withdrew from the landmark nuclear deal signed between Tehran and world powers in July 2015. That deal swapped limits on Tehran’s nuclear programme for the lifting of crippling international sanctions. Israel is now lobbying other world powers to follow US President Donald Trump in leaving the agreement. UAE Ambassador to the IAEA, Hamad Alkaabi, told the nuclear body on Thursday that the nuclear deal was not satisfactory. “In relationship to the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action) concluded with Iran, my country, like many, has hoped that such Agreement would address long held nuclear concerns and moderate Iran’s regional behavior,” he said. “Unfortunately, this was not the case. We call on Iran to build further confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities and to refrain from the actions that continue to threaten the peace and stability of the region.” Israel believes the agreement is insufficient for denying their arch-foe the means to eventually get the bomb. It views Iran as its number one national security concern. The Iranian regime backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian movement Hamas. Both groups have fought four wars with Israel since 2006. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria’s seven-year civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel’s borders.

(JTA) — Israel is upgrading and reinforcing its nuclear sites in light of “repeated and explicit threats” made by Iran and its proxies to attack them, a nuclear official said. Zeev Snir, the director-general of Israel’s Atomic Energy Commission, addressed the issue in a speech Tuesday to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA. The address was provided to the Israeli media. “These outrageous threats require Israel to take action and continue to protect and defend its nuclear facilities,” Snir said. “These facilities are constantly upgraded and reinforced, in line with IAEA safety guidelines, in order to withstand any attack.” Israel rarely discusses its nuclear activities publicly. Snir called for regional cooperation on nuclear security and safety, but noted that while Israel has “repeatedly expressed its willingness to collaborate with all of its neighbors” on nuclear safely and security, the Jewish state is not recognized by several Middle East countries and Iran has openly called for Israel’s destruction. He called on the IAEA to “conduct a robust verification of Iran’s clandestine nuclear activities,” adding that the covert Iranian nuclear weapons program is “a documented fact.” “Israel has repeatedly underlined the importance of confronting Iran with its lies and concealment efforts,” he said. Snir said the new information recently revealed by Israel “conclusively proves that Iranian activities were part of a well-orchestrated plan to continue the development of nuclear weapons.” He also spoke of Syria’s “undeclared, secretive military nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour,” which Israel bombed more than a decade ago.

Iran asked the United Nations to condemn what it described as Israeli nuclear threats against it yesterday, while Israel said it was stepping up security around its atomic sites as a precaution against threats from Tehran and its regional allies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit to a secretive Israeli atomic reactor in August to warn the country's enemies that it has the means to destroy them, in what appeared to be a reference to its assumed nuclear arsenal. "The United Nations ‘members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons," Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Gholamali Khoshrou said in letters to the U.N. secretary general and the security council, was quoted as saying by Fars news agency. Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear program under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N. atomic watchdog. The director general of Israel's Atomic Energy Commission said on Tuesday that Iran and Syria posed significant proliferation threats to the region and called for U.N. action at the 62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency now taking place in Vienna. In a statement yesterday, director general Zeev Snir said: "We cannot ignore the repeated and explicit threats, made by Iran and its proxies, to attack Israel's nuclear sites. These outrageous threats, require Israel to take immediate action and continue to protect and defend its nuclear facilities." Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having a nuclear arsenal, a decades-old "ambiguity" policy. It is trying to lobby world powers to follow the United States in withdrawing from the 2015 deal with Iran that capped the Islamic Republic's nuclear capabilities in return for lifting of sanctions. The Israelis say the agreement does not do enough to denying their arch-foe the means to eventually build a bomb. Tehran, which is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), denies wanting to so. Netanyahu gave details in April of what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program. Iran called the documents fake. Snir said the IAEA must conduct a robust verification of Iran's "clandestine activities" and also of an undeclared, secretive military nuclear reactor that he said Syria has built at Deir el-Zour. Since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has called for Israel's destruction. Tehran backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria's civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel's borders.

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday described Israel as “the most terrifying threat to the peace and stability of the region and the world.” Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter “Israel, which has a nuclear arsenal and is blatantly threatening others with nuclear annihilation, is the most terrifying threat to the peace and stability of the region and the world,” the Iranian president said. “The countless crimes by Israel against the Palestinians would not have been able to take place without assistance and support from the US,” Rouhani said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly. President Rouhani (Photo: Reuters) He also added that the passage of the years cannot justify what he described as the “continued occupation.” Rouhani further emphasized that the US decision to transfer its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was a flagrant example of Washington undermining regional peace. He also slammed Israel’s recent passage of the Nation-State Law was another clear example of the country being an apartheid state. Rouhani criticized Washington for its hostile policy toward his country and said the US approach was doomed to failure. He said the United States had waged "economic war" against Iran by reimposing unilateral sanctions, which were lifted under the country's 2015 multinational nuclear deal in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. "The United States policy vis-a -vis the Islamic Republic of Iran has been wrong from the beginning, and its approach of resisting the wishes of the Iranian people as manifested in numerous elections is doomed to failure," Rouhani said. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact in May, and his administration reimposed sanctions on Iran in August. Harsher sanctions on Iran's oil and banking sector are expected in November. "The economic war that the United States has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the Iranian people but also entails harmful repercussions for the people of other countries, and that war has caused a disruption in the state of global trade," Rouhani said. "What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfillment of obligations." Mounting pressure from the Trump administration combined with discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy are rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers, officials and analysts say. The rial has lost 40 percent of its value against the US dollar since April. Iran has blamed US sanctions for the currency's fall, saying the measures amount to a "political, psychological and economic" war on Tehran. Threat for threat To pile on the pain, Washington says all countries must end crude imports from Iran by November 4, hitting the oil sales that generate 60 percent of the country's income. Iran says this level of cuts will never happen. Tehran has suggested it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries' oil exports in retaliation for US sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude. Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes. "The security of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz has always been important for us ... we will confront any and all disruptive efforts in this critical waterway in the future," said Rouhani. The Strait of Hormuz is a strategic artery linking Middle East crude producers to key markets in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond. A third of the world's seaborne oil passes through the strait in southern Iran. Trump, in his annual UN speech, said he would keep up economic pressure on Tehran to try to force a change in its behavior. But Rouhani said Iran had no intention of succumbing to the US pressure. "The United States' understanding of international relations is authoritarian. ... Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition," Rouhani said. "No state and nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force," said the pragmatist president, adding that Iran did not want any war. President Trump (Photo: EPA) "Our proposal is clear: commitment for commitment; violation for violation; threat for threat; and step for step, instead of talk for talk," he said. Rouhani expressed Iran's willingness to improve ties with the regional countries. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia has been at loggerheads with Shi'ite Iran for decades, fighting a long-running proxy war in the Middle East and beyond that has influenced conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Riyadh and its Gulf allies have hailed Trump's decision to exit the nuclear deal and to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, reflecting their concern about Iran's influence in the region. "We believe in the formation of a collective mechanism for the Persian Gulf region with the presence and participation of all regional countries," Rouhani said.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani calls the Israeli-Palestinian conflict the “most pressing crisis” in the Middle East and claims the Jewish state is the greatest threat to world peace. “The innumerable crimes of Israel against the Palestinians would not have been possible without the political and military assistance” of the US,” he charges in a speech to the UN General Assembly. He accuses Israel of “blatantly threatening others with nuclear annihilation” and says the Jewish state constitutes “the most daunting threat to regional and global peace.” Rouhani calls Trump’s decision to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem “abhorrent” and said recent legislation defining Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people is “racist” and a “manifestation of apartheid.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (C) speaks during the weekly cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, on July 12, 2015. (Xinhua/JINI/POOL/Emil Salman) UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday said that Iran has hidden "massive amounts of equipment and materiel," indicating that the country is eyeing nuclear weapon program. Speaking at the General Debate of the UN General Assembly, Netanyahu said that nearly 15 kilograms of radioactive material had been stored in the warehouse in the Turquzabad district of Tehran. "Today I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran's secret nuclear program," Netanyahu said. This site contained as much as 300 tonnes of nuclear-related equipment and materiel, he said, noting Iran hasn't abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons. While not detailing what the material was, Netanyahu urged the International Atomic Energy Agency, a UN atomic watchdog, to inspect the location immediately. Netanyahu also criticized Europe for setting up a legal entity to bypass U.S. re-imposed sanctions, saying such action amounts to an appeasement with Iran. On Monday, European Union foreign and security policy chief Federica Mogherini said that the EU will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran in light of the U.S. withdrawal from the international agreement on Tehran's nuclear program and the re-imposition of sanctions. On Wednesday, leaders of France and Britain, while speaking at the UN Security Council (UNSC) meeting on non-proliferation, vowed to defend the Iran nuke deal. All these showed that Washington, by exiting the deal and sanctioning Iran, has put itself in isolation, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. Netanyahu on April 30 revealed what he called a "great intelligence achievement" about Iran's nuclear program, saying that he had proof that Iran had been seeking nuclear power even after it signed an agreement curbing its nuclear program in 2015. However, Iranian Foreign Ministry later denounced his nuclear allegations against Iran as a "worthless show" and "ridiculous propagandist presentations" that were "merely aimed at spreading lies and deception." Tensions between Iran and Israel, as well as the United States, have been running high this year. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States will impose "tougher than ever" sanctions on Iran after the punitive actions against the country slated in November this year. In May, Trump announced Washington's withdrawal from the landmark Iranian nuclear deal. Since then, the Trump administration has slapped a number of sanctions on Iran while vowing to apply more in November.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed before the UN General Assembly on Thursday “another secret atomic facility” in Iran, some four months after he presented what he said was “conclusive proof” of a secret project underway in Iran for the development of nuclear weapons. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter “What I’m about to say has not been shown publicly before ... Today I’m revealing the site of a second facility, Iran’s secret atomic warehouse,” he said after a brief introduction praising his country under his leadership for opposing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in May, making way for the reimposition of crippling sanctions that have devastated Iran’s currency and which threaten to ravage its economy. The new site Netanyahu identified sits a short distance from Shourabad where the Mossad pinched a trove of documents and evidence showing that Iran had archived its nuclear materials despite the nuclear deal. PM Netanyahu addresses UN General Assembly (צילום: UN Web TV) X “When I spoke here 3 years ago Israel stood alone among the nations. Of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this hall, only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran. We oppose it because it threatens our future, even our very survival,” the prime minister said. “We opposed it because the deal paved Iran’s path to a nuclear arsenal and the lifting of the sanction has fueled Iran’s campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the Middle East. We opposed it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie … Israel exposed that lie.” Continuing what has become a traditional characteristic of presenting visuals during his UN speeches, Netanyahu said “Let me show you exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like. Here it is,” while holding up a picture of satellite and up-close images. According to Netanyahu, the second secret site was right near a rug-cleaning store, which he quipped may now be radioactive. There was no immediate official response from Tehran. Iran's mission to the UN did not respond to a request for comment. Iran's state-run, English-language Press TV channel carried Netanyahu's remarks live, but cut away after he made the allegation about the nuclear warehouse. PM Netanyahu shows satellite images of 'another atomic facility in Iran' (Photo: AFP) "Since we raided the atomic archive, they’ve been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. Just last month they cleared out 15kg of radioactive material … They took it out and they spread it around Tehran in order to hide the evidence," he claimed. He also said Israel shared the information with the UN atomic watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment. "The IAEA has not demanded to inspect a single site discovered in that secret archive. So given this inaction, I decided to reveal today something else that we have shared with the IAEA and a few intelligence agencies," he explained. Listing a legion of threats posed by Iran and its Lebanon-based terror proxy group Hezbollah, which he said was acquiring the technical know-how from Tehran to convert non-precision missiles into precision missiles to hit Israeli cities, Netanyahu said that he had a message for “the tyrants of Tehran.” “Israel knows what you're doing and Israel knows where you are doing it,” he declared. "What Iran hides, Israel will find.’ Netanyahu said that over the last year, Hezbollah has attempted to build an infrastructure for the conversion of surface-to-surface missiles into precision missiles near an airport in Beirut. In a similar vein to his message to Iran, Netanyahu issued a warning to Hezbollah. "I have a message for Hezbollah today: Israel also knows what you’re doing. Israel knows where you are doing it and Israel will not let you get away with it." PM shows satellite images of precision missiles facility (Photo: AFP) The prime minister’s speech comes on the heels of a diplomatic spat with Russia after Syria accidentally shot down a Russian spy plane while attempting to repel an IAF strike in Latakia. Since the incident last week, Israel has said that it will not be inhibited by the adverse political fallout from continuing to attack targets to prevent Iranian military entrenchment in Syria or the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah—a message that Netanyahu used the podium to reiterate. “Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran’s aggression. We will continue to act against you in Syria, we will act against you in Lebanon and we will continue to act against you in Iraq ... wherever, whenever, to defend our state and to defend out people,” he vowed. Accusing Iran of using money that poured into its coffers following the lifting of economic sanctions in the wake of the nuclear deal, Netanyahu said that Tehran “used the money to fuel its vast war machine.” PM Netanyahu at UNGA (Photo: AFP) But Iran’s aggression, the prime minister said, was not confined to the Middle East, asserting that it had spread both into New York and Europe. Despite the threats posed by Iran to the European continent, Netanyahu said that its nations were still “appeasing” and "coddling" the Islamic republic by seeking to mitigate the financial impact of US sanctions. "I’m an historian’s son, I have to ask. I ask not merely as an historian’s son, I ask it as a Jew, as a citizen of the world, as someone who’s lived through the 20th century: Have these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?" he asked. “Well, in Israel, we don’t need a wakeup call because Iran threatens us every day. Because despite the best of hope, and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal, this deal did not push war further away. It brought war ever closer to our borders,” Netanyahu said. But Netanyahu did say that the Iran nuclear deal had made one significant, positive contribution to the MIddle East. “I have an important confession to make. This may surprise you. But I have to admit that the Iran deal has had one positive consequence … By empowering Iran, it brought Israel and many Arab states closer together than ever before, in an intimacy and friendship that I’ve not seen in my lifetime and that would have been unimaginable years ago,” he said while pounding the rostrum. Netanyahu also used the end of his speech to criticize the people who have objected to Israel’s recent passage of the Nation-State Law, which Abbas said would lead to an official apartheid system. "Israel is called racist for making Hebrew the official language? … When Israel is declared an apartheid state for declaring itself the nation-state of the Jewish people, it is downright preposterous," he shouted. "There are more than 50 countries here that have crosses or crescents on their flags,” he pointed out, stressing that those countries are inhabited by people from many faiths. “Only Israel is denigrated,” he said, for celebrating its national heritage. “Here at the UN, Israel is absurdly accused of racism … Here at the UN, Israel is shamefully accused of apartheid. Here at the UN, Israel is outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing. It’s the same old anti-Semitism with a brand new face,” he said, prompting a round of applause from supporters. The Israeli leader slammed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for lambasting Israel on the podium just moments earlier, citing examples of hypocrisy in Abbas’s accusations of racism against Israel. “President Abbas, you should know better. You write a dissertation denying the Holocaust. Your PA imposes death sentences on Palestinians for selling land to Jews,” he said. He also highlighted the PA’s policy of paying Palestinian terrorists for killing Jews in Israel. “President Abbas, you proudly pay Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews. In fact the more they slay, the more you pay. That’s in their law too, and you condemn Israel’s morality? You call Israel racist? This is not the way to peace,” he vented. Netanyahu’s remarks to the UN came a day after Trump made his first public endorsement of a two-state solution to resolve the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Speaking before the prime minister, President Abbas told the UN General Assembly that Jerusalem "is not for sale" while urging President Trump to rescind his decisions recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and cutting aid to the Palestinians, which he said had undermined the two-state solution to the Middle East conflict. "I renew my call to President Trump to rescind his decisions and decrees regarding Jerusalem, refugees and settlements."

News article:
UNITED NATIONS: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described on Thursday what he said was a secret atomic warehouse in Tehran and accused Europe of appeasing Iran as he sought to rally support for US sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu showed an aerial photograph of the Iranian capital marked with a red arrow and pointed to what he said was a previously secret warehouse holding nuclear-related material. He argued this showed Iran still sought to obtain nuclear weapons, despite its 2015 agreement with world powers to curb its program in exchange for loosening of sanctions. Netanyahu spoke 4-1/2 months after US President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord, arguing it did too little to rein in Tehran´s nuclear ambitions and triggering the resumption of US economic sanctions on Iran. Netanyahu said the site contained some 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of radioactive material that has since been moved and called on the UN atomic agency to inspect the location immediately with Geiger counters. "I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran´s secret nuclear programme," Netanyahu said. The world will laugh at Netanyahu´s claims, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, according to Fars News. "The world will only laugh loudly at this type of false, meaningless and unnecessary speech and false shows," Qassemi said. Iran´s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that there should be more scrutiny on Israel´s nuclear program. "No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a secret and undeclared nuclear weapons program - including an actual atomic arsenal. Time for Israel to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons program to international inspectors," Zarif tweeted. Netanyahu did not identify the material nor specifically suggest that Iran had actively violated the nuclear deal. An outspoken opponent of the deal, Netanyahu has previously made allegations about Iran´s nuclear activities that are difficult or impossible to verify, including presenting a cartoon bomb to the General Assembly in 2012 warning of how close Tehran was to producing a nuclear device. In April, Netanyahu presented what he said was evidence of a large secret archive of documents related to Iran´s clandestine nuclear weapons program at a different site in Tehran. He said Israeli agents removed vast amounts of documents from that site. At the time, Iran said the documents were fake. In a speech in which he said relatively little about efforts to achieve peace with the Palestinians, Netanyahu said Iran had since begun moving items out of the second site. "Since we raided the atomic archive, they´ve been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. Just last month they removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material. You know what they did with it?" he said. "They took it out and they spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence. "He said Iranian officials still had a lot of work to do because there were some 15 shipping containers full of nuclear-related equipment and materials stored at the second site. "This site contained as much as 300 tonnes - 300 tonnes - of nuclear-related equipment and materiel," he said. Under the nuclear deal struck by Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from US and other economic sanctions. The International Atomic Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly said Tehran was abiding by its commitments to the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), including in a document reviewed by Reuters on Aug. 30.France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia have stayed in the pact, vowing to save it despite the restoration of US sanctions and this week discussing a barter mechanism they hope may allow Iran to circumvent the US measures.Netanyahu criticized Europe for doing so in unusually harsh language that evoked European nations´ initial failure to confront Nazi Germany in the 1930s. "While the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions, Europe and others are appeasing Iran by trying to help it bypass those new sanctions," Netanyahu said. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States is aware of the facility Netanyahu announced and described it as a "warehouse" used to store "records andarchives" from Iran's nuclear program. A second US intelligence official called Netanyahuâ€™s comments "somewhat misleading. First, we have known about this facility for some time, and itâ€™s full of file cabinets and paper, not aluminium tubes for centrifuges, and second, so far as anyone knows, there is nothing in it that would allow Iran to break out of the JCPOA any faster than it otherwise could. "The Israeli leader also lambasted Iran´s ballistic missile activity, identifying three locations near Beirut airport where he said Lebanon´s Hezbollah was converting missiles. "In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hezbollah to build secret sites to convert inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles, missiles that can target deep inside Israel within an accuracy of 10 metres (yards)," he said. The IAEA, Iran and Hezbollah were not immediately available for comment. The Israeli military released a video clip and photos of what it said were Hezbollah Shi´ite militia rocket building sites in Lebanon, shortly after Netanyahu´s address.

News article:
By JTA September 28, 2018 (JTA) — A State Department official called on the International Atomic Energy Agency to investigate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s claims about a secret nuclear warehouse in Tehran. Netanyahu made the claim about the facility in the Turquzabad district of the Iranian capital Thursday during a speech at the U.N. headquarters in New York. Netanyahu claimed the warehouse was used for “storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program,” which was being moved to other parts of the city. He urged the IAEA to investigate the locale. In a statement quoted by Reuters, a State Department official said following Netanyahu’s claims that it was “absolutely imperative that the IAEA fully exercise its authorities in order to provide confidence to the international community that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran.” An unnamed U.S. diplomatic source quoted by the Israel Broadcasting Corp. said: “The latest revelation of nuclear documents requires the Agency to find out if Iran is hiding nuclear materials or activity.” In April, Israel announced it had stolen more than 100,000 documents from a Tehran archive detailing the Iranian nuclear program. Iran has denied Netanyahu’s claims about a nuclear warehouse. An unnamed U.S. intelligence source was quoted by the Israel Broadcasting Corp. as disputing Netanyahu’s claims about the warehouse. “What Netanyahu said last night was slightly misleading,” the source was quoted as saying. “We knew about the facility in Tehran and it’s a place full of file cabinets and documents, not aluminum pipes or centrifuges. Secondly, there’s nothing in that facility that can be seen as an Iranian violation of the nuclear deal.” Alyssa Fisher is a news writer at the Forward.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday dismissed Israeli claims that Tehran was harbouring a secret atomic warehouse. "No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a *secret* and *undeclared* nuclear weapons programme," Zarif said in a tweet. He called on Israel saying it was "time to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons" programme to international inspectors. "How can Israel, as the only holder of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, so shamelessly accuse a country whose programmes have repeatedly been declared as peaceful by the IAEA," the UN nuclear watchdog, Iran's official IRNA news agency quoted Zarif as saying. He said Israel and the United States stood "alone" on the world stage, as "policies forced by Netanyahu on America" had driven them both to isolation. Zarif was responding to allegations made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday in a speech to the UN General Assembly, embellished by ample use of the colourful props that have become his trademark. Netanyahu held up a map and a photograph of an outwardly "innocent looking compound" which he said was a secret atomic warehouse in Tehran and urged the IAEA to inspect. "Today, I'm disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran's secret nuclear weapons programme," he said. Israel, along with Saudi Arabia and its allies, are the main supporters of US President Donald Trump's abandonment of a landmark 2015 nuclear accord between the major powers and Iran. The move, announced in May and accompanied by the subsequent reimposition of crippling US sanctions, has put Washington at odds with other major powers, including longstanding allies.

News article:
NEW YORK — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s revelation at the UN on Thursday of a previously unknown Iranian nuclear site has caused “growing pressure inside Iran,” a senior Israeli official said over the weekend. “They’re wondering how to deal with this facility, how to evacuate it, how to cover it up,” the official said. “There is no doubt it is a very important site for them; they’re seeking to conceal it and stall in any way possible.” According to the official, the 15 kilograms of radioactive material that Netanyahu said was removed from the facility and dispersed around Tehran was taken away at the beginning of August. Netanyahu, meanwhile, told Israeli reporters in a briefing Friday that it was past time for the IAEA to act, and that Iran had been exposed “as deceiving and cheating the international community.” He also said that Iran was aiming to break out to a nuclear arsenal when it deems the time ripe: “There’ll be a crisis somewhere or other, and they’ll [take advantage of the distraction] to break out to a nuclear arsenal,” he warned. “That’s the Iranian plan.” In his address to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, revealing the “secret atomic warehouse,” Netanyahu said “[Global] intelligence services and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have known about this for six weeks” and failed to act. The warehouse allegedly contained nuclear materials that Iran is not allowed to hold without declaring them to the IAEA. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu, in his speech, claimed the warehouse was used for “storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program,” which was quickly being moved to other parts of the city. The site may contain as much as 300 tons of nuclear-related equipment and material in 15 shipping containers, he added. The US on Friday asked the IAEA to investigate Netanyahu’s new allegations, although Reuters also quoted a US official as saying the prime minister’s information was misleading, and that the site contained documentation and not nuclear materials. Advertisement The Israeli official rejected this on Friday, saying “It’s not just documents. There are other things there,” and added: “Did he check it? First of all, let them check.” He noted that it seemed “very important for Iran to hide it, to disperse things across Tehran.” The official acknowledged that Israel did not have information on everything contained within the site, and said this was why the IAEA should “go and check.” Asked if the existence of the secret warehouse and its contents definitely violated the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the Israeli official replied: “First of all, let them check… Why did they remove 15 kilograms of radioactive material? That’s a question that needs to be looked into. “We know there’s radioactive material there. They distributed that radioactive material all around Tehran. Those 15 kilograms are a fact. Why did they go around dispersing it? What happened? They need to check.” Iranians on Friday published selfies on social media taken outside the facility, and mocked Netanyahu’s claim that it was a secret nuclear facility. The official said “The fact that you have young Iranians taking selfies there is unbelievable.” The senior official scoffed at the notion that Netanyahu had exposed sensitive intelligence material. “That’s absurd. We had discussions about this, what to reveal and what not to, and it was decided to reveal it at this point.” Advertisement Briefing Israeli reporters traveling with him in the US, Netanyahu himself on Friday said it was “time for [the IAEA] to act.” As to whether it would, he said: “They may act and they may not act, but one thing is certain — Iran has been exposed as deceiving and cheating the international community. That’s been revealed and that’s the main purpose. Anything else is a bonus.” Netanyahu once again lambasted the 2015 nuclear deal, saying Iran “immediately” used funds freed up by the accord to bolster its war machine. “It gave them hundreds of millions of dollars in direct released funds, in credit and in the entry of investors” and Iran had since seen “a 40 percent increase in its defense budget.” Said Netanyahu Friday, in a bitter denunciation of the accord: “The essence of the 2015 nuclear deal was that, in that in return for not enriching uranium for a single bomb, Iran in a few years will get the right to enrich for hundreds of bombs. Iran has already announced that it will produce 200,000 centrifuges, some of them 20 times faster than the current generation.” Iran, he said, has “mountains of yellowcake” uranium concentrate. “They have their archived information [on bomb-making] in their secret atomic archive. They can push not for one bomb, but for hundreds of bombs simultaneously.” “There’ll be a crisis somewhere or other, and they’ll [take advantage of the distraction] to break out to a nuclear arsenal,” he warned. “That’s the Iranian plan. And that’s what the agreement gave them. “It also gave them hundreds of millions of dollars — directly released funds,” he noted. “They put that money directly into their war machine; there’s been a 40% increase in their defense budget. The Iranians, he said, “were also obligated [under the deal] to come clean on all their [nuclear] activities. The 15 kilograms [of radioactive material] is further prove [of their failure to do so].” The newly revealed warehouse, said Netanyahu, did not merely contain documents, as some US officials have charged. “There are other things too. But they key fact is that they hid it.” Advertisement On Friday an unnamed official told Channel 10 news that the facility was uncovered by the Mossad spy agency a few months ago, and had since been kept under surveillance. When the IAEA failed to act, the Israeli government apparently agonized over what to do with the information, and decided after discussions in the Prime Minister’s Office that Netanyahu would reveal it in his annual speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday in an attempt to goad the IAEA into taking action. “There was no choice but to reveal this information, because the goal is to prompt the IAEA to take action,” the senior official said. “We wanted to wake up the world and pressure the IAEA to act against the suspected facilities in Iran.” Channel 10 reported that the senior official revealed that the nuclear facility is under the supervision of a secret Iranian defense ministry department headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, named by Netanyahu in his April presentation of the seized nuclear archive as the Iranian physicist who heads the country’s nuclear program. “Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,” Netanyahu had said in April, showcasing the material that he said proved conclusively that Iran lied when it said it had not sought nuclear weapons and that the 2015 nuclear deal was built upon “Iranian deception.” The Israeli official was adamant, by contrast, that what the Iranians were keeping in the newly revealed warehouse was considerably more grave than the contents of the archive. The official did not elaborate beyond saying it was “forbidden nuclear material,” the TV report said. In May an Israeli TV report suggested Jerusalem may have decided not to assassinate Fakhrizadeh because it prefers to keep him alive and watch what he is up to, even as other Iranian nuclear experts have been assassinated in recent years in hits attributed to the Mossad. Advertisement At the General Assembly speech (full text here), the prime minister said the IAEA had failed to take any action after he revealed in April a nuclear archive that Israeli spies managed to spirit out of Iran, and so he was now revealing what he said was a “secret atomic warehouse” in the Turquzabad district of Tehran, a few miles from the archive. Both the archive and warehouse, Netanyahu said, were proof that Iran had not given up its nuclear program. “Iran has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons…. Rest assured that will not happen. What Iran hides, Israel will find,” Netanyahu added. On Thursday, Netanyahu also met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and urged him to ask the IAEA to investigate the facility. He urged IAEA director-general Yukiya Amano, who he called “a good man,” to “do the right thing” and “go and inspect this atomic warehouse immediately — before the Iranians finish cleaning it out.” Inspect “right here, right now,” he urged, “and inspect the other sites we told you about… Tell the world the truth about Iran.” Iranian officials have dismissed Netanyahu’s claims about the atomic warehouse as unfounded and “obscene.” Referring to Netanyahu’s statements as “ridiculous,” an Iranian state TV report said the country is committed to nonproliferation and Iran’s nuclear program is under surveillance of the IAEA. The website of state TV briefly reported the Netanyahu accusation and called it an “illusion.” Agencies contributed to this report.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intended to reveal a third batch of intelligence material in his UN speech on Thursday, in which he exposed what he said was a “secret atomic warehouse” in Tehran and revealed details of Hezbollah missile factories in Beirut, a senior Israeli official said at the weekend. Netanyahu ultimately elected not to include the third revelation in his address to the General Assembly because the security establishment recommended that he not do so, Israel’s Channel 10 news said Saturday night. Beyond indicating that the intelligence material related to “a third site,” the official provided no further details of the information. Netanyahu’s decision to specify the location and alleged content of the Tehran atomic warehouse, from which he said the Iranians recently removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material, was taken after consultations with the security establishment and with its approval, the prime minister has made clear. Israel had provided details of the warehouse to the IAEA and to the US administration six weeks ago, but Netanyahu charged that the IAEA failed to act. It was decided after security consultations at the Prime Minister’s Office that Netanyahu would publicize the information at the UN, in the hope of galvanizing the IAEA into action. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Since his speech, the US has indeed asked the IAEA to investigate the site, and Netanyahu also asked UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to push the IAEA on this. Immediately after Netanyahu’s speech, meanwhile, the IDF published further information on the Hezbollah missile factories that Netanyahu had referred to. Presumably the recommendation from security chiefs that Netanyahu not include material on the third site in his speech stemmed from a decision to work behind the scenes on this issue for the time being. Advertisement In April, Netanyahu held a press conference to detail the contents of a huge haul of documentation taken by the Mossad from a secret Iranian nuclear weapons project archive in Tehran. The operation to remove that material from under the Iranians’ noses had taken place months earlier. Israel had privately shared some of the material with the US and with the IAEA, Netanyahu said at the time, but did not rush to make the haul public. Briefing Israeli reporters traveling with Netanyahu in the US on Friday, a senior Israeli official said the prime minister’s revelation of the atomic warehouse and its contents has caused “growing pressure inside Iran.” “They’re wondering how to deal with this facility, how to evacuate it, how to cover it up,” the official said. “There is no doubt it is a very important site for them; they’re seeking to conceal it and stall in any way possible.” According to the official, the 15 kilograms of radioactive material that Netanyahu said was removed from the facility and dispersed around Tehran was taken away at the beginning of August.

When the IAEA failed to act, the Israeli government apparently agonized over what to do with the information, and decided after discussions in the Prime Minister’s Office that Netanyahu would reveal it in his annual speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday in an attempt to goad the IAEA into taking action. “There was no choice but to reveal this information, because the goal is to prompt the IAEA to take action,” the senior official said. “We wanted to wake up the world and pressure the IAEA to act against the suspected facilities in Iran.” Channel 10 reported that the senior official revealed that the nuclear facility is under the supervision of a secret Iranian defense ministry department headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, named by Netanyahu in his April presentation of the seized nuclear archive as the Iranian physicist who heads the country’s nuclear program. “Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,” Netanyahu had said in April, showcasing the material that he said proved conclusively that Iran lied when it said it had not sought nuclear weapons and that the 2015 nuclear deal was built upon “Iranian deception.” The Israeli official was adamant, by contrast, that what the Iranians were keeping in the newly revealed warehouse was considerably more grave than the contents of the archive. The official did not elaborate beyond saying it was “forbidden nuclear material,” the TV report said. In May an Israeli TV report suggested Jerusalem may have decided not to assassinate Fakhrizadeh because it prefers to keep him alive and watch what he is up to, even as other Iranian nuclear experts have been assassinated in recent years in hits attributed to the Mossad. At the General Assembly speech (full text here), the prime minister said the IAEA had failed to take any action after he revealed in April a nuclear archive that Israeli spies managed to spirit out of Iran, and so he was now revealing what he said was a “secret atomic warehouse” in the Turquzabad district of Tehran, a few miles from the archive. Both the archive and warehouse, Netanyahu said, were proof that Iran had not given up its nuclear program. “Iran has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons … Rest assured that will not happen. What Iran hides, Israel will find,” Netanyahu added. On Thursday, Netanyahu also met with UN Secretary-General Guterres and urged him to ask the IAEA to investigate the facility. He urged IAEA director-general Yukiya Amano, whom he called “a good man,” to “do the right thing” and “go and inspect this atomic warehouse immediately — before the Iranians finish cleaning it out.” Inspect “right here, right now,” he urged, “and inspect the other sites we told you about… Tell the world the truth about Iran.” Iranian officials have dismissed Netanyahu’s claims about the atomic warehouse as unfounded and “obscene.” Referring to Netanyahu’s statements as “ridiculous,” an Iranian state TV report said the country is committed to nonproliferation and Iran’s nuclear program is under surveillance of the IAEA. The website of state TV briefly reported the Netanyahu accusation and called it an “illusion.” Agencies contributed to this report.

Israel in no position to level nuclear accusation at Iran: Zarif Iran Press TV Fri Sep 28, 2018 01:41AM Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has lashed out at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his baseless claims against Iran at his UN speech, saying Tel Aviv is in no position to level such accusations against Tehran. "Netanyahu must explain how Israel, as the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East region, can put itself in a position to level such brazen accusations against a country whose [nuclear] program has been repeatedly declared peaceful by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," Zarif told IRNA on Thursday. The senior Iranian diplomat's comments came after the Israeli prime minister once again took the stage at the UN on Thursday to put on another spectacle about Iran's nuclear program, repeating his threadbare allegation that the country is working to develop nuclear weapons at "secret" sites. Zarif said Netanyahu's move is only aimed at deflecting attention from the fact that the Israeli regime is "the biggest threat to the Middle East" given that he stands by a nuclear weapons facility and threatens other states with atomic annihilation. "The Tel Aviv regime will never manage to achieve anything by playing such games," the Iranian foreign minister added. "We have seen in recent days the extent of the US' isolation at the UN General Assembly and the Security Council as a result of the policies Netanyahu has imposed on Washington. Now imagine how isolated the Israelis themselves are when they have managed to haul the US into such isolation," Zarif stated. 'World to laugh out loud at Netanyahu's Iran claims' Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi strongly dismissed Netanyahu's UN show as "ridiculous" and a fabricated scenario aimed at making up for the failed US and Israeli smear campaign against Iran at the UN General Assembly. "The occupying regime [of Israel] must know that in the new era, the world will only laugh out loud at such false, inconsiderate and empty remarks and fake shows," Qassemi told journalists on Thursday. He referred to the IAEA as the only body responsible for dealing with nuclear issues, saying that 12 reports issued by the UN atomic watchdog and verified by the global community and all relevant parties have so far confirmed Iran's commitment to its obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview broadcast Sunday that the Holocaust cannot be used “as a justification for an apartheid policy in Palestine.” Zarif, speaking to CBS’s “Face the Nation” was asked about a recent statement from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said that “for a Holocaust denying country that is threatening Israel to compare the United States or its leader to Nazis is among the most outrageous things I have ever heard.” Zarif responded by first acknowledging the Holocaust, but then saying it was no excuse for Israel to mistreat Palestinians. The Iranian regime has a long history of Holocaust denial. “Iran has stated very clearly, we reject the killing of innocent people no matter what the numbers, no matter by who,” Zarif said, before being asked if he was referring to the Holocaust and if he acknowledged that six million Jews were murdered. “Of course it did,” he said. “And a huge number of people died – a huge number of innocent people who died.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “But, it does not justify depriving others of their homeland. It does not justify building settlements in the territory of other people. It does not justify violating on mass the rights of Palestinians. The Holocaust cannot be used as a justification for an apartheid policy in Palestine,” Zarif said. Asked why Iranian President Rouhani said that US President Donald Trump has tendencies resembling a Nazi disposition, Zarif stood by his president’s words. “The xenophobic tendencies that he has exhibited, the wall, the Muslim ban, the ban on Iranians traveling to the United States. All of these are reminiscent of the type of mentality,” Zarif said. Advertisement In excepts from the interview released earlier, Zarif rejected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s allegations of a new “secret atomic warehouse” near Tehran, branding it the latest “nonsense” claim regarding the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program in a string of “wrong” claims dating back to 1992. “He’s just trying to find a smokescreen,” Zarif said in an excerpt from an interview released Saturday night. “He’s been making allegations about Iran since 1992,” said a smiling Zarif. “In 1992, according to him, we were supposed to have finished making a bomb in about five years. In 1996 still five years. So he’s been on the record — even testifying before Congress — that Iran is just about to make a nuclear weapon.” Zarif rejected all of Netanyahu’s claims. “The previous allegations that Netanyahu made have been investigated by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and have been rejected,” Zarif said. “He’s been wrong about the previous [allegations] and he’s wrong about this one… They are nonsense.” Advertisement Furthermore, Zarif said, if Netanyahu wanted to ensure that Tehran could not produce a nuclear weapon, he should have supported the deal clinched between the major world powers and Iran in 2015, which he had instead tried to torpedo. The United States in May withdrew from the accord. “If he’s concerned about Iran’s nuclear program, the best way to make sure, is the deal that he has done his best to undermine, because JCPOA, the nuclear deal, allows the IAEA the most intrusive inspections that are available in the world,” Zarif said. “And Iran accepted those intrusive inspections because we did not have anything to hide.” Zarif also accused Netanyahu of hypocrisy in his threat against Iran in late August, issued outside the Dimona nuclear facility in southern Israel. “You remember a few weeks ago, he stood beside Dimona, which is the bomb making factory of Israel, and threatened Iran with annihilation,” he said. “And now he says that the Iranians threatened them with annihilation. This is absurd.” The full CBS interview is to be broadcast on Sunday night. Zarif’s comments reiterated his dismissive tweets on Thursday. No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a *secret* and *undeclared* nuclear weapons program – including an *actual atomic arsenal*. Time for Israel to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons program to international inspectors. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) September 27, 2018 Advertisement “No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a *secret* and *undeclared* nuclear weapons program — including an *actual atomic arsenal*,” Zarif said. “Time for Israel to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons program to international inspectors.” Israel is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal but has never publicly acknowledged it. Zarif further called Netanyahu’s accusation an “obscene charge,” the state-run IRNA news agency reported Friday, and branded the Israeli prime minister a “liar who would not stop lying.” Netanyahu in his speech last week revealed what he said was a previously unknown Iranian nuclear site, saying it could contain up to 300 tons of nuclear material, and accused the International Atomic Energy Agency of failing to investigate findings that he presented earlier this year about Iran’s nuclear program. Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly (full text), Netanyahu also revealed what he said were Hezbollah precision missile sites hidden in Beirut, warned that Israel would act against Iran “whenever and wherever.” The prime minister said the IAEA, the UN’s nuclear agency, had failed to take any action after he revealed in April a nuclear archive that Israeli spies managed to spirit out of Iran, and so he was now disclosing what he said was a “secret atomic warehouse” in the Turquzabad district of Tehran, a few miles from the archive. Netanyahu claimed the warehouse was used for “storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program,” which was quickly being moved to other parts of the city. Advertisement He claimed some 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of radioactive material had been recently removed from this atomic warehouse and squirreled away around Tehran, endangering the capital’s residents. The site may contain as much as 300 tons of nuclear-related equipment and material in 15 shipping containers, he added. He did not specify what nuclear material was contained at the site. Israel had provided details of the warehouse to the IAEA and to the US administration six weeks ago, but Netanyahu charged that the IAEA failed to act. It was decided after security consultations at the Prime Minister’s Office that Netanyahu would publicize the information at the UN, in the hope of galvanizing the IAEA into action. The US on Friday asked the IAEA to investigate Netanyahu’s new allegations, although Reuters also quoted a US official as saying the prime minister’s information was misleading, and that the site contained documentation and not nuclear materials. An Israeli official rejected this on Friday, saying, “It’s not just documents. There are other things there,” and added: “Did he check it? First of all, let them check.” He noted that it seemed “very important for Iran to hide it, to disperse things across Tehran.” Michael Bachner and agencies contributed to this report.

News article:
Israel plans to share recently obtained intelligence ‎on covert Iranian nuclear activity, as well as on ‎its efforts to arm its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, ‎with several countries worldwide in an effort to ‎drive them to act against the Islamic republic.‎ Addressing the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, ‎Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed that Iran ‎was maintaining a secret warehouse holding ‎nuclear-‎related material, in violation of the 2015 deal with ‎world powers. ‎ He further lambasted Iran for its involvement in the ‎Syrian ‎civil war and its attempt to establish ‎permanent ‎military bases there from which to attack ‎Israel, as ‎well as for its funding and arming of ‎Hezbollah, presenting world leaders with evidence ‎that the latter was using ‎Iranian funding to build ‎weapon production ‎facilities in the heart of ‎Lebanese capital, ‎including near Beirut’s ‎international airport.‎ ‎ Israel Hayom learned on Saturday that Israel will first ‎and foremost share the information with the other ‎signatories to the 2015 accord, namely Britain, ‎France, Germany, Russia and China, as well as with ‎the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).‎ This means to show them that while they insist on ‎backing the deal and look for ways to circumvent the ‎issues that arose in the wake of the U.S.’s decision ‎to withdraw from the deal in May, Iran continues to ‎deceive them and the United Nations by secretly pursuing ‎nuclear weapons.‎ Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Israeli intelligence has found that the facility, ‎disguised as a carpet manufacturing plant, housed ‎hardware and software directly connected to Iran’s ‎nuclear program. ‎ Western diplomats said on Saturday that while this ‎information had to be brought to the IAEA’s ‎attention, it did not constitute a “smoking gun” ‎proving that Iran was in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal. ‎ Backed into a corner on the issue The decision to reveal the information at the U.N. ‎General Assembly was made after the data was ‎carefully scrutinized by the Israel Defense Forces and the Mossad, ‎Israel’s national intelligence agency, to ensure making it public would not compromise sensitive sources.‎ A senior political source said that Netanyahu sought ‎to have his U.N. address incriminate Iran “across ‎the board,” which led to the decision to include ‎the intelligence pertaining to Hezbollah’s weapon-production efforts. ‎ Israeli military intelligence has been closely ‎monitoring the Shiite terrorist group’s efforts for ‎the past year, and has already shared it with ‎several Western intelligence agencies, he said. ‎ Iranian officials dismissed Netanyahu’s claims at ‎the United Nations, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif ‎denouncing the allegations as an “obscene charge” ‎and calling the Israeli prime minister “liar who ‎would not stop lying.” ‎ Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi ‎said that “the world will only laugh loudly at this ‎type of false, meaningless and unnecessary speech ‎and false shows.” In Lebanon, where Hezbollah sits in the government ‎and wields considerable political power, the ‎allegations against Hezbollah prompted a heated ‎public and media debate.‎ The fact that one of the Hezbollah sites is ‎located near Beirut’s international airport prompted ‎harsh criticism at the group for jeopardizing the ‎country’s tourism industry, which is one of its main ‎sources of revenue.‎ The Israeli official said that as the Lebanese ‎government it mostly powerless against the Shi’ite ‎terrorist group, and it is unlikely that any Western ‎nations would attempt to curb its activities, the ‎Israeli policy of thwarting any Iranian attempt to ‎smuggle weapons to Hezbollah will remain in place.‎ A source in Netanyahu’s entourage to the U.N. General ‎Assembly said that Thursday’s speech has unsettled ‎the Iranians, who have been backed into a corner on ‎the issue.‎ Another source said Netanyahu himself stressed ‎that he would not have gone forward with the ‎revelations without the support of the Israeli ‎intelligence community. ‎ Describing the speech as a “call for action,” ‎Netanyahu also noted that the fact that Iranian ‎officials “criticized the addressed, they didn’t ‎deny [the allegations], which says everything.”

© Sputnik / Roman Mahmutov Anti-Iran Speech as Bid to Justify Own Attacks on Syria Tensions Show No Sign of Abating Fight Over Status Quo to Be Established in Syria Once Terrorists Defeated Syria remains at the heart of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, and the exchange of accusations between the two nations during the week of the General Debate of the 73rd UN General Assembly (UNGA) clearly indicates that these sharp disagreements show no sign of abating, experts told Sputnik.On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the UN platform to announce that his country allegedly discovered Iran's second secret atomic warehouse used to store nuclear-related material.The claims met a swift and harsh response from Tehran.According to Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, the issue of Iranian military presence in Syria was a real "subtext" of Netanyahu's remarks."As long as the Iranians have armed forces in Syria, and as long as they continue to support Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Israeli government will shine the harshest possible light on them in public forums like the UNGA," Pollack told Sputnik.Syrian lawmaker Ahmad Merhi similarly tied Netanyahu's UNGA speech with the developments in Syria, suggesting, however, that"Netanyahu wants to push the world against Iran specifically after Israel's incident with the Russian plane. He tries to justify their acts amid the plane incident. Netanyahu wanted to use the UN tribune to show that Israel is a victim in this situation. At the same time he was reiterating that his military operations in Syria will not stop," Merhi told Sputnik.Former Israeli Deputy National Security Adviser Eran Etzion listed a number of reasons showing that the current tensions would hardly de-escalate in the near future.First of all, the Israeli expert believes in the credibility of Netanyahu's statements on Tehran's alleged nuclear facilitates, noting that the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has only weakened the existing mechanisms to keep the Iran nuclear program under international control.Marco Zanni, a member of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Iran, shared the view, noting that "Secondly, Etzion pointed to the rising tensions in the Gaza Strip, which Israel blames on Israel-supported Palestinian forces and new looming package of the United States' anti-Iran sanctions as factors not contributing to calming the disagreements down.Thirdly, he described Syria as the main issue of friction."Iran and Israel continue to march on a collision course, mainly in Syria. After the Il-20 tragic incident, and Russia's possible policy change with respect to Israel's activities against Iranian military assets in Syria, tensions will only intensify," Etzion said.Marco Zanni, a member of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Iran, shared the expert's view that the de-escalation in the region was very unlikely. According to Zanni, Syria has become an extremely overcrowded theater of military actions, where interests of many players have come into conflict."At this stage, I do not see any further development; they are at stake, taking into account the growing tensions in that area and the role played by outside actors such as the United States and Russia in the shifts in the Middle East balance of power," he suggested.Etzion stressed that Israel's main concern was the future of Iranian military presence and its ceasefire agreement with Syria once the conflict in the Arab republic was over."The most pressing issue is of course Syria. Israel demands that Iran withdraw completely from all Syrian territory. This will not happen. However, Israel has a legitimate concern, one that Russia should address. Now that the civil war is almost over, and Assad's regime has retaken control, it is time to gradually reinstate a stable and agreed ceasefire between Israel and Syria," he pointed out.According to the expert, the 1974 Armistice agreement "must be upgraded to reflect the new circumstances, mainly Iran's and its various proxies' activities against Israel from Syria's territory," noting that "Russia should be the main facilitator" of the process.While Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said on Saturday that the fight against terrorism in the country was almost over, the struggle still continues.. On September 17, Israel's actions in Syria's airspace led to the crash of the Russian Il-20 plane.According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Israel had notified the Russian military of its airstrikes in Syria only one minute before their start and failed to provide the location of its bombers to Russia. As a result, the Il-20 was caught in the crossfire and downed by a missile launched by Syria's S-200 air defense system.The Russian Defense Ministry said Israeli F-16 jets flying in the vicinity used the Russian aircraft as a shield against Syrian air defenses, with Israel refuting the accusations of using the aircraft as a shield and maintaining that Moscow was warned about the air raid in a timely manner.

News article:
Iranian spokesman slams Netanyahu’s ‘Ridiculous Behavior’ at UN Tasnim – Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi rejected Israeli Prime Minister’s recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly about a “secret nuclear warehouse” in Tehran and said his claims are “more like a joke”. Speaking to reporters at his weekly press briefing in Tehran on Monday, Qassemi said what has been done by the Zionist regime of Israel against Iran is nothing but hostility and obstructionism, which has led to nothing but failure for the Israeli premier. His behavior is more like a joke, the spokesman said, adding that this is while many countries are deeply concerned about the Tel Aviv regime’s nuclear weapons program. In response to a question about Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s remarks about mediation between Iran and Israel, Qassemi said the Islamic Republic’s stance on the Zionist regime is completely clear, indicating that Iran would not accept such a mediation because it does not recognize the Zionist entity. In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, Netanyahu said he was revealing the existence of the “atomic warehouse” for the first time in public. As he has in past presentations, Netanyahu brought visual aids to illustrate his claims, according to media reports. He held up a satellite image which he said showed where the warehouse was located in Tehran, and a photograph of a nondescript wall and metal gate, which he said showed the exterior of the warehouse. Israel is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, but its policy is to neither confirm nor deny that it has atomic bombs. The Tel Aviv regime is estimated to have 200 to 400 nuclear warheads in its arsenal. Unlike Iran, the Tel Aviv regime is not a member of the NPT — whose aim is to prevent the spread of nuclear arms and weapons technology – in defiance of international pressure.

News article:
Netanyahu’s anti-Iran claims aim to cover up Israeli crimes: Ex-UN official Tasnim – A former official at the United Nations and professor of international law deplored Israeli Prime Minister’s recent anti-Iran remarks at the UN General Assembly and said the Tel Aviv regime tries to divert world attention from its “daily crimes”. “Netanyahu (and Trump) level allegations against the sovereign state of Iran in provocative and insulting language that makes a series of accusations about the behavior of the Iranian government, and its regional policies, without bothering to provide meaningful evidence,” Richard A. Falk said in an interview with the Tasnim News Agency. “The allegations also take no note of the daily crimes against humanity committed against the Palestinian people and Israel’s acts of war against several neighboring countries,” he said. “Certainly, Israel wants to shift world attention away from its excessive and inhumane uses of lethal force against the people of Gaza every Friday for the last six months,” the former UN official said. Professor Richard Anderson Falk is the author or co-author of 20 books and the editor or co-editor of another 20 volumes. In 2008, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) appointed him to a six-year term as a United Nations Special Rapporteur on “the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967”. The following is the full text of the Interview: Tasnim: In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once again accused Iran of developing a nuclear weapons program. He claimed he was revealing the existence of a “secret atomic warehouse” in Tehran but offered no proof of the claim or details. In response, Iranian officials dismissed the claim as a despicable lie and said such lies are aimed at covering up the Tel Aviv regime’s heinous crimes against the defenseless people of Palestine. This is while Israel is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, but its policy is to neither confirm nor deny that it has atomic bombs. The Tel Aviv regime is estimated to have 200 to 400 nuclear warheads in its arsenal. What do you think about Netanyahu’s comments? Falk: I agree with the implications of the question. As long as Israel has its own secret arsenal of nuclear weapons it has no basis in law or morality to raise questions about Iran’s nuclear activities. Israel persuaded Trump to repudiate the 2015 international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program, which continues to be endorsed and upheld by the other five signatories. Netanyahu (and Trump) level allegations against the sovereign state of Iran in provocative and insulting language that makes a series of accusations about the behavior of the Iranian government, and its regional policies, without bothering to provide meaningful evidence. The allegations also take no note of the daily crimes against humanity committed against the Palestinian people and Israel’s acts of war against several neighboring countries. Whether Israel’s diplomatic assault against Iran, backed by the United States and several Arab governments, is itself a violation of international law is a serious question. Such an assault seems to be encouraging the destabilization of the Iranian governing process and to be threatening Iran with military attacks. It is widely agreed that this kind of coercive diplomacy violates international law and endangers regional and global peace. Certainly, Israel wants to shift world attention away from its excessive and inhumane uses of lethal force against the people of Gaza every Friday for the last six months. The permissive Israeli rules of engagement should be held responsible for killing at least 191 Palestinians and injuring many thousands. It is an ongoing atrocity in circumstances where Israel has a primary obligation under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population of Occupied Palestine. Israel claims that its disengagement from Gaza in 2005 relieves it of humanitarian responsibilities under international law. The UN and most international law experts think differently. They continue to regard Israel as an occupier in control of Gaza’s borders, restricting entry and exit, and periodically mounting massive attacks on Gaza without any efforts to impose procedures of accountability. This control exercised by Israel entails legal responsibility and should lead to criminal accountability as appropriate. Tasnim: As you know, Israeli troops on Friday killed seven other Palestinians, two of them children, and wounded dozens more in the deadliest day in recent weeks as Gazans stepped up protests along the border fence. Since March 30, Israeli forces have killed at least 191 Palestinians during the demonstrations dubbed the “Great March of Return” along the Gaza border. Most of the dead and the thousands wounded were unarmed civilians against whom Israel was using excessive force. What is your opinion about the developments and the Israeli regime’s crimes? Falk: As I suggested in responding to the prior question, Israeli uses of excessive force are violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention governing belligerent occupation and constitute a continuing Crime against Humanity by virtue of its persistence in situations in which nonviolent means of crowd control should have been relied upon by governing Israeli authorities to the extent that genuine security threats were posed. It should be appreciated that Great March of Return is a continuing demonstration against the denial of the fundamental rights of Palestinians to return to their homes inside of Israel from which they were dispossessed in 1947, and subsequently. These Palestinian attempts to mount a protest close to the fence separating Israel from Gaza seemed a reasonable form of resistance under the circumstances and have so far not inflicted any civilian casualties in Israel. The one-sided casualty statistics is enough by itself to identify the locus of violence in this confrontation. To meet such a political demand for basic rights long delayed with lethal force seemed excessive from both legal and moral viewpoints, and has been so assessed by world public opinion. To brush aside Israeli responsibilities by invoking vague claims of Israel’s right to defend itself is also unacceptable, especially when non-lethal methods of crowd control seem available and have not been put to the test. To dismiss these demonstrations as the work of ‘terrorists’ or an undertaking of Hamas is to misrepresent the character of the initiative as a largely civil society initiative that became symbolically violent only after Israeli security tactics inflicted heavy casualties on demonstrators, including medics and journalists standing clearly apart from those engaged in the demonstrations. It also evades even the consideration of whether the basic Palestinian contention of a right to return is well founded in international law, which I believe it is. Tasnim: Israel has rejected international calls for probes into recent deaths and insisted that its open-fire rules for Gaza will not change. Some Western states, particularly the US and Britain, who call themselves champions of human rights, have supported the Tel Aviv regime’s crimes against Palestinians. The UN has also failed to restore the rights of the people. What is your assessment? Falk: The situation described by this question underscores the inability of the UN to protect innocent and vulnerable people when, as here, geopolitical forces are lined up in support of the wrong doing State. It is up to member states to do their best to call attention to such a situation and call for action. Not even this has been done effectively. It should be recalled that the UN Security Council affirmed the ‘Responsibility to Protect’ or R2P norm a few years ago. The situation of the entrapped population of Gaza denied basic rights for decades, is a seemingly perfect case for R2P applicability, and prompt urgent consideration of significant responses in the General Assembly and Security Council, as well as calls for action by the Secretary-General. This has not happened. Instead, there is silence and the futile gaze of frustrated onlookers. Once again we are confronted with this ugly truth: the UN is no better (or worse) than the policies and priorities of its most powerful members. This remains the sad truth: Israel is effectively shielded by the United States no matter how greatly its policies and practices do violence to international morality and international law.

This is while Israel is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, but its policy is to neither confirm nor deny that it has atomic bombs. The Tel Aviv regime is estimated to have 200 to 400 nuclear warheads in its arsenal. What do you think about Netanyahu’s comments? Falk: I agree with the implications of the question. As long as Israel has its own secret arsenal of nuclear weapons it has no basis in law or morality to raise questions about Iran’s nuclear activities. Israel persuaded Trump to repudiate the 2015 international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program, which continues to be endorsed and upheld by the other five signatories. Netanyahu (and Trump) level allegations against the sovereign state of Iran in provocative and insulting language that makes a series of accusations about the behavior of the Iranian government, and its regional policies, without bothering to provide meaningful evidence. The allegations also take no note of the daily crimes against humanity committed against the Palestinian people and Israel’s acts of war against several neighboring countries. Whether Israel’s diplomatic assault against Iran, backed by the United States and several Arab governments, is itself a violation of international law is a serious question. Such an assault seems to be encouraging the destabilization of the Iranian governing process and to be threatening Iran with military attacks. It is widely agreed that this kind of coercive diplomacy violates international law and endangers regional and global peace. Certainly, Israel wants to shift world attention away from its excessive and inhumane uses of lethal force against the people of Gaza every Friday for the last six months. The permissive Israeli rules of engagement should be held responsible for killing at least 191 Palestinians and injuring many thousands. It is an ongoing atrocity in circumstances where Israel has a primary obligation under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population of Occupied Palestine. Israel claims that its disengagement from Gaza in 2005 relieves it of humanitarian responsibilities under international law. The UN and most international law experts think differently. They continue to regard Israel as an occupier in control of Gaza’s borders, restricting entry and exit, and periodically mounting massive attacks on Gaza without any efforts to impose procedures of accountability. This control exercised by Israel entails legal responsibility and should lead to criminal accountability as appropriate. Tasnim: As you know, Israeli troops on Friday killed seven other Palestinians, two of them children, and wounded dozens more in the deadliest day in recent weeks as Gazans stepped up protests along the border fence. Since March 30, Israeli forces have killed at least 191 Palestinians during the demonstrations dubbed the “Great March of Return” along the Gaza border. Most of the dead and the thousands wounded were unarmed civilians against whom Israel was using excessive force. What is your opinion about the developments and the Israeli regime’s crimes? Falk: As I suggested in responding to the prior question, Israeli uses of excessive force are violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention governing belligerent occupation and constitute a continuing Crime against Humanity by virtue of its persistence in situations in which nonviolent means of crowd control should have been relied upon by governing Israeli authorities to the extent that genuine security threats were posed. It should be appreciated that Great March of Return is a continuing demonstration against the denial of the fundamental rights of Palestinians to return to their homes inside of Israel from which they were dispossessed in 1947, and subsequently. These Palestinian attempts to mount a protest close to the fence separating Israel from Gaza seemed a reasonable form of resistance under the circumstances and have so far not inflicted any civilian casualties in Israel. The one-sided casualty statistics is enough by itself to identify the locus of violence in this confrontation. To meet such a political demand for basic rights long delayed with lethal force seemed excessive from both legal and moral viewpoints, and has been so assessed by world public opinion. To brush aside Israeli responsibilities by invoking vague claims of Israel’s right to defend itself is also unacceptable, especially when non-lethal methods of crowd control seem available and have not been put to the test. To dismiss these demonstrations as the work of ‘terrorists’ or an undertaking of Hamas is to misrepresent the character of the initiative as a largely civil society initiative that became symbolically violent only after Israeli security tactics inflicted heavy casualties on demonstrators, including medics and journalists standing clearly apart from those engaged in the demonstrations. It also evades even the consideration of whether the basic Palestinian contention of a right to return is well founded in international law, which I believe it is. Tasnim: Israel has rejected international calls for probes into recent deaths and insisted that its open-fire rules for Gaza will not change. Some Western states, particularly the US and Britain, who call themselves champions of human rights, have supported the Tel Aviv regime’s crimes against Palestinians. The UN has also failed to restore the rights of the people. What is your assessment? Falk: The situation described by this question underscores the inability of the UN to protect innocent and vulnerable people when, as here, geopolitical forces are lined up in support of the wrong doing State. It is up to member states to do their best to call attention to such a situation and call for action. Not even this has been done effectively. It should be recalled that the UN Security Council affirmed the ‘Responsibility to Protect’ or R2P norm a few years ago. The situation of the entrapped population of Gaza denied basic rights for decades, is a seemingly perfect case for R2P applicability, and prompt urgent consideration of significant responses in the General Assembly and Security Council, as well as calls for action by the Secretary-General. This has not happened. Instead, there is silence and the futile gaze of frustrated onlookers. Once again we are confronted with this ugly truth: the UN is no better (or worse) than the policies and priorities of its most powerful members. This remains the sad truth: Israel is effectively shielded by the United States no matter how greatly its policies and practices do violence to international morality and international law.

News article:
Netanyahu’s anti-Iran claims aim to cover up Israeli crimes: Ex-UN official Tasnim – A former official at the United Nations and professor of international law deplored Israeli Prime Minister’s recent anti-Iran remarks at the UN General Assembly and said the Tel Aviv regime tries to divert world attention from its “daily crimes”. “Netanyahu (and Trump) level allegations against the sovereign state of Iran in provocative and insulting language that makes a series of accusations about the behavior of the Iranian government, and its regional policies, without bothering to provide meaningful evidence,” Richard A. Falk said in an interview with the Tasnim News Agency. “The allegations also take no note of the daily crimes against humanity committed against the Palestinian people and Israel’s acts of war against several neighboring countries,” he said. “Certainly, Israel wants to shift world attention away from its excessive and inhumane uses of lethal force against the people of Gaza every Friday for the last six months,” the former UN official said. Professor Richard Anderson Falk is the author or co-author of 20 books and the editor or co-editor of another 20 volumes. In 2008, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) appointed him to a six-year term as a United Nations Special Rapporteur on “the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967”. The following is the full text of the Interview: Tasnim: In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once again accused Iran of developing a nuclear weapons program. He claimed he was revealing the existence of a “secret atomic warehouse” in Tehran but offered no proof of the claim or details. In response, Iranian officials dismissed the claim as a despicable lie and said such lies are aimed at covering up the Tel Aviv regime’s heinous crimes against the defenseless people of Palestine.

This is not the first time the Israeli prime minister has scolded the Iranian regime.

The ‎latter is not going anywhere, and it is doubtful its ‎rulers would agree to reconcile with the Fatah-led ‎Palestinian Authority just to facilitate Trump’s ‎‎“deal of the century.” Second, despite rhetoric to the contrary, Arab ‎leaders have no real intention of going over ‎the head of Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas ‎and accepting a deal on the Palestinians’ behalf. ‎This leads to the third reason: The Palestinian ‎leadership simply cannot make the necessary historic ‎decisions. ‎ Abbas can definitely protest that “Jerusalem is not ‎for sale” as much as he wants, but the bottom line ‎is that Trump is right—there is no reason why the ‎United States should give the P.A. hundreds ‎of millions of dollars in aid only to be ‎disrespected on the world stage—at least as much ‎as Abbas respects Russian President Vladimir Putin, ‎who has never given the Palestinians a dime. ‎ Moreover, one must remember that international ‎treaties rarely reflect “justice,” let alone the ‎Palestinian and their supporters’ version of “absolute justice.” The Jewish community understood ‎that in 1948, which is why it ‎succeeded in forming a state. ‎ This is why Trump and Netanyahu both chose to focus ‎on Iran at the U.N. General Assembly. ‎ Netanyahu’s speech again showcased Israel’s ‎intelligence and operational prowess, which time and ‎again make Iran and Hezbollah, its regional proxy, ‎vulnerable. ‎ Trump’s speech reiterated the U.S. pledge to ‎prevent Iran from going nuclear, and continuing to ‎disseminate terrorism and chaos in the Persian ‎Gulf and Middle East.‎ The American president’s words were binding. No ‎one knows better than him that his success and ‎international standing in the coming year will be ‎determined, to a large extent, by how he deals with ‎Tehran.‎ Failing to come up with a good answer to the ‎allegations made against them at the U.N. General ‎Assembly, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad ‎Zarif resorted to familiar rhetoric, saying that ‎the Holocaust did not justify the establishment of the ‎State of Israel on Palestinian land. ‎ Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, for his part, ‎opted for a more “elegant” suggestion, saying, “We ‎do not wish to fight or destroy or throw anyone into ‎the ocean. We call on the Israelis, in the most ‎civilized way possible, to board planes or ships and ‎return to the countries from where they came. ‎ ‎“Only the Jews who lived in Palestine before [the ‎Balfour Declaration] will be able to stay here. The ‎rest, those who came from all over the world, have ‎to leave.” These statements are another good reason why Iran and ‎its allies must be stopped. European leaders would ‎be wise to pay attention before rushing to appease ‎Iran.‎

News article:
Israel never ceases to up the ante on Iran, and the latest development was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telling the UN General Assembly recently that Iran is maintaining a secret nuclear weapons storage facility. "Iran has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons," Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly. The Israeli prime minister was even more specific about the alleged location of the secret facility which was described to be located in Tehran’s Turquzabad District. The Israeli leader also told the UN that he has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about this allegation and requested an immediate investigation. Of course as predicted, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif denied, categorically, the Israeli charge and called it a fabrication. Netanyahu's main audience, however, could be none other than US President Donald Trump, who is already sold on the idea that Iran is capable of all sorts of mischief, including the possession of nuclear weapons and, therefore, more than ready to believe the latest Netanyahu story. Given the proposition that Trump is trigger-happy when it comes to Iran, having devoted the bulk of his address to the UN last week to Iran and the dangers it possesses to its region and the world, Netanyahu would like nothing more than having Trump order the bombing of the alleged facility, where Iran is presumably storing its secret nuclear weapons. And the US president is of the kind who would order such an attack even when the Israeli charge cannot be corroborated by an independent source. The international community is duty-bound to prevent any attack on an Iranian facility that is suspected of storing nuclear weapons, without first verifying the authenticity of the accusation levelled against Iran. Israel has its own agenda concerning Iran and, unfortunately, President Trump is more than ready to accommodate this agenda, whatever the price or its validity.

Accusing Tel Aviv of deceiving the world about Iran, the senior officer accused Israel of acting as a "political mannequin" in the US shop window. Turning his ire toward Washington, Salami charged the US with spending $7 trillion on wars in the Middle East, adding that the US has been defeated with each effort. "We do not have military bases anywhere, and our presence in Syria is limited, which represents our values," he added, referring to the source and scope of Iran's regional influence. Salami also praised what he called the "thunderous" October 1 missile strikes against Daesh* in Syria, which Iran launched in retaliation following the September 22 terrorist attack on a military parade in Ahvaz, Iran which left 25 people dead and dozens more injured. Traditionally rocky relations between Iran and Israel hit new lows last week at the UN General Assembly meeting, with the two countries exchanging barbs over Syria and Iran's alleged secret nuclear weapons program. Last Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that Tel Aviv had discovered a second secret nuclear facility in Tehran, and vowed that Israel would "never" accept the efforts of "a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons." Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif shot back, saying that Israel was the "only regime in our region with a secret and undeclared weapons program – including an *actual atomic arsenal*."

News article:
TEHRAN — The deputy commander of Iran’s revolutionary guards warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday to “practice swimming in the Mediterranean” because he would be forced to abandon his country. “I tell the prime minister of the Zionist regime to practice swimming in the Mediterranean because soon you will have no choice, but flee into the sea,” Brigadier-General Hossein Salami said, according to the ultraconservative news website Fars news. Speaking at a rally of the volunteer Basij militia in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, Salami said Israel could be destroyed by Iran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah. “They are not at the level of being a threat for us, Hezbollah is enough for destroying them,” he said. Iran has supplied the Lebanese terror group with tens of thousands of rockets and missiles. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms His comments echo the repeated threats of Israel’s enemies to drive Israel into the sea and wipe out the Jewish state. Iran does not recognize Israel, and opposition to the Jewish state has been a central tenet of its government since the 1979 revolution. In September Netanyahu accused Iran at the UN General Assembly of still trying to build nuclear weapons and vowed he would “never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons. Not now, not in 10 years, not ever.” Advertisement He also revealed three sites in Beirut that Israel says are being used by Hezbollah to hide underground precision missile production facilities. Its officials regularly warn that Israel will soon cease to exist, although they are usually careful to indicate that this will not be due to a direct attack by Iran. “In 25 years’ time, with the grace of God, no such thing as the Zionist regime will exist in the region,” said supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2015, which has become a frequently used prediction among hardliners. On Monday, the Revolutionary Guard launched six ballistic missiles at terror groups in eastern Syria with “Death to Israel” on them. The missiles also had anti-American and anti-Saudi slogans written on them. One missile shown on state television bore the slogans “Death to America, Death to Israel, Death to Al Saud,” referring to Saudi Arabia’s ruling family. The missile also bore in Arabic the phrase “kill the friends of Satan,” referring to a verse in the Quran on fighting infidels.

TEHRAN — The deputy commander of Iran’s revolutionary guards warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday to “practice swimming in the Mediterranean” because he would be forced to abandon his country. “I tell the prime minister of the Zionist regime to practice swimming in the Mediterranean because soon you will have no choice, but flee into the sea,” Brigadier-General Hossein Salami said, according to the ultraconservative news website Fars news. Speaking at a rally of the volunteer Basij militia in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, Salami said Israel could be destroyed by Iran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah. “They are not at the level of being a threat for us, Hezbollah is enough for destroying them,” he said. Iran has supplied the Lebanese terror group with tens of thousands of rockets and missiles.

Iran does not recognize Israel, and opposition to the Jewish state has been a central tenet of its government since the 1979 revolution. In September Netanyahu accused Iran at the UN General Assembly of still trying to build nuclear weapons and vowed he would “never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons. Not now, not in 10 years, not ever.” Advertisement He also revealed three sites in Beirut that Israel says are being used by Hezbollah to hide underground precision missile production facilities.

On Monday, the Revolutionary Guard launched six ballistic missiles at terror groups in eastern Syria with “Death to Israel” on them. The missiles also had anti-American and anti-Saudi slogans written on them. One missile shown on state television bore the slogans “Death to America, Death to Israel, Death to Al Saud,” referring to Saudi Arabia’s ruling family. The missile also bore in Arabic the phrase “kill the friends of Satan,” referring to a verse in the Quran on fighting infidels.

News article:
An official with Iran's Revolutionary Guards has warned Israeli PM Netanyahu to "practice swimming," saying he'll soon have no other choice but to flee the region. It comes as Tehran accuses Israel of spreading Iranophobia. "Netanyahu should know that there is no way for him except fleeing the region and so he needs to learn how to swim in the Mediterranean Sea," Brigadier-General Hossein Salami said during a Friday address to a group of IRGC commanders and officers in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, as quoted by Fars news agency. His comments come after Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly (UNGA) a little over a week ago, stating that its arch rival Iran has "another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran's secret nuclear program." Netanyahu has intensified his statements that Iran is developing nuclear weapons since the US, Israel's biggest ally, pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. He reiterated at the UNGA meeting that Israel will never let a government that calls for its destruction to develop nuclear weapons. "Not now, not in 10 years, not ever." Iran's foreign ministry responded to those comments by stating that the world "will only laugh loudly at this type of false, meaningless, and unnecessary speech and false shows." Foreign Minister Javad Zarif also took to Twitter to state that Israel is the only country in the region with a "secret" and "undeclared" nuclear weapons program - including an "actual atomic arsenal." No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a *secret* and *undeclared* nuclear weapons program - including an *actual atomic arsenal*. Time for Israel to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons program to international inspectors. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) September 27, 2018 Tehran does not recognize Israel as a country, and regularly warns that it will soon cease to exist. Syria is another bone of contention between the two countries, with tensions becoming even worse after Israel vowed to prevent Iran from establishing a permanent military presence in Syria and carried out dozens of strikes against Iranian bases. Just days ago, Netanyahu welcomed a historic $38 billion in military aid from Washington, with the US State Department noting that the package is aimed at protecting Israel against "all potential regional adversaries," but foremost from the "Iranian regime’s sponsorship of terrorist groups." Netanyahu took to Twitter to express his gratitude, stating that "Israel and the world face complex security challenges, first and foremost Iranian aggression," while calling Washington's "unwavering support" one of the "pillars of the strong relationship between the two countries." Meanwhile, Iran is also accusing the US of interfering in Middle Eastern affairs, stating that sanctions against Iran are driving the price of crude up - and that if Trump wants cheaper oil like he claims, he should stop meddling.

News article:
Iran is a formidable enemy. A large country of more than 80 million people, endowed with energy riches, it has always been a regional power. Having an imperial past and revolutionary zeal (since the 1979 Iranian Revolution), Iran nourishes ambitions to rule over the Middle East and beyond. Furthermore, theologically there is no place in Iranian thinking for a Jewish state. Iran believes that Israel will either wither away following military pressure on its population or be annihilated when it is militarily weak and vulnerable. As Iran challenges the status quo in the Middle East, a clash between Tehran and Jerusalem is inevitable. International history teaches us that when a rising power challenged the balance of power, in most cases war ensued. Sparta challenged an Athenian-led Greek city system, ending in the Peloponnesian wars. Prussia’s quest for the unification of the German principalities under its helm ended in several European Wars. Similarly, Israel cannot tolerate a Middle East dominated by Iran and its radical ideology. Unfortunately, much of the Arab world is in the throes of a deep socio-political crisis, particularly since the mistermed “Arab Spring,” creating dissension and a political vacuum, which the sophisticated revolutionary elite in Iran has capitalized upon. These dynamics explain the rise of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the power grab of the Houthi Shi’ite sect in Yemen. The revolutionary enterprise was also facilitated by the Middle East policies of the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations. American military intervention destroyed Iraq, a strong rival of Iran, further undermining the regional balance of power. Subsequently, the display of weakness by Obama was replaced by a questionable Trump commitment to the security of the region. The Sunni Arab states have been terrified by the advances in the Iranian nuclear program and by the successes of its proxies. They are weak. Saudi Arabia failed to contain Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq. Closer to home, it was not successful to change the pro-Iranian orientation of small Qatar. Egypt, an important Sunni power, survived the domestic turmoil, but it focuses on literally supplying food to its population, fighting an Islamic insurgency at home, leaving little energy to parry the Iranian challenge. Turkey, a strong Sunni state, albeit non-Arab, has preferred to act upon its Islamic impulses and its common interest with Iran on the Kurdish issue, forfeiting its potential to balance Iran. The result was an entente between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Gulf states with Israel. In the absence of a credible American security umbrella, the Sunnis understand that only Israel can oppose the hegemonic drive of Iran. Iran reached a similar conclusion – Israel is the main barrier for achieving hegemony. Israel is a religious and strategic anathema. Initially, Iran has waged war against Israel primarily by proxies. It envisions military actions causing exhaustion to the civilian population. In the 1980s, Iran trained and armed the Hezbollah, a Shi’ite militia in Lebanon, directing its military efforts to oust Israel from South Lebanon. Moreover, Iran has supplied more than 120,000 missiles of various ranges to Hezbollah, which cover most of Israel. The declared goal still is “to liberate Jerusalem from Zionist rule.” In the meantime, Hezbollah has assumed control of Lebanon, turning the country into an Iranian satrapy. Similarly, after Hamas took over Gaza in 2005, it became the recipient of large military aid from Iran, intended to enhance its capability to bleed Israel. As Sunni Hamas did not support the Iranian line in Syria, Tehran channeled its financial and military aid to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, which is subservient to Iranian wishes. By having a foothold in Gaza, Iran established an additional front against Israel in the south. The current Iranian effort in Syria aims at establishing a third front in the northeast, along Israel’s border on the Golan Heights. Moreover, it wants to acquire a land corridor to the Levant (Lebanon and Syria) via Iraq, where Iran has been successful to establish a military presence and influence, to facilitate the transfer of more advanced weapons to Hezbollah and gain access to the Mediterranean. We can also detect Iranian efforts to destabilize the Jordanian kingdom, situated along Israel’s eastern border. This is also part of Iran’s attempt to encircle Israel with Iranian proxies. Shi’ite militias and/or the Islamic Revolutionary Guards in Iraq and Syria obviously threaten the Hashemite dynasty. The fall of Jordan would also endanger Saudi Arabia, Iran’s arch-rival in the Gulf. Neutralizing Israel’s military power, by encircling it with proxies which have at their disposal thousands of missiles directed at Israel’s strategic installations and centers of population, is an Iranian goal in its quest for hegemony in the Middle East. In the absence of a clear American or Turkish determination to confront Iranian encroachment, only Israel has the power to stop it. Therefore, Israel has no choice but to wage war against Iranian entrenchment in Syria. It is an illusion that Iran’s nuclear ambitions can be curbed by international agreements. The bomb is the best insurance for regime survival and for achieving hegemony in the region. It is inconceivable that the mullahs will give it up. As the international community, including the US, has no appetite for a military confrontation with Iran, it is left to Israel to prevent its nuclearization. The only way to do it is by brute force, adding a new dimension to the war conducted already against Iran. This is an inevitable imperative for Jerusalem.

Moreover, it wants to acquire a land corridor to the Levant (Lebanon and Syria) via Iraq, where Iran has been successful to establish a military presence and influence, to facilitate the transfer of more advanced weapons to Hezbollah and gain access to the Mediterranean. We can also detect Iranian efforts to destabilize the Jordanian kingdom, situated along Israel’s eastern border. This is also part of Iran’s attempt to encircle Israel with Iranian proxies. Shi’ite militias and/or the Islamic Revolutionary Guards in Iraq and Syria obviously threaten the Hashemite dynasty. The fall of Jordan would also endanger Saudi Arabia, Iran’s arch-rival in the Gulf. Neutralizing Israel’s military power, by encircling it with proxies which have at their disposal thousands of missiles directed at Israel’s strategic installations and centers of population, is an Iranian goal in its quest for hegemony in the Middle East. In the absence of a clear American or Turkish determination to confront Iranian encroachment, only Israel has the power to stop it. Therefore, Israel has no choice but to wage war against Iranian entrenchment in Syria. It is an illusion that Iran’s nuclear ambitions can be curbed by international agreements. The bomb is the best insurance for regime survival and for achieving hegemony in the region. It is inconceivable that the mullahs will give it up. As the international community, including the US, has no appetite for a military confrontation with Iran, it is left to Israel to prevent its nuclearization. The only way to do it is by brute force, adding a new dimension to the war conducted already against Iran. This is an inevitable imperative for Jerusalem.

News article:
JERUSALEM (JTA) — Israel’s Supreme Court has rejected a petition by the residents of a West Bank Bedouin village slated to be razed to halt the demolition. An injunction against the plan to demolish Khan al-Ahmar, located outside of Jerusalem near Maale Adumim, expires in a week. The international community and human rights organizations have rallied in support of the village. In their decision Wednesday, the justices also declined to delay Khan al-Ahmar’s demolition until an alternative site is found for its approximately 200 residents. The Supreme Court had authorized the demolition in May, since the homes were built without permits. The July injunction called on the state to review a compromise offer drawn up by the locals that would legalize the village. Critics of the demolition believe that Israel is tearing down the village in order to make a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov called the impending demolition “against international law” and tweeted that it would “undermine prospect for two state solution.”

News article:
Occupied Jerusalem: Israeli regime’s top court on Wednesday upheld an order to raze a Palestinian Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, after debating petitions challenging the decision. There has been strong international pressure on the Israeli regime to reverse its plans to raze Khan Al Ahmar, which the Israeli occupation authorities say was built illegally. “We reject the petitions” against the directive to demolish Khan Al Ahmar, the supreme court panel said in its ruling, adding that a temporary order preventing the razing of the village during court hearings “will be cancelled within seven days from today.” It will now be down to the authorities to decide when to carry out the demolition after the restriction order ends. The present village consists mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is generally the case with Bedouin sites. In May, the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal against its demolition after nine years of hearings before various tribunals. The court said Khan Al Ahmar residents had rejected proposals by the state regarding the site of their relocation, and expressed hope “the dialogue” would continue. Activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits that are almost never issued to Palestinians in the large parts of the occupied West Bank where Israeli regime has full control over civil affairs. Tawfiq Jabareen, one of the lawyers representing Khan Al Ahmar residents in the petitions, said the court was following the occupation’s rightwing government in its ruling, which he said was “legally wrong”. “It is not based on legal arguments and contradicts past supreme court rulings,” he told AFP. “This is unfortunately what the government wants, and the court doesn’t want to intervene.” Jabareen said there were currently no understandings between the state and residents on a voluntary relocation. “I’ve never seen someone who’s being expelled and whose house is being destroyed sitting idly by,” he said. Box Regime closes border to Gaza after violence Occupied Jerusalem: Israel closed a border post to the occupied Gaza Strip except for humanitarian cases on Wednesday in response to violence a day earlier. Israeli occupation authorities said Palestinians have caused damage to Erez border post while protesting the US’ decision to cut aid to UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Efe news reported. “Passage will be permitted for individually approved humanitarian cases,” occupation authorities said in a statement. — IANS

© Mohamad Torokman / Reuters Israel's top court has greenlighted the eviction of a West Bank Bedouin village despite earlier international uproar. The Palestinian authorities have slammed the move, calling on the global community to "intervene immediately."The Israeli High Court of Justice rejected an appeal from the residents of Khan Al-Ahmar, a Bedouin village east of Jerusalem, effectively greenlighting its demolition on Wednesday. Israel says the village was built without an Israeli permit, but Palestinians say they are impossible to obtain. Tel Aviv's plan to raze the village, which is home to around 180 people,has been met with an avalanche of international condemnation, including from the UN, high-ranking EU officials, and Amnesty International.However, all this has not deterred Israel from ruling that the village can be bulldozed and the Palestinian government is calling to take action."The International community must come out of its ineffective condemnations shell and intervene immediately to defend its human and legal system, which Israel is explicitly penetrating into," it said in a statement as cited by Wafa news agency.It is unclear where the families of the village are going to move as alternative sites suggested by Israel were rejected. One of them is close to a landfill site belonging to the nearby town of Abu Dis, and the other lies in a desert location south-west of Jericho - which is also inappropriate for "a community that has animals and needs grazing," according to the UN.Amnesty International said that forced transfers amount to war crimes under a statute of the International Criminal Court.

The Palestinian authorities have slammed the move, calling on the global community to “intervene immediately.” The Israeli High Court of Justice rejected an appeal from the residents of Khan Al-Ahmar, a Bedouin village east of Jerusalem, effectively greenlighting its demolition on Wednesday. Israel says the village was built without an Israeli permit, but Palestinians say they are impossible to obtain. Tel Aviv’s plan to raze the village, which is home to around 180 people, more than half of whom are children, has been met with an avalanche of international condemnation, including from the UN, high-ranking EU officials, and Amnesty International. However, all this has not deterred Israel from ruling that the village can be bulldozed and the Palestinian government is calling to take action. “The International community must come out of its ineffective condemnations shell and intervene immediately to defend its human and legal system, which Israel is explicitly penetrating into,” it said in a statement as cited by Wafa news agency. The Palestinian authorities believe that the move is aimed at the implementation of the ‘E1 colonial project’, which was designed to create “an arc of settlements around East Jerusalem effectively alienating it from the West Bank and killing any hopes for a future contiguous Palestinian State.” It is unclear where the families of the village are going to move as alternative sites suggested by Israel were rejected. One of them is close to a landfill site belonging to the nearby town of Abu Dis, and the other lies in a desert location south-west of Jericho – which is also inappropriate for “a community that has animals and needs grazing,” according to the UN. The UN has repeatedly warned Israel against forced evictions, including in Khan-al-Ahmar, as it may lead to the forcible transfer of the population of an occupied territory, considered illegal under international humanitarian law. Amnesty International said that forced transfers amount to war crimes under a statute of the International Criminal Court. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

Source: Xinhua| 2018-09-10 21:40:51|Editor: Yurou Video Player Close RAMALLAH, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority said on Monday that they will oppose the ruling of Israel's top court in favor of the demolition of a Bedouin community at international courts. "Palestinians have lost faith in Israeli courts after their highest body, the High Court, ruled in favor of the demolition that would allow Israel to displace Palestinians and build a Jewish settlement in their location," head of the Palestinian Authority Wall and Settlements Colonization Resistance Committee Walid Assaf told the official Palestinian radio station Voice of Palestine. He said that the committee will not appeal at Israeli courts anymore because they are "a tool of the occupation to legalize theft of Palestinian land." The Israeli High Court last week rejected an appeal by the residents of Al-Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin community located east of Jerusalem, and ruled in favor of the demolition of the community after evicting its residents within one week. The community in Al-Khan Al-Ahmar is one of the 46 Bedouin communities in central West Bank that the UN considers at risk of forcible transfer. Over 200 homes and community structures are slated for demolition in the area, where nearly 1,400 Palestinians reside. The area suffers a lack of basic services and infrastructure, such as a power grid, a sewage system and proper roads. The area has the only school for the Bedouin communities, a mosque and a healthcare unit as well as several homes that are all at risk of demolition by Israel. Residents said they are offered no alternative or shelters to stay.

GENEVA (10 September 2018) – An Israeli High Court ruling giving the Government of Israel the green light to demolish the entire Palestinian Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar Ab al Helu, has been described as “appalling” by two UN human rights experts*. “It is gravely disappointing that a High Court can take a decision that is totally against the fundamental principles of international human rights law and international humanitarian law,” said Michael Lynk, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 and Leilani Farha, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living. “This appalling decision could trigger the eviction of 180 inhabitants, including more than 90 children, putting them at imminent risk of forcible transfer,” they added. “Forced eviction constitutes a gross violation of the right to adequate housing under international human rights law. In addition, forcible transfer of people who are protected within an occupied territory is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and amounts to a war crime under the 1998 Rome Statute,” the experts said. “If the demolition of the village goes ahead and results in the residents having to move out of their current location, all those responsible for this international crime should be held accountable.” The experts’ comments follow a decision on 5 September to dismiss the latest petitions by residents of Khan al-Ahmar, some 15 km northeast of Jerusalem in the West Bank. The Special Rapporteurs are also urging Israel, as the occupying power, to stop the eviction. “It is time to regularize their situation and respect the rights of the Khan al-Ahmar residents to remain on the lands they have inhabited for decades,” the experts added. The residents of Khan al-Ahmar are descendants of Bedouins expelled from the Negev by Israel in the 1950s. They were relocated in the West Bank, on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Their village is situated between two large Israeli settlements, Ma’ale Adumim and Kfar Adumim, and an Israeli industrial zone called Mishor Adumim. The residents have been subjected to constant pressure by the Israeli authorities and neighbouring settlers and have been living in what has been described as an “increasingly coercive environment” that may leave no other choice to the community but to move.

Palestinian activists have set up five shipping containers near a Bedouin hamlet to protest the expected razing of the West Bank encampment by Israel. Activist Abdallah Abu Rahmeh said Tuesday that setting up the white shipping containers near Khan al-Ahmar, one with a Palestinian flag, is a message to Israel that “it’s our right to build on our land.” The Israeli human rights group B’Tselem announced Saturday it had written to the European Union to ask that it intervene to prevent the demolition of the village, which is slated to occur as early as Wednesday. B’Tselem director Hagai El-Ad wrote to the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, asking her to take action on the issue. El-Ad referred to previous statements made by Mogherini warning Israel against the demolition, writing: “We have reached the juncture where it appears that these serious consequences must be spelled out, if the EU is to credibly back its own positions.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In a ruling last week the High Court of Justice cleared the way for the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar, rejecting a final appeal in a case that has drawn international criticism. El-Ad wrote that, “in their occupation-serving decision, the justices ignored both the context of a completely one-sided planning regime, where building ‘legally’ is an option reserved for settlers and denied from protected persons.” He then claimed that the demolition was part of a plan to minimize Palestinian presence in Area C, a stretch of land accounting for 60 percent of the West Bank over which Israel has control under the terms of the Oslo Accords signed between Israel and the Palestinians in September 1995. Advertisement “The EU obviously has ample leverage to affect a concrete impact, by showing Israel that unacceptable human rights violations will have serious consequences and spelling out exactly what it stands to lose,” wrote El-Ad. “The destruction of an entire Palestinian community is the clearest recent expression of Israel’s unabashed disregard for the supposed shared values that presumably lie at the core of its relationship with the EU,” he added. Right-wing Israeli activists clashed Friday with residents of the village. In footage taken by local Bedouins and Palestinian activists, the residents of the village could be seen exchanging angry shouts with the Israelis from the Im Tirzu organization in a passageway under the Route 1 highway leading to the ramshackle village. עשרות פעילים של תנועת הימין "אם תרצו" באו הבוקר לכפר הבדואי חאן אל אחמר, שהוקם שלא כחוק ליד כפר אדומים. הם התעמתו עם כמה מתושבי הכפר, אך איש לא נפגע. ב"אם תרצו" אומרים כי הפעילים הגיעו למקום כדי לשמוע הרצאה. בג"ץ התיר שלשום למדינה לפנות את הכפר בעוד שבוע @carmeldangor pic.twitter.com/h8STRD20Xf — כאן חדשות (@kann_news) September 7, 2018 Israeli police officers soon interceded and separated the groups, leading the Israeli activists out of the area. Advertisement The European Union on Thursday urged Israel to reconsider the razing, warning it would undermine efforts to reach a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. “The consequences of a demolition of this community and the displacement of its residents, including children, against their will, would be very serious and would severely threaten the viability of the two-state solution and undermine prospects for peace,” the EU said in a statement. “The community of Khan al-Ahmar is located in a sensitive location in Area C, of strategic importance for preserving the contiguity of a future Palestinian state.” “The EU expects the Israeli authorities to reconsider their decision to demolish Khan al-Ahmar,” the statement continued. On Tuesday UN Mideast envoy Nickolay Mladenov similarly warned that demolition of the village would impact peace efforts. Mladenov said the planned demolition of the village would “undermine the prospect for two-state solution and is against international law.” Opponents of the demolition argue that it is part of an effort to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem almost to the Dead Sea, a move critics say will bisect the West Bank, making a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. In its ruling, which was in response to a petition from residents of Khan al-Ahmar, the High Court said an order preventing the village’s demolition would be lifted in seven days, allowing it to take place as soon as next week. There has been strong international pressure on Israel to reverse its plans to raze the village, which Israeli authorities say was built illegally. Sitting east of Jerusalem, the village is located near several major Israeli settlements and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Advertisement Khan al-Ahmar’s demolition had already been approved by the court in May, which the judges noted in their decision Wednesday. The judges also rejected the petitioners’ request to delay Khan al-Ahmar’s demolition until an alternative site is found for its residents. Residents of the village have opposed the state’s plan to relocate them near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, as well as another proposal that would have moved them to a site east of the Mitzpe Jericho settlement. The High Court froze the planned demolition of Khan al-Ahmar in July when it agreed to hear the residents’ petition. In the beginning of that month, the state had begun its preparations to raze the hamlet, where none of the structures have been granted permits. Security forces were deployed to the village and construction workers began paving an access road that would facilitate the demolition and evacuation. The state says the structures, mostly makeshift shacks and tents, were built without permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway. But the villagers — who have lived at the site, then controlled by Jordan, since the 1950s, after the state evicted them from their Negev homes — argue that they had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as such permits are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan Al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs.

Palestinian activists have set up five shipping containers near a Bedouin hamlet to protest the expected razing of the West Bank encampment by Israel. Activist Abdallah Abu Rahmeh said Tuesday that setting up the white shipping containers near Khan al-Ahmar, one with a Palestinian flag, is a message to Israel that “it’s our right to build on our land.” The Israeli human rights group B’Tselem announced Saturday it had written to the European Union to ask that it intervene to prevent the demolition of the village, which is slated to occur as early as Wednesday. B’Tselem director Hagai El-Ad wrote to the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, asking her to take action on the issue. El-Ad referred to previous statements made by Mogherini warning Israel against the demolition, writing: “We have reached the juncture where it appears that these serious consequences must be spelled out, if the EU is to credibly back its own positions.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In a ruling last week the High Court of Justice cleared the way for the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar, rejecting a final appeal in a case that has drawn international criticism. El-Ad wrote that, “in their occupation-serving decision, the justices ignored both the context of a completely one-sided planning regime, where building ‘legally’ is an option reserved for settlers and denied from protected persons.” He then claimed that the demolition was part of a plan to minimize Palestinian presence in Area C, a stretch of land accounting for 60 percent of the West Bank over which Israel has control under the terms of the Oslo Accords signed between Israel and the Palestinians in September 1995. Advertisement “The EU obviously has ample leverage to affect a concrete impact, by showing Israel that unacceptable human rights violations will have serious consequences and spelling out exactly what it stands to lose,” wrote El-Ad. “The destruction of an entire Palestinian community is the clearest recent expression of Israel’s unabashed disregard for the supposed shared values that presumably lie at the core of its relationship with the EU,” he added. Right-wing Israeli activists clashed Friday with residents of the village. In footage taken by local Bedouins and Palestinian activists, the residents of the village could be seen exchanging angry shouts with the Israelis from the Im Tirzu organization in a passageway under the Route 1 highway leading to the ramshackle village. עשרות פעילים של תנועת הימין "אם תרצו" באו הבוקר לכפר הבדואי חאן אל אחמר, שהוקם שלא כחוק ליד כפר אדומים. הם התעמתו עם כמה מתושבי הכפר, אך איש לא נפגע. ב"אם תרצו" אומרים כי הפעילים הגיעו למקום כדי לשמוע הרצאה. בג"ץ התיר שלשום למדינה לפנות את הכפר בעוד שבוע @carmeldangor pic.twitter.com/h8STRD20Xf — כאן חדשות (@kann_news) September 7, 2018 Israeli police officers soon interceded and separated the groups, leading the Israeli activists out of the area. Advertisement The European Union on Thursday urged Israel to reconsider the razing, warning it would undermine efforts to reach a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. “The consequences of a demolition of this community and the displacement of its residents, including children, against their will, would be very serious and would severely threaten the viability of the two-state solution and undermine prospects for peace,” the EU said in a statement. “The community of Khan al-Ahmar is located in a sensitive location in Area C, of strategic importance for preserving the contiguity of a future Palestinian state.” “The EU expects the Israeli authorities to reconsider their decision to demolish Khan al-Ahmar,” the statement continued. On Tuesday UN Mideast envoy Nickolay Mladenov similarly warned that demolition of the village would impact peace efforts. Mladenov said the planned demolition of the village would “undermine the prospect for two-state solution and is against international law.” Opponents of the demolition argue that it is part of an effort to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem almost to the Dead Sea, a move critics say will bisect the West Bank, making a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. In its ruling, which was in response to a petition from residents of Khan al-Ahmar, the High Court said an order preventing the village’s demolition would be lifted in seven days, allowing it to take place as soon as next week. There has been strong international pressure on Israel to reverse its plans to raze the village, which Israeli authorities say was built illegally. Sitting east of Jerusalem, the village is located near several major Israeli settlements and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Advertisement Khan al-Ahmar’s demolition had already been approved by the court in May, which the judges noted in their decision Wednesday. The judges also rejected the petitioners’ request to delay Khan al-Ahmar’s demolition until an alternative site is found for its residents. Residents of the village have opposed the state’s plan to relocate them near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, as well as another proposal that would have moved them to a site east of the Mitzpe Jericho settlement. The High Court froze the planned demolition of Khan al-Ahmar in July when it agreed to hear the residents’ petition. In the beginning of that month, the state had begun its preparations to raze the hamlet, where none of the structures have been granted permits. Security forces were deployed to the village and construction workers began paving an access road that would facilitate the demolition and evacuation. The state says the structures, mostly makeshift shacks and tents, were built without permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway.

KHAN AL-AHMAR, West Bank (Reuters) - Israel security forces on Thursday dismantled several shacks built by Palestinian protesters near Khan al-Ahmar, a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank that Israel has slated for demolition. Reuters witnesses said Israeli forces arrived at the village before sunrise on Thursday and began taking down the newly built protest huts, without touching the Bedouin encampment, the fate of which has become a focus of Palestinian protests and international concern. Israel’s military liaison agency with the Palestinians, COGAT, said on Twitter that five "movable structures that were illegally transported & installed" in the area had been taken down. The five new huts had been assembled this week by activists from several rights groups and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in support of the Bedouin community. Khan al-Ahmar is beside an Israeli highway that runs through the West Bank from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea. Israel’s plan to demolish the village and relocate its 180 residents - Bedouins who scrape a living by raising sheep and goats - to a site 12 km (7 miles) away, has drawn criticism from Palestinians and some European states, who cite the impact on the community and prospects for peace. Palestinians say the demolition is part of an Israeli push to create an arc of settlements that would effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which the Palestinians seek for an independent state. Last week, Israel’s Supreme Court rejected petitions to prevent the move, siding with the authorities who say the village was built without required permits. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain. (Reporting by Ali Sawafta; Editing by Robert Birsel & Simon Cameron-Moore)

Israeli High Court Green Lights Razing of Khan al-Ahmar Anan AbuShanab Research Assistant, Middle East and North Africa Division Residents of Khan al-Ahmar thought they had found a way around Israel’s discriminatory building permit regime in Area C of the West Bank. Since a building permit is required only for concrete structures, they built their school, which serves 160 children from five villages, using clay and 2,200 old tires. The plan didn’t work. The Israeli army has exclusive control over planning in Area C. It has allocated just one percent of that land for Palestinian buildings, and refuses the vast majority of Palestinian permit applications. Khan al-Ahmar was no exception. Over the years, Israeli authorities issued demolition orders against the school and every other structure in this small village of 180 residents, just east of Jerusalem, on the grounds that they lacked permits. On September 5, Israel’s High Court rejected several appeals, and green-lighted demolition. Israeli military planning documents do not recognize the community’s presence, and Israeli authorities have repeatedly confiscated its land, demolished its buildings, and expelled its Palestinian residents for building without permits. This isn’t the community’s first displacement. In the early 1950s, Israeli forces evicted residents from the Tel Arad district of the Negev desert. The community fled to the West Bank and built a village in the current location. They registered as Palestine refugees with the United Nations. In 1977, Israel established the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, allocating it the land on which Khan al-Ahmar sits. International law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property, including schools, unless “absolutely necessary” for “military operations.” Transferring civilians within an occupied territory, either by direct force or indirect coercion into a place not of their choosing, is a war crime under the International Criminal Court’s statute. Israeli officials should know that the demolition and any resulting displacement of the population may subject them to criminal investigation. Other states also have a duty to ensure that the Geneva Conventions are respected, and should make clear to Israeli officials that, if the demolition goes ahead, people implicated in any criminal acts could be investigated and prosecuted by domestic authorities outside of Israel where they have jurisdiction. Global condemnation alone has not stopped serious war crimes during Israel’s 50-year occupation. Action and justice is long overdue.

It has allocated just one percent of that land for Palestinian buildings, and refuses the vast majority of Palestinian permit applications. Khan al-Ahmar was no exception. Over the years, Israeli authorities issued demolition orders against the school and every other structure in this small village of 180 residents, just east of Jerusalem, on the grounds that they lacked permits. On September 5, Israel’s High Court rejected several appeals, and green-lighted demolition. Israeli military planning documents do not recognize the community’s presence, and Israeli authorities have repeatedly confiscated its land, demolished its buildings, and expelled its Palestinian residents for building without permits. This isn’t the community’s first displacement. In the early 1950s, Israeli forces evicted residents from the Tel Arad district of the Negev desert. The community fled to the West Bank and built a village in the current location. They registered as Palestine refugees with the United Nations. In 1977, Israel established the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, allocating it the land on which Khan al-Ahmar sits. International law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property, including schools, unless “absolutely necessary” for “military operations.” Transferring civilians within an occupied territory, either by direct force or indirect coercion into a place not of their choosing, is a war crime under the International Criminal Court’s statute. Israeli officials should know that the demolition and any resulting displacement of the population may subject them to criminal investigation. Other states also have a duty to ensure that the Geneva Conventions are respected, and should make clear to Israeli officials that, if the demolition goes ahead, people implicated in any criminal acts could be investigated and prosecuted by domestic authorities outside of Israel where they have jurisdiction. Global condemnation alone has not stopped serious war crimes during Israel’s 50-year occupation. Action and justice is long overdue.

News article:
Like vultures, Israeli soldiers descended on Khan Al-Ahmar, on Sep. 14, recreating a menacing scene with which the residents of this small Palestinian village, located East of Jerusalem, are all-too-familiar. The strategic location of Khan Al-Ahmar makes the story behind the imminent Israeli demolition of the peaceful village unique amid the ongoing destruction of Palestinian homes and lives throughout besieged Gaza and Occupied West Bank. Throughout the years, Khan Al-Ahmar, once part of an uninterrupted Palestinian physical landscape has grown increasingly isolated. Decades of Israeli colonisation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank left Khan Al-Ahmar trapped between massive and vastly expanding Israeli colonial projects: Ma'ale Adumim, Kfar Adumim among others. The unfortunate village, its adjacent school and 173 residents are the last obstacle facing the E1 Zone project, an Israeli plan that aims to link illegal Jewish colonies in Occupied East Jerusalem with West Jerusalem, thus cutting off East Jerusalem entirely from its Palestinian environs in the West Bank. Like the Neqab (Negev) village of Al-Araqib, which has been demolished by Israel and rebuilt by its residents 133 times, Khan Al-Ahmar residents are facing armed soldiers and military bulldozers with their bare chests and whatever local and international solidarity they can obtain. Despite the particular circumstances and unique historical context of Khan Al-Ahmar, however, the story of this village is but a chapter in a protracted narrative of a tragedy that has extended over the course of seventy years. It would be a mistake to discuss the destruction of Khan Al-Ahmar or any other Palestinian village outside the larger context of demolition that has stood at the heart of Israel's particular breed of settler colonialism. READ: Palestinian activists address comments to UN General Assembly It is true that other colonial powers used the destruction of homes and properties, and the exile of whole communities as a tactic to subdue rebellious populations. The British Mandate government in Palestine used the demolition of homes as a 'deterrence' tactic against Palestinians who dared rebel against injustice throughout the 1920s, 30s and 40s, till Israel took over in 1948. The Israeli strategy is far more convoluted than a mere 'deterrence'. It is now carved in the Israeli psyche that Palestine must be destroyed for Israel to exist. Therefore, Israel is engaging in a seemingly endless campaign of erasing everything Palestinian, because the latter, from an Israeli viewpoint, represents an existential threat to the former. This is precisely why Israel sees the natural demographic growth among Palestinians as an 'existential threat' to Israel's 'Jewish identity'. This can only be justified with an irrational degree of hate and fear that has accumulated throughout generations to the point that it now forms a collective Israeli psychosis for which Palestinians continue to pay a heavy price. The repeated destruction of Gaza is symptomatic of this Israeli psychosis. Israel is a "country that when you fire on its citizens, it responds by going wild – and this is a good thing," was the official explanation offered by Tzipi Livni, the Israeli foreign minister in January 2009 to justify its country's war on the blockaded Gaza Strip. The Israel 'going wild' strategy has led to the destruction of 22,000 homes, schools and other facilities during one of Israel's deadliest wars on the Strip. A few years later, in the summer of 2014, Israel went 'wild' again, leading to even greater destruction and loss of lives. Israel's mass demolition of Palestinian homes in Gaza, and everywhere else, preceded Hamas by decades. It has nothing to do with the method of resistance that Palestinians utilise in their struggle against Israel. Israel's demolishing of Palestine – whether the actual physical structures or the idea, history, narrative, and even street names – is an Israeli decision through and through. A quick scan of historical facts demonstrates that Israel demolished Palestinian homes and communities in diverse political and historical contexts, where Israel's 'security' was not in the least a factor. READ: Book on Israel's deliberate maiming of Palestinians wins top academic prize Nearly 600 Palestinian towns, villages and localities were destroyed between 1947 and 1948, and approximately 800,000 Palestinians were exiled to make room for the establishment of Israel. According to the Land Research Center (LRC), Israel had destroyed 5,000 Palestinian homes in Jerusalem alone since it occupied the city in 1967, leading to the permanent exile of nearly 70,000 people. Coupled with the fact that almost 200,000 Jerusalemites were driven out during the Nakba, the Catastrophe' of 1948, and the ongoing slow ethnic cleansing, the Holy City has been in a constant state of destruction since the establishment of Israel. In fact, between 2000 and 2017, over 1,700 Palestinian homes were demolished, displacing nearly 10,000 people. This is not a policy of 'deterrence' but of erasure – the eradication of the very Palestinian culture. Gaza and Jerusalem are not unique examples either. According to the Israeli Committee against House Demolitions (ICAHD's) report last December, since 1967 "nearly 50,000 Palestinian homes and structures have been demolished – displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and affecting the livelihoods of thousands of others." Combined with the destruction of Palestinian villages upon the establishment of Israel, and the demolition of Palestinian homes inside Israel itself, ICAHD puts the total number of homes destroyed since 1948 at more than 100,000. In fact, as the group itself acknowledges, the figure above is quite conservative. Indeed, it is. In Gaza alone, and in the last ten years which witnessed three major Israeli wars, nearly 50,000 homes and structures were reportedly destroyed. So why does Israel destroy with consistency, impunity and no remorse? It is for the same reason that it passed laws to change historic street names from Arabic to Hebrew. For the same reason, it recently passed the racist Nation-state law, elevating everything Jewish and completely ignoring and downgrading the existence of the indigenous Palestinians, their language and their culture that goes back millennia. Israel demolishes, destroys and pulverizes because, in the racist mindset of Israeli rulers, there can be no room between the Sea and the River but for Jews; where the Palestinians – oppressed, colonised and dehumanised – don't factor in the least in Israel's ruthless calculations. This is not just a question of Khan Al-Ahmar. It is a question of the very survival of the Palestinian people, threatened by a racist state that has been allowed to 'go wild' for 70 years, untamed and without repercussions.

News article:
A Palestinian from the northern Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit Hanina, in the central occupied West Bank, demolished his own home on Thursday afternoon, upon order by an Israeli court. Fadi Shawamreh said, according to Ma’an News Agency, that he had to demolish his own home; that was built in 2006, following an order by an Israeli court that the house was not licensed. Shawamreh said that a demolition order against his house was issued after he started renovating the ceiling and walls of the house, over the past two years. He added that he was able to postpone the demolition several times until a final order was issued by the court to demolish the structure. The court allowed Shawamreh until the beginning of September to carry out its order, or else paying demolition fees imposed by the Israeli municipality for crews that would be carrying out the demolition instead. Shawamreh said that Israeli municipality crews, escorted by Israeli forces, had raided his house several months ago to demolish the structure, evacuated its content and assaulted those present at the time, however, the demolition was prevented by a lawyer. He pointed out that the municipality had imposed a fine of 50,000 shekels, on another part of his house, a steel-structure with a cement floor, several years ago. Israel rarely grants Palestinians permits to build in East Jerusalem, though the Jerusalem municipality has claimed that compared to the Jewish population, they receive a disproportionately low number of permit applications from Palestinian communities, which also see high approval ratings. For Jewish Israelis in occupied East Jerusalem’s illegal settlements, the planning, marketing, development and infrastructure are funded and executed by the Israeli government. By contrast, in Palestinian neighborhoods, all the burden falls on individual families to contend with a lengthy permit application that can last several years and cost tens of thousands of dollars. According to Daniel Seidemann of the NGO Terrestrial Jerusalem, “Since 1967, the Government of Israel has directly engaged in the construction of 55,000 units for Israelis in East Jerusalem; in contrast, fewer than 600 units have been built for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the last of which were built 40 years ago. So much for (Jerusalem Mayor Nir) Barkat’s claim ‘we build for everyone.'” (archive photo image)

News article:
Khan Al Ahmar: The Israeli regime on Sunday told residents of Khan Al Ahmar, a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank slated for demolition, to clear their houses by October 1. Khan Al Ahmar consists of tin and wood shacks built on a desert hillside beside an Israeli highway that runs from occupied Jerusalem to the Dead Sea. The Israeli occupation regime plans to demolish the village and relocate its 180 residents - Bedouins who scrape a living by raising sheep and goats - to a site 12km away, near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis and adjacent to a landfill site. The move has drawn criticism from Palestinians and some European states, who cite the impact on the community and prospects for peace. A spokeswoman for occupation regime’s military liaison agency with the Palestinians said no date had been set for demolition should the houses remain after the deadline. Occupation forces on Sunday morning handed out letters telling residents to voluntarily take down the buildings by October 1 or the occupation regime would enforce the demolition orders. “We will not voluntarily evacuate the place,” said village resident Faisal Abu Dahuk. “The occupation forces that have an army and weapons can evacuate us by force, but there is no other place to go and we refuse to be moved anywhere else.” Israel’s Supreme Court has rejected petitions to prevent the move, siding with the occupation regime which say the village was built without the required permits. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain. Palestinians say the demolition is part of an Israeli push to create an arc of colonies that would effectively cut off occupied East Jerusalem from the West Bank, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which the Palestinians seek for an independent state.

News article:
On September 4, the Israeli High Court of Justice gave the green light for the demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar and of the so-called “rubber tires school”, built by the Italian NGO, Vento di Terra. The school provides educational opportunities for 180 children from the Bedouin village and from adjacent villages as well. A few weeks earlier, on August 10, Israeli warplanes bombed and completely destroyed al-Mishal Cultural Center in Gaza. Among its many activities, the center was used to help children cope with trauma resulting from war-inflicted physical and psychological scars. Advertisement Targeting of Palestinian educational and cultural institutions – through bombings, demolition or property confiscation – has been a regular Israeli policy for many years. While Israel often offers the clichéd explanation, that such destruction is carried out in the name of “security”, facts demonstrate that there is no basis for this claim. In fact, Israel demolishes and destroys based on a completely different logic which dates back to Israel’s own creation over the ruins of hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages in 1948. The Khan al-Ahmar Model The Palestinian village of Khan Al-Ahmar, which is facing imminent Israeli demolition, is a perfect illustration of this horrific and lingering reality. The strategic location of Khan Al-Ahmar makes the story behind the Israeli demolition of the peaceful village unique amidst the ongoing destruction of Palestinian homes and lives throughout besieged Gaza and Occupied West Bank. Throughout the years, Khan Al-Ahmar, once part of an uninterrupted Palestinian physical landscape has grown increasingly isolated. Decades of Israeli colonization of East Jerusalem and the West Bank left the village trapped between massive and vastly expanding Israeli colonial projects: Ma’ale Adumim and Kfar Adumim, among others. The village, its adjacent school and 173 residents are the last obstacle facing the E1 Zone project, an Israeli plan that aims to link illegal Jewish colonies in Occupied East Jerusalem with West Jerusalem, thus cutting off East Jerusalem completely from its Palestinian environs in the West Bank. Like the Neqab (Negev) village of Al-Araqib, which has been demolished by Israel and rebuilt by its residents 133 times, Khan Al-Ahmar residents are facing armed soldiers and military bulldozers with their bare chests and whatever solidarity they are able to obtain. Despite the particular circumstances and unique historical context of Khan Al-Ahmar, however, the story of this village is but a chapter in a trajectory of tragedies that has extended over the course of seventy years. Israel is engaging in a seemingly endless campaign of erasing everything Palestinian, because the latter, from an Israeli perspective, represents an ‘existential threat’ to Israel’s ‘Jewish identity’ Ramzy Baroud Erasure of Palestine It would be an error to discuss the destruction of Khan al-Ahmar, or any other Palestinian village outside the larger context of demolition that has stood at the heart of Israel’s particular breed of settler colonialism. It is true that other colonial powers used destruction of homes and properties, and the exile of entire communities as a tactic to subdue rebellious populations. The British Mandate government in Palestine used the demolition of homes as a ‘deterrence’ tactic against Palestinians who dared rebel against injustice throughout the 1920s, 30s and 40s, till Israel took over in 1948. Yet, the Israeli strategy is far more convoluted than a mere ‘deterrence’. It is now carved in the Israeli psyche that Palestine must be completely destroyed in order for Israel to exist. Therefore, Israel is engaging in a seemingly endless campaign of erasing everything Palestinian, because the latter, from an Israeli perspective, represents an ‘existential threat’ to Israel’s ‘Jewish identity’. This can only be justified with an irrational degree of hatred and fear that has accumulated throughout generations to the point that it now forms a collective Israeli psychosis for which Palestinians continue to pay a heavy price. The repeated destruction of Gaza is symptomatic of this Israeli obsession. Israel is a “country that when you fire on its citizens it responds by going wild - and this is a good thing,” was the official explanation offered by Tzipi Livni, the Israeli foreign minister in January 2009 to justify its country’s war on the blockaded Gaza Strip. The Israel ‘going wild’ strategy has led to the destruction of 22,000 homes, schools and other facilities during one of Israel’s deadliest wars on the Strip. A few years later, in the summer of 2014, Israel went ‘wild’ again, leading to an even greater destruction and loss of lives. Israel’s mass demolition of Palestinian homes in Gaza, and everywhere else, preceded Hamas by decades. In fact, it has nothing to do with the method of resistance that Palestinians utilize in their struggle against Israel. Israel’s demolishing of Palestine – whether the actual physical structures or the idea, history, narrative, and even street names – is entirely an Israeli decision. Numbers don’t lie A quick scan of historical facts demonstrates that Israel demolished Palestinian homes and communities in diverse political and historical contexts, where Israel’s ‘security’ was not in the least a factor. Nearly 600 Palestinian towns, villages and localities were destroyed between 1947 and 1948, and nearly 800,000 Palestinians were exiled to make room for the establishment of Israel. According to the Land Research Center (LRC), Israel had destroyed 5,000 Palestinian homes in Jerusalem alone since it occupied the city in 1967, leading to the permanent exile of nearly 70,000 people. Coupled with the fact that nearly 200,000 Jerusalemites were driven out during the Nakba, ‘the Catastrophe’ of 1948, and the ongoing and gradual ethnic cleansing, the Holy City has been in a constant state of destruction since the establishment of Israel. In fact, between 2000 and 2017, over 1,700 Palestinian homes were demolished, displacing nearly 10,000 people. This is not a policy of “deterrence” but of erasure – the eradication of Palestinian lives, livelihoods, sense of belonging and culture. Gaza and Jerusalem are not unique examples either. According to the Israeli Committee against House Demolitions (ICAHD’s) report last December, since 1967 “nearly 50,000 Palestinian homes and structures have been demolished – displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and affecting the livelihoods of thousands of others.” Combined with the destruction of Palestinian villages upon the establishment of Israel, and the demolition of Palestinian homes inside Israel itself, ICAHD asserts the total number of homes destroyed since 1948 to be more than 100,000. In fact, as the group itself acknowledges, the above figure is rather conservative. In Gaza alone, and in the last 10 years which witnessed three major Israeli wars, nearly 50,000 homes and structures were reportedly destroyed. So why does Israel destroy with consistency, impunity and no remorse? For the same reason that it passed laws to change historic street names from Arabic to Hebrew. For the same reason it recently passed the racist nation-state law, elevating everything Jewish and completely ignoring and downgrading the existence of the indigenous Palestinians, their language and their culture that go back millennia. Israel demolishes, destroys and pulverizes because in the racist mindset of Israeli rulers, there can be no room between the Sea and the River but for Jews; where the Palestinians - oppressed, colonized and dehumanized - don’t factor in the least in Israel’s ruthless calculations. This is not merely a question of Khan Al-Ahmar - it is a question of the very survival of the Palestinian people, threatened by a racist state that has been allowed to ‘go wild’ for 70 years, untamed and without repercussions. _________________________ Ramzy Baroud is a journalist, author and editor of Palestine Chronicle.

News article:
With Israeli authorities' demolition of Palestinian village Khan Al-Ahmar imminent, after an October 1 deadline ran out, Amnesty International has declared that the destruction of the community in the occupied West Bank would constitute a "war crime". "Today's planned demolition by Israeli forces of a West Bank village and the forcible transfer of its residents to make way for illegal Jewish settlements is a war crime", Monday's statement began, with some 180 residents facing expulsion by the Israeli army. The planned expulsion has been endorsed twice by Israel's Supreme Court, "following desperate appeal by residents", including a demolition order for "the village's school". The village is slated for destruction on the basis that it "was built without relevant building permits", however, as Amnesty noted, "these are impossible for Palestinians to obtain in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank known as Area C". Why Israel Demolishes: Khan Al-Ahmar as Representation of Greater Genocide "Israel's policies of settling Israeli civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, wantonly destroying property and forcibly transferring Palestinians living under occupation, violate the Fourth Geneva Convention and are war crimes listed in the statute of the International Criminal Court." According to Amnesty, "since 1967, Israel has forcibly evicted and displaced entire communities and demolished more than 50,000 Palestinian homes and structures." Saleh Higazi, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director, said: "This act is not only heartless and discriminatory, it is illegal". "After nearly a decade of trying to fight the injustice of this demolition, the residents of Khan Al-Ahmar now approach the devastating day when they will see their home of generations torn down before their eyes." "The forcible transfer of the Khan Al-Ahmar community amounts to a war crime. Israel must end its policy of destroying Palestinians' homes and livelihoods to make way for settlements."

Residents of a West Bank hamlet were bracing Monday for the demolition of their homes after the passing of an Israeli-imposed deadline for Khan al-Ahmar’s inhabitants to evacuate before forced removal. Action by authorities was thought unlikely to take place before the end of the Sukkot holiday at sundown Monday. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) executive committee, announced that Monday’s general strike by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs against Israel’s Jewish nation-state law was also in solidarity with the hamlet slated for destruction. Defense Ministry officials handed out notices in the village last month, warning residents that they had until October 1 to demolish all buildings in the hamlet. Otherwise, the notices said, state authorities would do so. “In accordance with the High Court of Justice decision, you are asked to demolish all buildings in Khan al-Ahmar no later than October 1, 2018,” read notices distributed by workers of the Civil Administration, the Defense Ministry body that governs construction in the West Bank.

Any citizen who wishes to receive assistance in demolishing or transporting [property] is welcome to contact the Jerusalem District Coordination and Liaison Office by said date.” The notices followed a ruling from the High Court of Justice earlier this month that rejected a final appeal from Khan al-Ahmar residents to prevent the demolition of their village in a case that has drawn international condemnation of Israel. Locals have opposed the state’s plan to relocate them near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, as well as another proposal that would have moved them to a site adjacent to a sewage treatment facility east of the Mitzpe Jericho settlement. Advertisement The High Court initially froze the planned demolition of Khan al-Ahmar in July when it agreed to hear the residents’ petition. In the beginning of that month, the state began its preparations to raze the hamlet, where none of the structures have been granted permits. Security forces were deployed to the village and construction workers began paving an access road that would facilitate the demolition and evacuation. The state says the structures, mostly makeshift shacks and tents, were built without permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway. The villagers — who have lived at the site, then controlled by Jordan, since the 1950s, after the state evicted them from their Negev homes — argue that they had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as such permits are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as where Khan al-Ahmar lies, where Israel exerts full control over civilian affairs. Opponents of the demolition also argue that it is part of an effort to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem almost to the Dead Sea, a move critics say will bisect the West Bank, making a contiguous Palestinian state impossible.

News article:
The aftermath of a house demolition in Jerusalem, September 2018. Photo credit: OCHA – OPT. Israeli forces demolished five Palestinian-owned structures in the holy city in September. Israeli authorities continued targeting Palestinian homes and businesses for demolition in the holy city throughout September. On September 20, 2018, Fadi Shwamreh demolished his home in Beit Hanina. According to an Israeli demolition order, if Shawamreh did not demolish his home himself, Israeli forces would raid his home, demolish it, and then charge him for the costs of demolition. Shawamreh reports that his home was built in 2006. Israeli authorities accuse him of building the home without an Israeli construction permit. Fifteen people lived in Shawamreh’s home. On September 5, Israeli forces demolished a Palestinian home in Beit Hanina. The house was owned by Naeem Farrah and his family. Sana Farrah told the Wadi Hilweh Information Center that Israeli forces raided the home and then forced her outside in order to execute the demolition. Israeli police did not allow the family to remove most of their belongings from the house. The family had attempted to postpone the demolition of their home in Israeli courts. “The family built the house 16 years ago and fines were imposed amounting to NIS 120,000. After the fines were paid, the municipality issued a decision to demolish the house,” Sana explained. Eight people lived in the Farrah family home. Israeli forces demolished another Palestinian home on September 5 in Silwan. The home belonged to Ali Abu Sway, who reports he had no prior notice of an impending demolition. Israeli authorities allege his home, which was built five years ago, lacks Israeli construction permits. Israeli forces demolished two homes in Anata on September 4. The homes belonged to the Fahidat family. Ziad Fahidat told Ma’an News that six people lived in them. The Israeli municipality zones only 8 – 13% of East Jerusalem for Palestinian residential construction. As a result, many East Jerusalem residents are forced to build without permits to avoid overcrowding. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel found that 20,000 homes in East Jerusalem – 39% of all homes in East Jerusalem – lack Israeli construction permits. Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem are the target of Israeli settlement plans, which aim to link four concentric circles of settlements, starting with the Old City, followed by the “Holy Basin” (Silwan, Sheikh Jarrah, a-Tur, Mount Zion, and the Kidron Valley), Jerusalem’s annexation border, and finally the West Bank. The United Nations Office of Humanitarian Affairs reports that as of September 24, a total of 306 Palestinian-owned structures have been demolished by Israel this year. The European Union found in August that nearly half of the Palestinian-owned structures demolished by Israeli authorities this year were in the Jerusalem district.

Jerusalem – A Palestinian Bedouin village slated for demolition is dealing with a large pool of sewage, apparently from a nearby Israeli settlement. The sewage flowed downhill toward Khan al-Ahmar earlier this week, and on Friday was still pooled in a ravine by the West Bank community’s corrugated tin shacks. Israel’s Civil Administration in the West Bank said that a sewage pipe burst in the area and the military was dispatching a truck to pump the waste out. Israel’s Supreme Court recently rejected a final appeal against plans to demolish the village. Israel says Khan al-Ahmar was built illegally and has offered to resettle its residents a few miles (kilometers) away. Palestinians and other critics say the demolition aims to displace Palestinians in favor of Israeli settlement expansion.

In Al-Birah city occupation forces demolished a residential building which was under construction. The house which is three storeys was to be inhabited by the family of Khamees Matariya. The family had received not prior warning of the planned demolition. The house is located east of Al-Birah city in the central area of the West Bank, adjacent to the illegal Israeli settlement of Psagot, which is a residence of nearly 2,000 illegal settlers living on Palestinian land.

Bardala, a herding community, has faced the demolition of 48 of its structures since 2009 according to OCHA. One Palestinian family was also made homeless in the herding community of Khirbet Al-Marajem in Duma village north of the West Bank after their building was demolished in the early morning. Occupation forces regularly demolish Palestinian homes and structures on the occupied West Bank under the pretext that they were built without the impossible to obtain building permits in an effort to expand settlements and force Palestinians from their homes and lands. The Jordan Valley village of Khan Al-Ahmar is currently threatened with demolition to make way for the expansion of nearby settlements under the Israeli E1 plan on the Jerusalem–Jericho road.

Israeli authorities pack up tents, water tanks and other supplies that had been installed at Jabal West, the relocation site where the government hopes to place the residents of Khan al-Ahmar after razing the West Bank hamlet. The supplies have been at the site adjacent to the Abu Dis garbage dump for several weeks in anticipation of the demolition which could have taken place as early as October 1. Yesterday, the cabinet approved a several-week delay of the razing to give another opportunity for the state to reach an agreement with the residents for a voluntary evacuation of Khan al-Ahmar. However, the attorney representing the Bedouin village tells The Times of Israel that nobody from the government has reached out in the past 24 hours.

Israeli authorities pack up tents, water tanks and other supplies that had been installed at Jabal West, the relocation site where the government hopes to place the residents of Khan al-Ahmar after razing the West Bank hamlet. The supplies have been at the site adjacent to the Abu Dis garbage dump for several weeks in anticipation of the demolition which could have taken place as early as October 1. Yesterday, the cabinet approved a several-week delay of the razing to give another opportunity for the state to reach an agreement with the residents for a voluntary evacuation of Khan al-Ahmar. However, the attorney representing the Bedouin village tells The Times of Israel that nobody from the government has reached out in the past 24 hours.

Israeli forces have demolished the village of Al-Araqeeb in the occupied Negev desert for the 135th time, local sources reported yesterday. Al-Araqeeb's residents told Arab48 that Israeli bulldozers, reinforced and protected by the occupation forces, stormed the village and proceeded to demolish all the Palestinian houses and tents there, displacing women and children despite the "cold weather and rain". After the demolition was completed, the residents added, Israeli forces arrested four of the village's inhabitants, including Sheikh Al-Araqeeb, Sheikh Sayah Al-Turi, Aziz Sabah and his wife, and Salim Mohammed Abu Medegham, for allegedly "obstructing the work of police and the demolition crews". The locals explained that the detainees were transferred by occupation forces to a detention centre for interrogation. Earlier this week, scores of Palestinians, including officials, demonstrated in support of Al-Araqeeb. Read: Palestinians in Israel come out in support of Al-Araqeeb The Negev village of Al-Araqeeb was first razed in 2010 under pretexts that it was built without the needed licenses. The last demolition was carried out earlier this month. Al-Araqeb is one of 35 "unrecognised" Bedouin villages. According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), more than half of the approximately 160,000 Bedouins in the Negev reside in unrecognised villages. The unrecognised Bedouin villages were established in the Negev soon after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war following the creation of the State of Israel. Right groups say that the demolition of unrecognised Bedouin villages is a central Israeli policy aimed at removing the indigenous Palestinian population from the Negev and transferring them to government-zoned townships to make room for the expansion of Jewish Israeli communities.

News article:
(Repeats Sept. 11 column without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Traders more concerned about supply than consumption outlook * Efforts to maintain global supply amid sanctions in sharp focus * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2oZ5MoB LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Oil traders have become much more concerned in recent weeks about the potential impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran and the effect on the availability of crude at the end of the year. Brent futures for November have moved to a premium of 45 cents a barrel over the December contract, in a sharp reversal from early last month, when the earlier contract traded at a 20 cent discount. The gyrations in the futures curve are linked closely to traders’ perceptions of the availability of seaborne crude once sanctions are re-imposed from early November (tmsnrt.rs/2oZ5MoB). The November-December calendar spread moved into an increasing premium (backwardation) between July 2017 and May 2018, reflecting the overall tightening of the oil market. Rapid growth in consumption, output restraint by OPEC and its allies as well as unexpected disruptions to production in Venezuela and some African countries all helped to reduce excess oil inventories. The U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran’s exports from early November contributed to a forecast tightening of the market, pushing the Nov-Dec spread to a premium of more than 50 cents in early May. But the calendar spread subsequently collapsed as OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, started to increase production from May onwards. For a short period, in late July and early August, the Nov-Dec spread was trading at a small but significant discount (contango) consistent with plentiful availability of oil at the end of the year. In recent weeks, however, the spread has tightened again, amid signs that output from the Permian Basin in Texas is levelling off and that Saudi Arabia is raising production more slowly than expected. Traders have become much more cautious about crude availability late this year, reflected in a rise in spot oil prices, tighter calendar spreads and an increase in bullish hedge fund positioning in crude futures. Concerns about crude availability have been exacerbated by signs that the threatened re-imposition of sanctions is already having an impact on Iran’s exports, even before the secondary embargo formally goes into effect. For the moment, traders are more concerned about a shortfall in crude availability as a result of sanctions and the stagnation of U.S. drilling than they are about a slowdown in the global economy hitting growth in oil consumption. THREE-WAY DANCE The sharp movements in the spread point to the complicated three-way dance between the White House, Saudi Arabia and hedge fund managers over Iran sanctions and oil supplies. The White House wants tough sanctions but is anxious to maintain crude availability and avoid being blamed for a rise in fuel costs, especially in an election year. Saudi Arabia supports a tough policy on Iran and has promised to make up any shortfall in oil supplies, but it does not want to risk oversupplying the market and provoking a renewed drop in prices. Hedge fund managers, in turn, are betting supplies will fall and prices rise as Saudi caution trumps White House pressure for steady or lower fuel costs. Someone must be miscalculating. If the market tightens as much as traders currently expect, the White House will be faced with a rise in prices it has tried hard to avoid. Rising prices may matter less after election day on Nov. 6, but they are likely to remain unwelcome at any time and will expose both the White House and Saudi Arabia to criticism for poorly executed policy. If, on the other hand, the White House and Saudi Arabia manage to keep the market plentifully supplied even as sanctions go into effect, Brent spot prices and calendar spreads are likely to come under renewed pressure. And hedge fund managers are likely to liquidate some of the new bullish positions they have established since late last month, intensifying downward pressure on spot prices and spreads. The oil market outlook now depends on whether the United States and Saudi Arabia can successfully implement their sanctions policy without disrupting global oil supplies. Most oil traders are betting they will fail and leave the market at least moderately short of crude.

A gas flare on an oil production platform in the Soroush oil fields is seen alongside an Iranian flag in the Persian Gulf, Iran, July 25, 2005 | Reuters London- Asharq Al-Awsat As the second wave of US sanctions against Iran closes in, oil rates shot up on global markets touching a four-year high on Tuesday, with markets bracing for regulations restricting importing Iranian crude. Brent crude rose $78 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest in four years, gaining more than 10 percent since mid-August. On another note, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry met with his Saudi counterpart Khaled al-Falih in Washington, with the Trump administration urging giant oil producers to keep production high. Perry will meet with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak Thursday in Moscow. Perry and Falih discussed the state of world oil markets, the potential for US-Saudi civil nuclear cooperation, and efforts to share technologies to develop “clean fossil fuels,” US Department of Energy said in a statement. The move coincides with a statement by Novak saying that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and independent producers, known as the OPEC + alliance, may sign a new long-term cooperation agreement next December. OPEC and non-OPEC officials meet later this month to discuss proposals for an increase in oil production. OPEC member states, Russia and other non-OPEC producers agreed in June to re-impose 100 percent compliance with the oil production cuts agreement struck in January 2017. On the other hand, Novak said that Russian companies are able to increase oil production and that Russian crude oil production stood at 11.21 million bpd in August, unchanged from July. Russia is a partner in the cooperation production cut agreement to stabilize world oil prices between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. Another source told Reuters that India's state-run Bharat Petroleum will skip buying Iranian oil in October-- US crude oil exports to Japan and South Korea are expected to rise to record highs.

LONDON - The US will find it difficult to cut Iran's oil exports completely as the oil market is already tight and rival producers cannot make up the shortfall, a top Iranian official said on Friday. Washington is seeking to cut Iranian oil exports to zero by November as it reimposes sanctions, and is encouraging other producers such as Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia to pump more to meet the shortfall. Even so, the expected loss of Iranian oil, declining supply from another OPEC member Venezuela and other outages are boosting crude prices, which this week hit $80 a barrel, the highest since May. Iran's OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said in comments to Reuters that a "supply shortage" meant that the United States would not be able to meet its zero export target.

Oil cartel OPEC has "not much credit" left as some members are turning it into "a tool for the U.S.," a senior Iranian official said. "Saudi Arabia and the UAE are turning OPEC into a tool for the U.S. and consequently the organization has not much credit left," Iran's OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told the Shana newswire, affiliated to Iran's Oil Ministry. "It is a fact that OPEC is losing its organizational character and becoming a forum," he added. In a move heavily opposed by Iran, OPEC and other oil producers including Russia agreed in June to boost crude output by around a million barrels a day, reversing course after supply cuts that had cleared a global glut and boosted prices. Iran, a founding member of the cartel, had been against the move which came as the country faces renewed U.S. sanctions after Washington's decision to leave the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers. The U.S. decision had stoked supply concerns on world markets. Ardebili also accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of taking the market "hostage" through increased production and said that OPEC's responsibility is to restore market balance, not to boycott its founding members. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the cartel to raise its production and said that other countries must stop buying oil from Iran or face U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, output from Iran has hit its lowest level since July 2016 as top buyers India and China distance themselves from Tehran due to looming U.S. sanctions on November 5, according to the International Energy Agency.

News article:
BEIJING: Global oil prices edged up from early losses on Monday despite assurances from Washington that Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States can raise output fast enough to offset falling supplies from Iran and elsewhere. US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in an interview with Reuters on Friday that he does not foresee any price spikes and that the countries, the world’s top three oil producers, can between them raise global output in the next 18 months. Brent crude oil futures gained 25 cents to $78.34 per barrel as of 0727 GMT, reversing a 0.2 percent loss earlier in the session. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose 28 cents to $69.27 a barrel after posting a drop of 20 cents earlier in the trading session. Iran’s oil exports are falling as more buyers, including its second-largest buyer India, cut imports ahead of US sanctions that will be re-imposed in November. Washington aims to cut Iran oil exports down to zero to force Tehran to re-negotiate a nuclear deal. Iran’s OPEC governor said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia and Russia have taken the oil market “hostage” and accused other producers of turning OPEC into a US tool. Iran is the third-largest producer among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Trading remained choppy amid an unresolved trade war between the US and China. US President Donald Trump is likely to announce new tariffs on about $200 billion on Chinese imports as early as Monday, a senior administration official told Reuters on Saturday. The escalating trade row is raising concerns about the potential for slower growth in oil consumption, offsetting supply concerns stemming from the upcoming US sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. “The market’s expectation of shortages has cooled after data from last week showed increases in supplies, while investors have lowered the outlook for oil demand,” said Wang Xiao, head of crude research with Guotai Junan Futures. Also weighing on oil prices, US drillers added two oil rigs in the week to December 1, bringing the total count up to 749, the highest since September, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. Brent crude’s premium to WTI stretched as wide as $9.42 a barrel on Monday with investors expecting the premium to rise in the near term after data showed that investors placed more long bets on Brent versus WTI. “Markets will be looking toward OPEC and Joint Technical Committee conference call for forward guidance on oil market fundamentals in the coming term,” said Benjamin Lu, a broker at Philip Futures, in a note on Monday. The Joint Technical Committee consists of members from OPEC and non-OPEC producers that coordinates the groups’ current supply agreement. It is set to meet on Monday.

US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in an interview with Reuters on Friday that he does not foresee any price spikes and that the countries, the world’s top three oil producers, can between them raise global output in the next 18 months. Brent crude oil futures gained 25 cents to $78.34 per barrel as of 0727 GMT, reversing a 0.2 percent loss earlier in the session. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose 28 cents to $69.27 a barrel after posting a drop of 20 cents earlier in the trading session. Iran’s oil exports are falling as more buyers, including its second-largest buyer India, cut imports ahead of US sanctions that will be re-imposed in November. Washington aims to cut Iran oil exports down to zero to force Tehran to re-negotiate a nuclear deal. Iran’s OPEC governor said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia and Russia have taken the oil market “hostage” and accused other producers of turning OPEC into a US tool. Iran is the third-largest producer among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Trading remained choppy amid an unresolved trade war between the US and China. US President Donald Trump is likely to announce new tariffs on about $200 billion on Chinese imports as early as Monday, a senior administration official told Reuters on Saturday. The escalating trade row is raising concerns about the potential for slower growth in oil consumption, offsetting supply concerns stemming from the upcoming US sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. “The market’s expectation of shortages has cooled after data from last week showed increases in supplies, while investors have lowered the outlook for oil demand,” said Wang Xiao, head of crude research with Guotai Junan Futures. Also weighing on oil prices, US drillers added two oil rigs in the week to December 1, bringing the total count up to 749, the highest since September, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. Brent crude’s premium to WTI stretched as wide as $9.42 a barrel on Monday with investors expecting the premium to rise in the near term after data showed that investors placed more long bets on Brent versus WTI. “Markets will be looking toward OPEC and Joint Technical Committee conference call for forward guidance on oil market fundamentals in the coming term,” said Benjamin Lu, a broker at Philip Futures, in a note on Monday. The Joint Technical Committee consists of members from OPEC and non-OPEC producers that coordinates the groups’ current supply agreement. It is set to meet on Monday.

An Iranian oil facility on the Gulf island of Khark is seen in a file picture taken on March 12, 2017 Oil cartel OPEC has "not much credit" left as some members are turning it into "a tool for the US", a senior Iranian official said in comments published Saturday. "Saudi Arabia and the UAE are turning OPEC into a tool for the US and consequently the organisation has not much credit left," Iran's OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told the Shana newswire, affiliated to Iran's Oil Ministry. "It is a fact that OPEC is losing its organisational character and becoming a forum," he added. In a move heavily opposed by Iran, OPEC and other oil producers including Russia agreed in June to boost crude output by around a million barrels a day, reversing course after supply cuts that had cleared a global glut and boosted prices. Iran, a founding member of the cartel, had been against the move which came as the country faces renewed US sanctions after Washington's decision to leave the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers. The US decision had stoked supply concerns on world markets. Ardebili also accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of taking the market "hostage" through increased production and said that OPEC's responsibility is to restore market balance, not to boycott its founding members. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the cartel to raise its production and said that other countries must stop buying oil from Iran or face US sanctions. Meanwhile, output from Iran has hit its lowest level since July 2016 as top buyers India and China distance themselves from Tehran due to looming US sanctions on November 5, according to the International Energy Agency.

FUJAIRAH: OPEC must stick together for the good of the global economy as founding member Iran faces renewed US sanctions, the head of the group said Tuesday — though he did not address how an already-tight market will make up for the loss of Iranian supply. Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo also said an agreement between OPEC and non-members that cut production and helped bring prices back up from lows of $30 a barrel in January 2016 was now “a permanent feature.” Cementing that arrangement would be one of the topics of discussion as OPEC meets this Sunday in Algeria, he added. Still, OPEC will face rising anger from Iran, which feels increasingly under pressure after President Donald Trump pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in May. Crushing US oil sanctions on Iran will resume in early November and already, American allies in Asia are cutting back on their purchases of Iranian crude. The US moves have gotten furious reactions from Iran, especially amid talk of American officials asking Russia and Saudi Arabia to make up the difference. “Mr. Trump’s attempt to prevent Iran from appearing on the global crude oil markets has allowed Russia and Saudi Arabia, which would not favor low prices, to pursue hostage-taking policies in the market,” Iranian OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said on Saturday. Barkindo said: “Iran is not only a founding member of OPEC, it’s a very important member of this organization. We have no choice but continue to work with all parties.” Benchmark Brent crude already is nearing $80 a barrel and analysts believe it may go even higher as production remains low. A loss of Iranian supply likely will further drive up prices. Trump, facing midterm elections in the US, already has called for more oil production from Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down prices with limited effect. A gallon of regular gasoline costs on average $2.85 in the US, up from $2.62 a year ago, according to AAA. Barkindo praised the agreement between OPEC and non-members that cut production and said the cartel would work to make it permanent. “The declaration of cooperation has come to stay,” he said.

An escalation in US rhetoric in the ongoing trade war with China as well as falling Iranian exports will have an impact on supply and demand, with Opec collectively acting to balance oil markets, the group’s secretary general said yesterday. on Tuesday. "Trade is a major quantum in the overall global economic equation and whatever affects the free flow of trade will ultimately impact growth and will have an impact on oil demand and also on the GDP," Mohammed Barkindo told a conference of energy traders in Fujairah, organised by Gulf Intelligence. Oil prices have recovered from a three-year slump, rising to around $80 per barrel earlier this month, as exports from Iran, Opec's third-largest producer, began to fall due to the onset of US sanctions against the country. The White House has set November 14 as the deadline for countries to stop importing Iranian crude. The exporters’ group in June began to revise an earlier pact to hold back around 1.8 million barrels per day from the market to boost prices. With Brent averaging around $72 for much of the year, Opec, led by Saudi Arabia, added 377,000 bpd back to the market since the second quarter of the year. However, with importers cutting back supplies from Iran, oil markets remain concerned about a possible supply squeeze and higher prices that could trigger production from independent North American shale producers. _______ Read more: Oil production at record but IEA says prices likely to rise Oil trades below $70 as traders assess supply shortage ________ Opec will act collectively to reinforce market balance should the Iran sanctions lead to a supply shock, Mr Barkindo said. “We’re always acting and in the summer of 2014 we learnt our lessons,” he said. "We have to continue to be ahead of the curve on all issues and if need be, also take collective action. It is not the responsibility of one or two producers to take decisions on behalf of all producers,” he added. He stressed that Iran, as a founding member of Opec, would see its concerns addressed adequately by the exporters' group. The group’s technical committee is monitoring and analysing the current dynamics of the oil market, which will be taken up at Opec’s upcoming sub-committee meeting at the Algerian capital on September 24, he said. Opec will also press ahead during the meeting to institutionalise the working relationship with sovereign producers outside the group led by Russia. The National reported in February that the 25 Opec and non-Opec producers undertaking supply corrections will evolve into a super-group by the end of the year. The charter to formalise the relationship will be agreed to and signed during Opec’s annual meeting in Vienna in December, said Mr Barkindo.

Fujairah, UAE: The head of OPEC said Tuesday that Iran remains "a very important member" of the oil cartel, as Tehran braces for a new round of US sanctions partially targeting its crude exports. "Iran is a very important member of OPEC... and we have no choice but to continue working with all parties," Mohammad Barkindo said at the Gulf Intelligence Energy Forum in the emirate of Fujairah. Iran remains "a very important exporter of oil," said the chief of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. He did not specify how crude producers would compensate for declining exports from Iran, with new US sanctions due to hit the Islamic republic´s oil industry on November 4. Iran´s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said Saturday that OPEC had "not much credit left" and slammed Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for turning it into a "tool for the US". Output from Iran has now hit its lowest level since July 2016, according to the International Energy Agency, as top buyers India and China have distance themselves from Tehran. US President Donald Trump has called for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members, primarily US ally Saudi Arabia, to raise their production, and warned importers to stop buying oil from Iran or face American sanctions. In 2016, major producers both within and outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to slash production in an attempt to boost prices following the 2014 oil market crash. Barkindo said a "permanent" framework of cooperation between the 14 OPEC members and 11 non-OPEC oil states, including the world´s top producer Russia, was expected in December.

News article:
Oil prices slipped on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump called on OPEC to “get prices down now!” ahead of a meeting of major oil exporters in Algeria this weekend, Reuters reports. Brent crude oil LCOc1 was down 40 cents at $79.00 a barrel by 1225 GMT. U.S. light crude oil CLc1 was unchanged at $71.12 a barrel after rising nearly 2 percent on Wednesday. The North Sea benchmark has been trading close to $80 a barrel, near its highest for almost four years, on expectations that U.S. sanctions against Iran, OPEC’s third biggest producer, will reduce supply in world markets. The U.S. sanctions were imposed by Trump in response to Iran’s nuclear program, which the White House says is designed to produce weapons, an allegation Tehran denies. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, meet on Sunday in Algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. The meeting is unlikely to agree an official rise in crude output, although pressure is mounting on top producers to prevent a spike in prices. U.S. President Donald Trump weighed into the debate via Twitter on Thursday, urging OPEC to cut prices. “The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!,” Trump said. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember.” Despite the president’s intervention, market sentiment remained fairly bullish with many traders and analysts expecting Brent to move above $80 soon. “Brent is definitely fighting the $80 line, wanting to break above,” said SEB Markets chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop. “But this is likely going to break very soon.” The market remained bullish after news of another fall in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell for a fifth straight week to 3-1/2 year lows in the week to Sept. 14, while gasoline inventories also showed a larger than expected draw on unseasonably strong demand, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 2.1 million barrels, compared with expectations for a decrease of 2.7 million barrels. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports come into force on Nov. 4 and many buyers have already scaled back Iranian purchases. It is unclear how easily other producers, such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia, can compensate for lost supply.

News article:
US President Donald Trump has accused OPEC’s Middle East producers of “pushing for higher and higher oil prices.” Trump, who is a proponent of cheap crude, has told OPEC countries they would not be safe for long without the US. We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 20 сентября 2018 г. Oil prices showed a mixed reaction to Trump’s words. The Brent benchmark fell 43 cents to $78.97 per barrel, while the US Texas Intermediate grew 9 cents to $71.21. This is not the first time Trump has attacked OPEC and blamed it for high oil prices. Asked by Fox on July 1 if someone was manipulating oil markets, Trump said: “OPEC is and they better stop it because we’re protecting those countries, many of those countries.” In a follow-up Tweet on July 4, the president said that “the United States defends many of those countries for very little $’s.” Why does Trump so badly want low oil prices? De-facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and Russia have an agreement to curb oil production. The kingdom, its Gulf allies and Russia have recently agreed to lift production by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to offset losses from Venezuela and Iran, but not more. This keeps oil no lower than $75 per barrel. As oil prices remain high, prices for gasoline in the US are growing. The average cost of gasoline has risen 60 percent from $1.87 per gallon in February 2016 to over $3 in September. Higher oil prices have boosted economies of producing states North Dakota, Texas and others. “But most of those states are solidly Republican and likely to vote for Trump’s party at the mid-term congressional elections in 2018,” said John Kemp, a Reuters market analyst. “The president, therefore, is paying much closer attention to the harmful impact of higher oil and gasoline prices on consumers in swing states.” One of the largest factors for the oil price surge is Trump’s sanctions war against Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, analysts have said. As Iran oil sales decline, the supply goes down, and prices grow. Does the US really protect the Middle East? Iran is not the only country in the Middle East which could find Trump’s so-called protection claim questionable. Trump has said several times that without the US, OPEC countries would not be safe. OPEC members such as Libya, Iraq, Venezuela would surely doubt that. A 2011 NATO military intervention in Libya to oust the country’s leader, Muammar Gaddafi, fueled a major conflict which took the lives of thousands of civilians. In the war, Libya lost more than half of its 1.6 million barrels per day in oil production, something which still hasn’t returned to 1 million. OPEC’s second-largest oil producer, Iraq, suffered a US military invasion in 2003. Iran and Venezuela are under tough US sanctions which have slashed their oil exports and triggered a currency crisis. For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section

Iran, whose economy is increasingly being squeezed by the United States, has threatened to veto any decisions by Opec that will hurt its national interests at the organisation’s coming sub-committee meeting in Algiers. Opec is set to convene in the Algerian capital on September 24 to discuss the dynamics of the oil markets. Oil prices have risen close to $80 per barrel this year, supported by earlier production cuts as well as in anticipation of US sanctions against Iran. Tehran is opposed to Opec and sovereign producers outside the group led by Russia deciding to increase production – which could lower oil prices – and possibly allocate output quotas at a time when its own capacity to export is restricted by sanctions. "Iran will veto any decision that threatens our national interests. Without a moment of doubt. Veto means that the decision is not legal. If vetoed, that decision is illegal," Iranian Petroleum Minister Bijan Zanganeh told state petroleum news agency Shana. Mr Zanganeh, who will not be attending the meeting in Algiers, where Iran will be represented by its Opec governor, called out the group and its allies for allowing political interference from the Americans. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused Opec of manipulating prices to remain high this year. On Thursday, he accused the group again of nudging prices ahead of its meeting in Algeria. After a three-year slump, the price of Brent has averaged a comfortable $72/b for much of the year, after Opec and allies managed to successfully draw down five-year high inventory levels that had led to a glut in the oil markets. Following increased US pressure, the group reversed an earlier pact to slash approximately 1.8 million barrels per day and had begun to substantially add supply back to the market. Saudi Arabia and allies have ramped production by almost 350,000 bpd since January. _______ Read more: Sri Lanka stops import of Iranian oil ahead of sanctions Trade wars and falling Iran exports to impact supply and demand, says Opec India's Iran oil purchases to fade ahead of US sanctions ________ On Tuesday, Opec secretary general Mohammed Barkindo told an audience of energy traders in the UAE's northern emirate of Fujairah that Iran, a founding member of Opec, was an important part of the organisation. “When you have major producers facing supply challenges it’s a concern not only for Opec but also for the consuming countries,” he told the audience. “We will continue to work with all parties, Iran is a very important player and exporter and so are other countries,” he added. Iran has seen buyers slash imports in anticipation of US snapback sanctions targeting its energy industry, which will come into force on November 4. Analysts are predicting Iranian exports may fall by as much as 1.5 million bpd. Countries that had depended on Iranian imports for refining such as Japan have loaded their last cargoes, while South Korean and Indian refiners have already cut back. On Tuesday, Sri Lanka's Petroleum Resources Development minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the country had completely halted its oil imports from Iran. The Islamic Republic had been almost the sole supplier for crude to the South Asian state, which was planning to upgrade its sole refinery with Iranian help. The retrenchment of Iranian oil buyers further threatens the country's ability to collect foreign exchange which in turn impacts its purchasing power and trading position. The Iranian rial has lost more than 80 per cent of its value against US dollar since the start of the year due to mounting US pressure and re-imposition of American sanctions. Mr Zanganeh declined to comment on how Iran, which continues to ship crude to select buyers using its own tanker facilities was getting its oil to market. “I [will] not reveal the client, the destination, the countries, how [we] transfer the oil to the tanker, how to solve the insurance problem. I do not know anything,” he said.

After a three-year slump, the price of Brent has averaged a comfortable $72/b for much of the year, after Opec and allies managed to successfully draw down five-year high inventory levels that had led to a glut in the oil markets. Following increased US pressure, the group reversed an earlier pact to slash approximately 1.8 million barrels per day and had begun to substantially add supply back to the market. Saudi Arabia and allies have ramped production by almost 350,000 bpd since January. _______ Read more: Sri Lanka stops import of Iranian oil ahead of sanctions Trade wars and falling Iran exports to impact supply and demand, says Opec India's Iran oil purchases to fade ahead of US sanctions ________ On Tuesday, Opec secretary general Mohammed Barkindo told an audience of energy traders in the UAE's northern emirate of Fujairah that Iran, a founding member of Opec, was an important part of the organisation. “When you have major producers facing supply challenges it’s a concern not only for Opec but also for the consuming countries,” he told the audience. “We will continue to work with all parties, Iran is a very important player and exporter and so are other countries,” he added. Iran has seen buyers slash imports in anticipation of US snapback sanctions targeting its energy industry, which will come into force on November 4. Analysts are predicting Iranian exports may fall by as much as 1.5 million bpd. Countries that had depended on Iranian imports for refining such as Japan have loaded their last cargoes, while South Korean and Indian refiners have already cut back. On Tuesday, Sri Lanka's Petroleum Resources Development minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the country had completely halted its oil imports from Iran. The Islamic Republic had been almost the sole supplier for crude to the South Asian state, which was planning to upgrade its sole refinery with Iranian help. The retrenchment of Iranian oil buyers further threatens the country's ability to collect foreign exchange which in turn impacts its purchasing power and trading position. The Iranian rial has lost more than 80 per cent of its value against US dollar since the start of the year due to mounting US pressure and re-imposition of American sanctions. Mr Zanganeh declined to comment on how Iran, which continues to ship crude to select buyers using its own tanker facilities was getting its oil to market. “I [will] not reveal the client, the destination, the countries, how [we] transfer the oil to the tanker, how to solve the insurance problem. I do not know anything,” he said.

Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, pledged to block any supply increases, saying that the price jump was caused by Trump’s decision to put additional sanctions on Iranian oil. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said he would personally block any OPEC decision that would harm Iran’s interests, Bloomberg reported. “Any country that says it can make up for the shortfall in the market is siding with the US,” Zanganeh told reporters in Tehran on Thursday, also noting that he will not attend the JMMC meeting, saying that $80 a barrel is a “suitable” price and declaring that any decision made by the JMMC to increase production would be “void” and “invalid.” Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the only oil producer able to adjust its output, will not be able to produce 12 million barrels per day to cover Iranian oil exports once Washington introduces restrictions, media reported. The state-run Saudi Arabian Oil Company, known as Saudi Aramco, had been informing its customers its crude would be in short supply in October, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing Saudi officials. Moreover, the company would not be able to meet the demand for crude in the long term once Tehran, currently producing around 1.9 million barrels per day, wold be be banned from exporting oil, the outlet added. August’s OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report showed that Saudi Arabia’s output reached 10.44 million barrels per day that month. "[Producing] 11 million [barrels a day] is already a stretch, even for just a few months," a Saudi official told the Wall Street Journal.

News article:
WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump linked American support for Middle Eastern countries to oil prices on Thursday as he again urged OPEC to lower prices. "We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!" Trump wrote on Twitter. The Republican president has lashed out at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over the past several months. Rising U.S. gasoline prices could create a political headache for Trump before November congressional elections by offsetting Republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped boost the U.S. economy. Trump has called on Saudi Arabia, OPEC´s largest producer, to raise output, saying that it should help the United States lower fuel prices since Washington is aiding Riyadh in its struggle against Iran. OPEC and its allies are unlikely to agree to an official increase in crude output when they meet in Algeria this weekend, although pressure is mounting on top producers to prevent a spike in oil prices ahead of new U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC sources told Reuters on Thursday. The new sanctions take effect in November, as a result of with Trump´s decision to pull out of a 2015 agreement on Iran´s nuclear program. Saudi Arabia is worried that any sanctions-related spike in oil prices will trigger fresh criticism from Trump, but it also faces doubts over its ability to compensate for a drop in Iranian supply, the sources said. In a visit to Moscow this month, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia can between them raise global output in the next 18 months to compensate for falling oil supplies from Iran.

The Saudi state-run oil company Aramco (short for Saudi Arabian Oil Co.) is warning its potential buyers that they are running low on the most popular crude in October 2018, a month before the US is to impose sanctions on the sale of Iranian oil, amid higher-than-expected demand, as the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources close to the situation. One buyer revealed that he’s been offered the company’s less popular types of oil. Aramco is also said to lack the capacity to fill in for Iran’s oil in the long term once Tehran, currently producing around 1.9 million barrels per day, is banned from exporting oil, the outlet added. According to the outlet, this could increase oil prices, pulling them past $80 a barrel, which would impact US consumers.

News article:
London, Kuwait: Opec and its allies are pumping half a million barrels a day below the target they set two months ago as output drops in countries from Iran to Venezuela. The group is currently over-complying by 29 per cent, meaning it’s pumping less than it pledged. While there won’t be any new production proposal at a meeting this weekend in Algiers, a renewed pledge to bring the group back to 100 per cent compliance with targets would allow Saudi Arabia to open the taps. Opec+ officials are in Algiers to review production figures ahead of a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee on Sunday, a group that includes the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia and observes producers’ compliance. Officials are so far not discussing any proposal beyond a June agreement to achieve 100 per cent compliance with quotas initially established in 2016, the delegates said. Oil prices have climbed about 18 per cent this year amid mounting concern that dwindling production in some countries will cause a shortfall. Declines in Iran, Venezuela, Kazakhstan and Mexico are largely to blame for the over-compliance in August, delegates said. Yet divisions in the Opec are making it almost impossible to agree on collective action to cool the rally. While Saudi Arabia — along with non-Opec ally Russia — is eager to temper prices with more supply, Iran feels such moves would steal the market share it’s losing to US sanctions. While delegates attributed the August compliance figure to declines in certain nations, output estimates from the International Energy Agency suggest a figure closer to 100 per cent for August. In any event, the so-called JMMC has no mandate to decide on how output increases will be shared out to reach full compliance, delegates said, adding that the decision will be taken at the next ministerial meeting in Vienna. The question is just how much oil is going to be taken off the market with US sanctions on Iran. I think that the market is building up energy for another try at multi-year highs.” - Gene McGillian | Director of market research at Tradition Energy Meanwhile, oil prices ended the week giving back most earlier gains after news that major producers would consider additional supply a day after US President Donald Trump again blasted Opec. Investors grappled with whether the Opec and non-Opec producers will offset a shortfall from Iran once US sanctions go into full force November 4. Major producers are scheduled to gather in Algeria on Sunday. “The question is just how much oil is going to be taken off the market with US sanctions on Iran,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Compounding declining production in Venezuela, Iran’s production cuts could lead to a much tighter supply picture, he said. “I think that the market is building up energy for another try at multi-year highs.” Global benchmark Brent crude settled 10 cents higher at $78.80 (Dh289.39) a barrel.

News article:
Abu Dhabi: Opec and no-Opec members including Russia have decided there will be not be any additional increase in supply to offset falling Iranian oil exports in a rebuff to US president Donald Trump’s calls for increasing output to bring down oil prices. Ministers and officials from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies gathered in Algerian capital on Sunday to review output data and discuss current situation in oil markets. Saudi oil minister Khalid Al Falih said the country had spare capacity to increase oil output but no such move was needed at the moment. “My information is that the markets are adequately supplied. I don’t know of any refiner in the world who is looking for oil and is not able to get it,” Al Falih was quoted as saying by Reuters during a meeting of oil ministers in Algiers. Falih also said returning to 100 per cent compliance was the main objective and should be achieved in the next two to three months. “We have the consensus that we need to offset reductions and achieve 100 per cent compliance, which means we can produce significantly more than we are producing today if there is demand,” he said. Opec, Russia and other allies agreed a deal in December 2016 to cut supply, but after months of cutting by more than the pact had called for, they agreed in June to boost output by returning to 100 per cent compliance which equates to about one million barrels per day. We have the consensus that we need to offset reductions and achieve 100 per cent compliance, which means we can produce significantly more than we are producing today if there is demand.” - Khalid Al Falih | Saudi Energy Minister UAE Energy minister Suhail Al Mazroui also said that the country has spare production capacity but won’t overuse it, and right now the market is in “good condition.” The comments come as supply concerns intensify due to the decision of the US government to reimpose sanctions on Iran, a top oil producing country. US president Donald Trump renewed sanctions on Iran earlier this year and asked countries to stop importing oil from Iran from November or face US sanctions. Many countries like India have already reduced imports from Iran to avoid being penalised by the US government. “Crude oil remains supported and at risk of breaking higher as supply concerns intensify,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “Despite increased production from some Opec members and Russia together with robust US export sales of crude, the market is turning increasingly tight. Iranian exports have already witnessed a sharp reduction and are likely to fall further when US sanctions come into effect in November.” Iran, which is one of the important members of the Opec produces about 3.8 million barrels of oil per day, of which it exports about 2.8 million barrels of oil per day to various countries including China, India and a number of countries in Europe. Iranian exports are expected to reduce by 30 to 40 per cent due to sanctions. Global benchmark, Brent is trading near $79 per barrel and US crude West Texas Intermediate at $71 per barrel. Brent crude rose above $80 per barrel last week. US President Trump criticised Opec for not doing enough to lower oil prices in a tweet last week. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The Opec monopoly must get prices down now!” Trump wrote on Twitter. — With inputs from Bloomberg, Reuters

Abu Dhabi: Opec and no-Opec members including Russia have decided there will be not be any additional increase in supply to offset falling Iranian oil exports in a rebuff to US president Donald Trump’s calls for increasing output to bring down oil prices. Ministers and officials from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies gathered in Algerian capital on Sunday to review output data and discuss current situation in oil markets. Saudi oil minister Khalid Al Falih said the country had spare capacity to increase oil output but no such move was needed at the moment. “My information is that the markets are adequately supplied. I don’t know of any refiner in the world who is looking for oil and is not able to get it,” Al Falih was quoted as saying by Reuters during a meeting of oil ministers in Algiers. Falih also said returning to 100 per cent compliance was the main objective and should be achieved in the next two to three months. “We have the consensus that we need to offset reductions and achieve 100 per cent compliance, which means we can produce significantly more than we are producing today if there is demand,” he said. Opec, Russia and other allies agreed a deal in December 2016 to cut supply, but after months of cutting by more than the pact had called for, they agreed in June to boost output by returning to 100 per cent compliance which equates to about one million barrels per day.

News article:
Algiers (AFP) - A meeting between oil producing countries on Sunday decided not to alter supply to the global market, after calls by US President Donald Trump for an immediate hike in output to reduce prices. A committee of participating states "expressed its satisfaction regarding the current oil market outlook with an overall healthy balance between supply and demand", a statement said, at the end of a meeting in Algiers. But Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih left the way open to a future production hike, as supplies tighten due to the US imposing sanctions on Iranian oil from November this year. "It is critical that we continue to foresee and anticipate changing market supply and demand balances and take proactive actions to avoid conditions that could make (oil) consumers uneasy and anxious," said Falih, who chairs the joint committee of OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The OPEC cartel in December 2016 concluded an agreement with non-member states -- including Russia -- to reduce output in order to arrest sliding prices. Sunday's meeting in Algiers brought together OPEC oil ministers and non-OPEC signatories to the 2016 agreement, as they seek to extend their cooperation. Trump has repeatedly called for a hike in production by countries other than Iran to reduce oil prices, which have partially recovered since the December 2016 agreement, to trade close to $80 per barrel this month. "We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices!" Trump tweeted on Thursday. "We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!" The committee formed by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers "was directed to study the 2019 outlook and present options on 2019 production levels to prevent market imbalance", the closing statement in Algiers added. - 'Spare capacity' ready to deploy - Story continues Falih said attending ministers "showed us that they have spare capacity that they are ready to deploy if there is demand for it, if it is required by any shortfall". But he said producers would reduce "supply if there is ever... a demand shock to the market". "It's premature to say what we're going to do in 2019," he added. Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak on Sunday appeared to back a continuation of the partnership between OPEC and non-OPEC member states. "We need to give serious thought to expand our partnership beyond this year to tackling the new challenges that appear ahead of us," he said. After pulling out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in May this year, the Trump administration has pledged to impose an embargo on Iranian oil from November 5. Iran's OPEC representative Hossein Kazempour Ardebili on Sunday said his country was continuing to meet its OPEC quota share. "I expect all countries to exercise their sovereignty and not to abide by the instructions of Trump," he said. But output from Iran has hit its lowest level since July 2016, according to the International Energy Agency, as top buyers India and China distance themselves from Tehran in anticipation of the US sanctions.

News article:
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global Benchmark Brent crude jumped more than 3 percent on Monday to a four-year high above $80 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for action to raise global supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC states, including top producer Russia, gathered in Algiers on Sunday for a meeting that ended with no formal recommendation for any additional supply boost to counter falling supply from Iran. “The market’s still being driven by concerns about Iranian and Venezuelan supply,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford. “The failure of the producers to address that adequately this weekend is creating a buying opportunity.” Brent crude LCOc1 settled up $2.40 or 3.1 percent at $81.20 a barrel, after touching an intraday high of $81.39, the highest since November, 2014. U.S. light crude CLc1 settled up $1.30, or 1.8 percent, higher at $72.08. (U.S. oil drilling, production & storage levels: tmsnrt.rs/2OKP4nJ) OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group, Russia, on Sunday effectively rebuffed Trump’s demand for moves to cool the market. “I do not influence prices,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters on Sunday. Trump said last week that OPEC “must get prices down now!”, but Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Monday OPEC had not responded positively to Trump’s demands. “It is now increasingly evident, that in the face of producers reluctant to raise output, the market will be confronted with supply gaps in the next three-six months that it will need to resolve through higher oil prices,” BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian told Reuters Global Oil Forum. Commodity traders Trafigura and Mercuria said Brent could rise to $90 per barrel by Christmas and pass $100 in early 2019, as markets tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran are fully implemented from November. JPMorgan said U.S. sanctions on Iran could lead to a loss of 1.5 million barrels per day, while Mercuria warned that as much as 2 million bpd could be knocked out of the market. Concerns about production shortfalls are encouraging traders to place more long bets, boosting Brent prices, said Brian LaRose, a technical analyst at United-ICAP. “This is the seventh time over the last couple of months that we have challenged the highs,” he said, referring to individual monthly contracts, rather than a continuation contract. If Brent prices climb past $82 a barrel, he said prices up to $90 would be a near-term possibility. Some have said softening demand from trade tensions between the U.S. and China to offset loss of Iranian supply, but Tradition’s McGillian said that unless trade tensions show signs of eroding Chinese demand, oil prices will surge further. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA are at their lowest since early 2015. While U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA is near a record high of 11 million bpd, subdued U.S. drilling points toward a slowdown in output.

TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday called on its OPEC partners not to bow to "threats" from US President Donald Trump, as the oil cartel prepared to meet to discuss output levels. "I hope the outcome of this meeting will not be affected by President Trump´s threats," Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told SHANA, his ministry's news agency. Ahead of Sunday's meeting in Algiers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Trump tweeted that "the OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!" by raising output. Middle East states "would not be safe for very long" without the United States, the president also wrote Thursday. Zanganeh fired back, saying the claim that "America safeguards the security and survival of producing countries" was the "biggest insult to American allies in the region". "OPEC is an organisation independent of America and will hopefully stay so," he said.

LONDON: Saudi Arabia and Russia won´t add significantly more oil to the market because of a lack of capacity, a top Iranian official said on Monday, predicting prices will probably rise further. On Sunday, ministers and officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other allies ruled out an immediate oil-output boost, in effect rebuffing U.S. President Donald Trump´s calls for action. The move helped push crude prices to a four-year high near $81 a barrel on Monday. Also underpinning the market is the prospect of lower exports from Iran, OPEC´s third-largest producer, due to U.S. sanctions. Iran´s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said in comments to Reuters that Saudi Arabia and Russia were unable and unwilling to add more production at short notice. "They are doing little and late, to get prices higher," he said. "They got prices higher and they are going to get them higher still. There is no spare capacity. They cannot deliver the extra capacity that they claim." Saudi Arabia, OPEC´s biggest producer, says it can add an extra 1.5 million barrels per day - about 1.5 percent of world demand - to the market. But Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday such a move was not needed at the moment. Sunday´s meeting appeared to leave unresolved a disagreement which flared up in June between Saudi Arabia and Iran over whether OPEC members are allowed to pump more oil to make up shortfalls elsewhere. Under pressure from Trump, OPEC and allies agreed in June to boost production, after months of undersupply by OPEC countries including Venezuela and Angola and the prospect of the Iran sanctions. Saudi Arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more, such as itself, to go ahead and do so, to make up for shortfalls. Iran disagreed and Kazempour maintained that position on Monday. "Extra production beyond OPEC quotas requires permission of the conference," he said. "Assignment of OPEC share to non-OPEC requires conference approval." The next meeting of the conference - the full group of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers, is not until December. The OPEC governor is typically the second most senior post in a country´s OPEC delegation after the oil minister. Iran´s minister, Bijan Zanganeh, was quoted on Monday as saying the meeting did not give a positive response to Trump.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Iran will tighten global oil supplies sharply until the end of the year, but a threat to world demand looms in 2019 from the U.S.-China trade war, the head of BP’s oil trading in Asia said. FILE PHOTO: A worker at an oil field owned by Bashneft, Bashkortostan, Russia, January 28, 2015. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo “We’re moving into the tightest part of 2018 ... the re-imposition of Iran sanctions is the main factor as the market will tighten substantially from now to year-end,” Janet Kong, chief executive of Integrated Supply and Trading Eastern Hemisphere at BP told Reuters. Saudi Arabia and Russia won’t add significantly more oil to the market because of a lack of capacity, a top Iranian official said on Monday, predicting prices will probably rise further. Sanctions on Venezuela are also exacerbating a production decline there, while outages in Nigeria and Libya have further crimped supplies, Kong said, with Brent supported at above $80 a barrel. “The market fundamentals in the short term look very bullish and positive due to supply shocks, but over time, when supply catches up and the shock to demand becomes more evident, the market will go through another round of re-balancing next year,” she said. The world’s two largest economies, China and the United States, have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports in an escalating trade war that has rattled global markets and raised concerns of a slowdown in world economies and commodities demand next year. “Going into 2019, I worry about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, manifesting itself slowly,” Kong said. “The trade war impact has not really shown up in the data anywhere, but it will show up gradually over time. So the supply shock is very sharp and prompt, while the impact from trade war is boiling over slowly.” Analysts and the International Monetary Fund have forecast a 0.5 percent to 1 percent drop in world gross domestic product growth next year, she said. The International Energy Agency said in its monthly oil report that global oil demand is set to to top 100 million bpd next year, although emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent this figure. “The Trump administration wants intellectual property protection ... reducing subsidies to Chinese SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and open market access by all businesses which are difficult, in my view, for the Chinese government to agree to,” Kong said. “So it’s very likely this war will drag on for a long time.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Wednesday after U.S. data showed a surprise build in domestic crude inventories, but an impending drop in Iranian exports kept Brent futures above $80 a barrel and on track for a fifth straight quarterly gain. A pumpjack brings oil to the surface in the Monterey Shale, California, U.S., April 29, 2013. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Global benchmark Brent fell 53 cents to settle at $81.34 a barrel. On Tuesday, Brent rose as high as $82.55, the highest since November 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 71 cents to settle at $71.57 a barrel. U.S. crude inventories rose 1.9 million barrels in the week to Sept. 21, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. Analysts had expected a decrease of 1.3 million barrels. Refinery crude runs fell by 901,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. “We are reluctant to read much into today’s price action or the unexpected crude build per the EIA. The complex had a strong upside run and is entitled to a correction,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Investors kept a close eye on impending U.S. sanctions affecting Iran’s petroleum sector, due to come into force in November. The oil market is bracing for a hit to global supplies from the sanctions. Brent remains on course for its fifth consecutive quarterly increase, the longest stretch since early 2007 when a six-quarter run led to a record-high price of $147.50 a barrel. Several big buyers, such as a number of Indian refiners, have signaled they will wind down purchases of Iranian crude but the impact on global markets is not yet clear. U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to reassure consumers and investors that enough supply will remain in the oil market and have pushed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to raise output. In a Tuesday speech at the United Nations, Trump reiterated calls on OPEC to pump more oil, accused Iran of sowing chaos and promised further sanctions on the country. The so-called “OPEC+” group, which includes non-OPEC members such as Russia, met over the weekend but decided not to boost output. Commerzbank said in a note that “the latest rise in oil prices is due primarily to Trump himself. ... he has focused the market’s attention on the Iran sanctions again, even though the market is adequately supplied at present thanks to the increase in OPEC and Russian production.” A Nigerian oil industry official said OPEC will act to balance the market after oil prices hit a four-year high, but its options may be limited by available spare capacity.

News article:
London - Asharq Al-Awsat US data showed a build in domestic crude inventories, but an impending drop in Iranian exports kept Brent futures above $80 a barrel and on track for a fifth straight quarterly gain, as oil prices eased on Wednesday. Speaking on the sidelines of United Nations meetings in New York, US special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook announced his country will make sure the oil market is well supplied before it reimposes oil sanctions against Iran on November 4. “We will ensure prior to the re-imposition of our sanctions that we have a well-supplied oil market,” Hook told a news conference. US is encouraging Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase supply in order to push prices down, meanwhile, a Nigerian oil industry official said on Wednesday that OPEC will act to balance the market after oil prices hit their highest in four years, but its options may be limited by available spare capacity. “It’s obvious that if you have high prices it’ll affect demand, so you have to do some market balance,” Malam Mele Kyari, head of crude oil marketing at Nigeria’s state oil firm NNPC and also the country’s OPEC representative, told Reuters. Kyari indicated that OPEC will do everything to stabilize and balance the market, however, there’s a limit to what they can do. “You must have the spare capacity,” asserted Kyari. Several big buyers, such as a number of Indian refiners, have signaled they will wind down purchases of Iranian crude but the impact on global markets is not yet clear. The US will impose new sanctions on Iran in November and the expected loss in Iranian supplies is the main reason behind increased prices recently. OPEC and its independent producers, including Russia, met earlier this week but decided not to boost output. Meanwhile, Brent remains on course for its fifth consecutive quarterly increase, the longest stretch since early 2007 when a six-quarter run led to a record-high price of $147.50 a barrel. Unlike most investments banks, Goldman Sachs reiterated its view that "Brent prices will stabilize back in their $70-80/bbl range into year-end." Goldman Sachs stated that the lack of new production growth guidance by OPEC does not reflect a desire to let prices appreciate meaningfully further, but rather the historical pattern of OPEC responding to rather than front-running production losses. "We continue to expect that the decline in Iran exports will reach 1.4 million barrels per day, and while it is occurring faster than we had previously expected, we continue to expect it to remain offset by a faster ramp-up in production from other producers,” added Goldman in its report. US officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to reassure consumers and investors that enough supply will remain in the oil market and have pushed OPEC to raise output. In a Tuesday speech at the United Nations, Trump reiterated calls on OPEC to pump more oil, accused Iran of sowing chaos and promised further sanctions on the country. On the supply front, American Petroleum Institute figures showed that US crude inventories rose by 2.9-million barrels in the week to September 21 to 400-million, compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 1.3-million barrels.

The chart shows that Iranian oil exports have fallen from 2.5 million barrels per day in May 2018 to about 0.5 million barrels per day in April 2019. The decline in exports is due to US sanctions on Iran, which have made it difficult for Iran to sell its oil to other countries.

News article:
Crude prices will likely reach $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014, and OPEC has no leverage to prevent such a scenario, an analyst has warned. “Nobody wants to get caught short, full in the knowledge that more Iranian barrels are poised to be removed from the market,” Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note published on Monday, as quoted by CNBC. On Monday, Brent crude surged above $83 per barrel as Iran continues losing its crude exports ahead of US sanctions which come into force in November. “Against this backdrop of dwindling Iranian oil supplies, the focus will turn to meek levels of global, or more accurately, Saudi spare capacity,” Brennock said. Saudi Arabia has been unable to offset the lost Iranian crude exports. And “this essentially leaves the world’s only swing producer powerless to prevent a supply shock and subsequent price spike in the final quarter of this year,” he added. Iran could lose up to 1.5 million barrels per day when US sanctions kick in early November. In May, Iran sold 2.71 million bpd abroad, nearly three percent of daily global oil consumption. The US is rapidly increasing its production. In September, it hit a record 11.1 million bpd, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). That is an increase of almost a third since 2016. However, the increase in US production is not enough to offset the loss of Iranian output.

Crude prices will likely reach $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014, and OPEC has no leverage to prevent such a scenario, an analyst has warned. “Nobody wants to get caught short, full in the knowledge that more Iranian barrels are poised to be removed from the market,” Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note published on Monday, as quoted by CNBC. On Monday, Brent crude surged above $83 per barrel as Iran continues losing its crude exports ahead of US sanctions which come into force in November. “Against this backdrop of dwindling Iranian oil supplies, the focus will turn to meek levels of global, or more accurately, Saudi spare capacity,” Brennock said. Saudi Arabia has been unable to offset the lost Iranian crude exports. And “this essentially leaves the world’s only swing producer powerless to prevent a supply shock and subsequent price spike in the final quarter of this year,” he added. Iran could lose up to 1.5 million barrels per day when US sanctions kick in early November. In May, Iran sold 2.71 million bpd abroad, nearly three percent of daily global oil consumption. The US is rapidly increasing its production. In September, it hit a record 11.1 million bpd, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). That is an increase of almost a third since 2016. However, the increase in US production is not enough to offset the loss of Iranian output.

News article:
(Adds more quotes, background) LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Iran accused Saudi Arabia and Russia on Wednesday of breaking OPEC's agreement on output cuts by producing more crude, adding that the two countries would not be able to produce enough oil to make up for a reduction in Iranian exports. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the United States before a meeting in Algiers with other producers. U.S. sanctions on Iran's petroleum sector are set to take effect next month after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May. Washington wants to cut Iran's oil exports to zero by November, and is encouraging producers such as Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia to pump more to meet the shortfall. "If Iran is under sanctions, the price of oil would rise and Russia and Saudi Arabia cannot do anything to supply additional oil to the market," Iran's OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili was quoted as saying by SHANA, the oil ministry's news agency. Kazempour Ardebili, Iran's representative on OPEC's board of governors, said that U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil were "impossible", and called on Trump to return to the nuclear deal with Tehran. "Mr Trump is very angry with some countries for not being able to replace the Iranian oil and has expressed this anger in his remarks to the Saudi king and to OPEC for not increasing output," he said. "If we look at the two countries' rise of production in comparison to their commitments in the Declaration of Cooperation, we see Saudi Arabia and Russia have had respectively a 346,000 and 250,000 BPD output rise, and this production rise is a violation to the (OPEC) agreement on output cut," Kazempour Ardebili said. Since the meeting in Algiers, Reuters has reported that Riyadh planned to lift output by some 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd from September to help fill the gap left by lower Iranian output due to the sanctions. Russian output rose 150,000 bpd in September. Trump made an undiplomatic remark about close ally Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, saying he warned Saudi Arabia's King Salman he would not last in power "for two weeks" without the backing of the U.S. military.

News article:
As oil prices have risen under White House pressure on foreign nations to curb Iran's oil exports, Russia and Saudi Arabia have "quietly" responded by increasing production to keep prices low. The world's top two oil producers struck a deal to raise output starting last month and continuing through December, Reuters reported Thursday. The news comes as the benchmark Brent crude price increased to $85 per barrel, up 27 percent over the same time last year. With the implementation of U.S. sanctions in August and a second round taking effect next month, analysts have raised concerns that prices could rise even further without other producers stepping in to fill the gap. According to a Reuters source, energy ministers from Riyadh and Moscow "agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on [President Donald] Trump's order to pump more." Another source confirmed that the Saudi minister told the U.S. the kingdom would increase supply if customers request more. Last month, Russia already broke its post-Soviet era record for oil output, according to Bloomberg. The country increased its production by nearly 150,000 barrels per day over the previous month, reaching nearly 11.3 million barrels of oil and condensate a day. "I would expect Russia's oil production will hover at around 11.4 million to 11.6 million bpd until the end of 2018 and may increase further to 11.8 million bpd later on in 2019," a source from a major Russian oil company told Reuters. Since summer, Trump has been pushing allies and trading partners to cut imports of Iranian oil, while also urging OPEC members to fill the gap. "Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!" Trump tweeted in June, ahead of sanctions taking effect. Last month, the president reiterated his calls, tweeting "the Opec monopoly must get prices down now!" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih confirmed publicly last month that the kingdom's production was "below 10 million barrels a day for the first five months of the year; in October we're producing about 10.7 million," according to Radio Free Europe. He said that he expected supplies in November to be even higher, and pointed out that the United Arab Emirates and Iraq had also increased production. Tehran has responded with criticism, arguing that Moscow and Riyadh have broken their agreements with OPEC. It also has insisted that the increase won't be enough to make up for the deficit of removing Iranian oil from the international market. The Islamic Republic produces around 3.8 million barrels per day on average. As of now, oil prices are the highest they've been in nearly four years. Analysts believe the prices will continue to increase before lowering. "Prices will probably rise further into overshoot territory. Once we see $90, I would expect decisive supply reaction," Commerzbank strategist Carsten Fritsch told Reuters. "Major economies won't let oil prices rise to triple digits and harm economic growth."

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, stressed that the Kingdom is fulfilling promises to make up for Iranian crude supplies lost to American sanctions. “The request that America made to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries is to be sure that if there is any loss of supply from Iran, that we will supply that. And that happened,” he told Bloomberg in an interview published on Friday. The action appears lost on US President Donald Trump, who continues to attack the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for letting prices rally while he seeks to choke off supplies from Iran, reported Bloomberg. On Wednesday the State Department urged OPEC to tap its reserve supplies. A coalition of producers from OPEC and beyond has recently boosted output by 1.5 million barrels a day, double the 700,000-barrel decline suffered so far by Iran, according to Prince Mohammed. “We export as much as two barrels for any barrel that disappeared from Iran recently,” he stressed. “So, we did our job and more.” Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 10.7 million barrels a day -- close to a record -- and can add a further 1.3 million “if the market needs that,” he added. Prince Mohammed said that the kingdom could push capacity beyond 12 million barrels a day with additional investment, and that extra supplies are also available from Saudi Arabia’s allies. The so-called OPEC+ coalition spans other Gulf producers like the United Arab Emirates, as well as countries outside OPEC such as Russia. Trump is reimposing sanctions on Iran after quitting an agreement on the country’s nuclear program, and the measures will take full effect in November. While many -- including Russian President Vladimir Putin -- have blamed Trump’s actions for oil’s rally, the price is actually being driven by losses in other countries, according to Prince Mohammed. “The higher price that we have in the last month, it’s not because of Iran,” he said. “It’s mostly because of things happening in Canada and Mexico, Libya, Venezuela and other countries.”

News article:
Saudi Arabia’s crown prince in an interview with Bloomberg News is insisting that the kingdom is fulfilling promises to the United States to make up a shortfall in world oil supplies resulting from the loss of Iranian production under U.S. sanctions. "The request that America made to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries is to be sure that if there is any loss of supply from Iran, that we will supply that," Muhammad Bin Salman, heir to the Saudi throne, told Bloomberg in an interview published on October 5. "And that happened." Salman said a coalition of producers from OPEC has recently boosted output by 1.5 million barrels a day, which is double the 700,000-barrel decline in output experienced so far by Iran under the threat of U.S. sanctions on its oil sector, which are due to take effect on November 5. "We export as much as two barrels for any barrel that disappeared from Iran recently," the prince said. "So we did our job and more." Yet that hasn't stopped U.S. President Donald Trump from continuing to blame the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a sharp rise in prices this year, even as his administration vows to choke off all of Iran's oil exports. The increased production also failed this week to prevent premium crude prices from hitting a four-year high above $86 a barrel in London trading. Oil traders say they are concerned that the kingdom isn’t ramping up output quickly enough, and that it may not have enough capacity to fully cover Iran’s losses. 'Maxed Out' Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 10.7 million barrels a day -- close to a record -- and can add a further 1.3 million "if the market needs that," Salman told Bloomberg. However, some analysts doubt that 12 million barrels a day can be reached quickly, or maintained for an extended period. "Near-term spare capacity is effectively maxed out," said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. The Saudi prince claimed in the Bloomberg interview that the kingdom could push its capacity beyond 12 million barrels a day with additional investment, and that extra supplies are also available from its allies in the Persian Gulf region. The so-called OPEC+ coalition includes other Gulf producers like the United Arab Emirates, as well as countries outside OPEC such as Russia. However, Russia, which rivals the Saudis as a top global producer, does not support the U.S. sanctions against Iran and has vowed to help Iran get around them and keep exporting oil. Trump announced he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran in May after walking away from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. But Russia, China, and the three European powers that also signed the deal have continued to honor it and are working with Iran on ways to evade the U.S. sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin, like Iran, has blamed Trump’s abandonment of the nuclear deal for the sharp rise in oil prices this year. The Saudis, by contrast, are bitter rivals with Iran in the Middle Eastern region and applauded Trump's decision to quit the nuclear deal. Trump at the time said he expected the Saudis and other Gulf allies to make up the shortfall in Iranian production that would result from the sanctions. Iran's oil output reached a peak of about 4 million barrels a day after global sanctions were lifted in 2016 in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities under the nuclear deal. But its output has declined sharply in recent months under the threat of U.S. sanctions. The Saudi prince contended in the Bloomberg interview that the most recent sharp rise in prices to over $80 a barrel is actually being driven by output losses in other countries, not Iran. "The higher price that we have in the last month, it’s not because of Iran," he said. "It’s mostly because of things happening in Canada and Mexico, Libya, Venezuela, and other countries." On a related matter, Reuters reported on October 5 that Indian crude importers intend to keep buying oil from Iran in November after U.S. sanctions go into effect and are seeking a waiver from the sanctions from Washington.

News article:
One of Theresa May’s few policy announcements at the Tory party conference was a pledge to keep the freeze on petrol duty. There had been speculation that, after eight years on hold, the Treasury was anxious to raise extra duties to help find £20bn for the NHS. In effect President Trump made that impossible. An unholy alliance between Saudi Arabia and Russia to limit production of crude oil has meant a surging crude oil price, which determines the cost of petrol at the pumps. The reason for the rise, which lifted crude oil above $80 a barrel, was Trump’s decision to side with Benjamin Netanyahu and tear up the Iranian nuclear agreement. But Trump doesn’t do things by halves. He also decided to reimpose sanctions on Tehran in spite of a vote in the United Nations saying such action was illegal. The consequence is the oil price has begun to climb again, with many countries fearful of attracting the Trump ire by doing business with Iran. The price of petrol and diesel at the pumps has jumped by 10 pence or so since May and many experts believe the wholesale price for oil could rise from the current $80 to $100 a barrel. Those who opposed the Iran deal by President Obama to lift sanctions in response to inspection of its nuclear facilities and a halt in further production of the isotopes critical to nuclear weapon production have welcomed Trump’s actions. But as veteran journalist Bob Woodward revealed in his new book Fear: Trump in the White House, the administration has more than enough reasons to want to tame Iran. Indeed, for supporters of Israel, paying more for petrol may be a small price. According to Woodward, former army colonel Derek Harvey is a “fact driven” intelligence officer who serves as Middle East director on Trump’s National Security Council. Early in the Trump presidency, he warned Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner (assigned a Middle East peace portfolio) and others in the administration that Hezbollah, with more than 48,000 full-time military operatives in the Lebanon, was an existential threat to Israel. Hezbollah, financed by Iran, had extended its reach and now comprised 8,000 regional commando forces in Syria, Lebanon and across the region. It also had units operating globally from Colombia in South America to Mozambique and Kenya. Iran was paying Hezbollah bills at a staggering cost of $1bn year. Most disturbing of all, Hezbollah has under its command some 150,000 rockets. In the 2006 Lebanon war, it had access to just 4,500. In addition to direct subvention from Iran, Hezbollah was making money from money laundering, human trafficking and the opium trade. With the backing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, Hezbollah was Israel’s most serious enemy and had enough rockets to pummel the Jewish state’s air bases and overwhelm the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow defences. The forensic detail of the Harvey briefing goes a long way to explaining much of America’s policy toward the Middle East. This includes reaching out to Saudi Arabia and Israel, as an alliance against jihadi extremism, across the region, and the aerial campaign supported by the UK against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Most importantly, it convinced Trump and his advisers the moderate leadership of President Hassan Rouhani in Iran was a chimera and with the export of terror nothing had changed. The restoration and toughening of sanctions on Iran already is causing serious difficulties by sending the currency, the rial, plunging on foreign exchanges, blocking off hard currency flows and causing internal hardship. Next time members of the British Jewish community fill their cars and complain about the price of fuel, they can at least reflect there are good, strategic reasons behind the cost.

Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Monday dismissed as “nonsense” claims by the Saudi crown prince that Saudi Arabia can replace sanctions-hit Iranian oil in the market. Mohammed bin Salman’s remarks “can only satisfy” US President Donald Trump, Zanganeh was quoted as saying on his ministry’s website. “No one else will believe him. Iran’s oil cannot be replaced by Saudi Arabia,” the minister added. Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg on Friday the kingdom had met its promise to Washington to make up for Iranian oil supplies lost through US sanctions. Additional US sanctions, on Iran’s oil and banking industries, will be imposed in November. Zanganeh said such remarks had no “real impact on the market” but were part of a psychological war against Iran, Reuters reports. “Any country that makes such claims… just wants to display its support to the US sanctions against Iran,” Zanganeh said.

News article:
* Hopes slim for oil flows after difficult talks * Tensions over Qatar, Iran add to difficulties * U.S. asks Saudi to raise output, wants lower oil price * Cost of maintaining Neutral Zone fields rises each year DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will struggle to resume oil production from jointly operated fields any time soon due to operational differences and souring political ties between the previously close Gulf OPEC allies, sources familiar with the matter said. The two countries halted output from the jointly run oilfields - Khafji and Wafra - in the so-called Neutral Zone more than three years ago, cutting some 500,000 barrels per day or 0.5 percent of global oil supply. As oil prices rose to a four-year high above $85 per barrel this year, Washington has been pressing its top Gulf ally Riyadh to reduce crude prices by increasing production. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Kuwait last month to discuss a resumption of oil output from the zone. But the sources, who asked not to be identified as they are prohibited from discussing the issue publicly, said the talks failed to move the two countries closer to a deal as Kuwait resisted Riyadh’s push for greater control of the fields. “It did not go well because Kuwaiti sovereignty is non-negotiable,” one source told Reuters. Riyadh does not want Kuwaiti laws to apply to U.S. oil major Chevron, which operates the Wafra onshore field on behalf of the Saudi government, the source added. Another source said Saudi Arabia wanted a bigger say and more control in running oil operations in the zone. Prince Mohammed met Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and Crown Prince Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah but the visit was cut short from the originally planned two days to just a few hours on the night of Sept. 30, the sources said. POLITICAL TENSIONS Adding to the political friction were tensions between the two countries over the embargo of neighbouring Qatar and diverging views on relations with Saudi Arabia’s arch-foe Iran, the sources said. Kuwait is trying to mediate the embargo, which is being led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Doha last year, accusing it of financing terrorism. Qatar rejects the charges. Kuwait has sought to maintain neutrality, although the Emir’s efforts to mediate the rift have had little success so far. Kuwait, which has a sizeable Shi’ite Muslim minority, has also maintained dialogue with Shi’ite Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran back opposing sides in civil wars in Syria and Yemen. In a move that may further complicate relations with Riyadh, Kuwait this month signed a defence cooperation plan with Turkey in what it said was meant to strengthen bilateral ties. Turkey has sided with Qatar in the Gulf row and its relations with Riyadh have been strained due to Ankara’s close ties with Iran. “The (regional) situation is not stable, so every country should think how to protect itself,” Saleh Ashour, a member of the Kuwaiti parliament, told Reuters. COSTLY IDLE WELLS Oil output in the Neutral Zone, which dates back to 1920s treaties establishing regional borders, is divided equally between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The Wafra field is operated by state-run Kuwait Gulf Oil Co and Chevron on behalf of Saudi Arabia. The Khafji field is operated by state oil giant Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Gulf Oil. Tensions have been simmering since the last decade, when Kuwait was angered by a Saudi decision to prolong Chevron’s Wafra concession until 2039 without consulting Kuwait. In 2014, Saudi Arabia closed Khafji, citing environmental issues. In 2015, Chevron shut Wafra after failing to agree operating rights with Kuwait. Shutting output is expensive because it requires investments of tens of millions of dollars per year for maintenance, sources familiar with field operations said. The Neutral Zone “is the single biggest asset in the world which was deliberately stopped and hasn’t been producing for three years”, one of the sources said. “The more the restart is postponed the more it will cost to maintain it. And the more problematic it might be to restart the fields quickly and fully,” he added. Industry sources from both countries say that though Khafji and Wafra are not linked geographically, an agreement to bring one field back online would be tied to the other.

News article:
EU officials have expressed optimism that the new framework will allow firms to keep doing business with Iran. Businesses have already pulled out and the Iranian rial has plummeted as the threat of US sanctions looms. The remaining signatories of the Iran nuclear deal announced on Monday that they would establish a channel to facilitate payments for Iran's exports, including oil, as well as its imports. The decision was reached after high-level closed-door talks at the UN in New York. "Mindful of the urgency and the need for tangible results, the participants welcomed practical proposals to maintain and develop payment channels, notably the initiative to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate payments related to Iran's exports, including oil," Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the EU announced in a joint statement. The members' stated intent is "to protect the freedom of their economic operators to pursue legitimate business with Iran." The SPV could breathe life into the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal, and was sought by Tehran in order to counter the reimposition of sanctions triggered by the US's exit from the deal. The European Union has struggled to devise a workable legal framework to shield its companies from the effects of US sanctions, which are set to come into effect in November, and has tried to deter firms from pulling out of Iran. Nonetheless, a number of business — including the French energy giant Total, carmakers Peugeot and Renault, and Germany's Siemens and Daimler — have already suspended operations in Iran. The impending sanctions have also had a debilitating effect on Iran's economy, helping trigger a slide in Iran's currency. The rial has lost about two-thirds of its value this year, hitting a record low against the US dollar this month.

EU Sets Up Payment System with Iran to Maintain Trade By VOA News September 25, 2018 The five remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal have agreed to establish a special payment system to allow companies to continue doing business with the regime, bypassing new sanctions imposed by the United States. Envoys from Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran issued a statement late Monday from the United Nations announcing the creation of a "Special Purpose Vehicle" that will be established in the European Union. The parties said the new mechanism was created to facilitate payments related to Iranian exports, including oil. Federica Mogherini, EU's foreign policy chief, told reporters after the deal was announced that the SPV gives EU member states "a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran...and allow European companies to continue to trade with Iran in accordance to European Union law and could be open to other partners in the world." Mogherini said the financial agreement is also aimed at preserving the agreement reached in 2015 with Iran to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for relief from strict economic sanctions. The deal was reached under then-President Barack Obama, but Obama's successor, Donald Trump, pulled out of the accord in May of this year, saying it didn't address Tehran's ballistic missile program or its influence in the Middle East.

Iran’s coverage: Mogherini eyes Iran SPV for trade ‘before November’ Daily look at Iran’s late-breaking news and upcoming events: EU’s Mogherini eyes Iran SPV for trade ‘before November’ The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said on Wednesday a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under consideration to facilitate trade with Iran could be in place “before November.” Iran determined to cooperate with UN in all fields President of the Islamic Republic of Iran underscored the need for the global community to work hard in protecting the JCPOA as an important international agreement and complying with Resolution 2231 of UNSC. President Rouhani stressed: “Today, the greatest responsibility of Iranian and Venezuelan officials is to work harder to develop relations and cooperation to serve the interests of the people and strengthen economies of the two countries”. U.S.’ Mattis says not seen signs Iran intends to block Strait of Hormuz U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that he had not seen indications that Iran is intending to block the Strait of Hormuz. Iran together with other parties to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) are resolved to safeguard the deal, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has lashed out at Western countries for adopting a double-standard policy toward the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), reminding them of their support for slain Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in his war on Iran in the 1980s. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has blasted the United States for abusing the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to further undermine the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, an accord that US President Donald Trump quit in May. India’s Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj said her country sees Iran as a good neighbor and friend. Top diplomats of Iran, Russia and Turkey – which serve as guarantors of the Syria peace process – have sat down for talks in New York on the latest developments in the country’s Idlib Province, amid efforts to peacefully rid the area of terrorists. Iran’s top security official warns Israel against keeping up its strikes on positions of the Syrian army and its allies in support of terror groups, saying the regime will be given a firm response if it fails to stop such acts of aggression.

Iran’s top security official warns Israel against keeping up its strikes on positions of the Syrian army and its allies in support of terror groups, saying the regime will be given a firm response if it fails to stop such acts of aggression.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani praised Europe on Wednesday for taking a “big step” to maintain business with Tehran after the United States’ withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal and its re-imposition of sanctions on Iran. “To maintain financial and monetary relations in Iran, Europe has formed a special body… Europe has taken a big step,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. Rouhani reportedly said that US President Donald Trump was mounting pressure on Tehran for “domestic political gains.” The nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers is aimed at stalling Iran’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting some sanctions.

(Adds quotes, background) LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani praised Europe on Wednesday for taking a "big step" to maintain business with Tehran after the United States' unilateral withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal and re-imposition of new sanctions on the Islamic Republic. U.S. President Donald Trump in May withdrew from Iran's nuclear agreement with world powers which is aimed at stalling Tehran's nuclear capabilities in return for lifting some sanctions, and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions suspended under the deal. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the accord. The European Union announced last week a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under consideration to facilitate trade with Iran could be in place before November. "To maintain financial and monetary relations in Iran, Europe has formed a special body... Europe has taken a big step," Rouhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.

News article:
LONDON: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani praised Europe on Wednesday for taking a "big step" toward maintaining business with Iran after the unilateral US withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal and re-imposition of new sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also told the BBC on Wednesday that support from Europe to preserve economic ties with the Islamic Republic in the face of US pressure was "better than expected". In May, US President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers which aims at stalling Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting some sanctions, and ordered the re-imposition of US sanctions suspended under the deal. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the accord. The European Union announced last week a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under consideration to facilitate trade with Iran could be in place before November. "To maintain financial and monetary relations in Iran, Europe has formed a special body... Europe has taken a big step," Rouhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. Rouhani, a pragmatist who engineered the nuclear accord and a short-lived period of detente between Tehran and Washington, said the Trump administration was "extremely angry" with Europe´s decision. European diplomats have described the SPV proposal as a means to create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Monday that the EU´s proposed mechanism to pay Tehran the revenues from oil sales was not "an oil for food programme". The UN Security Council started the Oil-for-Food Programme in 1996 to allow Iraq to sell enough crude to pay for food and other necessities for its population, which was suffering under strict UN sanctions imposed after the first Gulf War. The World Court ordered the United States on Wednesday to ensure that sanctions against Iran do not impact humanitarian aid or civil aviation safety.

Later a spokesperson for the German finance ministry also confirmed the European plan to legislate a special purpose financial vehicle, according to German news outlet Spiegel. The EU special purpose financial vehicle will keep the cash inside the economic bloc and away from US-controlled global money-transfer networks, including SWIFT, while also avoiding the use of any bank afraid of being locked out of doing business with US financial markets. READ MORE: US Lawmakers Urge Treasury Dept. to Cut Off Iran From SWIFT — Letter "The German government is working together with the EEAS and European Commission, as well as France and the United Kingdom, on maintaining financial payment channels with Iran," the spokesperson noted, adding, "The negotiations on this are intensive and ongoing. There are different models under consideration," cited by Politico. Russia Ready to Join Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, commenting on the recent statements, has expressed Moscow’s readiness to cooperate within some kind of euro-SWIFT system to process operations among European banks and financial institutions, including oil and other resources payments. «We are ready to join such offers. That’s why it seems to me that this would be a way-out and response to these restrictions the US is imposing on companies and financial institutions, using dollars for settlements,” he told the Russian broadcaster Rossiya 24. The Brussels-based international interbank payment system SWIFT, created in the 70s, is now used by nearly 11,000 organizations in more than 200 countries. Criticized for sharing some information with the US government following the 9/11 attacks, the system in 2014 stated that it’s been put under pressure by some countries, insisting on its joining the sanctions against Russia. In the wake of Western sanctions over the Ukrainian crisis and threats to cut Russia off from the SWIFT in 2014, the Russian Central Bank created its own network, known as the System for the Transfer of Financial Messages, to be activated in the event that Russia's access to SWIFT is cut off. Earlier this year, a source told Russian media that Russia’s SWIFT alternative would also be upgraded to use blockchain technology by 2019.

Europe considers to facilitate financial transactions with Iran IRNA – European Union Foreign Affairs and Security Affairs Commissioner Federica Mogherini, says Europe has considered important solutions to facilitate bank and monetary transactions during the US sanctions against Iran, European Council on Foreign Relations website wrote. The website said, ‘As part of the effort to salvage the Iran nuclear deal, European governments have vowed to maintain their economic ties – not least their banking connections – with Iran. As of November 4, the US sanctions targeting Iran’s banks will make it extremely difficult for the European companies to engage in transactions with firms in the country. Many of the pathways to reduce the secondary impact of the US secondary sanctions on the European financial sector present significant technical and political challenges, however, Europe is determined to take preventive measures to enable European banks to operate with Iran.’ One of these is the creation of a legal entity to accomplish certain tasks. Establishing this mechanism is to facilitate payments to Iran. The special mechanism will allow European companies to continue their work with Iran in accordance with European laws. Europe wants to show its ability to fulfill its obligations, with the initiative of a special mechanism. The United States reacted to this mechanism and declared that we will not allow Europe or others to oppose the US sanctions. Although the European Union has shown its determination to support the continuation of cooperation with Iran, the special mechanism will be one of the important steps, but there are significant challenges to this framework of cooperation. If the United States imposes a new law and boycotts those involved in this plan, then not only efforts to circumvent the sanctions be disrupted in this way, but in some cases like medicines and foodstuffs that are exempted from sanctions, active people will also be included in the US sanctions. Hence, there are some doubts still about the effectiveness of the mechanism. The unilateral withdrawal of the United States from Iran’s nuclear deal and the Group 5+1, is contrary to the requirements of countries to adhere to international agreements. Therefore, the Europeans need to adhere to commitment to continue to cooperate with Tehran, in contrast to Trump’s decision to withdraw and impose sanctions on Iran. They have announced that they will adhere to with JCPOA and support the activities of their companies in Iran. The European Union will also provide a package of support for the activities of its companies in Iran.

Tehran, Iran, Oct. 19 Trend: European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini said the block has decided to put its plan aimed at creating a payment channel to preserve business with Iran and circumvent new US sanctions in place. “This is something that we presented during the [United Nations] General Assembly ministerial week in New York. The Member States of the European Union have decided to put this system in place, so they are now working on the concrete establishment of this [payment channel]. I am confident that they will continue this work in a successful manner in the coming weeks,” Mogherini said on Thursday evening, the EU official website reported on October 19. Following a ministerial meeting on September 24 in New York, the participants welcomed an EU initiative to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate payments related to Iran’s exports (including oil) and imports. “I have to say that our partners from Asia have always shown a lot of interest in working to keep the full implementation of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action); obviously for security reasons that also concern Asia and Central Asia,” she added. “But we tend to forget that Iran is not only a Middle Eastern country; it is also a country that have long borders with Afghanistan for instance, and that has many interests and links with Asia. I have always very much seen the interest and also exactly the same position that we have with our Asian partners on the need to maintain the JCPOA and on the need for Iran to stick to the full compliance to the nuclear commitments taken,” the EU foreign policy chief said. Back in May, US President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite objections from other signatories of the accord. In August, Washington re-imposed the first round of anti-Iran sanctions it had lifted under the JCPOA. A second round, forthcoming on November 4, will be targeting Iran's energy sector and financial transactions.

Open for business: Iran-EU finalizing deal to evade Trump trade sanctions Breitbart News | Simon Kent: Negotiations between Iran and the E.U. aimed at establishing a special payments channel to evade President Donald Trump’s renewed trade sanctions against Tehran are well underway, Iranian deputy Minister of Petroleum, Amir Hossein Zamaninia confirmed. In an interview with ISNA news agency released on Wednesday, Zamaninia said, “Iran and E.U. are negotiating. Expert-level negotiations between Iran and E.U. (Germany, UK and France) on establishing special payments channel are underway”. “We hope the special payments channel would be established before November 4,” he added. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the original Obama-era trade deal in May. Shortly afterwards, his administration reimposed sanctions on Iran, which left other signatories to the pact scrambling to avoid punitive measures for dealing with Tehran. Mr. Trump declared the landmark 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iran nuclear deal, had been “horrible,” leaving the Iranian government with excess cash to contribute to conflicts across the Middle East. Within days of his original announcement, he observed that even the threat of new sanctions had already worked: Donald J. Trump ✔@realDonaldTrump Iran, and it’s economy, is going very bad, and fast! I will meet, or not meet, it doesn’t matter – it is up to them! 85.9K 33.9K people are talking about this Last month E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the countries were keen to finalize the technical details to defy the U.S. “In practical terms, this will mean that E.U. member states will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran and this will allow European companies to continue to trade with Iran in accordance with European Union law and could be open to other partners in the world,” she told reporters while standing alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. She said that the remaining members of the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — would also maintain their commitments to support Iran on civilian nuclear energy. “The participants recalled that these initiatives are aimed at preserving the JCPOA, which is in the international interest,” she said. A number of business including French energy giant Total and carmakers Peugeot and Renault as well as Germany’s Siemens and Daimler have already suspended operations in Iran for fear of triggering U.S. sanctions.

A new European Union mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4, when the next phase of US sanctions hit, but will not be operational until early next year, three diplomats said. The mechanism, a so-called special purpose vehicle (SPV), is designed to circumvent the sanctions, under which Washington can cut off any bank that enables oil transactions with Iran. The SPV, which could incorporate a barter system, aims to sidestep the US financial system by using an EU intermediary to handle trade with Iran. It could ensure, for example, that Iranian oil bought by Europeans could be paid for with EU goods and services of the same value. “We’re trying to put the SPV in place before Nov. 4 and are pretty confident we can do it,” one EU diplomat said. “It won’t be operational immediately. It will take time and the time that takes will be months.” Related coverage DePaul University Student Government Denounces Campus Antisemitism The Student Government Association (SGA) of DePaul University issued a statement earlier this month denouncing antisemitism. "We as the DePaul Student... The physical location of a head office and other issues still had to be worked out, the diplomat added. A second diplomat said everything was in place to have a symbolic start date to show Tehran that the EU was meeting its promises. The bloc’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, announced the plan at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. However, a third diplomat cautioned that while things were going in the right direction, choosing a location was proving difficult given no European states had volunteered, fearing possible US reprisals. The entity would at one stage involve national central banks and there was no reason to think the Trump administration would not target them, the diplomat said. The EU, with support from China and Russia, hopes to keep Tehran in a 2015 nuclear non-proliferation deal by allowing trade to flow despite US penalties. “We need to demonstrate to the Iranians that we are working to uphold the (nuclear) agreement in the face of US sanctions, to keep them in, but also saying that we can only move so far, so fast,” a fourth diplomat said. EU diplomats said the SPV would not be enough to preserve all trade. The aim was to convince Iran to keep its commitments under its nuclear agreement with world powers, from which US President Donald Trump withdrew in May. The SPV will follow several other EU initiatives to try to shield European business with Iran from US sanctions that Trump is reimposing, as he seeks to punish Tehran for what the West says is Iran’s role in the wars in Syria and Yemen. The EU agrees with Washington that Iran has failed to contain its ballistic missile arsenal and is supporting proxies across the Middle East. But France, Britain and Germany say the 2015 nuclear accord is separate and should be upheld because it prevents Iran from developing a nuclear bomb.

Iranian MP says EU office in Tehran still viable Tasnim – An Iranian lawmaker said the European Union’s request for opening an office in Tehran could be granted if Europeans provide practical economic support for Iran in the face of US sanctions. Speaking to Tasnim, Chairman of the Iranian Parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Heshamtollah Falahatpisheh said the conditions are set for the EU to open a long-awaited office in Iran provided that they launch economic cooperation with Iran in practice. “Today, Europeans are standing with Iran in the political arena, and if such backing results in cooperation in the economic sphere as well, I believe that the conditions are set for the opening of the EU office in our country in the current situation,” he explained. Hailing Europe’s political confrontation with the US in support of Iran, Falahatpisheh said the EU office would be opened if Europe alleviates Iran’s concerns in practice. The EU proposed opening an office in Iran a couple of years ago. In 2016, Iran’s Foreign Ministry played down expectations for the establishment of the EU office in Iran, saying there was no “precise and comprehensive view” on opening such an office. In November 2017, Iranian First Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri said the establishment of an EU office in Tehran was on the agenda of the Foreign Ministry, adding that the office could facilitate the implementation of bilateral agreements.

News article:
Cairo: Dozens of Iran-allied Al Houthi militiamen were killed in fierce clashes with the Yemeni government forces near the port city of Hodeida, military sources said Thursday. The fighting south of the Red Sea city raged for more than 10 hours during which different types of weapons were used, the sources added. Warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition fighting Al Houthis also bombed militia targets. The battles were fought west of the city’s airport, which the government retook months ago as part of a major offensive aimed at expelling Al Houthis from Hodeida in west Yemen. Clashes, meanwhile, erupted between pro-government forces, known as Giants Brigades, and Al Houthi miliamen east of Hodeida. The fighting broke out after the rebels attempted to reopen a main supply route linking Hodeida to the capital Sana’a being under Al Houthis’ control, the Giants Brigades’ media centre reported. During the fight, coalition jets destroyed a number of rebel positions in the area. “Al Houthis’ defeat is inevitable and imminent,” governor of Hodeida Al Hassan Al Taher said. He urged Hodeida locals, fighting on the side of the extremists to “return to the right path” and side with the government forces. Hodeida is strategically important because of its harbour, which is a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, as most of the commercial imports and relief supplies enter through it to the country. The coalition accuses Al Houthis of taking advantage of their control of the port to obtain weapons from their Iranian patrons as well as confiscate aid intended for Yemenis in order to sustain their war efforts. In recent weeks, government forces, supported by the coalition’s air power, have intensified their bombardment of Al Houthi rebels in and around Hodeida, which has been under the militants’ control since October 2014. The coalition has sent reinforcements to Yemen’s west coast ahead of a fresh assault on Hodeida, AP reported, citing Yemeni officials. They said that the reinforcements arrived Wednesday in tanks and armoured vehicles provided by the UAE, a key member of the coalition. UN envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths has been trying to bring the country’s warring sides to negotiations in order to revive a long-stalled peace process. The British diplomat has disclosed that he plans a new round of peace talks in Europe before the end of the year. He said in remarks to Al Arabiya that the planned talks could be held in Geneva or Vienna next month. Indirect talks, brokered by the UN in Geneva, collapsed last month after rebels failed to show up.

Alistair Burt, the British foreign office minister for the Middle East, has warned that efforts to stabilise Yemen are being complicated by the deliberate inclusion of "insurgents and terrorists" on lists of public sector salaries. Efforts to pay civil servants and other government employees is a top priority for mediators and humanitarian organisations seeking to increase money in the economy and stave off food shortages and the country's descent into near starvation. Donor countries have sought to provide funds to both the Yemen government and the Houthi-run ministries in Sanaa so that public servants can draw salaries. "There is a new and added complication in speaking to the UN over the weekend – not everybody on the list is necessarily all they seem. "There are those on the lists who may be insurgents and who may be terrorists and nobody is going to hand over taxpayers money to just pay salaries to these people. This is a new complication done by those who seek to abuse these lists." Mr Burt also dismissed suggestions that a UN Security Council resolution should be passed that demands a ceasefire in the Yemen conflict. Speaking to parliament, Mr Burt said he was guided by the need to provide maximum support for the efforts of Martin Griffiths, the UN Secretary General's special envoy, who is attempting to restart negotiations with the Houthi rebels. "The best way to use the United Nations Security Council is to support the role of UN special envoy Martin Griffiths," he said. "We don't want to do anything to undercut it. "If you want to see an end to the conflict you will support Martin Griffiths and his efforts." Mr Burt said Mr Griffiths, who was meeting the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, continued to work to build confidence among the warring parties for negotiations after the failure of an attempt to kick start a new round of talks in Geneva in September. _________ Read more: Saudi ambassador to Yemen oversees fuel aid delivery to Aden Houthi rebels seize fuel and food cargo entering port city of Hodeidah Yemeni government launches cholera immunisation drive _________ Mr Burt said that the Houthi leadership had been responsible for the failure of the Geneva initiative. He said the summit between the government of Yemen and its Houthi-led rivals was "thwarted by the Houthi" who refused to go the negotiations. Attempts to blame logistic hurdles and the lack of humanitarian or medical evacuations were not credible. "If they had wanted to be there, they would have gone," the long-serving minister said. He added Houthis were responsible for abuse of humanitarian aid, systematic recruitment of child soldiers, interference with cholera fight and campaigns of targeted assassination. It was a view echoed by Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former deputy to Kofi Annan as special envoy to Syria. He said the diplomatic failure was comparable to the lack of outside pressure on the Assad regime in 2012. "Martin Griffiths is doing everything that can be done as a special envoy. He did everything right until Geneva but there was not enough pressure on the parties from the outside world. To me it echos the situation with Kofi Annan and the parties in Syria in 2012," Mr Egeland warned. "There wasn't enough pressure on these irresponsible parties." The British parliament also heard a call from Marwa Baabbad, a researcher with the Oxford Research Group, for pressure on Iran to take responsibility for the Houthi groups it arms and funds. "There is a perception among some Yemenis that the UN Special Envoy is not holding the Houthis accountable enough," she said. "The UK government should pressure Iran to stop arming the Houthis and hold them responsible for their attacks on their population."

News article:
COPENHAGEN: Sweden on Wednesday offered to host talks between Yemen’s warring parties as Washington called for an urgent halt to hostilities and the UN special envoy ramped up efforts to revive discussions that failed nearly two months ago. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the United Nations has asked her country if it “could be a place for the UN envoy to gather the parties in this conflict” — the internationally recognized government, supported by a Saudi-led coalition, and Yemen’s Iran-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. Wallstrom told Swedish news agency TT that her country would be “happy about it,” but that nothing is definite. The possible venue comes as UN envoy Martin Griffiths called on the opposing sides in the 3 1/2-year conflict to heed “recent calls” for a quick resumption of the political process and efforts to win a halt to fighting in Yemen. The Trump administration late Tuesday called for an urgent halt to the war and a start to negotiations aimed at a political settlement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked all parties to support Griffiths in what Pompeo said must be “substantive consultations” in November in a third country. In separate remarks, also Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a cease-fire within 30 days. Nigel Tricks of the Norwegian Refugee Council welcomed the cease-fire call, saying it could be “the political breakthrough that we have long requested from parties to this brutal war” that has been “four years of hell for Yemeni women, men and children.” Griffiths urged the concerned parties to “seize this opportunity” and singled out support for “confidence-building measures” such as Yemen’s central bank, a prisoner exchange and the re-opening of the airport in the rebel-held Yemeni capital, Sanaa. “Dialogue remains the only path to reach an inclusive agreement,” Griffiths said in a statement. Wallstrom reiterated Sweden’s support for Griffiths, whose efforts to host talks between the government and rebels in Geneva in September ran aground when Houthi representatives didn’t show up, insisting they had not been guaranteed safe return after the discussions. The conflict in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis who toppled the internationally recognized government. A Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015. The war has killed over 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. The UN says Yemen is facing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. At the beginning of 2017, the UN and its partners provided aid to 3 million hungry Yemenis. Since then, assistance has been scaled up, reaching 8 million people last month because of generous funding from donors, but far below the 14 million people — or half Yemen’s population — who may need it. Earlier this month, Mark Lowcock, the UN humanitarian chief, warned of “an imminent and great big famine engulfing Yemen.”

News article:
COPENHAGEN: Sweden on Wednesday offered to host talks between Yemen’s warring parties as Washington called for an urgent halt to hostilities and the UN special envoy ramped up efforts to revive discussions that failed nearly two months ago. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the United Nations has asked her country if it “could be a place for the UN envoy to gather the parties in this conflict” — the internationally recognized government, supported by a Saudi-led coalition, and Yemen’s Iran-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. Wallstrom told Swedish news agency TT that her country would be “happy about it,” but that nothing is definite. The possible venue comes as UN envoy Martin Griffiths called on the opposing sides in the 3 1/2-year conflict to heed “recent calls” for a quick resumption of the political process and efforts to win a halt to fighting in Yemen. The Trump administration late Tuesday called for an urgent halt to the war and a start to negotiations aimed at a political settlement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked all parties to support Griffiths in what Pompeo said must be “substantive consultations” in November in a third country. In separate remarks, also Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a cease-fire within 30 days. Nigel Tricks of the Norwegian Refugee Council welcomed the cease-fire call, saying it could be “the political breakthrough that we have long requested from parties to this brutal war” that has been “four years of hell for Yemeni women, men and children.” Griffiths urged the concerned parties to “seize this opportunity” and singled out support for “confidence-building measures” such as Yemen’s central bank, a prisoner exchange and the re-opening of the airport in the rebel-held Yemeni capital, Sanaa. “Dialogue remains the only path to reach an inclusive agreement,” Griffiths said in a statement. Wallstrom reiterated Sweden’s support for Griffiths, whose efforts to host talks between the government and rebels in Geneva in September ran aground when Houthi representatives didn’t show up, insisting they had not been guaranteed safe return after the discussions. The conflict in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis who toppled the internationally recognized government. A Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015. The war has killed over 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.

News article:
A leading Yemeni rebel figure on Thursday described the Trump administration's calls for a cease-fire in his country as "positive" but urged more international action to stop deadly airstrikes by the rebels' adversary, a U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition. The comments by Mohamed Ali al-Houthi on al-Masirah TV network, which backs Yemen's Shiite rebels known as Houthis, followed U.S. demands for a truce and the launch of U.N.-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war, now in its fourth year. According to al-Houthi, the chief of the rebel Supreme Revolutionary Committee, those urging a cease-fire should "translate their desire to bring peace in Yemen into action, stop the bombing of Yemenis immediately and lift the siege on Yemen." On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced what amounted to a major shift in the U.S. stance on the conflict, calling for a "cessation of hostilities." U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the truce should happen within 30 days and lead to U.N.-led political talks. The renewed diplomatic drive reflected a convergence of political pressures on Saudi Arabia stemming from international outrage over the slaying of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and the humanitarian crisis that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. The Saudi-led coalition has been stepping up an assault on the Red Sea port of Hodeida, the entry point for 70 percent of food imports and international aid to Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country. The coalition has waged war on the Houthis since March 2015 in efforts to bring back to power Yemen's internationally recognized government, which was toppled by the rebels after they seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. The Saudi-led coalition sees the rebels' ascendance as interference by Shiite powerhouse Iran, the kingdom's key rival. The Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, accuse the coalition of killing thousands of Yemeni civilians in a relentless air campaign and of choking Hodeida. In his remarks to the rebel TV, al-Houthi demanded the formation of international commissions of inquiry to investigate "crimes" of what the rebels describe as "U.S.-Saudi aggression." "It is necessary to stopping the war and the acts aggression, first of all, from the aggressor states which are supported by the United States of America," said Sultan al-Samaey, a member of the Houthi's Political Council. Bu the U.S. proposal was greeted with skepticism in the Houthi-controlled Sanaa. Al-Samaey said that while the war needed to be brought to an end, the rebels would only support "a peace which will preserve our independence." "This is simply a solution that will only plant land mines in the future of this region," said Ayoub al-Tamimi, a Sanaa resident and political activist. "There is no solution that can come from (President Donald) Trump or the Democrats, only booby traps." The International Committee for the Red Cross said Wednesday that its team in Hodeida this week found dreadful living conditions for thousands of displaced families "who own only the clothes they wear and survive on a little rice or a thin mix of flour and water, if they find any food to eat at all." "We know this is out of humanitarian hands, we know this is a political issue," Avril Patterson, the ICRC's health coordinator in Yemen said in an interview with the BBC on Thursday. "We need cessation of hostilities so that the country can rebuild." The conflict in Yemen has so far killed an estimated 10,000 people and also left around two-thirds of Yemen's population of 27 million relying on aid, with more than 8 million at risk of starvation.

CAIRO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The Gulf state of Oman on Thursday welcomed calls by the United States and Britain for a ceasefire in Yemen's war, Oman's state news agency reported on Thursday. Oman said dialogue was the best way to solve the conflict and bring security and stability to Yemen, and expressed its support for U.N. efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement. Oman is a Gulf ally of Saudi Arabia, but not a member of the Saudi-led military coalition trying to oust the Houthi militia that has seized the northern part of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. It maintains good relations with the Houthis, who, like the Saudi-backed government, have expressed a readiness to return to the negotiating table.

CAIRO/ADEN (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it attacked Sanaa International Airport and an adjoining airbase being used by Houthi insurgents, as the two warring sides also clashed further west in the country’s main port city. The violence broke out days after renewed U.S. calls for a ceasefire in the three-and-half-year war that the Saudi-backed government suggested it was ready to support. Houthi forces were using the airbase in the capital to launch drone and ballistic missile attacks, a coalition spokesman told Saudi state al-Ekhbaria TV on Friday. Flights and international aid efforts were not affected, Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Al-Masirah TV, which is controlled by the Houthis, said more than 30 air strikes targeted al-Dulaimi Air Base in Sanaa and the surrounding areas. In the port of Hodeidah, fighting broke out early on Friday in a southern district, residents and military sources said. The coalition had massed thousands of troops near the city on Wednesday, in a move to pressure the Iran-aligned Houthis to return to U.N.-sponsored peace talks. The sources in Hodeidah said fighting was heard in areas near the airport and the university, and Apache helicopters were spotted in the sky. Forces loyal to the Saudi-backed government have said coalition strikes were intensified on Thursday night on Houthi bases near the eastern entrance to the port city, which is a gateway to the capital, and in its southern part. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Sunni Muslim allies have been fighting since March 2015 against the Houthis, who drove the country’s internationally recognized government into exile in 2014. The Houthis control much of north Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. The war has devastated the country’s infrastructure and driven much of its population to the brink of famine.

Arab coalition jet fighters bomb Yemen capital city IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Nov 2, IRNA -- The jet fighters of the Saudi-led Arab coalition bombarded the Yemeni capital city of Sana'a 30 times early Friday, Al-Masirah news network reported. Saudi warplanes also struck an air base and its surrounding areas, north of Sana'a ten times, according to Al-Masirah . The Saudi-led Arab coalition has intensified its air strikes against Yemen Thursday evening and Friday morning while the United States called for an end to Yemen war Wednesday evening. Top American officials called for a ceasefire in Yemen and demanded warring parties immediately come to the negotiating table. The comments came as the Saudi-Emirati-led military coalition deployed more than 10,000 new troops towards a vital port city in the run-up to a new assault. James Mattis, the Pentagon chief, said the US had been watching the conflict 'for long enough', adding he believes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - who are in a US-backed coalition fighting Houthi rebels--are ready for talks. Meanwhile, spokesman for Yemen's Ansarallah Movement Mohammad Abduslsalam said if the United States was really serious in ending conflicts in Yemen it should first stop its arms sale as well as logistical and intelligence assistance to the Saudi-led coalition. Saudi Arabia and a number of its regional allies launched a devastating military campaign against Yemen in March 2015, with the aim of bringing the government of former president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi back to power and crushing the country's Houthi Ansarullah movement. Some 16,000 Yemenis have been killed and thousands more injured since the onset of the Saudi-led aggression. 1396**1396 NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - Thousands of Yemeni civilians are trapped on the southern outskirts of the Red Sea port of Hodeidah as forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition battle Houthi insurgents entrenched in the city, aid groups said on Monday. The alliance has massed thousands of Yemeni troops in recent days near the heavily defended port, but a source in the coalition told Reuters there were no immediate plans for an assault. The United Nations has said an attack on the city, entry point for 80 percent of impoverished Yemen’s food imports and relief supplies, would risk triggering a famine. The fighting has reached populated areas around a university 4 km (2.5 miles) from the port and has come close to the main hospital for the first time, aid groups and residents said. “All the people living between the airport and the university are trapped, the last four days have been very tough, it is beyond catastrophic levels,” said Isaac Ooko, Hodeidah area manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). “Air strikes have been very intense and the hovering of the jets causes permanent anxiety ... Hodeidah has become a ghost city, people stay indoors and the streets are deserted,” he told Reuters by telephone. Juliette Touma, spokeswoman for the U.N. children’s fund UNICEF who was recently in Hodeidah, voiced fears for al-Thawra, the main hospital on Yemen’s western coast and a center of cholera and diphtheria treatment. “You could hear the fighting from the hospital and from our guest house close to it,” she said. CEASEFIRE CALLS Capturing Hodeidah would allow the Saudi-led coalition to cut off the main supply line of the Iranian-aligned Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Bandar al-Aiban, head of the official Saudi national human rights commission, told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that coalition forces were “doing their best to spare civilians, particularly women and children, civilian sites, and infrastructure as a side-effect of the armed conflict”. Western countries have called for a ceasefire to support efforts to end a war that has lasted more than three years and killed more than 10,000 people. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not publicly commented on those calls, but the coalition source said the military deployment aimed to put pressure on the Houthis to return to negotiations. U.N.-led talks in Geneva fell apart in September after the Houthis failed to show up. The Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and has been under growing international scrutiny over civilian deaths. It relies heavily on Western arms and intelligence in the conflict, widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But its relationship with key Western allies has been badly strained by the murder of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month.

Bandar al-Aiban, head of the official Saudi national human rights commission, told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that coalition forces were “doing their best to spare civilians, particularly women and children, civilian sites, and infrastructure as a side-effect of the armed conflict”. Western countries have called for a ceasefire to support efforts to end a war that has lasted more than three years and killed more than 10,000 people. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not publicly commented on those calls, but the coalition source said the military deployment aimed to put pressure on the Houthis to return to negotiations. U.N.-led talks in Geneva fell apart in September after the Houthis failed to show up. The Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and has been under growing international scrutiny over civilian deaths. It relies heavily on Western arms and intelligence in the conflict, widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But its relationship with key Western allies has been badly strained by the murder of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month.

ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - Thousands of Yemeni civilians are trapped on the southern outskirts of the Red Sea port of Hodeidah as forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition battle Houthi insurgents entrenched in the city, aid groups said on Monday. The alliance has massed thousands of Yemeni troops in recent days near the heavily defended port, but a source in the coalition told Reuters there were no immediate plans for an assault. The United Nations has said an attack on the city, entry point for 80 percent of impoverished Yemen’s food imports and relief supplies, would risk triggering a famine. The fighting has reached populated areas around a university 4 km (2.5 miles) from the port and has come close to the main hospital for the first time, aid groups and residents said. “All the people living between the airport and the university are trapped, the last four days have been very tough, it is beyond catastrophic levels,” said Isaac Ooko, Hodeidah area manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). “Air strikes have been very intense and the hovering of the jets causes permanent anxiety ... Hodeidah has become a ghost city, people stay indoors and the streets are deserted,” he told Reuters by telephone. Juliette Touma, spokeswoman for the U.N. children’s fund UNICEF who was recently in Hodeidah, voiced fears for al-Thawra, the main hospital on Yemen’s western coast and a center of cholera and diphtheria treatment. “You could hear the fighting from the hospital and from our guest house close to it,” she said.

The war has devastated the country's infrastructure and driven much of its population to the brink of famine CAIRO/ADEN, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it attacked Sanaa International Airport and an adjoining airbase being used by Houthi insurgents, as the two warring sides also clashed further west in the country's main port city. The violence broke out days after renewed U.S. calls for a ceasefire in the three-and-half-year war that the Saudi-backed government suggested it was ready to support. Houthi forces were using the airbase in the capital to launch drone and ballistic missile attacks, a coalition spokesman told Saudi state al-Ekhbaria TV on Friday. Flights and international aid efforts were not affected, Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Al-Masirah TV, which is controlled by the Houthis, said more than 30 air strikes targeted al-Dulaimi Air Base in Sanaa and the surrounding areas. In the port of Hodeidah, fighting broke out early on Friday in a southern district, residents and military sources said. The coalition had massed thousands of troops near the city on Wednesday, in a move to pressure the Iran-aligned Houthis to return to U.N.-sponsored peace talks. The sources in Hodeidah said fighting was heard in areas near the airport and the university, and Apache helicopters were spotted in the sky. Forces loyal to the Saudi-backed government have said coalition strikes were intensified on Thursday night on Houthi bases near the eastern entrance to the port city, which is a gateway to the capital, and in its southern part. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Sunni Muslim allies have been fighting since March 2015 against the Houthis, who drove the country's internationally recognised government into exile in 2014. The Houthis control much of north Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. The war has devastated the country's infrastructure and driven much of its population to the brink of famine.

SANAA, Yemen (AP) - Troops from a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition pounded Houthi rebel positions in Yemen's Hodeida with airstrikes and a ground assault on Wednesday and now control a major road leading into the city, military officials and witnesses on both sides of the front line said. An Emirati-trained force known as the Giants, backed by Apache attack helicopters, secured an urban area along 50th Street, which leads to the city's key Red Sea port facilities some 5 kilometers (3 miles) away, they added. Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals or lack of authorization to brief journalists, they said that the Iran-backed Shiite rebels had been firing mainly from elevated and rooftop sniper positions, and have now resorted to burning tires to obscure the gunships' view. Most civilians have fled the area, they said. Dozens of fighters have been killed and hundreds wounded from both sides since a renewed coalition offensive on the city began five days ago, following calls by the Trump administration for a cease-fire by late November. The fighting has left dead bodies lying on the ground and inside burnt-out vehicles at the city's edge, according to witnesses. They said several civilians have been killed by shelling in residential areas. The Saudi-led coalition, which seeks to restore to power the internationally recognized Yemeni government, has been at war with the Houthis since March 2015. The stalemated conflict has generated the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

On Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, Geert Cappelaere called the situation a "living hell" for all Yemeni children, noting the death of Amal a child whose emaciated body gained attention on the front page of the New York Times last week. In a speech delivered in Amman Cappelaere said, "There is not one Amal - there are many thousands of Amals." (AP Photo/Hammadi Issa, File) Hodeida, the main portal for humanitarian aid to the suffering population, has become the epicenter of the conflict. A Save the Children supported health facility in Hodeida came under attack on Tuesday morning, damaging one of the pharmacies that supply life-saving medicines, the charity said in a statement. The group said shelling has also hit residential areas in Hodeida, where the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, roughly half of them children, are in danger. The charity did not elaborate on which group attacked the facility. The head of the U.N.'s food and agriculture agency and other groups say the conflict has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine, underlining how the international community is failing to end hunger. "We are watching before our eyes an unprecedented human tragedy," Food and Agriculture Organization chief Jose Graziano da Silva told a high-level briefing on food insecurity at the U.N. in New York. "Yemen is living proof of an apocalyptical equation: conflicts and food security go hand in hand, and when there is an overlap of climate change and conflict, famine is already on the horizon," he said. Also on Wednesday, the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders said it was closing its humanitarian project in the southern Dhale province due to security concerns amid the fighting there. Besides Dhale, other active fronts in Yemen include the provinces of Bayda, to the south, and the Houthis' northern strongholds of Hajjah and Saada. The United States has sold billions of dollars' worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition. In a statement, rebel leader Abdul-Malek al-Houthi described the U.S. cease-fire call as hypocritical, given that fresh fighting erupted almost immediately after it was delivered. "The Americans have always sought to escalate, putting out statements of peace while preparing for war," he said in comments carried by rebel media channels, saying the new offensive was expected. "The American role is central and essential in the military operation against our people." The rebels, who brandish "Death to America and Israel" slogans similar to that of the Iranian leadership, accuse the coalition of being stooges of masters in Washington and Israel. ___ Rohan reported from Cairo.

News article:
By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths is no longer aiming to convene the country's warring parties for peace talks by the end of this month and will instead try to bring them together by the end of the year, a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday. Griffiths, who is due to brief the Security Council on Nov. 16, is trying to salvage peace talks that collapsed in September. He said in a statement last week that he hoped to bring the parties to the negotiating table within a month. However, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the goal now was for political consultations before the end of the year. A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. Iran has denied supplying weapons to the Houthis. The United States and Britain last week stepped up calls for an end to the nearly four-year war that has driven impoverished Yemen to the verge of famine, raising pressure on Saudi Arabia as it faces a global outcry over the murder of a prominent Saudi journalist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. "There's always different challenges to bringing the parties together," Haq told reporters. "What we're trying to do is clear up any issues so that we can get a successful round of talks as soon as possible." An attempt to hold peace talks in Geneva in September was abandoned after three days of waiting for the Houthi delegation.

By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths is no longer aiming to convene the country's warring parties for peace talks by the end of this month and will instead try to bring them together by the end of the year, a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday. Griffiths, who is due to brief the Security Council on Nov. 16, is trying to salvage peace talks that collapsed in September. He said in a statement last week that he hoped to bring the parties to the negotiating table within a month. However, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the goal now was for political consultations before the end of the year. A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. Iran has denied supplying weapons to the Houthis. The United States and Britain last week stepped up calls for an end to the nearly four-year war that has driven impoverished Yemen to the verge of famine, raising pressure on Saudi Arabia as it faces a global outcry over the murder of a prominent Saudi journalist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. "There's always different challenges to bringing the parties together," Haq told reporters. "What we're trying to do is clear up any issues so that we can get a successful round of talks as soon as possible." An attempt to hold peace talks in Geneva in September was abandoned after three days of waiting for the Houthi delegation. The Houthis had said they wanted guarantees from the United Nations that their plane would not have to stop in Djibouti for inspection by the Saudi-led coalition. They also wanted the plane to evacuate some of their wounded to Oman or Europe.

ICRC warns of Saudi coalition's attack on Hodeida in Yemen IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Nov 9, IRNA -- The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Friday warned against Saudi coalition's new attack on Yemen's Hodeida Port. A statement, posted on the ICRC official website, reads that as Hodeida sees a dramatic escalation in the fighting around the city, the ICRC calls on warring parties to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure from unnecessary harm, especially in the lead-up to potential talks between parties. "Hodeida is once again trapped in violence with hundreds of thousands of Yemenis caught in the middle. The upcoming talks cannot be an excuse to disregard the laws of war that protect the lives of the Yemeni people," said Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC's Regional Director for the Near and Middle East. 'Wars have rules and parties to the conflict must respect them, even in the fiercest battles,' according to Carboni. The ICRC teams on the ground have seen how fear is rising among Yemeni people of being accidentally hit or purposely targeted. Fighting is nearing health centers, which led to the interruption of services in Hodeida's 22nd May Hospital, said Carboni, adding that the city's biggest hospital, Al-Thawra, is mere meters from the frontline, and if more health structures are rendered dysfunctional, the remaining facilities might not have the capacity to provide regular services or cope with an influx of casualties. The ICRC encourages political efforts to put an end to a war that has caused intense misery for Yemeni families, said the official, adding that millions of people are displaced in the country and millions are battling extreme hunger as a direct consequence of the conflict. "This new attack on Hodeida is brushing away the hope sparked by the recent announcement of the peace talks," said Carboni. "We´re running out of words to describe how wretched the situation is. It´s time to see a glimmer of hope in Yemen,' said the ICRC official. The ICRC in Hodeida is providing support to Al-Thawra hospital and the Hodeida Water Authority to help keep basic services running. Since the escalation of the fighting in June, the ICRC has delivered more than 80 metric tons of medical supplies to health facilities in and around the city and food and household items to more than 48,000 internally displaced individuals, ICRC statement concluded. It is for more than three years that the people of Yemen are under the Saudi-led coalition attacks. The aim of Saudi attacks which began on March 2015 is to restore power to Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. Thousands of civilians including women and children have been killed or injured in the brutal attacks of Saudi Arabia and its allies on the impoverished country and many have lost their lives due to outbreak of diseases and lack of medicines and medical services. Many human rights groups across the world have expressed great concern over the horrible situation in Yemen caused by the bloody war imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Western and Arab allies. 9191**1420 NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

An Istanbul conference under the aegis of Nobel laureate Tawakkol Karman on Friday called for concrete measures to end the war in her native Yemen and an international court to judge those charged with crimes during the conflict, AFP reported. The conference was organized by Karman’s foundation. It urged international players, including the UN, to take “deliberate and responsible actions to end the war and restore peace in Yemen.” The UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said in late October it aims to re-launch Yemen peace talks “within a month.” Karman, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011, was a key figure in the protests that ousted Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh during the Arab Spring uprisings. At the conference, Karman called on Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to end their “unconstructive interference in Yemen and stop supporting terrorist groups and armed militias.” She also called for an end to interference “by the mullahs in Iran to try to control Yemen by supporting Houthi militias.”

News article:
Yemeni pro-government forces drive through the eastern outskirts of Hodeida as they battle to seize the key Red Sea port city from Huthi rebels on November 10, 2018 At least 150 people have been killed in 24 hours of clashes in the Yemeni port city of Hodeida, medics said Monday, as Britain's top diplomat visited the Gulf seeking to boost international calls for a ceasefire. Government loyalists supported by a Saudi-led coalition are fighting to oust the Iran-backed Huthi rebels from the strategic Red Sea city, whose docks are a lifeline to 14 million Yemenis at risk of starvation. Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, a coalition spokesman told reporters in Riyadh that "the operation is still ongoing", adding that it was meant to pressure the rebels to come to the negotiating table. A Hodeida resident reported an ebb in fighting around the city by Monday evening, but UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of a possible "catastrophic situation" if the port is destroyed. "The fighting must stop, a political debate must begin, and we must prepare a massive humanitarian response to avoid the worst next year," he said. A military source in the pro-government coalition said the insurgents had pushed back a large-scale assault aimed at moving towards the port, under rebel control since 2014. In a statement sent via the Telegram messaging app, the Huthis said they had "lured" loyalists up the western coastline of Hodeida, where the rebels then launched an attack on the troops. Government forces, led on the ground by Emirati-backed troops, have made their way into Hodeida after 11 days of clashes, reaching residential neighbourhoods in the east on Sunday and sparking fears of street fights that would further endanger civilians trapped in the city. Residents and government military sources have reported rebel snipers stationed on rooftops in civilian streets in eastern Hodeida, a few kilometres (miles) from the port on the western edge of the city. The fighting forced hundreds of terrified medical workers and patients to flee the al-Thawra hospital -- Hodeida's largest public medical facility -- as a series of explosions rocked the area on Sunday, Amnesty International said. A medical worker told Amnesty that they "dodged a hail of shrapnel" as bombardment near the hospital lasted more than 30 minutes. - 'Enough is enough' - The Hodeida offensive has sparked an international outcry unprecedented in nearly four years of conflict between the Huthis and the Saudi-backed government. Britain, the United States and France have all called for an end to hostilities. All three countries are major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a major ally of Washington, to engage in peace talks. The battle for Hodeida British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met with Saudi King Salman and Prince Mohammed on Monday during a visit to the kingdom to press its rulers to support UN efforts to end the conflict. Hunt also flew to the United Arab Emirates, a key pillar of the Saudi-led coalition, to meet the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. In France, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was time "the international community said enough is enough. "There will be no victor in this war," Le Drian told France 2 TV. - Civilian toll - Aid groups fear for the safety of hundreds of thousands of people living in Hodeida -- and for millions of others dependent on its port for what little food and humanitarian aid trickle into impoverished, blockaded Yemen. A military official in Hodeida on Monday confirmed seven civilians had died, without giving further details. A 15-year-old boy died last week of shrapnel wounds in Hodeida, Save the Children said. Medics in hospitals across Hodeida province reported 111 rebels and 32 loyalist fighters killed overnight, according to a tally by AFP. Sources at the Al-Alfi military hospital, seized by the rebels during their 2014 takeover, said charred body parts had been delivered there overnight. Military sources confirmed that the Saudi-led alliance had targeted the rebels with multiple air strikes. A Yemeni woman carries her child who is suffering from severe malnutrition at a hospital in northwestern Hajjah province on November 11, 2018 The rebels have begun to evacuate their wounded to Sanaa, the capital, which the Huthis seized during a 2014 takeover that included a string of ports on Yemen's coastline. Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened in the Yemeni government's fight against the Huthis in 2015, triggering what the UN now calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 600 people have been killed since clashes erupted in Hodeida on November 1, ending a temporary suspension in a government offensive to take the city that began in June. - Diplomatic pressure - The coalition has come under intense international pressure to end the conflict, particularly following the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an ardent critic of Prince Mohammed, in his country's consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Displaced children from Hodeidah province wait for water supplies in a camp in the northern district of Abs in Yemen's northwestern Hajjah province on November 10, 2018 Multiple countries, including Germany and Norway, have announced the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi's killing. The United Nations' Yemen envoy, Martin Griffiths, is pushing for peace talks between the Huthis and the government by the end of the year. The United States, which for years provided military training and aerial refuelling for the Saudi-led coalition, on Saturday announced it would end its inflight refuelling support for the alliance. The alliance accuses Iran of smuggling arms to the Huthis through Hodeida port. Tehran denies the charges. bur-faw-ny-ac/nla

Yemeni pro-government forces drive through the eastern outskirts of Hodeida as they battle to seize the key Red Sea port city from Huthi rebels on November 10, 2018 At least 150 people have been killed in 24 hours of clashes in the Yemeni port city of Hodeida, medics said Monday, as Britain's top diplomat visited the Gulf seeking to boost international calls for a ceasefire. Government loyalists supported by a Saudi-led coalition are fighting to oust the Iran-backed Huthi rebels from the strategic Red Sea city, whose docks are a lifeline to 14 million Yemenis at risk of starvation. Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, a coalition spokesman told reporters in Riyadh that "the operation is still ongoing", adding that it was meant to pressure the rebels to come to the negotiating table. A Hodeida resident reported an ebb in fighting around the city by Monday evening, but UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of a possible "catastrophic situation" if the port is destroyed. "The fighting must stop, a political debate must begin, and we must prepare a massive humanitarian response to avoid the worst next year," he said. A military source in the pro-government coalition said the insurgents had pushed back a large-scale assault aimed at moving towards the port, under rebel control since 2014. In a statement sent via the Telegram messaging app, the Huthis said they had "lured" loyalists up the western coastline of Hodeida, where the rebels then launched an attack on the troops. Government forces, led on the ground by Emirati-backed troops, have made their way into Hodeida after 11 days of clashes, reaching residential neighbourhoods in the east on Sunday and sparking fears of street fights that would further endanger civilians trapped in the city. Residents and government military sources have reported rebel snipers stationed on rooftops in civilian streets in eastern Hodeida, a few kilometres (miles) from the port on the western edge of the city. The fighting forced hundreds of terrified medical workers and patients to flee the al-Thawra hospital -- Hodeida's largest public medical facility -- as a series of explosions rocked the area on Sunday, Amnesty International said. A medical worker told Amnesty that they "dodged a hail of shrapnel" as bombardment near the hospital lasted more than 30 minutes. - 'Enough is enough' - The Hodeida offensive has sparked an international outcry unprecedented in nearly four years of conflict between the Huthis and the Saudi-backed government. Britain, the United States and France have all called for an end to hostilities. All three countries are major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a major ally of Washington, to engage in peace talks. The battle for Hodeida British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met with Saudi King Salman and Prince Mohammed on Monday during a visit to the kingdom to press its rulers to support UN efforts to end the conflict. Hunt also flew to the United Arab Emirates, a key pillar of the Saudi-led coalition, to meet the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. In France, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was time "the international community said enough is enough. "There will be no victor in this war," Le Drian told France 2 TV. - Civilian toll - Aid groups fear for the safety of hundreds of thousands of people living in Hodeida -- and for millions of others dependent on its port for what little food and humanitarian aid trickle into impoverished, blockaded Yemen. A military official in Hodeida on Monday confirmed seven civilians had died, without giving further details. A 15-year-old boy died last week of shrapnel wounds in Hodeida, Save the Children said. Medics in hospitals across Hodeida province reported 111 rebels and 32 loyalist fighters killed overnight, according to a tally by AFP. Sources at the Al-Alfi military hospital, seized by the rebels during their 2014 takeover, said charred body parts had been delivered there overnight.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called on the warring factions in Yemen to engage in peace talks. Recent clashes in the port city of Hodeida have exacerbated the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The destruction of the port of Hodeida, a vital lifeline for millions of starving civilians in Yemen, would "create a catastrophic situation," Antonio Guterres told French radio station France Inter. He said that the situation in Yemen was at an impasse, particularly due to the the fight over Hodeida and that "a political solution was absolutely necessary" right now. Since November 1, when clashes erupted as the Saudi-led coalition attempts to retake the strategic port from the Houthi rebels , nearly 600 people have been killed, ending a temporary suspension of the offensive by the government and the coalition supporting it led by Saudi Arabia. He added that there was "a consensus, between the United States, Russia, Europe and many states in the region, that it is finally time to end this conflict" but that any attempts to begin peace talks have been thwarted by the situation in Hodeida, which he described as "frozen." He urged all parties to relaunch peace talks, which were abandoned in September. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a major US ally, to agree to peace talks, while the UK's foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is in Saudi Arabia on Monday to try and press King Salman and Prince Mohammed to support efforts to end the hostilities. Both the United States and Britain are major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia. The Yemeni government, supported by Saudi Arabia, and the Houthi rebels, affiliated with Saudi arch enemy Iran, have been fighting for nearly four years. This has caused what the UN considers to be the world's worst current humanitarian crisis. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and has left 14 million people on the brink of starvation, the UN says. ng/msh (AFP, Reuters)

News article:
US, UK culpable for recent Saudi atrocities in Yemen: American analyst Tasnim – An American political commentator deplored recent Saudi-led coalition’s attacks on Yemen’s western port city of Hudaydah, which led to the killing of about 150 people, and said the Washington and London governments are also complicit in the war crimes. “As for the US and UK, they are completely culpable regards Yemen,” John Steppling, who is based in Norway, told the Tasnim News Agency in an interview. “Totally, this is a Saudi/US/UK war, period!” he said, adding, “And the UAE is along for the ride too.” Steppling is a well-known author, playwright and an original founding member of the Padua Hills Playwrights Festival, a two-time NEA recipient, Rockefeller Fellow in theater, and PEN-West winner for playwriting. He is also a regular political commentator for a number of media outlets around the world. Following is the full text of the interview: Tasnim: As you know, the Saudi-led coalition has intensified attacks on Yemen. At least 149 people, including seven civilians, were killed in the latest clashes between Yemeni troops and Saudi-backed mercenaries in the western port city of Hudaydah, according to medics and military sources. What is the main reason behind the increased Saudi attacks on Hudaydah? Is it trying to gain some leverage at the negotiating table? Steppling: I think there are three strands to follow in trying to understand Saudi motivation here. The first is that the Kingdom does not want what they see as Shiite (Iranian) influence on the Arabian Peninsula. So, even if it is only rhetorical support from Iran (it is more but I’m not sure all that much more) the Saudis see themselves as the power broker in the region. This is maybe increasingly delusional but then they are prone to delusions. Second is the US and UK weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. (Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad) Bin Salman curried favor with the US and UK by going on a spending spree. And remember that the attack on Yemen started under Obama and with his support. The US has targeted Iran for a long time, going back to the 1950s. And certainly, it was re-intensified again since 9/11. But then 9/11 was a great justification, in their minds, for almost anything. And third is the Saudi fear about regime change against them. And from the US. Look, I said a couple years ago that regime change was coming to KSA. They have far outlived their usefulness and the new generation, if MBS is an example, is just hopelessly out of touch. Who needs a medieval backward looking inbred dynasty of fanatics sitting on the oil of the world? Tasnim: According to some political experts, the murder of Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, along with sharply deteriorating humanitarian conditions and growing media attention paid to the war in Yemen, has led to increased pressure on Saudi Arabia to end the war. Recently, Germany urged other European Union member states to follow its example in stopping arms exports to Saudi Arabia. What is your assessment of the international pressures and their influence on the protracted war in Yemen and how do you predict the future of the conflicts? Steppling: Look, I have no idea why Khashoggi was topped off. But I do know that the official response by the US Department of State and Oval Office and secretaries of defense and state was highly stage-managed and carefully orchestrated. As if anyone is in the least surprised the Kingdom tortures and kills people in hotel rooms in Turkey. I’m sure this is an almost routine occurrence. Khashoggi was not exactly John Reed or Ryszard Kapuscinski. The moral outrage of the US is laughable, if not for the dire state of things in that part of the world, a state in which laughter is strangely incongruous. Now if Germany and other EU (and NATO) countries are sincere, and I have no idea if they are, then this is a good time to cut some of the economic ties they have with the US government. I am guessing they ARE genuinely angry since public opinion is so bad. This leads to a very important question regards Europe and NATO. Do they stop prostrating themselves before the US? The sanctions do hurt Iran, but it is not going to topple anyone. Far from it. But then there is also the rise of the far right neo-fascist parties across Europe. The worst being Hungary and Poland, and Italy close behind. But even in Sweden and the Netherlands, in Denmark and France, and in Germany, too, the new anti-immigration hyper-nationalists are positions of influence. What will be the effect of this? The US under Trump is a bit hard to read. But Pompeo is an evangelical nut job. Self-righteous and arrogant, a bloated preening Christian extremist. And a scary man. Now Israel would love to keep the focus on Iran. Israel will do what it is told, of course, but it always keeps whispering in Trump’s ear. The problem is this war is starting to really create PR problems. Over 7000 dead civilians (a low ball estimate), bombs have hit over 300 farms and 250 schools. It is an appalling record even for the Kingdom. And there is no way to spin this. The UAE and UK and the US are hand in hand with the Saudis in all this. And right now something like 80% of the country is in need of food. Eight million are outright starving. And yet all you get from the US is this hand-wringing about the death of slightly sleazy marginally talented journalist like Khashoggi. Tasnim: Some Western countries that claim to be champions of human rights are pursuing double-standard policies on Saudi Arabia’s atrocities. What do you think about the roles of Washington and London in the Riyadh regime’s heinous crimes against Yemen? Steppling: The western NGO establishment….the human rights institutions like Human Rights Watch and the like, are highly selective by nature. They are there to promote the status quo or they are out of a job. As for the US and UK, they are completely culpable regards Yemen. Totally, this is a Saudi/US/UK war, period! And the UAE is along for the ride too. Now it is worth mentioning again here that the US has openly said it wants a coup in Tehran. They, the US diplomatic corps, the State Dept, and the Pentagon, all of them are Orientalists; they are xenophobic and very aggressive in their thinking. The so-called regime change game sort of lumps all these regions into one basket. For the neocons, Donbass is not all that different than Tehran. Honduras and Haiti are not so far removed in their minds from Sana’a. And this provincialism has gotten worse under Trump. And again its hard to read the Trump presidency. Who is deciding certain things? Trump himself we know is very ignorant. Who is the shot caller in the white house? I have no idea, but I do know that these human rights organizations cannot be trusted. They are western based and see things through the lens of neoliberal conceits. And then there is the question of how one is to see the UN. The point to remember, I think, is that the ruling class across the globe tends to have similar values and interests. These large economic blocs operate outside of national borders — to some degree, and maybe largely. One has to remember that those very rich and powerful interests, in banking and finance, in the defense business, in mining and shipping and even packaging and of course oil — the men behind the giant multinationals and those in aerospace and digital technology, whatever country they come from, they share common interests. And those interests are to, in a nutshell, control the world. That is not hyperbole. The problem is that increasingly mankind faces environmental problems, and pollution and this 1%, so-called, does not care about you and me. Billionaires are buying land in remote areas…New Zealand, or Patagonia or above the Arctic Circle in places, and they are preparing for dire social upheavals. They do not spend their money to solve these problems and help people, they spend their money and time preparing to protect themselves, period. So it is important to know that the far right, those racist idiots in the US, and in Europe, the fascists and neo-fascists, they are unintentionally (for the most part) serving the interests of that 1%. The leaders of the West love having fascists in power. The US loves the electoral outcome in Brazil. Perfect. So behind the scenes, they are supporting these parties. They are targeting Venezuela now and I expect a coup of some sort to at least be attempted there. The only chance is the vision of independent countries like Russia and China and Iran, like Cuba and the DPRK and Venezuela and Bolivia and Syria. Each has issues, and they are imperfect…but that is where the hope lies. The US/NATO alliance is an enemy to humanity. They are what destabilize regions. They are the danger that humankind faces. And in the US, the recent election is another example of a heavily indoctrinated populace voting for one or another party of war. Meanwhile, fires and floods and poverty are decimating the country.

News article:
The UAE, Saudi, US and UK established on Thursday a committee to address Yemen’s economic and humanitarian crisis. Senior officials and ambassadors of the quartet states met in Riyadh to identify measures aimed at stabilizing Yemen’s economy by calling on the international community to support the ongoing peace process. “The four nations agreed to establish an advisory committee that will meet once a month to establish measures aimed at stabilizing Yemen’s currency, management of foreign currency flows and support the government of Yemen in improving its economic management,” according to a statement by the Saudi Press Agency. They expressed support for UN Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths’ efforts in bringing all sides of the conflict to the negotiating table in order to work on a political solution. Mr Griffiths is expected to give a briefing on Friday to the UN Security Council on the progress of the upcoming peace talks next month. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Adel Al Jubeir, said on Thursday that the kingdom supports UN-led peace efforts to end the war in Yemen. "We support a peaceful solution in Yemen and we support the efforts of the UN special envoy to Yemen," Mr Al Jubeir told reporters. "We are committed to delivering all the necessary humanitarian aid to our brothers in Yemen." The development comes as Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, held talks with Yemen’s Al Islah party. During the meeting on Wednesday evening, Sheikh Mohammed reviewed the latest developments in Yemen with Al Islah chairman Colonel Mohammed Abdullah Al Yidoumi and secretary-general Abdulwahab Ahmad Al Anisi, according to state news agency WAM. _______________ Read more: Exclusive: Yemenia to resume flights to Arabian Gulf and Africa as it plans comeback Houthi rebels fire missile at Hodeidah port, threatening ceasefire _______________ Al Islah leaders expressed their gratitude to the UAE and the Arab led coalition for their efforts against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to WAM. “The meeting is seen as a positive and important step towards strengthening and uniting the Arab coalition in achieving its objectives of assisting pro-government forces to retake much of the rebel-held areas,” Adnan Al Adaini, deputy head of the information department of the Islah Party said. Mr Al Adaini accused Qatar of playing a role in undermining security in Yemen and the Arab region. Al Islah has been fighting alongside forces loyal to Yemeni president Abdrabu Mansur Hadi in Marib province, east of Sanaa, for three years. Mr Hadi on Wednesday backed UN-proposed talks to end fighting in his war-torn country but vowed to "liberate" the battleground rebel-held port city of Hodeidah regardless of the peace process. His aide Abdullah Al Alimi said the president had given strict instructions to army commanders to avoid civilian casualties, while also pushing for peace negotiations. President Hadi, said Mr Al Alimi, has continuously pushed for the interest of the country to be taken into consideration. On Thursday in Hodeidah an uneasy calm had settled for the third consecutive day after nearly two weeks of intense fighting between Iran-backed Hputhi rebels and the Arab coalition. A resident of Hodeidah told The National that the Iran-backed rebels had deployed tens of children to replace deserters and fighters taken prisoners by the coalition. Anas Balgheith, a displaced Hodeidah resident in Al Khoukhah told The National that tens of new Houthi fighters had been deployed to the city centre on a daily basis. "As soon as they arrive they take up positions on the buildings' rooftops and start digging new trenches and build barricades and plant mines," Mr Balgheith said. "More than 300,000 civilians are still living in the city, they are living in a catastrophic situation, they can't flee the city because the Houthis used to fire randomly over the families who tried to flee so the majority prefer to stay home.

News article:
A member of the Yemeni pro-government forces is pictured in front of the May 22 Hospital on the eastern outskirts of port city of Hodeida, on Thursday (AFP photo) UNITED NATIONS — United Nations food chief David Beasley spotted a tiny foot sticking out from under a blanket in a hospital in Yemen that has been overwhelmed with malnourished children, so he tried to bring a smile to the face of the small patient. “It was just like tickling a ghost,” Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, told reporters in New York on Friday after returning from a three-day visit to the war-torn, impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. Beasley recounted a conversation he had with a doctor at the hospital in the country’s capital Sanaa: “He said ‘every day about 50 children are brought to us. We have to send 30 home to die. We can only accommodate 20.’” Beasley will brief the UN Security Council on Friday with UN aid chief Mark Lowcock and UN Yemen Envoy Martin Griffiths, who is trying to broker peace in the more than three-year conflict seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. The Houthis now rule most of Yemen’s population, while the exiled government controls a section of the south. The country’s economy is in crisis and three-quarters of Yemen’s population, or 22 million people, require aid. Some 8.4 million are on the brink of starvation, though Lowcock has warned that will likely rise to 14 million. “This is not on the brink of a catastrophe. This is a catastrophe,” Beasley said. “You cannot solve the humanitarian crisis in Yemen today with humanitarian response alone. It’s now going to require an economic infusion of substantial liquidity. Both are going to be required to avert a famine,” he said. Yemen’s riyal has lost more than half its value against the US dollar since the start of the war. Soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis and the central bank has struggled to pay public-sector salaries on which many depend as foreign exchange reserves dwindle. Beasley also visited Yemen’s main port city Hodeida, which handles 80 per cent of the country’s food imports and aid supplies. The Saudi-led coalition has ordered a halt in a log-running offensive against the Houthis in Hodeida, sources said on Thursday. “That port has got to protected at all costs,” Beasley said. “We are prepared, if necessary, if all parties desire, for the UN to take over the operational capacity of the port. We are prepared to do that, we do not want to do that, but if that’s what it takes we will do it,” he said. Beasley also spoke about seeing an eight-month-old baby boy at the hospital in Sanaa who weighed a third of what he should. His mother had driven hundreds of kilometres through military checkpoints to get him medical help. “The little boy died yesterday,” he said. Containing the crisis Kuwait said this month there was a “positive view to contain the Gulf crisis”, and a source familiar with US policy said diplomats were putting forward a plan on Qatar. But neither side seems ready to cede ground. Qatar’s foreign ministry spokeswoman said last month that Khashoggi’s death should serve as a “wake-up call”. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said on Tuesday he did not expect a thaw soon. “I am very pessimistic about this. With the current [Saudi and UAE] leadership I don’t see that there is any way that things may be loosened up,” he told reporters. “The only face-saving way for them to get out is to apologise.” Abu Dhabi says the dispute is not a priority, according to three diplomats and other sources familiar with Gulf policy. “The Qataris are raising the price for resolving the crisis,” said one Western diplomat. “The Emiratis are happy to keep the Qataris isolated.” Qatar and UAE authorities did not respond to requests for comment. Riyadh and Abu Dhabi continue to reassure Washington that the dispute will not deter the formation of a proposed Middle East security alliance, which would include Doha, diplomats said. They said the UAE still strongly supports Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman against Iran and on his economic and social reforms, seen by Abu Dhabi as essential to replicating the UAE model of a business-friendly, tolerant Muslim society to combat extremism. “The Emiratis see Saudi Arabia as the only choice to lead the region. They haven’t blinked in their belief that Riyadh’s reform plans are the best and only option,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for the Arabian Peninsula at the International Crisis Group.

News article:
Cairo, Sanaa, Aden – Ali Rabih and Asharq Al-Awsat The Yemeni legitimate government agreed on Monday to participate in the upcoming peace consultations, scheduled for Sweden before the end of the month. Culture Minister Marwan Dammaj hoped that the Iran-backed Houthi militias will attend the talks without placing any preconditions as they did during the last round. The last round was held in Geneva in September, but they failed after the Houthis made demands that were not met. This prompted their no-show at the consultations, dooming them to fail. Dammaj added to Asharq Al-Awsat that Yemen rejects western attempts that are trying to transform the country into an arena to “appease Iran” at the expense of the Yemeni people and their national interest. He added that western powers are showing interest in the Yemen conflict because they want to exploit it to exert pressure on Saudi Arabia and achieve their interests. He condemned such motives, saying they are part of a greater agenda to “divide Arabs along sectarian and tribal lines.” “Such an agenda will cripple the Arab nation and lead it to constantly remain dependent on the West and major powers,” he explained. Moreover, Dammaj rejected attempts to exploit the humanitarian file in Yemen for political purposes, criticizing western double standards in implementing UN Security Council resolutions. The Yemeni foreign ministry confirmed that “the government has informed the UN envoy to Yemen... that it will send a government delegation to the talks with the aim of reaching a political solution.” It hoped that the solution will be based on the Gulf initiative, national dialogue outcomes and UN Security Council resolution 2216. Meanwhile, the Houthi militias did not declare an open agreement to attend the Sweden talks. Head of the militias’ so-called Higher Revolutionary Committee Mohammed Ali al-Houthi did announce that the militias will stop firing rockets and launching drones in compliance with UN special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths’ request. Soon after he made his announcement, however, field sources in the Yemeni army said that they had detected a Houthi ballistic missile attack towards the liberated Midi directorate in northwestern Hajjah. The sources said the attack demonstrated the Houthis’ disregard for any alleged truce.

News article:
On September 19, a group of Yemeni human rights activists and journalists met with Mr. Kamel Jendoubi, the head of the prominent experts tasked with investigating human rights violations in Yemen. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the 39th session of the UN human rights council in Geneva, and it aimed to discuss the council’s August report, which stirred wide controversy due to some mistakes in it and due to its ignoring of many of the violations which the Houthis are committing in Yemen. I was one of the participants in this special meeting, which Jendoubi began with presenting the methodology adopted in preparing the report and the difficulties that the team confronted while visiting some areas that witnessed violations, as well as the obstacles which prevented the team from reaching other areas. The most significant thing that Jendoubi told us that day was that due to security threats, his team was prevented from reaching the Taiz governorate and other areas where the Houthis committed violations. Such organizations clearly support the Houthis. Yemenis on social media networks and in their gatherings wonder why does this always repeat as every time the Yemeni national army gets close to liberating any governorate, international organizations rush from day one to issue statements warning of the dangerous humanitarian situation Hamdan Alaly During the peak of the conversation, my friend Mansour al-Shadadi – a human rights activist from Marib – asked Jendoubi: “Why didn’t you visit Marib governorate to look into the crimes which the Houthis are committing there? It’s a secure city and the Houthis had bombarded it with missiles.” Jendoubi replied saying his team was prevented from entering it due to the security situation there. Advertisement I told him that the American envoy and other ambassadors and journalists from European countries continuously visit it, and it’s safe. Jendoubi interrupted me saying: “This is the envoy of America, a superpower,” to which I replied: “And you represent the UN!” The conversation ended with him saying: “The UN’s safety and security team is the one that prevented (our) team from reaching these governorates for security reasons and (we) cannot violate this.” Hence the UN report lacked the most important, brutal and dark side of the Houthis’ violations. UN contradictions On the same day, I met with Yemen's Deputy Human Rights Minister Nabil Abdul Hafiz and condemned the government’s lack of action – represented in its human rights and interior ministries – to secure the team’s visit to Taiz and Marib to look into the violations which the Houthis are committing there. Abdul Hafiz confirmed to me that the ministry repeatedly asked the team, both in written and oral requests, to go to Taiz and Marib and guaranteed it full protection but these demands were rejected. This is also what Yemen’s Minister of Human Rights Mohammed Askar confirmed to me later. OPINION: How Houthi criminal violations are ‘covered up’ in Yemen I recalled these details while reading news that a high-level delegation from international organizations, including UN organizations, risked itself to enter Hodeidah last Tuesday as armed confrontations were ongoing in different areas in and around the city. A delegation headed by Executive Director of the World Food Program David Beasley (who runs operations in more than 90 countries), UN Humanitarian Coordinator Lise Grande and others risked their lives and entered Hodeidah as they heard the gunfire, explosions and the roar of guns and fighter jets! The aim was to suspend the operations to liberate Hodeidah and save the Houthi armed militias, which the UN views in its decisions as rebellious. Before this huge contradiction, what can we the Yemenis understand? Such organizations clearly support the Houthis. Yemenis on social media networks and in their gatherings wonder why does this always repeat as every time the Yemeni national army gets close to liberating any governorate, international organizations rush from day one to issue statements warning of the dangerous humanitarian situation for the purpose of halting the liberation of these governorates?! These organizations keep silent when the Houthi militias commit violations against civilians. Hypocrisy It’s worth remembering that these international organizations kept silent when the heavily armed Houthis marched towards Sanaa and the rest of the governorates and they were even silent when the Houthis besieged Taiz and did not allow bringing in water, food and medicine resulting in the death of premature infants in hospitals because they lacked life-saving oxygen! Everyone still remembers what happened on January 22, 2016 when the United Nations Department of Safety and Security risked the lives of seven of the UN organizations’ chiefs, including the former humanitarian coordinator, to enter Taiz and issue a shameful statement announcing there was no humanitarian siege on the city. After three and a half years, none of these organizations can today issue a statement or a report acknowledging there is a humanitarian siege on Taiz. ALSO READ: When Israel kills Palestinians with impunity, why a ‘death penalty’ law? The same applies to non-UN organizations. What makes a British “charity” organization that practices political activities and carries out funded and supported media campaigns in Europe and the US demand changing or amending UN Security Council Resolution 2216 which obligates the Houthis to hand over their weapons towards guaranteeing restoring the state and ending the war? There is a huge amount of suspicious activities and shameful violations which some international organizations operating in Yemen are committing; hence confirming the political involvement and the scandalous exploitation of the humanitarian situation to obstruct any military efforts that seek to restore the state and liberate Yemen from the violence of the descent that claims that God granted it the right to enslave and control the Yemeni people. The Yemenis now know your conspiracies and your harmonious efforts along with the orientations of some states that are keen on keeping the armed Houthi militia in the Arabian Peninsula to be a dagger in the Arabs’ waist… but this will be in vain!

News article:
Efforts to end Yemen's devastating war picked up pace on Monday as the government and rebels edged closer to peace talks and Britain led a push at the UN Security Council for an immediate truce.The moves come ahead of a visit in the next few days to the Arabian Peninsula country by UN envoy Martin Griffiths, who is once again trying to get all sides around the negotiating table."The government has informed the UN envoy to Yemen... that it will send a government delegation to the talks with the aim of reaching a political solution," Yemen's foreign ministry said, quoted by the official Saba news agency.Earlier, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the Houthi rebels' Higher Revolutionary Committee and an influential political figure, tweeted that he wanted his group to announce "readiness to suspend and halt all military operations" and stop firing missiles on Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia, which is leading a coalition backing the Yemeni government, also lent its support to new talks.A UN draft resolution on Yemen presented to the Security Council on Monday calls for an immediate truce in the battleground port city of Hodeida, according to the draft seen by AFP.The text, circulated by Britain to the 14 other council members, sets a two-week deadline for the warring sides to remove all barriers to humanitarian aid.The proposed resolution would significantly ratchet up the pressure on the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-linked Houthi rebels to seek a negotiated settlement in Yemen, where millions are on the brink of starvation.It also calls for a large injection of foreign currency into the economy through the central back to support Yemen's collapsing currency and for salaries of civil servants, teachers and health workers to be paid within one month.The Houthis have controlled Yemen's capital Sanaa since capturing it in late 2014. They also still hold Hodeida, home to a key port on the Red Sea.The rebels have also fired hundreds of ballistic missiles into neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which has since 2015 has led a military coalition to restore to power President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's government.Residents of Sanaa, interviewed by AFP, welcomed the Houthi call to halt military operations."This initiative is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength to prevent bloodshed and for life to go on," Mohammed al-Jouri said on the streets of the capital.Griffiths also hailed the rebel move towards ending missile strikes, saying he "hopes that all parties continue to exercise restraint to create a conducive environment" for talks.The envoy will visit Sanaa on Wednesday, a source in his office said. He is expected to finalise arrangements for peace talks in Sweden, a date for which has not yet been set.On Monday, Saudi King Salman told the Shura Council, his country's top advisory body, that Riyadh also supported a "political solution" and a "comprehensive national dialogue" in Yemen.Multiple past attempts to hold negotiations between the government alliance and Houthis have failed.Griffiths said he hoped the rivals would meet in Sweden "within the next few weeks" to seek "an appropriate formula for the involvement of Ansarullah (the Houthis' movement) and other political parties throughout Yemen in a government of unity".He told Sky News an agreement had been reached to ensure Houthi delegates could attend the talks without fear of being prevented from returning to Yemen, an obstacle that doomed peace talks slated to take place in Geneva in September.The Houthis' foreign minister, Hisham Sharaf Abdallah, met UN officials late Sunday, and was quoted by the rebels' news agency as saying that the UN and the international community should "adopt the political path to stop the bloodshed".British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt arrived Monday in Iran for the first time to discuss Tehran's role in Yemen, meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif."We are very, very keen to move towards peace in Yemen. That's our number one priority at the moment," Hunt told British television after the talks.Fighting in Yemen intensified at the start of November as the coalition renewed an offensive aimed at seizing Hodeida, whose port serves as entry point for nearly all of the country's imports and humanitarian aid.Pro-government forces announced a pause in their offensive last week as international pressure grew for a ceasefire.But the coalition insisted Monday that their operations were still ongoing, with spokesperson Turki al-Maliki saying they were targeting rebel reinforcements even as he voiced support for the talks.An AFP correspondent in Hodeida said Monday the city remained calm, although the rebel-run Al-Masirah TV said the coalition had carried out seven air strikes in the surrounding province and one inside Hodeida city.The rebels also reported fresh clashes in a battle front near Sanaa on Monday, Al-Masirah said.The World Health Organisation says nearly 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen since the Saudi intervention in March 2015, but rights groups believe the toll may be five times higher.The war in Yemen - already one of the world's most impoverished countries - has left the nation on the edge of mass starvation.

Efforts to end Yemen's devastating war picked up pace on Monday as the government and rebels edged closer to peace talks and Britain led a push at the UN Security Council for an immediate truce.The moves come ahead of a visit in the next few days to the Arabian Peninsula country by UN envoy Martin Griffiths, who is once again trying to get all sides around the negotiating table."The government has informed the UN envoy to Yemen... that it will send a government delegation to the talks with the aim of reaching a political solution," Yemen's foreign ministry said, quoted by the official Saba news agency.Earlier, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the Houthi rebels' Higher Revolutionary Committee and an influential political figure, tweeted that he wanted his group to announce "readiness to suspend and halt all military operations" and stop firing missiles on Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia, which is leading a coalition backing the Yemeni government, also lent its support to new talks.A UN draft resolution on Yemen presented to the Security Council on Monday calls for an immediate truce in the battleground port city of Hodeida, according to the draft seen by AFP.The text, circulated by Britain to the 14 other council members, sets a two-week deadline for the warring sides to remove all barriers to humanitarian aid.The proposed resolution would significantly ratchet up the pressure on the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-linked Houthi rebels to seek a negotiated settlement in Yemen, where millions are on the brink of starvation.It also calls for a large injection of foreign currency into the economy through the central back to support Yemen's collapsing currency and for salaries of civil servants, teachers and health workers to be paid within one month.The Houthis have controlled Yemen's capital Sanaa since capturing it in late 2014. They also still hold Hodeida, home to a key port on the Red Sea.The rebels have also fired hundreds of ballistic missiles into neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which has since 2015 has led a military coalition to restore to power President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's government.Residents of Sanaa, interviewed by AFP, welcomed the Houthi call to halt military operations."This initiative is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength to prevent bloodshed and for life to go on," Mohammed al-Jouri said on the streets of the capital.Griffiths also hailed the rebel move towards ending missile strikes, saying he "hopes that all parties continue to exercise restraint to create a conducive environment" for talks.The envoy will visit Sanaa on Wednesday, a source in his office said. He is expected to finalise arrangements for peace talks in Sweden, a date for which has not yet been set.On Monday, Saudi King Salman told the Shura Council, his country's top advisory body, that Riyadh also supported a "political solution" and a "comprehensive national dialogue" in Yemen.Multiple past attempts to hold negotiations between the government alliance and Houthis have failed.Griffiths said he hoped the rivals would meet in Sweden "within the next few weeks" to seek "an appropriate formula for the involvement of Ansarullah (the Houthis' movement) and other political parties throughout Yemen in a government of unity".He told Sky News an agreement had been reached to ensure Houthi delegates could attend the talks without fear of being prevented from returning to Yemen, an obstacle that doomed peace talks slated to take place in Geneva in September.The Houthis' foreign minister, Hisham Sharaf Abdallah, met UN officials late Sunday, and was quoted by the rebels' news agency as saying that the UN and the international community should "adopt the political path to stop the bloodshed".British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt arrived Monday in Iran for the first time to discuss Tehran's role in Yemen, meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif."We are very, very keen to move towards peace in Yemen. That's our number one priority at the moment," Hunt told British television after the talks.Fighting in Yemen intensified at the start of November as the coalition renewed an offensive aimed at seizing Hodeida, whose port serves as entry point for nearly all of the country's imports and humanitarian aid.Pro-government forces announced a pause in their offensive last week as international pressure grew for a ceasefire.But the coalition insisted Monday that their operations were still ongoing, with spokesperson Turki al-Maliki saying they were targeting rebel reinforcements even as he voiced support for the talks.An AFP correspondent in Hodeida said Monday the city remained calm, although the rebel-run Al-Masirah TV said the coalition had carried out seven air strikes in the surrounding province and one inside Hodeida city.The rebels also reported fresh clashes in a battle front near Sanaa on Monday, Al-Masirah said.The World Health Organisation says nearly 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen since the Saudi intervention in March 2015, but rights groups believe the toll may be five times higher.The war in Yemen - already one of the world's most impoverished countries - has left the nation on the edge of mass starvation.

Hunger and disease have killed 85,000 children under the age of five in Yemen since 2015, according to Save the Children. Its estimate coincides with a UN envoy's visit to Sanaa as the warring parties prepare for talks. Humanitarian organization Save the Children estimates 85,000 children under five years of age have died in Yemen since the war started, its representatives said. The group said its figures were based on historically verified mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition or SAM. These show that up to 30 percent of under-5's die if their malnutrition is neglected. "For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable," said the charity's Yemen director Tamer Kirolos. "Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop." Read more: Struggling to stay neutral in Sanaa The UN did not provide a malnutrition death toll in Yemen, but its officials say 300,000 under-5's are at risk of dying in what the UN considers the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Proxy war Last month, the UN's World Food Program warned that the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran had already put 8 million — over half of Yemen's 14 million people — on the brink of famine. A database run by ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) puts Yemen's losses since early 2016 at 57,000. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 in a bid to restore a government that had been ousted by ethnic Houthi rebels in 2014. The fighting is currenly focused on the main port city of Hodeida, a supply line for the Iran-aligned rebels on Yemen's western Red Sea coast. The Saudi-led blockade was tightened a year ago. Aid groups have warned that an all-out assault on the port city would endanger 80 percent of Yemen's humanitarian aid, including food imports. Shelling in Hodeida Hodeida has seen shelling by pro-government and Houthi militias in recent days after the rebels declared a halt to missile and drone attacks on the Saudi-led coalition that includes United Arab Emirates forces. Pro-government troops on Hodeida's outskirts Image: Getty Images/AFP Arriving in the capital, Sanaa, Wednesday,UN envoy Martin Griffiths said both sides had agreed to attend peace talks in Sweden "soon." After talks with rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi, Griffiths was expected to travel on to Hodeida on Thursday. A draft resolution, cited by Reuters, calls for halting the fighting around Hodeida and other populated areas, ensuring the flow of commercial and humanitarian goods and a fast injection of foreign currency into Yemen's impoverished economy. A previous bid to launch UN-sponsored talks in September in Geneva collapsed when the Houthi rebels failed to show up. ipj,dj/msh (dpa, AP, Reuters)

News article:
Riyadh – Abdulhadi Habtor British Ambassador to Yemen Michael Aron accused the Iran-backed Houthi militias of hindering the delivery of food aid to the Yemeni people, which is aggravating the country’s humanitarian crisis. He did, however, hail the undeclared truce that was announced in Yemen, saying it will lay the foundation for the upcoming peace consultations that are scheduled for Sweden before the end of the month. Aron told Asharq Al-Awsat that United Nations Security Council resolution 2216 is the main basis for a solution and negotiations in Yemen. The draft resolution that was presented by the UK to the Security Council does not substitute resolution 2216. The draft tackles humanitarian aspects of the conflict, not political ones, he clarified. Asked about the preparations for the Stockholm talks and the extent of the Houthis’ commitment to attend them, Aron replied that UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, was leading a good team and that the upcoming consultations are very important for the country’s peace and stability. He believed that both sides of the conflict were serious in participating in the consultations, adding that London welcomes the Houthi announcement that they were ceasing ballistic missile and drone attacks. The Houthis claim that they are serious about peace, but it is important for them to translate this stance at the negotiations and on the ground, he remarked. The last round of consultations were held in Geneva in September. The Houthis did not attend the talks, making last-minute demands that doomed the consultations to failure. Asked about the repercussions should any of the concerned parties fail to attend the new round of consultations, Aron warmed that the international community’s reaction will be strong. He added, however, that he was optimistic that all sides involved will head to Sweden. Moreover, he cited the recent tour of the region by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying it was successful because it led to an agreement over the evacuation of wounded Houthis so that they could receive medical treatment. This was one of the main issues that had hindered the militias’ participation in the Geneva talks and it has now been resolved, noted the ambassador. Hunt had held talks during his visit with Custodian the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riaydh. He also met with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi. The Saudi and Emirati officials expressed to Hunt their desire for peace and stability in Yemen, adding that they supported Griffiths’ mission, Aron told Asharq Al-Awsat. Turning to the unofficial ceasefire in Yemen, he said that the developments on the ground indicate that it was being upheld. The Arab coalition, though, does not appear too keen on the truce because it believes that it will ease the pressure off the Houthis. It believes that military pressure is important in pushing them towards heading to negotiations, he explained. Asked about Yemeni criticism against the international community, including Britain, that it only acts when the Houthis are being cornered, he replied that since the eruption of the crisis, London sought to issue resolution 2216, which condemns the militias. He added that London also recognizes the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and stands by the Arab coalition. He stressed that Houthi attacks and their occupation of Yemeni regions is a catastrophe. A political solution is necessary for the problem It is laughable for the Houthis to believe that Britain is their ally, Aron added. Furthermore, he condemned in the strongest terms ballistic missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The use of Sanaa airport for these attacks is unacceptable. The facility should be used for civil, not military purposes. On Saudi efforts to support Yemen, he noted that Kingdom was its greatest financial backer. Addressing Hunt’s recent visit to Tehran, the ambassador said that London believes that Iran is part of the problem in Yemen and it hopes that it can instead be part of the solution. It would be better for the Iranians to withdraw from Yemen and leave the Yemeni parties to solve their problems themselves, he stressed.

News article:
Nearly 85,000 children under the age of five have died from acute malnutrition in Yemen since the start of the conflict, an international NGO said on Wednesday, after humanitarian officials warned that the war-torn nation was heading towards the worst famine in history. The statement by UK-headquartered Save the Children came a day after Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Mohammed bin Saeed Al Jaber met the Head of the International Committee of the Red Cross for the GCC, Yahya Al Oleibi, to discuss co-operation over the humanitarian situation in Yemen, according to the Saudi Press Agency. Eight million Yemenis are currently affected by severe food shortages, according to UN officials, who warned that up to 14 million – or half of Yemen's population – are at risk of famine. Of that number, 1.8 million are children under five years old who are described as acutely malnourished. Another 400,000 are severely acutely malnourished, and yet another 1.1 million are malnourished pregnant or nursing women. “I saw children dying before my very own eyes,” the head of the UN World Food Programme, who visited Yemen last week, said in a televised interview with CNN. David Beasley said he tried to tickle the children expecting them to smile, but it felt instead “like tickling ghosts”. Aid organisations blame both Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition for deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the country. Aid groups, including Save the Children, say not enough food is entering the country through Yemen's main port of Hodeidah. The rebel-held port, through which the country imported up to 90 per cent of its food before the war, has had a drop-off of commercial imports by more than 55,000 tonnes a month since the Saudi-led coalition imposed a blockade on the area a year ago, Save the Children said. This is only enough to meet the needs of 4.4 million people, including 2.2 million children, it said. Meanwhile, Mr Beasley said Houthi rebels were endangering humanitarian operations elsewhere in the country. The WFP chief accused the Iran-backed rebels of placing seven landmines inside grain bins in one of WFP’s grain silos in Hodeidah. He said his team found the landmines only two days after he had left Yemen. “They [Houthi rebels] have been entering our facilities, violating every humanitarian principle, putting our people, who are working there, putting their lives on the line,” he said. “This has got to stop.” The deputy governor of Hodeidah province, Waleed Al Qudaimi told The National that the Houthi militia was planting landmines and threatening food warehouses in an attempt to put pressure on relief organisations to providing food for the rebel group's fighters. He also claimed that rebels stole thousands of sacks of flour meant for families living in rebel-controlled parts of Hodeidah. Earlier on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates pledged $500 million (Dh1.8 billion) to tackle food shortages in Yemen. The new aid programme will provide food assistance to up to 12 million Yemenis. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are working with organisations on the ground to ensure aid and food assistance reaches the most vulnerable populations, Reem Al Hashimy, UAE Minister of State for International Co-operation, told a news conference. “We are focusing on the most affected groups, especially malnourished children, pregnant women and the elderly,” she told reporters. “We will ensure that humanitarian conditions improve.” Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, where 8.3 million people are dependent on food aid, according to the UN. The nearly three-year civil war has pushed the country to edge of famine with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to push back the Houthi rebels and restore the government of President Abdrabu Mansur Hadi. The Houthi rebels, backed by the Iranian regime, have repeatedly launched ballistic missile towards Saudi. _______________ Read more: Editorial: The moment for peace in Yemen must be seized Arab Coalition throws its weight behind Yemen peace talks Unicef says 'every 10 minutes' a child is dying in Yemen

Iran hosting international conference on Yemen amid Saudi war Press TV – The International Conference on Supporting the Oppressed and Resistant Yemenis has kicked off in the Iranian capital, with dozens of intellectuals and civil rights activists from 35 countries in attendance. The event, which opened in Tehran on Thursday morning, is expected to highlight the sufferings of the Yemeni nation caused by a brutal Saudi-led war on the impoverished country. The one-day conference will also feature speeches by Iranian officials and several representatives from resistance movements in the region. Iran stands by war-stricken Yemenis Addressing the summit, the head of Iranian volunteer Basij forces said that Yemeni people’s resistance against the Saudi aggression will live on in history. Brigadier-General Gholam-Hossein Gheibparvar Iran, as a nation that has itself suffered from US mischief economic blockade, and war, understands the ordeals of the Yemeni people. Backed by the US and the UK, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of its vassal states unleashed the deadly military aggression against Yemen in March 2015 in an attempt to reinstall the country’s former Riyadh-allied regime. The Saudi-led offensive, coupled with a naval blockade, has destroyed Yemen’s infrastructure and led to famine in the import-dependent state. The military standoff has so far killed about 56,000 Yemeni people, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a nonprofit conflict-research organization, said in a report last month. According to latest calculations by Save the Children, nearly 85,000 Yemeni children may have died of starvation amid the Saudi war Turning a deaf ear to international warnings, the Saudi-led military alliance has been engaged in a concerted push since June to seize Yemen’s port city of Hudaydah, a vital conduit and lifeline for aid delivery to Yemeni civilians. Yemeni armed forces, led by the Houthi Ansarullah movement, have put of stiff resistance in the face of the Saudi-led campaign with the help of popular forces, preventing Riyadh and its allies to achieve their goals of war. Referring to the remarkable the Yemeni forces have been showing in Hudaydah, Gheibparvar said, “What is taking place in Yemen is a lesson of withstanding. All [enemies] have gathered in Hudaydah, but people have been standing against them with empty hands.”

Sheikh Abdullah called Iran a “neighbouring country that deserves to be like any other country seeking development and serving its people” but he criticised the country’s leadership for placing its priorities elsewhere. “I hope there are minds in Iran that desire stability in Iran and the region to change the current path.” The UAE’s support came as US State Department released another statement calling “for all parties to support Martin Griffiths by immediately ceasing hostilities and engaging in direct talks aimed at ending the conflict.” Spokeswoman Heather Nauert referred to a statement by UN Special Envoy that “the Houthis and the Republic of Yemen Government are committed to attending the consultations in Sweden, and we call on the parties to follow through on that commitment.” “The time for direct talks and building mutual confidence is now,” Ms Nauert said. _______________ Read more: Mattis says Hodeidah operation halted ahead of Yemen talks UN envoy Martin Griffiths arrives in Sanaa to lay groundwork for peace talks _______________ US Defence Secretary James Mattis also sounded upbeat about the prospects of talks. He told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday that “it looks like very, very early in December up in Sweden we’ll see both the Houthi rebel side and the UN-recognised President Hadi government will be up there.” “The Saudis and the Emiratis are fully on board,” he said. Pressure has been mounting from Congress on the Trump administration to push for a political solution for the war. Fear of a widespread humanitarian catastrophe and an economic collapse have triggered a sense of urgency to pursue negotiations. A report by the non-governmental organization Save The Children on Tuesday estimated that around 85,000 children may have died of hunger in the war-ravaged country.

News article:
Mattis: Yemen Peace Talks Expected in Early December By VOA News November 21, 2018 U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths is in war-torn Yemen to prepare for peace talks after fresh fighting erupted in the key port of Hodeida. Griffiths was scheduled to meet with Iran-aligned Houthi officials in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in an attempt to persuade them and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government to begin negotiations in Sweden by year's end. The peace process collapsed in Switzerland in September when Houthi rebels failed to appear. Both sides recently expressed support for Griffiths' efforts, but the eruption of violence after a lull raised the possibility talks could be derailed. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday he expected the warring parties would hold peace talks in Sweden early next month. Monday in New York, U.N. Security Council member Britain circulated a draft resolution to the rest of the council, calling for a cease-fire in Yemen, a halt to attacks on civilian areas, and unhindered access to Hodeida. The port is under rebel control and is a lifeline for food, fuel, and humanitarian aid to the suffering population. The Saudis have accused Iran of sending arms to the rebels through the port, a charge it denies. The Trump administration has joined its Western allies in demanding a cease-fire in Yemen. The United States has stopped providing refueling services to Saudi coalition aircraft that attack Yemen. The Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014, forcing the government to flee to exile in Saudi Arabia. The group has since relocated to the southern Yemeni city of Aden. Saudi-led airstrikes aimed at driving out the Houthis have killed thousands of people and wiped out entire civilian neighborhoods, including hospitals. The fighting has compounded the misery in Yemen, which is also dealing with mass starvation and a cholera outbreak. The war has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis. The World Health Organization estimates nearly 10,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Yemen since the Saudis intervened in March 2015. Some human rights groups, however, believe the death toll may be five times higher. The International aid group Save the Children said in a report Wednesday about 85,000 children may have died of starvation and disease since March 2015. The United Nations estimates more than 1.3 million children have suffered from severe malnutrition since the war began, it says up to 14 million Yemenis are at risk of starvation if the port is closed by violence or damage.

News article:
The U.N. envoy to Yemen on Friday urged warring sides to "keep the peace" in Hodeida, saying the rebels agreed to talks on the U.N. taking a leading role in running the lifeline port. Griffiths, who started a Yemen peace mission in Houthi-held Sanaa on Wednesday, said he has discussed with Houthi rebel officials "how the U.N. could contribute to keeping the peace" in the key port city of Hodeida. "I am here to tell you today that we have agreed that the U.N. should now pursue actively and urgently detailed negotiations for a leading U.N. role in the port and more broadly," he told reporters during his first visit to Hodeida. "We believe that such a role will preserve the essential humanitarian pipeline that starts here and serves the people of Yemen." Griffiths urged Yemen's warring parties to "keep the peace" in the rebel-held Red Sea port city, which serves as the entry point of nearly all imports and humanitarian aid into the impoverished country. "The attention of the world is on Hodeida. Leaders from every country have called for us all to keep the peace in Hodeida," he said. Griffiths's visit began as the Houthi-held capital of Sanaa was rocked by a string of intermittent explosions amid fighting between Houthi fighters and forces loyal to the Yemeni government, which is currently headquartered in the southern city of Aden. Griffiths was in the country ahead of planned peace talks in Sweden in December between the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels and pro-government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition. The government claims that the Houthis use Hodeida to import weapons from Iran. The port is also considered the main conduit into the country for humanitarian aid. Impoverished Yemen has remained wracked by violence since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated in 2015 when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a devastating air campaign in Yemen aimed at rolling back Houthi gains. Tens of thousands of people -- including numerous Yemeni civilians -- are believed to have been killed in the conflict, which has left much of the country's basic infrastructure in ruins.

News article:
As pressure grows for a ceasefire in Yemen it seems likely that there will be some form of de-escalation soon, if not a full-fledged ceasefire. Indeed, a modest de-escalation has already been affected as demonstrated by the Ansarullah movement's (aka the Houthis) decision to stop missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Calls for a ceasefire have increased in recent weeks, in part due to the repercussions of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The United Kingdom has taken the lead on this by submitting a draft proposal for a limited ceasefire to the United Nations Security Council. Moreover, the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt raised the issue on his visit to Iran where he tried to elicit Tehran's support for the UK's plans. Meanwhile, on the ground, fierce fighting is continuing in the key port of Hudaydah as the Saudi-Emirati coalition tries to make maximum gains ahead of a possible limited ceasefire centred on Hudaydah and surrounding areas. READ: Saudi-led coalition halts assault on Yemen's Hudaydah However, a cessation of hostilities without a clear roadmap for a lasting political solution is likely to make matters worse in the long run. Yemen is riven with deep divisions at every level, some of which, notably the quest by southern secessionists for independence, threaten the very integrity of the Yemeni state. Currently, the country's deep political divisions are masked by the intensity of the fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi-UAE coalition. Once that fighting stops, other divisions will likely come to the fore, leading to the de facto partition of Yemen. Can a ceasefire hold? The latest news on the diplomatic aspects of the Yemen conflict suggests that even a limited ceasefire is not guaranteed at this point. The Trump administration has reportedly "slammed on the brakes" on a British-sponsored draft resolution, apparently for fear of isolating the Saudi leadership. It is also important to note that the British diplomatic initiative is exclusively focussed on securing a ceasefire at the port of Hudaydah where the fiercest fighting is concentrated. But the conflict between the Houthis and their allies on the one hand and the Saudi-UAE supported Aden-based government on the other, rages on many fronts, albeit intermittently. In July forces loosely aligned to the Aden-based government made a lightning advance on Hajjah province in the north before they were beaten back by the Houthis. At around the same time in the summer Aden-based government-aligned forces made a push into the eastern part Saada province (the heartland of the Houthis), with full Saudi air cover, but despite the repeated air strikes that offensive also stalled. The failure of the Saudi-directed offensives in Hajjah and Saada during the summer reflect two overriding facts. First, the Saudi-led coalition is reliant on poorly trained and often poorly motivated tribal fighters in the field. Whilst these forces fought well in Aden back in 2015 and performed similarly well in Taiz where they managed to contain a Houthi-led siege, their performance further afield has been poor. READ: Yemen National Army pushes into northern Houthi stronghold Second, Saudi-directed offensives close to the Houthi heartlands in the north are as much about distraction than of a genuine military push into these areas. The Houthis have taken the fight deep inside Saudi Arabia's Asir region as early as 2016 and continue to fire ballistic missiles at targets deep inside Asir and the neighbouring Jizan region. The latest reported missile strikes on targets in Asir and Jizan occurred yesterday, despite earlier Houthi assurances to discontinue missile attacks in preparation for a limited ceasefire. By appearing to harass the Houthis in their northern strongholds the Saudis hope to distract attention away from the fact that the Ansarullah movement has demonstrated military sophistication and political resolve by taking the fight deep inside Saudi Arabia. The complexity of the Yemeni battlefields – coupled with the fact that the Ansarullah movement has gained a tenuous foothold inside Saudi Arabia – calls into question the longevity of any "limited" ceasefire. Ceasefire talks are set to start in the Swedish capital Stockholm next week and it remains to be seen if Saudi Arabia guarantees safe passage to a Houthi delegation travelling from Sana'a. Back in September ceasefire talks in Geneva were abandoned because guarantees of safe passage had not been made to the Houthi delegation. Illusion of peace Assuming the talks in Stockholm take place as scheduled in early December and assuming further that a "limited" ceasefire centred on Hudaydah is secured, based on the current military, political and strategic configurations a wider peace is still firmly beyond reach. For a start, the Saudis will find it hard to cease air strikes indefinitely, especially when presented with opportunities to target the Houthi leadership, similar to the air strike back in April which targeted the Sana'a based interior ministry reportedly killing two Houthi leaders. Then there is the issue of the political and military divergence at the heart of the anti-Houthi coalition. The Saudis and Emiratis appear to be fighting separate campaigns in Yemen, backing competing groups and scrambling to consolidate their respective positions in Aden. Tensions came to the fore in January when Saudi-backed forces nominally aligned to the fledgling government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi clashed with fighters loyal to the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council which is clamouring for secession. READ: Houthis want war, reject peace In their drive to shape Yemeni politics to suit their respective strategic postures, the Saudis and Emiratis have intervened in local politics to the point of dangerously intensifying underlying fissures and centrifugal forces. For example, the Saudis appear to tolerate hardline Salafi factions and even jihadist groups, notably Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, both of which have been central to Saudi efforts at containing the Houthi siege of the south-western city of Taiz. Meanwhile, the UAE reportedly commissioned American and Israeli mercenaries to kill the leaders of Al-Islah, the Yemeni chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood. Subsequent attempts by the UAE to reach out to Al-Islah, including a meeting in Abu Dhabi between UAE Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed and Al-Islah leaders, reflects the UAE's weak position ahead of ceasefire talks in Sweden. At a deeper level, it betrays the Emirate's volatile and in the long run untenable position in Yemen. In view of this confusing picture, the Saudis and Emiratis may well sabotage any limited ceasefire flowing out of the talks in Sweden for fear of expediting their collapsing positions in Yemen. The inherently fragile Yemeni coalition that is ranged against the cohesive Ansarullah movement is likely to implode once fighting against the Houthis stops. At that point, a vicious civil war could break out in the south. Yemen it seems may not survive the proposed ceasefire.

News article:
As pressure grows for a ceasefire in Yemen it seems likely that there will be some form of de-escalation soon, if not a full-fledged ceasefire. Indeed, a modest de-escalation has already been affected as demonstrated by the Ansarullah movement's (aka the Houthis) decision to stop missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Calls for a ceasefire have increased in recent weeks, in part due to the repercussions of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The United Kingdom has taken the lead on this by submitting a draft proposal for a limited ceasefire to the United Nations Security Council. Moreover, the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt raised the issue on his visit to Iran where he tried to elicit Tehran's support for the UK's plans. Meanwhile, on the ground, fierce fighting is continuing in the key port of Hudaydah as the Saudi-Emirati coalition tries to make maximum gains ahead of a possible limited ceasefire centred on Hudaydah and surrounding areas. READ: Saudi-led coalition halts assault on Yemen's Hudaydah However, a cessation of hostilities without a clear roadmap for a lasting political solution is likely to make matters worse in the long run. Yemen is riven with deep divisions at every level, some of which, notably the quest by southern secessionists for independence, threaten the very integrity of the Yemeni state.

The Yemeni government rejected the Houthi militias’ proposal of handing over the supervision of the Hodeidah Port to the UN, adding that by doing this, the Houthis only aim to mislead and re-position themselves. The Houthis have agreed to hand over supervision of the port to the UN under the condition that the port’s revenues be handed over to the Central Bank in Sanaa, controlled by the militias. Advertisement “Handing over the port of Hodeidah to anyone other than the legitimacy is a violation of sovereignty,” the government said in a statement. Minister of State Mohammed al-Amiri said the Houthis have been looting the state’s revenues through the port for four years and practiced piracy, threatened international navigation, committed crimes and thwarted humanitarian aid. Negotiations over the Hodeidah Port came amid violent clashes in Al-Khamseen Street where national army forces and Houthi militias exchanged artillery shelling. Meanwhile, the coalition’s air force targeted Houthi posts and military vehicles in several areas in Hodeidah. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to the United States Prince Khalid bin Salman has said that only consistent pressure on the Iran-backed Houthi militias would eventually lead to a political solution in Yemen. “After stalling for months, the Houthis agreed to talk about handing some control of Hodeidah port to the UN,” Prince Khalid tweeted on Tuesday. “This comes as they are on the verge of being pushed out by force; proof that only consistent pressure on the Iran backed militia will lead to a political settlement,” he added.

DUBAI: Houthi militias are using civilians as human shields in Hodeidah, Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed told the UN humanitarian coordinator in Yemen during their meeting on Tuesday. “The Iranian-backed Houthi militia controls the city, takes civilians as human shields, deprives them of humanitarian aid and sells it in the market for their personal gain and to finance their wars,” the Yemeni prime minister said. At the meeting in the interim capital of Aden with Lise Grande, the prime minister discussed the efforts and projects of the United Nations in Yemen during the last period and the situation in Hodeidah. He urged the UN and international organizations to provide more assistance to those affected in Yemen, suffering from the humanitarian crisis that has resulted from the war being waged by the militia against Yemeni people. The prime minister urged aid organizations to open their offices in the Aden to ensure delivery of projects and supplies to Yemenis affected by the war in all areas. Meanwhile, Yemeni Minister of Endowments and Guidance, Ahmad Attiya said that reinstating political leadership to the internationally recognized government and liberating Hodeidah from the Houthis was inevitable. “The Houthi militias do not believe in peace and co-existence because they are a militia that receives its guidance from Iran and is trying to change the identity of Yemen and extract it from its Arab surroundings,” he said at a lecture given at the University of Saba in the Yemeni province of Marib. Attiya claimed that the Houthi militias manipulate young people and recruit them into their wars, violating international human rights laws.

News article:
Riyadh – Abdulhadi Habtour The Yemeni Mothers of Abductees Association, a pressure group led by mothers, wives and daughters whose fathers, sons and husbands are imprisoned and tortured by Houthi militias in Sanaa, urged UN Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths to step in and help free hundreds of journalists detained in coup prisons. A breaking story on four abducted journalists brutally tortured by Houthi militias in Sanaa, their stronghold, shocked Yemenis nationwide. A new round of peace consultations is scheduled for early December, whereby Griffiths and the freely-elected government will have a chance to negotiate the release of journalists and anti-Iran dissidents kidnapped by Houthis. The Association on Tuesday issued a statement revealed shocking details on the torture of journalists Salah Al Qaidi, Akram Al Walidi, Hareth Hamid and Issam Belghaith faced in Houthi prisons. According to the statement, the detainees were stripped from their clothes and left to freeze in icy weather for four hours, and received an inhuman beating that left them unconscious. Iran-supported Houthi militias, undeterred, have been actively abducting journalists for nearly four years in a way amounting to human rights crimes. “This requires the urgent action of all human rights organizations, human rights activists and media personnel to step in and save and end the suffering of thousands of abductees held in coup prisons,” the statement read. According to Reporters without Borders (RSF) Press freedom has been dramatically curtailed by major political upheavals and violence including the seizure of the capital, Sanaa, by Iran-allied Houthis. Journalists are now constantly exposed to threats, attacks, and abduction. As for access to information on the internet, many websites are blocked since the Houthis took control of the Ministry of Telecommunications. Citizen-journalists are under surveillance in all areas of Yemen and get arrested for posts on social media. Yemen is ranked 167th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2018 World Press Freedom Index. In one of the monitor’s reports, Houthis militias were found responsible for the death of 26 journalists and media professionals, between 2014 and 2017, and 825 violations of press freedoms. Documenting Houthi transgressions against press freedoms and the right to information, a 2017 UN report revealed that the Iran-backed group had also blocked 21 websites, 7 television channels and banned 18 newspapers.

News article:
UN’s Yemen envoy unlikely to deliver a miracle in Stockholm Mohamed Chebaro UN envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths. (AFP) After fruitless meetings in Sanaa, Muscat, Riyadh, Geneva and Kuwait, will the Yemen peace talks in Stockholm be any different? Despite a different UN special envoy to Yemen, and a new drive by the international community to settle the conflict, the talks in Sweden are unlikely to yield much. Martin Griffiths, the new UN envoy, will try his luck but the situation on the ground remains unchanged and therefore I doubt the Iran-aligned Houthis are in the mood to yield to power-sharing or to equal representation in a united and peaceful Yemen that will coexist and cooperate with its neighbors. Since the uprising in Yemen broke out in early 2011, the UN has been trying to help Yemenis find a peaceful solution. It supported negotiations between the government and the opposition, resulting in the signing of the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its implementation mechanism in Riyadh in November 2011. Since then, four UN Security Council resolutions have been voted on, but none have made it as far as being acted on by the warring parties. Griffiths joined the fray after two previous UN envoys tried but failed to bridge the gap between the Houthi militia and the elected government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, which is now in exile and supported by the Saudi-led Arab coalition. Encouraged by new international resolve, Griffiths hopes to revive the peace process that will ultimately lead to a negotiated transition and power-sharing based on UN Security Council Resolution 2216. In Stockholm, Griffiths hopes to present his updated version of the “Framework for Negotiations,” which it is hoped will help the warring parties agree on a road map that will lead to an end to the war and a transitional deal. The framework, we are told, will include interim security and political arrangements, and the return of Yemen’s friendly relations with neighboring states and the restoring of state institutions. Griffiths hopes to go beyond the mere normalization of Yemen, as he hopes that his framework will ideally lead to principled compromises that will allow the people of Yemen to live again in peace. What the new UN envoy has not explained are the guarantees, if any, that he has received from the Houthi militia and its patron Iran to facilitate such a deal. Military experts would ask, since the Houthis have not suffered great losses and still have a firm grip on power in all strategic provinces from Saada close to the Saudi border all the way to Taiz in the south, why would they suddenly have the appetite to concede and share power? As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to Congress, the issue of Yemen and other hotspots in the Middle East are directly linked to Iran Mohamed Chebaro Iran might be minded to show flexibility in Yemen after the noose of US sanctions was tightened again this month, but at what price? All indications point to a less compromising Tehran after the reimposition of US sanctions. From Afghanistan to Iraq and through to Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza, Iran’s allies are not interested in compromising, sharing power, facilitating government formation, or the voting in of transition governments. Saudi Arabia, the party most affected by the Yemen conflict — as more than 200 ballistic missiles have been launched toward its southern provinces and even its capital Riyadh — has repeatedly expressed its willingness to seek a political settlement that protects Yemeni unity and stability in the Gulf region. There is now mounting pressure in the US for Washington to end its support for the Arab coalition in Yemen. By a bipartisan 63-37 vote, the Senate on Wednesday opted to move forward with legislation calling for an end to US involvement in Yemen, despite President Donald Trump’s opposition. But, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to Congress, the issue of Yemen and other hotspots in the Middle East are directly linked to Iran; and any drawdown by US lawmakers against Saudi Arabia would lead to a stronger Iran in the region. Griffiths insists that he has received assurance from the various Yemeni parties, including the Houthis and Hadi’s government, that they will attend the talks in Stockholm. But the real assurance that seems to be missing is the green light from Tehran, the Houthis’ main ally, about facilitating such a deal. The odds are that the negotiations will go ahead, but the secret potion to replace rivalry with peace is still elusive. The Yemen conflict is one flashpoint among many where Iran is meddling in its neighbors’ internal affairs and, unless a global approach is taken to accommodating Iran’s needs and interests with those of its neighboring states, peace talks will be a waste of time. The nuclear deal to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, which was brokered by the Obama administration, could have been an occasion to review and redraw the limits of Iranian influence in the region. That opportunity has been missed, and the Yemen conflict is unlikely to trigger a process to clip Iran’s wings. Griffiths believes there is a genuine drive from all sides to join the forthcoming Stockholm consultations, but all indicators — short of a major shift in the theater of war — point to the fact it is unlikely all parties will be swayed to compromise — at least not yet. Mohamed Chebaro is a British-Lebanese journalist with more than 25 years’ experience covering war, terrorism, defense, current affairs and diplomacy. He is also a media consultant and trainer.

Iran four-point plan on Yemen still only viable option: FM Zarif Press TV – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has once again assessed the viability of putting an end to the ongoing Saudi-led crisis in Yemen only through the Islamic Republic’s four-point plan. In a post on his official Twitter account on Friday, Zarif said he has announced Iran’s four-point proposal on the Yemeni crisis in April 2015. I said this on the crisis in Yemen in April 2015. Today, after untold human suffering & war crimes by the Saudi coalition & its U.S. accomplices, & efforts to whitewash their crimes with absurd allegations against Iran, our four-point plan still remains the only viable option. https://t.co/7CqVTIduF9 — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) November 30, 2018 “Today, after untold human suffering & war crimes by the Saudi coalition & its U.S. accomplices, & efforts to whitewash their crimes with absurd allegations against Iran, our four-point plan still remains the only viable option,” the top Iranian diplomat said. In April 2015, the Iranian foreign minister submitted a four-point peace plan for Yemen to the United Nations in an attempt to end the bloodshed in the Arab country. “It is imperative for the international community to get more effectively involved in ending the senseless aerial attacks and establishing a ceasefire,” Zarif said in the letter, adding that Tehran is ready to cooperate with the UN “to facilitate and encourage an immediate end to these senseless bombardments and initiation of a genuine dialogue to find a political solution to this tragic crisis.” Saudi Arabia and a number of its regional allies launched a devastating military campaign against Yemen in March 2015, with the aim of bringing the government of former Yemeni president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi back to power and crushing the country’s Houthi Ansarullah movement. According to a new report by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a nonprofit conflict-research organization, the Saudi-led war has so far claimed the lives of around 56,000 Yemenis. The Saudi-led war has also taken a heavy toll on the country’s infrastructure, destroying hospitals, schools, and factories. The UN has already said that a record 22.2 million Yemenis are in dire need of food, including 8.4 million threatened by severe hunger. According to the world body, Yemen is suffering from the most severe famine in more than 100 years. During a press briefing in the Yemeni capital Sana’a on Thursday, UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock appealed for a halt to fighting in Yemen. The UN official said the fighting has once again highlighted the ongoing humanitarian tragedy in the war-ravaged Arab country and said, “I’d like to see a cessation of hostilities, especially around the key infrastructure, especially around Hudaydah.” A number of Western countries, the US, France and Britain in particular, are also accused of being complicit in the ongoing aggression as they supply the Riyadh regime with advanced weapons and military equipment as well as logistical and intelligence assistance. US President Donald Trump, who has touted the country’s lucrative purchase of arms from the US, has threatened to veto a bill on ending the United States’ military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen if it arrives on his desk. The United States on Thursday displayed pieces of what it claimed were Iranian weapons deployed to militants in Yemen and Afghanistan. Iran has always rejected claims that it is assisting Yemeni fighters in their war with Saudi Arabia in military terms, emphasizing that the crisis should be settled through diplomatic approaches.

News article:
Iran four-point plan on Yemen still only viable option: FM Zarif Press TV – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has once again assessed the viability of putting an end to the ongoing Saudi-led crisis in Yemen only through the Islamic Republic’s four-point plan. In a post on his official Twitter account on Friday, Zarif said he has announced Iran’s four-point proposal on the Yemeni crisis in April 2015. I said this on the crisis in Yemen in April 2015. Today, after untold human suffering & war crimes by the Saudi coalition & its U.S. accomplices, & efforts to whitewash their crimes with absurd allegations against Iran, our four-point plan still remains the only viable option. https://t.co/7CqVTIduF9 — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) November 30, 2018 “Today, after untold human suffering & war crimes by the Saudi coalition & its U.S. accomplices, & efforts to whitewash their crimes with absurd allegations against Iran, our four-point plan still remains the only viable option,” the top Iranian diplomat said. In April 2015, the Iranian foreign minister submitted a four-point peace plan for Yemen to the United Nations in an attempt to end the bloodshed in the Arab country. “It is imperative for the international community to get more effectively involved in ending the senseless aerial attacks and establishing a ceasefire,” Zarif said in the letter, adding that Tehran is ready to cooperate with the UN “to facilitate and encourage an immediate end to these senseless bombardments and initiation of a genuine dialogue to find a political solution to this tragic crisis.” Saudi Arabia and a number of its regional allies launched a devastating military campaign against Yemen in March 2015, with the aim of bringing the government of former Yemeni president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi back to power and crushing the country’s Houthi Ansarullah movement. According to a new report by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a nonprofit conflict-research organization, the Saudi-led war has so far claimed the lives of around 56,000 Yemenis. The Saudi-led war has also taken a heavy toll on the country’s infrastructure, destroying hospitals, schools, and factories. The UN has already said that a record 22.2 million Yemenis are in dire need of food, including 8.4 million threatened by severe hunger. According to the world body, Yemen is suffering from the most severe famine in more than 100 years. During a press briefing in the Yemeni capital Sana’a on Thursday, UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock appealed for a halt to fighting in Yemen. The UN official said the fighting has once again highlighted the ongoing humanitarian tragedy in the war-ravaged Arab country and said, “I’d like to see a cessation of hostilities, especially around the key infrastructure, especially around Hudaydah.” A number of Western countries, the US, France and Britain in particular, are also accused of being complicit in the ongoing aggression as they supply the Riyadh regime with advanced weapons and military equipment as well as logistical and intelligence assistance. US President Donald Trump, who has touted the country’s lucrative purchase of arms from the US, has threatened to veto a bill on ending the United States’ military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen if it arrives on his desk. The United States on Thursday displayed pieces of what it claimed were Iranian weapons deployed to militants in Yemen and Afghanistan. Iran has always rejected claims that it is assisting Yemeni fighters in their war with Saudi Arabia in military terms, emphasizing that the crisis should be settled through diplomatic approaches.

Iran backs UN-sponsored peace talks in Yemen, state media reported earlier today, with Tehran stating that it was ready to help find a political solution to the conflict. "Iran welcomes the talks in Sweden … Tehran is ready to help international talks to end the crisis and underlines the importance of accelerating providing humanitarian aid to the people," Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The peace talks are set to resume in Stockholm this week with delegations from the Iran-allied Houthis and the Yemeni government, backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, reportedly set to be in attendance. However scepticism around the proposed negotiations remains, after previous talks broke down in September after Saudi Arabia refused to allow a Houthi delegation to fly to Geneva to attend the meeting. The evacuation of the wounded fighters has been a key condition of the Houthis to attend the upcoming round of talks. Pressure to bring the war in Yemen to an end has risen in recent months amid a worsening humanitarian crisis that has resulted in the deaths of some 85,000 children due to malnutrition, according to Save the Children. Yemen FM: Houthis want war, reject peace The murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, widely regarded as having been ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman, has also increased support for cutting ties with the Kingdom. Last week, the US senate voted in favour of a bill to end American support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, a move largely seen as a showdown between the White House and Senate, which have been tiptoeing toward a standoff over Saudi Arabia for more than a year. Finland, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands have also recently announced that they will be cutting arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Impoverished Yemen has remained wracked by violence since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government. Since the coalition intervened in 2015, Yemen has become the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, according to the UN. Some 10,000 people have been killed in the war, while more than 11 per cent of the country's population has been displaced. Twenty-nine million civilians are in need of humanitarian aid while 14 million are at risk of famine as a result of the war and subsequent sieges which the Saudi-led coalition has imposed on a number of cities in an effort to starve and fore Houthi fighters out of them.

* Evacuating wounded Houthis precondition to attend peace talks * US Senate to mull resolution to end support for Saudi-led war * Yemen conflict seen as proxy Saudi-Iranian war * Turning up for talks in Sweden seen as progress - analyst * More than 8 million Yemenis facing starvation (Adds Houthi official, UN envoy, British foreign minister) By Mohamed Ghobari and Aziz El Yaakoubi ADEN/DUBAI, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Yemeni Houthi officials are expected to travel to Sweden shortly for talks as early as Wednesday to end the nearly four-year-old war after the Saudi-led coalition allowed the evacuation of some of their wounded for treatment. Prospects for convening talks have risen as Western allies press Saudi Arabia, leader of the Sunni Muslim alliance battling the Iranian-aligned Houthis, over a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Monday to escort the Houthi delegation, a U.N. source told Reuters. The Saudi-backed government has said it would follow the Houthis to the talks, the first since 2016. The peace talks may start on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter said. Griffiths shuttled between the parties to salvage a previous round that collapsed in September after the Houthis failed to show up. Western powers, which provide arms and intelligence to the coalition, may now have greater leverage to demand action on Yemen after outrage over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul led to increased scrutiny of the kingdom's activities in the region. The U.S. Senate is due to consider this week a resolution to end support for the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and its arch-foe in the Middle East, Iran. Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthi politburo, told Reuters their delegation would travel to Sweden Tuesday morning on a plane provided by Kuwait and accompanied by Griffiths. A post on the U.N. envoy's Twitter account thanked all parties for facilitating the evacuation of the 50 wounded fighters on Monday to Oman for treatment. British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt tweeted that the evacuation as a "positive 1st step" ahead of the talks. The coalition said in a statement it had agreed on the evacuation "for humanitarian considerations and as part of confidence-building measures" ahead of the talks, which are also due to focus on a transitional governing body. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said it backed the talks and was ready to help find a political solution, Iranian state TV reported on Monday. LOOMING FAMINE Analysts said both parties showing up for the talks would be an achievement in itself, even if there are no concrete outcomes as Griffiths tries to overcome deep mistrust on all sides. "Neither side wishes to be blamed for the dire consequences of the looming famine, which is starting to become a reality," said Elisabeth Kendall, a senior research fellow in Arabic and Islamic Studies at Oxford University. "But it remains to be seen whether the political will is really there to make the necessary concessions for peace." Some 8.4 million Yemenis are facing starvation, although the United Nations has warned that will probably rise to 14 million. Three-quarters of impoverished Yemen's population, or 22 million people, require aid. The Arab alliance intervened in the war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi but has bogged down in military stalemate, despite superior air power, since seizing the southern port of Aden that year. The Houthis, who are more adept at guerrilla warfare, hold most population centres including Sanaa and the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions that is now the focus of the war. Griffiths hopes to reach a deal on reopening Sanaa airport and securing a prisoner swap and a ceasefire in Hodeidah as a foundation for a wider ceasefire, which would include a halt to coalition air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians as well as Houthi missile attacks on Saudi cities.

News article:
Zarif: Iran backs intra-Yemeni talks to solve crisis IRNA – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a message expressed Iran’s support for the intra-Yemeni talks to resolve crisis. “Iran supports the upcoming intra-Yemeni talks in Sweden. All sides should enter constructive and responsible engagement to end the crisis in #Yemen. The world has historic responsibility to back dialogue incl by halting arming of aggressors,” Zarif tweeted on Monday. The Iranian foreign ministry has offered the country’s support for the upcoming Yemen talks in Sweden, calling on all Yemeni sides to have a “constructive and responsible” engagement in the Stockholm talks with the goal of putting an end to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The full text of the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s statement on Yemeni-Yemeni talks in Stockholm is as follows: Ahead of the Yemeni-Yemeni talks to be held in Sweden under the supervision of the United Nations, the Iranian Foreign Ministry welcomes and offers its support for the talks and calls on all Yemeni sides to have constructive and responsible participation in the talks. The Ministry also wants all the Yemeni sides to take trust-building measures, preparing the ground for achieving a comprehensive agreement to put an end to the suffering of Yemenis and the brutal blockage on them. At the onset of the conflict and the brutal aggression on Yemen, the Islamic Republic of Iran proposed a comprehensive approach to resolve the crisis as a four-point peace plan, which included an immediate cessation of war, delivery of humanitarian aid, beginning of Yemeni-Yemeni talks, and establishment of an all-inclusive government in Yemen. Iran now once again stresses that there is no way out of the Yemen crisis other than a political solution based on Yemeni-Yemeni talks. The Iranian Foreign Ministry calls on the international community to play a key and serious role, including by exerting pressure on the exporters of arms to the aggressors to facilitate the peace process in Yemen and let the Yemeni people decide their country’s fate free from the outsiders’ interference. The warmongers have not achieved any of their political and hegemonic goals after four years of bitter war and destructive aggression against Yemeni people.

Zarif: Iran backs intra-Yemeni talks to solve crisis IRNA – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a message expressed Iran’s support for the intra-Yemeni talks to resolve crisis. “Iran supports the upcoming intra-Yemeni talks in Sweden. All sides should enter constructive and responsible engagement to end the crisis in #Yemen. The world has historic responsibility to back dialogue incl by halting arming of aggressors,” Zarif tweeted on Monday. The Iranian foreign ministry has offered the country’s support for the upcoming Yemen talks in Sweden, calling on all Yemeni sides to have a “constructive and responsible” engagement in the Stockholm talks with the goal of putting an end to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The full text of the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s statement on Yemeni-Yemeni talks in Stockholm is as follows: Ahead of the Yemeni-Yemeni talks to be held in Sweden under the supervision of the United Nations, the Iranian Foreign Ministry welcomes and offers its support for the talks and calls on all Yemeni sides to have constructive and responsible participation in the talks. The Ministry also wants all the Yemeni sides to take trust-building measures, preparing the ground for achieving a comprehensive agreement to put an end to the suffering of Yemenis and the brutal blockage on them. At the onset of the conflict and the brutal aggression on Yemen, the Islamic Republic of Iran proposed a comprehensive approach to resolve the crisis as a four-point peace plan, which included an immediate cessation of war, delivery of humanitarian aid, beginning of Yemeni-Yemeni talks, and establishment of an all-inclusive government in Yemen. Iran now once again stresses that there is no way out of the Yemen crisis other than a political solution based on Yemeni-Yemeni talks. The Iranian Foreign Ministry calls on the international community to play a key and serious role, including by exerting pressure on the exporters of arms to the aggressors to facilitate the peace process in Yemen and let the Yemeni people decide their country’s fate free from the outsiders’ interference. The warmongers have not achieved any of their political and hegemonic goals after four years of bitter war and destructive aggression against Yemeni people. The campaign has only led to the collapse of economic resources and infrastructures of Yemen, deaths of thousands of women and children and other oppressed but resilient people of Yemen and a total humanitarian catastrophe in the country.

News article:
Negotiators representing Yemen's internationally recognised government arrived in Sweden for UN-backed talks with Houthi rebels on Wednesday, marking the start of a new peace push that the government hopes will end a war that has brought economic ruin and famine to the country. A rebel delegation is already at the conference venue north of Stockholm, having arrived on Tuesday. Talks are scheduled to start on Thursday. The delegation representing the Yemeni government on Wednesday met with UN envoy Martin Griffiths' team. The envoy is scheduled to deliver a press conference on Thursday morning alongside Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom. The tone from all sides appeared to be more positive than that during September's round of abortive talks in Geneva, which failed to even bring the Houthis to the table. If the warring parties meet, it would be the first time since 2016 that the team representing the internationally recognised Yemeni government would engage in UN-backed talks with Houthi rebels. This time, a willingness to carry out confidence-building measures, which included a prisoner swap and flying rebel fighters to Oman for treatment, helped Mr Griffiths bring the two sides together. _______________ Read more: Rebel Houthi delegation on way to Stockholm for peace talks Editorial: Yemen breakthrough looks closer than ever _______________ Security around the Johannesbergs castle- where the talks are set to take place- has been tight. Four police cars have surrounded the palace since Wednesday morning. Two fire brigades with over 10 firefighters were ushered into the parking of the castle. A police officer told The National that the situation is a “standard security procedure”. The British Ambassador to Yemen, Michael Aron, confirmed that the talks will take place on Thursday. “The delegation of the Yemeni government will reach today, and the talks will start tomorrow in Johannesbergs Castle,” Mr Aron said. Abdullah Al Alimi, head of Yemeni President Abdrabu Mansur Hadi’s office and member of the government's team, said they wanted to end the civil war. “The delegation will leave today carrying the hopes of the Yemeni people for sustainable peace,” he said. “We want peace to prevail, to end the war and eliminate all causes that led to the coup.” Mr Hadi intends to focus on alleviating the suffering of Yemeni civilians in the coming talks but blamed the Houthis for the country's devastation, according to Mr Al Alimi. The US urged both sides to engage in the talks and to halt the fighting which flared up in recent weeks, a reference to clashes along Yemen's west coast and around the port city of Hodeidah. “The people of Yemen have suffered far too long. The parties owe it to their fellow Yemenis to seize this opportunity... We have no illusions that this process will be easy, but we welcome this necessary and vital first step,” Heather Nauert, US State Department spokeswoman, said. Police cars in Sweden. EPA Both sides in the conflict have come under growing pressure from the US, along with the UK and the UN, to end the war which has claimed more than 10,000 lives and placed millions more in danger of starvation. Meanwhile, the Emirati Red Crescent announced a project to support the creation of jobs for 1,000 families of those killed and wounded in the war. "The ERC has been intensifying its humanitarian interventions in Yemen, and later on it started to expand its humanitarian aid by focusing on sustainable development for the people who are in need for such rewarding projects to help them make a living,” said the Emirati ambassador in Yemen, Salem Al Ghafli. The world’s worst humanitarian crisis is in Yemen, where the government and a Saudi-led coalition have been locked in a largely stalemated war with the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels since March 2015. The fighting has claimed tens of thousands of lives and pushed the country to the brink of famine. Iran on Monday said it backs the UN-sponsored peace talks. “Tehran is ready to help international talks to end the crisis and underlines the importance of accelerating providing humanitarian aid to the people," Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement

News article:
RIMBO: The Houthi militia is “not serious” on finding common ground to end the devastating war in Yemen, a member of the government delegation to the UN-brokered talks in Sweden told AFP Saturday. Nearly four years into a war that has pushed 14 million Yemenis to the brink of starvation, the Saudi-backed government of Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi and the Houthi militia, linked to Iran, are in the rural town of Rimbo for what UN officials expect will be a week of negotiations. “Expectations stem from experience, and from experience I would say no, they are not serious,” said Rana Ghanem, a member of the government delegation to the talks. “But our hope ... is that this will help alleviate the tension, and alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people,” said Ghanem, the only woman in either delegation. The last round of talks in 2016 broke down in Kuwait after more than three months of negotiations. A plan to host the warring parties in Geneva collapsed in September after the rebels refused to leave the capital Sanaa, citing safety concerns. Government representatives, Houthi spokesmen and UN Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths have all said the talks are not aimed at finding a political solution to the conflict. Both Yemeni parties have threatened to leave the talks if certain demands are not met. Ghanem confirmed the two parties had not yet met face-to-face, with Griffiths and his team shuttling between the delegations. The feuding sides had, however, been chatting “informally” in the halls, she said. Among the issues under discussion are the country’s failed economy, potential humanitarian corridors, a prisoner swap, the reopening of the defunct Sanaa international airport, and Hodeida, the rebel-held city at the heart of an ongoing government offensive. The government has held firm to its demand that the Houthis evacuate the western governorate of Hodeidah, home to a Red Sea port that is the entry point for 90 percent of food imports to impoverished Yemen, and hand the area over to security forces. The Houthis, however, refused that demand Friday. And Yemen's Foreign Minister Khaled Al-Yamani said on Saturday the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah must be handed over to the government. "We accept that the port works under the administration that ran the port in 2014," Khaled Al-Yamani told AFP. The rebels seized Hodeida, Yemen's most valuable port, located on the Red Sea, in a takeover of territory in 2014. Al-Yamani added that Aden will be home to the country's main airport. "We have a vision that Aden will be the sovereign airport of Yemen," Khaled Al-Yamani told AFP in his first interview since the talks opened in Sweden on Thursday. A government proposal to turn Sanaa internatonal airport into a domestic airport was also rejected by the Houthis Friday. Sanaa airport has been largely shut for three years, during which the Arab coalition took control of Yemen’s sea and airspace. The coalition accuses the rebels of smuggling arms from Iran through Hodeidah and Sanaa airport. Tehran denies the charge. The Houthis, northern tribesmen who hail from the minority Zaidi Shiite community, overran the capital and a string of ports in a territorial takeover in 2014. Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened to bolster the Hadi government’s standing.

News article:
The airport in Aden will become Yemen's main airport, the country's foreign minister has said. Yemen's foreign minister on Saturday said that the government-controlled city of Aden will be home to the country's main airport, in the midst of talks to reopen the rebel-held international airport in the capital Sanaa. "We are ready to reopen Sanaa international airport today... but we have a vision that Aden will be the sovereign airport of Yemen," Khaled al-Yamani told AFP in his first interview since the talks opened in Sweden on Thursday. Yemen's capital has been held by Huthi rebels since 2014, when the insurgents drove the government out and seized a string of ports across the country's coastline. The government of Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi has since fought to drive the Iran-backed rebels back, supported since 2015 by a behemoth military coalition led by Saudi Arabia -- Tehran's regional archrival. The conflict has triggered what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 14 million people now at the brink of famine. Nearly 10,000 people have been killed in under four years, according to conservative estimates. The warring parties convened in the rural Swedish village of Rimbo on Thursday for UN-brokered talks which will not, officials say, find a political solution to the conflict. Sanaa international airport has been defunct for years, severely damaged in air raids by the Saudi-led coalition, which controls Yemeni airspace. A government proposal to allow flights to and from Sanaa was categorically rejected by the rebels Friday. Among the conditions set by the government are mandatory transit points in Aden and Sayoun, another government-held city, for plane inspections. The Saudi-backed coalition accuses the Huthis of smuggling arms from Iran through Sanaa as well as Hodeida, the rebel-held Red Sea city home to Yemen's most valuable port. Iran denies the charge. Foreign Minister Yamani said a government demand for a full rebel withdrawal from the city and port of Hodeida were non-negotiable. "As concerns the port... We accept that it works under the administration that ran the port in 2014, and we are ready to coordinate with the UN on supervision and the reinforcement of port operations," said Yamani. "But the port must remain sovereign, part of the work of the Yemeni transport ministry which is in charge of Yemeni borders and ports."

The airport in Aden will become Yemen's main airport, the country's foreign minister has said. Yemen's foreign minister on Saturday said that the government-controlled city of Aden will be home to the country's main airport, in the midst of talks to reopen the rebel-held international airport in the capital Sanaa. "We are ready to reopen Sanaa international airport today... but we have a vision that Aden will be the sovereign airport of Yemen," Khaled al-Yamani told AFP in his first interview since the talks opened in Sweden on Thursday. Yemen's capital has been held by Huthi rebels since 2014, when the insurgents drove the government out and seized a string of ports across the country's coastline. The government of Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi has since fought to drive the Iran-backed rebels back, supported since 2015 by a behemoth military coalition led by Saudi Arabia -- Tehran's regional archrival. The conflict has triggered what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 14 million people now at the brink of famine. Nearly 10,000 people have been killed in under four years, according to conservative estimates. The warring parties convened in the rural Swedish village of Rimbo on Thursday for UN-brokered talks which will not, officials say, find a political solution to the conflict. Sanaa international airport has been defunct for years, severely damaged in air raids by the Saudi-led coalition, which controls Yemeni airspace. A government proposal to allow flights to and from Sanaa was categorically rejected by the rebels Friday. Among the conditions set by the government are mandatory transit points in Aden and Sayoun, another government-held city, for plane inspections. The Saudi-backed coalition accuses the Huthis of smuggling arms from Iran through Sanaa as well as Hodeida, the rebel-held Red Sea city home to Yemen's most valuable port. Iran denies the charge. Foreign Minister Yamani said a government demand for a full rebel withdrawal from the city and port of Hodeida were non-negotiable. "As concerns the port... We accept that it works under the administration that ran the port in 2014, and we are ready to coordinate with the UN on supervision and the reinforcement of port operations," said Yamani. "But the port must remain sovereign, part of the work of the Yemeni transport ministry which is in charge of Yemeni borders and ports."

News article:
As UN-backed Yemen peace talks in Sweden entered their third day on Saturday, representatives of the country's warring parties have yet to bridge differences over key issues, including the reopening of the Sanaa airport and UN administration of a vital Yemeni port. Rana Ghanem, a member of the government's delegation told The National on Saturday that the government and Houthi delegation have not yet held face-to-face consultations. Instead, UN Envoy Martin Griffiths and his team have so far shuttled between Houthi rebels and representatives of the Yemeni government, in Rimbo, north of Stockholm. Ms Ghanem also said that discussions have yet to address a political solution to the conflict. "This is natural, how can we engage in a political process when there are many issues on the ground that needs to be resolved," she said. _______________ Read more: Houthis launch attacks in Hodeidah as Yemen peace talks begin Yemen’s government urges UN to take a firmer approach with Houthis Cautious optimism reigns over Yemen peace talks Yemen's warring parties appear together for first time since 2015 _______________ The UN envoy has outlined three initial objectives for talks in Sweden: securing some confidence-building measures including a prisoner swap, the reopening of the airport in the capital, Sanaa, and securing UN administration of the strategic Red Sea port of Hodeidah, through which almost 80% of international aid enters the country. The consultations are expected to last until December 13 with both sides under pressure to agree on confidence-building measures that will allow formal peace negotiations to resume. Mr Griffiths on Saturday commended the positive spirit the two parties are demonstrating in consultations. “The two parties are engaged in a serious and constructive way in discussing the details of confidence building measures, reduction of violence and the framework for negotiations,” Mr Griffiths said in a statement. The UN Envoy stressed the importance of continued restraint on the ground and called on the two parties to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, the statement said. “We are working to the background of a very fragile situation in Yemen. We hope that de-escalation will be maintained on different front lines, to give a chance for progress to be achieved on the political consultations.” Ms Ghanem said that negotiating parties have raised the issue of confidence building between rebels and the government, in an effort to boost mutual trust that has eroded over the course of the conflict. Yemen's warring sides agreed on Thursday on freeing thousands of prisoners as part of a wider attempt at enhancing trust. But, rebels and the government have yet to agree on details of the deal. While the first day of talks concluded on a positive note, negotiations have since been marred by complications. Houthi rebels on Friday rejected a request made by Yemen's government to reopen Sanaa airport to domestic flights. The government proposed reopening the rebel-held airport on condition planes are inspected in the airports of Aden or Sayun which are under its control. Delegates representing Houthi rebels told reporters in Sweden that they refuse plane inspections. But, Ms Ghanem said that the government's delegation did not receive an official response from the Houthis. She also criticized their reasons for rejecting the proposal, saying that "before the airport was shut in 2014, there were daily domestic flights between Sanaa and Besha and the flights were inspected in Besha." The main reason the government has proposed to reopen Sanaa airport, she said, "is to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people and to ensure the delivery of much needed humanitarian aid." The government is also pushing for the opening of Taez airport, according to Ms Ghanem. "The city is widely populated and this will ensure the long-term delivery of aid. But it cannot just open without any inspection and surveillance," she said, in comments that suggest that Houthis may also reject this proposal because of insistence on inspection. The main negotiator for Houthi rebels Mohammed Abdusalam told Reuters on Saturday that his group was open to the possibility of a UN role at Sanaa airport to secure agreement to reopen the facility, which has been bombed several times. "The closing of Sanaa airport was a political decision not because of security concerns… if we agree on its reopening, we are ready to discuss those details," he said. Meanwhile, Yemen's foreign minister on Saturday said that the government-controlled city of Aden will be home to the country's main airport. "We are ready to reopen Sanaa international airport today... but we have a vision that Aden will be the sovereign airport of Yemen," Khaled al-Yamani told AFP in his first interview since the talks opened in Sweden on Thursday. On the issue of the vital port of Hodeidah, Ms Ghanem said that it must come under full government control. The Yemeni government, backed by the Arab Coalition, accuses the Iran-backed rebels of using their control of the port, the main entry point for Yemen's food imports and desperately needed humanitarian aid, to smuggle in weapons from Iran. Mr Abdusalam on Saturday said that Hodeidah should be declared a neutral zone. "It (Hodeidah) should be a neutral zone apart from the conflict, and the military brigades that came from outside Hodeidah province should leave," he told Reuters in Rimbo on the sidelines of peace talks with the Saudi-backed government. "We have proposed to the UN to oversee the port and supervise its logistics... inspections, revenues and all the technical issues," he said while declining to say who will control the city if both rebels and government forces leave. Meanwhile, Yemen's foreign minister told AFP that the government is willing to coordinate with the UN on supervision and port operations but stressed that "the port must remain sovereign, part of the work of the Yemeni transport ministry which is in charge of Yemeni borders and ports." Ms Ghanem said she is sceptical about Houthi's willingness to engage in peace talks, expressing her belief that "they are not serious about finding a political solution to this crisis." But, she said she does hope to see Houthis pushing for peace, following the devastating war. Mr Abdusalam told Reuters that a ceasefire would be the first condition for a political solution. "As long as canons are firing and warplanes are bombing, there will be no space for a voice of reason or negotiations," he said.

News article:
The U.S. Senate is poised to debate a resolution that would force the end to United States support for the Yemen war, and numerous senators have asserted that such a measure could help bring an end to the conflict. With the White House strongly opposed to this effort, it is far from clear that Congress will end up enacting any Yemen-related legislation. However, no matter what transpires in the final legislative end game, it is worth examining both the premise of congressional actions and the likely strategic consequences. Unfortunately, calls to “stop the Yemen war,” though morally satisfying, are fundamentally misguided. They ignore what is at stake in the Yemen conflict and the true identity of the warring parties. A precipitous disengagement by the Saudi-led coalition from militarily backing the UN-backed government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the Yemeni civil war would have calamitous consequences for Yemen, the Middle East and the world at large. {mosads}The urgency to end the war reduces that conflict, and its drivers, to a morality play, with the coalition of Arab states cast as the bloodthirsty villain killing and starving Yemeni civilians. The assumption seems to be that if the coalition’s military operations are brought to a halt, all will be well in Yemen. Everybody seems to have forgotten that the conflict was triggered in late 2014 when the Houthis, backed by Iran, toppled the Yemeni government and took over large areas of the country, including strategic positions on the Red Sea. In seizing power, the Houthis inflicted massive civilian casualties and crippling damage to Yemen’s rudimentary infrastructure. Presented with a strategic threat at its doorstep, posed by an Iranian proxy and a humanitarian crisis, Saudi Arabia, responding to a request by Yemen’s legitimate government and backed by U.N. Resolution 2216, militarily intervened in the Yemen conflict seeking to restore Yemen’s legitimate government. As has been the case with the Afghan and Iraq wars, prosecuted by U.S.-led coalitions, the counterinsurgency campaign in Yemen has been a difficult enterprise. Because the Houthis have been fighting in a way that deliberately places civilians at risk, Yemen has experienced dire security and humanitarian circumstances. To curtail the influx of Iranian arms, the Saudi-led coalition periodically has restricted access to the port of Hodeidah, one of six main ports in Yemen, and a vital transit area for both humanitarian supplies and Iranian weapons transfers. The Houthis have exploited both of these for their war efforts and to consolidate their tactical gains on the ground, and so, abandoning the coalition efforts would leave Yemen in the rebels’ hands. We have seen this in Syria. Over the past several years, U.S. policymakers have called for “de-escalating” the Syrian war. On paper, the policy sounded prudent and moral. In practice, however, as the United States froze its assistance to the Syrian opposition, Russia, Iran and the regime of Bashar al-Assad took advantage of the de-escalation process. Towns and villages were besieged and forced to surrender to Assad. In many of those towns, the government exacted revenge by arresting or killing people. It also forcibly conscripted civilians into the army or loyalist militias. Even as the U.S. administration lauded “de-escalation” in its rhetoric, Syria and its Russian and Iranian patrons simply consolidated their position and continued their military campaign. A similar scenario will unfold in Yemen if the Saudi-led coalition were to cease operations. Iran’s long arm, the Houthis, would march on coalition-liberated areas and exact a bloody toll on the populations of cities such as Aden and Marib with the same ruthlessness to which they subjected Sanaa and Taiz during the past three years. The rebels have ruled Sanaa, kidnapping, executing, disappearing, systematically torturing, and assassinating detractors. In Taiz, they fire mortars indiscriminately at the civilian population and snipers shoot at children to force residents into submission. {mossecondads}Having an Iranian satellite armed with Iranian ballistic missiles on the Saudi doorstep would pose an intolerable threat to the kingdom, comparable to having the Soviet Union seize control of Mexico during the Cold War. But the stakes in Yemen involve more than just Saudi Arabia’s national security or the peace and prosperity of the Yemeni people. An abrupt termination of the war would leave Iran in control of Yemen would deal a serious blow to the global economy. Iran would have the ability to obstruct trade and oil flows from both the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, the latter of which has been tormented by Somali piracy for the decades. Iran would wield far greater influence than Somali pirates if it were allowed to threaten Bab-el-Mandeb. About 24 percent of the world’s petroleum and petroleum products supply passes through these two waterways, and Iran already has the capability to disrupt oil flows from Hormuz and has threatened to do so this year. Should Iran acquire that capability in Bab-el-Mandeb, by establishing a foothold in the Gulf of Aden, even if it chose not to utilize this capability, oil prices and insurance costs would surge. Allowing the IRGC to control two of the most strategic choke points for the global energy market is simply not an option for the international community. There is every reason to believe that Iran would launch attacks on maritime traffic. The Houthis have mounted multiple attacks on commercial and military vessels over the past several years, and Iran has supplied its Yemen proxy with drone boats, conventional aerial drones and ballistic missiles. Iran’s threats to disrupt international waterways should not be taken lightly. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) targeted Gulf oil tankers in the mid-1980s, prompting the U.S. Navy to launch Operation Earnest Will to protect the flow of oil. IRGC speedboats were deployed from Iran’s Farsi Island to launch rockets at oil tankers in the dead of night. An underwater mine placed by the IRGC struck U.S.-flagged oil tanker MV Bridgeton. There is plenty of reasonable criticism of the war effort in Yemen. The conflict has exacerbated a terrible humanitarian crisis and claimed the lives of thousands of civilians. But any resolution to this war that leaves the Houthis with control over the Yemeni people, or allows Iran to exert its influence over one of the world’s most strategic waterways, would be a humanitarian and security disaster.

News article:
The U.S. Senate is poised to debate a resolution that would force the end to United States support for the Yemen war, and numerous senators have asserted that such a measure could help bring an end to the conflict. With the White House strongly opposed to this effort, it is far from clear that Congress will end up enacting any Yemen-related legislation. However, no matter what transpires in the final legislative end game, it is worth examining both the premise of congressional actions and the likely strategic consequences. Unfortunately, calls to “stop the Yemen war,” though morally satisfying, are fundamentally misguided. They ignore what is at stake in the Yemen conflict and the true identity of the warring parties. A precipitous disengagement by the Saudi-led coalition from militarily backing the UN-backed government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the Yemeni civil war would have calamitous consequences for Yemen, the Middle East and the world at large. {mosads}The urgency to end the war reduces that conflict, and its drivers, to a morality play, with the coalition of Arab states cast as the bloodthirsty villain killing and starving Yemeni civilians. The assumption seems to be that if the coalition’s military operations are brought to a halt, all will be well in Yemen. Everybody seems to have forgotten that the conflict was triggered in late 2014 when the Houthis, backed by Iran, toppled the Yemeni government and took over large areas of the country, including strategic positions on the Red Sea. In seizing power, the Houthis inflicted massive civilian casualties and crippling damage to Yemen’s rudimentary infrastructure. Presented with a strategic threat at its doorstep, posed by an Iranian proxy and a humanitarian crisis, Saudi Arabia, responding to a request by Yemen’s legitimate government and backed by U.N. Resolution 2216, militarily intervened in the Yemen conflict seeking to restore Yemen’s legitimate government. As has been the case with the Afghan and Iraq wars, prosecuted by U.S.-led coalitions, the counterinsurgency campaign in Yemen has been a difficult enterprise. Because the Houthis have been fighting in a way that deliberately places civilians at risk, Yemen has experienced dire security and humanitarian circumstances. To curtail the influx of Iranian arms, the Saudi-led coalition periodically has restricted access to the port of Hodeidah, one of six main ports in Yemen, and a vital transit area for both humanitarian supplies and Iranian weapons transfers. The Houthis have exploited both of these for their war efforts and to consolidate their tactical gains on the ground, and so, abandoning the coalition efforts would leave Yemen in the rebels’ hands. We have seen this in Syria. Over the past several years, U.S. policymakers have called for “de-escalating” the Syrian war. On paper, the policy sounded prudent and moral. In practice, however, as the United States froze its assistance to the Syrian opposition, Russia, Iran and the regime of Bashar al-Assad took advantage of the de-escalation process. Towns and villages were besieged and forced to surrender to Assad. In many of those towns, the government exacted revenge by arresting or killing people. It also forcibly conscripted civilians into the army or loyalist militias. Even as the U.S. administration lauded “de-escalation” in its rhetoric, Syria and its Russian and Iranian patrons simply consolidated their position and continued their military campaign. A similar scenario will unfold in Yemen if the Saudi-led coalition were to cease operations. Iran’s long arm, the Houthis, would march on coalition-liberated areas and exact a bloody toll on the populations of cities such as Aden and Marib with the same ruthlessness to which they subjected Sanaa and Taiz during the past three years. The rebels have ruled Sanaa, kidnapping, executing, disappearing, systematically torturing, and assassinating detractors. In Taiz, they fire mortars indiscriminately at the civilian population and snipers shoot at children to force residents into submission. {mossecondads}Having an Iranian satellite armed with Iranian ballistic missiles on the Saudi doorstep would pose an intolerable threat to the kingdom, comparable to having the Soviet Union seize control of Mexico during the Cold War. But the stakes in Yemen involve more than just Saudi Arabia’s national security or the peace and prosperity of the Yemeni people. An abrupt termination of the war would leave Iran in control of Yemen would deal a serious blow to the global economy. Iran would have the ability to obstruct trade and oil flows from both the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, the latter of which has been tormented by Somali piracy for the decades. Iran would wield far greater influence than Somali pirates if it were allowed to threaten Bab-el-Mandeb. About 24 percent of the world’s petroleum and petroleum products supply passes through these two waterways, and Iran already has the capability to disrupt oil flows from Hormuz and has threatened to do so this year. Should Iran acquire that capability in Bab-el-Mandeb, by establishing a foothold in the Gulf of Aden, even if it chose not to utilize this capability, oil prices and insurance costs would surge. Allowing the IRGC to control two of the most strategic choke points for the global energy market is simply not an option for the international community. There is every reason to believe that Iran would launch attacks on maritime traffic. The Houthis have mounted multiple attacks on commercial and military vessels over the past several years, and Iran has supplied its Yemen proxy with drone boats, conventional aerial drones and ballistic missiles. Iran’s threats to disrupt international waterways should not be taken lightly. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) targeted Gulf oil tankers in the mid-1980s, prompting the U.S. Navy to launch Operation Earnest Will to protect the flow of oil. IRGC speedboats were deployed from Iran’s Farsi Island to launch rockets at oil tankers in the dead of night. An underwater mine placed by the IRGC struck U.S.-flagged oil tanker MV Bridgeton. There is plenty of reasonable criticism of the war effort in Yemen. The conflict has exacerbated a terrible humanitarian crisis and claimed the lives of thousands of civilians. But any resolution to this war that leaves the Houthis with control over the Yemeni people, or allows Iran to exert its influence over one of the world’s most strategic waterways, would be a humanitarian and security disaster.

The UN said future talks between Houthi rebels and Yemen's government will try to find a political solution to the conflict, as a government delegate said his team was willing to discuss rebel participation in the Cabinet if the insurgents gave up their guns. Yemen’s warring parties continued consultations in Sweden in the first meeting between the two sides since a breakdown of 2016 talks. A UN official who spoke on condition of anonymity on Sunday said Yemen’s factions would meet again in early 2019. The talks in Sweden have so far side-stepped discussions on a political transition, focusing instead on a prisoner swap, the reopening of Sanaa airport and securing UN administration of the strategic Red Sea port of Hodeidah. “Whatever gains we get here (in Sweden) as an entry point to the solution of the conflict, we could start towards building a political solution in late January,” the UN source said. “We want the war to end and we want that to happen now,” he said. _______________ Read more: Yemen's warring parties still at odds over key agenda items as talks enter third day Exclusive: Mesa to include nine countries while prioritising Iran threat [ Senate agrees to debate US Role in Yemen war ] _______________ The UN official said the two sides were willing to meet but had yet to agree on a date and venue. He said talks would most likely take place in Kuwait or Jordan. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdelsalam said on Sunday that his delegation was open to more talks with the government if progress was made before the talks in Sweden end on Friday. On Thursday, rival parties agreed to a prisoner exchange. The UN official and a Yemeni government delegate told The National that efforts are focusing on the exchange of some prisoners before Friday. The government wants to secure the release of high-profile leaders who have been held in Houthi prisons since 2015, including former minister of defence Gen Mahmood Al Soubaihi, and Maj Gen Naser Mansour Hadi – Yemeni President Abdrabu Mansur Hadi’s brother – in addition to the leader of Yemen's Islamist Al Islah party, Mohammed Qahtan. The Yemen war has claimed more than 10,000 lives since 2015 when Saudi Arabia and its allies joined the government's fight against the Iran-backed rebels. Fighting triggered what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with nearly 14 million Yemenis at risk of mass starvation as violence, poverty, disease and blockades bring the impoverished country to its knees.

News article:
Rimbo (Sweden) (AFP) - The United Nations has submitted proposals for de-escalation in the flashpoint Yemeni port city of Hodeida as well as the country's third city of Taiz to warring parties at UN-sponsored talks in Sweden. The Yemeni government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia and its military allies, has been battling the Iran-backed Huthi rebels for control of Yemen for nearly four years, spawning what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The government and Huthi teams are in Sweden for talks expected to continue until the end of this week, the first since more than three months of negotiations collapsed in 2016. Under discussion on Monday were the fate of the Hodeida, vital to aid and food imports, and Taiz, the scene of some of the most intense battles in Yemen. Other issues on the table include humanitarian corridors, the reopening of the defunct international airport in the capital Sanaa and a massive prisoner swap. The talks mark the first of what UN special envoy Martin Griffiths said he hoped would be multiple rounds, with plans to hold more negotiations in early 2019. - 'Lift threat of war' - Delegates on both sides on Monday said the prisoner swap had been largely finalised. Implementation will be overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross. UN envoy Griffiths said he hoped the swap "will be very very considerable in terms of the numbers that we hope to get released within a few weeks". The fight for Taiz and Hodeida, however, shows no sign of waning. "These are two major population zones in Yemen caught in war," Griffiths told reporters on Monday. "I'm hopeful that we can reach agreements on the de-escalation to reduce the fighting in both places... We're not there yet." Initial drafts of the proposals on Hodeida and Taiz, seen by AFP Monday, called for a mutual ceasefire. The Hodeida draft stipulated that the Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Huthis would cease an offensive on the rebel-held city in exchange for a Huthi withdrawal. Story continues The area would then be put under the control of a joint committee and supervised by the United Nations. The document did not propose the deployment of UN peacekeeping troops. Griffiths said the UN was working on a "simpler draft" which was still under discussion. In a rare gesture, Salim al-Moughaless, a Huthi negotiator, and Ahmed Ghaleb, a government official, shook hands for the cameras Monday, following a request by photographers. - Military operations ongoing - The Saudi-led coalition said military operations were ongoing in Hodeida, as the Sweden talks marked their fifth day. "The rebels have fortified their defence lines inside Hodeida city," said coalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki. "We are working to create safe humanitarian corridors from Hodeida to Sanaa." The UN has regularly urged the coalition to suspend operations in the densely-populated city, home to 600,000 people and a traditional conduit for 90 percent of food imports to Yemen. The Huthis seized the Red Sea city in 2014. The government launched an offensive in June to drive out the rebels. Aid groups have warned the destruction of Hodeida would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where the UN estimates 14 million people face starvation. The initial UN draft proposals for the southwestern city of Taiz, under the control of pro-government forces but besieged by the rebels, called for an unconditional ceasefire, a joint working group that includes the UN to monitor it, and the reopening of all roads and Taiz airport for humanitarian operations. The World Health Organization says nearly 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen since 2015, when Saudi Arabia and its allies joined President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's fight against the Huthis. Other rights groups say the toll could be as high as 50,000. faw-mou-ny-ach/pma

News article:
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Federica Mogherini, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, at a meeting on the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal Sept. 22, 2016, in New York. (JNS)-U.S. President Donald Trump vowed in May to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and signed an executive order in August to re-impose sanctions, which go into full effect on Nov. 4. The European Union, however, appears determined to ignore and circumvent U.S. efforts to force Iran into compliance on its nuclear program, and for the Islamic regime to cease and desist global terror activity. It appears that Trump's foreign policy on Iran has raised European ire and some of those countries do not yet seem willing to view Iran's hegemonic desires as dangerous. As such, European leaders instead seek to bypass U.S. sanctions by continuing to do business with the hostile Islamic regime. To that end, European officials have slammed renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran as "illegal" and in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231. France, Germany and the United Kingdom-the three European partners to the accord (the E3)-have vowed to continue efforts to thwart U.S. measures and preserve the Iran nuclear deal. In August, the E.U. gave Iran $20.6 million in aid as part of a larger package to help offset the impact of U.S. sanctions. In September, following a ministerial meeting of the remaining signatories of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action deal at the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, E.U. foreign-policy chief Federica Mogherini claimed that Iran has been complying with its end of the agreement, and said that the European Union would work around U.S. efforts to stem Tehran's oil exports with sanctions. Reading from a statement, she said, "Mindful of the urgency and the need for tangible results, the participants welcomed practical proposals to maintain and develop payment channels, notably the initiative to establish a special purpose vehicle to facilitate payments related to Iran's exports, including oil." However, the chairman of Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh has called the European effort to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran as "weak." 'They will do whatever they can to circumvent Trump' Dr. Tsilla Hershco, a senior research associate at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, told JNS that "The E.U. is currently turning a blind eye on Iran's ambitions regarding its nuclear program... Mogherini has even initiated measures designated to neutralize the influence of the U.S. sanctions on the EU trade with Iran. "Seemingly, Mogherini was not sufficiently impressed by the exposure of Iran's attempts to conceal its nuclear ambitions, as was the case with its hidden nuclear archives exposed by Israel," continued Hershco. "Concurrently, the E.U. has already expressed its genuine security concerns regarding the Iranian ballistic-missile program, its aspirations for hegemony in the Middle East and its subversive activities, including the financing of terrorist activities. At the end of the day, the E.U. should better stop to underestimate Iran's nuclear ambitions, as they are interconnected with Iran's ongoing regional and global subversive activities, opposed by the E.U." The Europeans have made it clear they are committed to the JCPOA and point to numerous inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency that, they say, prove Iran is in compliance. But this goes against the evidence that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented at the recent U.N. General Assembly in New York. There, he provided what appears to be ample and sound proof that Iran continues to deceive the world over its nuclear ambitions. He also called on IAEA head Yukiya Amano to immediately inspect the areas he revealed. Yet the IAEA appears to have ignored Netanyahu's demand-a move that suggests that it is unreliable in keeping Iran in check. According to Emmanuel Navon, an expert in E.U.-Israel relations at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies, two issues regarding the E.U. remain of serious concern. "The first," he told JNS, "is economic interest. Most of the countries, especially Germany and France, want to circumvent U.S. sanctions because they want to keep business going in Europe, especially car-makers and natural-gas companies. In some areas, they can circumvent the sanctions, but ultimately, companies need to choose between doing business with Iran or doing business with the United States. That's why the sanctions are effective; they force the businesses to choose. That's one aspect." "The other aspect," Navon continued, "is from the E.U. itself, and Mogherini and ideology. They hate Trump. They think the deal they reached with Iran three years ago was the best deal they could have reached, and they will do whatever they can to circumvent Trump." 'Israel can break that consensus' While collectively, European countries often appear unwilling to listen to Israel's concerns regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions and regional aspirations, Jerusalem has good relations with some of the E.U. countries individually, and the Jewish state's concerns have made their way into the halls of European parliaments. "By having a part in convincing the U.S. to pull out of the deal, Israel was able to influence European attitudes towards Iran," said Navon. "Netanyahu has been doing a pretty good job in developing ties with the so-called rebels in Eastern Europe. So now, when there is a vote on the Mideast, Israel can break that consensus." Navon was skeptical that E.U. efforts to bypass U.S. sanctions would prove successful. "The test really will be whether the E.U. will be able to convince the companies to remain in Iran," he added. "At the end of the day, the bottom line is that European companies will have to choose between doing business with Iran or with the U.S." Quotes "Most of the countries, especially Germany and France, want to circumvent U.S. sanctions because they want to keep business going in Europe, especially car-makers and natural-gas companies. In some areas, they can circumvent the sanctions, but ultimately, companies need to choose between doing business with Iran or doing business with the United States.

News article:
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Federica Mogherini, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, at a meeting on the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal Sept. 22, 2016, in New York. (JNS)-U.S. President Donald Trump vowed in May to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and signed an executive order in August to re-impose sanctions, which go into full effect on Nov. 4. The European Union, however, appears determined to ignore and circumvent U.S. efforts to force Iran into compliance on its nuclear program, and for the Islamic regime to cease and desist global terror activity. It appears that Trump's foreign policy on Iran has raised European ire and some of those countries do not yet seem willing to view Iran's hegemonic desires as dangerous. As such, European leaders instead seek to bypass U.S. sanctions by continuing to do business with the hostile Islamic regime. To that end, European officials have slammed renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran as "illegal" and in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231. France, Germany and the United Kingdom-the three European partners to the accord (the E3)-have vowed to continue efforts to thwart U.S. measures and preserve the Iran nuclear deal. In August, the E.U. gave Iran $20.6 million in aid as part of a larger package to help offset the impact of U.S. sanctions. In September, following a ministerial meeting of the remaining signatories of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action deal at the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, E.U. foreign-policy chief Federica Mogherini claimed that Iran has been complying with its end of the agreement, and said that the European Union would work around U.S. efforts to stem Tehran's oil exports with sanctions. Reading from a statement, she said, "Mindful of the urgency and the need for tangible results, the participants welcomed practical proposals to maintain and develop payment channels, notably the initiative to establish a special purpose vehicle to facilitate payments related to Iran's exports, including oil." However, the chairman of Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh has called the European effort to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran as "weak." 'They will do whatever they can to circumvent Trump' Dr. Tsilla Hershco, a senior research associate at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, told JNS that "The E.U. is currently turning a blind eye on Iran's ambitions regarding its nuclear program... Mogherini has even initiated measures designated to neutralize the influence of the U.S. sanctions on the EU trade with Iran. "Seemingly, Mogherini was not sufficiently impressed by the exposure of Iran's attempts to conceal its nuclear ambitions, as was the case with its hidden nuclear archives exposed by Israel," continued Hershco. "Concurrently, the E.U. has already expressed its genuine security concerns regarding the Iranian ballistic-missile program, its aspirations for hegemony in the Middle East and its subversive activities, including the financing of terrorist activities. At the end of the day, the E.U. should better stop to underestimate Iran's nuclear ambitions, as they are interconnected with Iran's ongoing regional and global subversive activities, opposed by the E.U." The Europeans have made it clear they are committed to the JCPOA and point to numerous inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency that, they say, prove Iran is in compliance. But this goes against the evidence that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented at the recent U.N. General Assembly in New York. There, he provided what appears to be ample and sound proof that Iran continues to deceive the world over its nuclear ambitions. He also called on IAEA head Yukiya Amano to immediately inspect the areas he revealed. Yet the IAEA appears to have ignored Netanyahu's demand-a move that suggests that it is unreliable in keeping Iran in check. According to Emmanuel Navon, an expert in E.U.-Israel relations at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies, two issues regarding the E.U. remain of serious concern. "The first," he told JNS, "is economic interest. Most of the countries, especially Germany and France, want to circumvent U.S. sanctions because they want to keep business going in Europe, especially car-makers and natural-gas companies. In some areas, they can circumvent the sanctions, but ultimately, companies need to choose between doing business with Iran or doing business with the United States. That's why the sanctions are effective; they force the businesses to choose. That's one aspect." "The other aspect," Navon continued, "is from the E.U. itself, and Mogherini and ideology. They hate Trump. They think the deal they reached with Iran three years ago was the best deal they could have reached, and they will do whatever they can to circumvent Trump." 'Israel can break that consensus' While collectively, European countries often appear unwilling to listen to Israel's concerns regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions and regional aspirations, Jerusalem has good relations with some of the E.U. countries individually, and the Jewish state's concerns have made their way into the halls of European parliaments. "By having a part in convincing the U.S. to pull out of the deal, Israel was able to influence European attitudes towards Iran," said Navon. "Netanyahu has been doing a pretty good job in developing ties with the so-called rebels in Eastern Europe. So now, when there is a vote on the Mideast, Israel can break that consensus." Navon was skeptical that E.U. efforts to bypass U.S. sanctions would prove successful. "The test really will be whether the E.U. will be able to convince the companies to remain in Iran," he added. "At the end of the day, the bottom line is that European companies will have to choose between doing business with Iran or with the U.S." Quotes "Most of the countries, especially Germany and France, want to circumvent U.S. sanctions because they want to keep business going in Europe, especially car-makers and natural-gas companies.

News article:
The EU effort to save the Iran nuclear accord by building a mechanism to buy Tehran’s oil despite the return of US sanctions has run into difficulty. Brussels supports the deal struck in 2015 to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, which was dealt a blow in May when the US President Donald Trump pulled out. But Washington has announced the reimposition of swingeing sanctions from November 4, including on Iran’s oil sector, scaring off European traders. Last month at the United Nations, the EU announced plans for a "special purpose vehicle" -- a payment system to continue trade and business ties with Iran. The renewed US sanctions come into force on Sunday, and work on the mechanism is still going on. "We are in the process of putting measures in place. Work is ongoing," EU foreign affairs spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters on Wednesday. The payment mechanism has the backing of the remaining five signatories to the Iran deal -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. But senior officials in Brussels admit that it is proving difficult to set up. "The undertaking is very complicated... the vehicle will not be operational on November 5," one told AFP. The EU will publish a statement on Tuesday reaffirming support for the nuclear deal, as long as Tehran continues to respect its side of the bargain. And an EU diplomat said the plan to create the new entity would be confirmed at the same time. "The intention is to create a company registered in an EU country which will allow transactions," the official said. "We need to supply it with capital and clarify its governance -- this is not easy and it will not just start working overnight." The three EU deal signatories -- France, Britain and Germany -- are involved in the project, along with other countries which buy Iranian oil. But not all EU countries are on board, Iranian agents have been accused of plotting attacks on opposition figures in Europe and US elections are looming. One European diplomat said the bloc wants to avoid a "direct confrontation" with Trump’s administration over Iran before the November 6 congressional poll. But in any case, the plans -- championed by EU high representative for foreign affairs Federica Mogherini -- are progressing very slowly. "For the moment, we’re nowhere. There’s no will to proceed on the behalf of the member states," one of those negotiating the design of the mechanism said. Another official insisted: "The plan’s not dead." But he admitted the whole enterprise is "politically risky" for capitals wary of antagonising Washington. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has explicitly warned against EU states or companies trying to get around the sanctions, which are a US policy priority. The idea is that the SPV acts as a clearing house. Traders would pay into it to buy Iranian exports and Iran’s purchases in Europe would be paid by the fund. This would allow Europeans to trade Iranian oil without sending cash directly to the Islamic republic. And EU leaders have not ruled out allowing entities from other states keen to avoid US sanctions -- notably India, China and Turkey -- to use the SPV. This would blow a hole in US efforts to use oil sanctions to pressure Iran into more concessions than agreed to in the nuclear deal -- or face collapse. But it would also accelerate the widening of the rift between the US and its allies on foreign policy, and Trump may seek to punish firms using the vehicle. Europe nevertheless hopes it can avoid an immediate crisis, and persuade Iran to stick by its side of the nuclear deal despite Washington’s refusal to do so.

News article:
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran called on Saturday for European assurances of support in the face of Washington’s intent to reimpose sanctions on vital Iranian oil sales to force Tehran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities. Slideshow ( 2 images ) Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke by telephone with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and his counterparts from Germany, Sweden and Denmark about European measures to counter the U.S. sanctions, the Iranian state news agency IRNA reported. “Mogherini and the European ministers ... highlighted the importance of the finance ministers’ commitment to Europe’s financial mechanism to save the Iran nuclear deal and said the mechanism will be operational in the coming days,” IRNA said. Washington will reapply far-reaching sanctions on Iran’s petroleum and banking sectors starting on Monday. Diplomats told Reuters last week that the new EU mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4, when the next phase of U.S. sanctions hit, but will not be operational until early next year. The EU, France, Germany and Britain, said in a joint statement on Friday they regretted U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to restore sanctions on Iran, the world’s No. 3 oil exporter. “Our aim is to protect European economic actors who have legitimate commercial exchanges with Iran, in line with European legislation and the United Nations’ Security Council resolution 2231,” Mogherini and the foreign ministers and finance ministers of the three countries said in their statement. The three biggest European powers are co-signatories, along with Russia and China, to an international 2015 deal with Iran that reined in its nuclear work in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions on Tehran. With the sanctions clampdown, Trump is seeking to push Iran into stricter curbs on its nuclear program and a halt to its missile development activity and support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. Trump denounced the nuclear deal, signed before he took office, as flawed in Iran’s favor and withdrew Washington from the pact in May. Meanwhile, Iranian state television reported that the Islamic Republic had started production of the locally-designed Kowsar fighter plane for use in its air force.

The EU, France, Germany and Britain, said in a joint statement on Friday they regretted U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to restore sanctions on Iran, the world’s No. 3 oil exporter. “Our aim is to protect European economic actors who have legitimate commercial exchanges with Iran, in line with European legislation and the United Nations’ Security Council resolution 2231,” Mogherini and the foreign ministers and finance ministers of the three countries said in their statement. The three biggest European powers are co-signatories, along with Russia and China, to an international 2015 deal with Iran that reined in its nuclear work in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions on Tehran. With the sanctions clampdown, Trump is seeking to push Iran into stricter curbs on its nuclear program and a halt to its missile development activity and support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. Trump denounced the nuclear deal, signed before he took office, as flawed in Iran’s favor and withdrew Washington from the pact in May. Meanwhile, Iranian state television reported that the Islamic Republic had started production of the locally-designed Kowsar fighter plane for use in its air force.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran called on Saturday for European assurances of support in the face of Washington’s intent to reimpose sanctions on vital Iranian oil sales to force Tehran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities. Slideshow ( 2 images ) Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke by telephone with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and his counterparts from Germany, Sweden and Denmark about European measures to counter the U.S. sanctions, the Iranian state news agency IRNA reported. “Mogherini and the European ministers ... highlighted the importance of the finance ministers’ commitment to Europe’s financial mechanism to save the Iran nuclear deal and said the mechanism will be operational in the coming days,” IRNA said. Washington will reapply far-reaching sanctions on Iran’s petroleum and banking sectors starting on Monday. Diplomats told Reuters last week that the new EU mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4, when the next phase of U.S. sanctions hit, but will not be operational until early next year.

News article:
On Nov. 5, the United States imposed sanctions on Iran's oil exports, the central bank of Iran and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Despite being the "toughest sanctions ever placed," their efficiency will depend on Europe, as it is Iran's second-largest trading partner. It is so because the biggest trading companion – China (30 billion euros annually), used to conduct business with the republic under the sanctions regime. Formally the European Union supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In August, after the first round of U.S. sanctions against Iran's automotive industry, riyal and trading in gold and some metals, Brussels promised to compensate losses for firms and prohibited them from complying with U.S. restrictions. Later on Nov. 2, the EU vowed a special payment mechanism which allows European companies to continue oil trading with Iran by bypassing the U.S. dollar. Still there are some tendencies inside Europe that make its resistance incomplete. Foremost, its fear. In an interview with CBS, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reminded viewers that "hundreds of businesses have left Iran since [President Donald] Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal." Among them are French Total S.A., which inked a $1 billion deal to develop the South Pars offshore field, Peugeot and Siemens. Pompeo hopes to increase fear and enforce more European multinationals to cut commerce with Tehran. "Any European companies doing business there won't do business with the U.S.," he added. The second barrier for effectiveness of European anti-sanction mechanism is the lack of unity concerning Iran. Some of the EU member states are more loyal to Washington than others. A recent example is Denmark. On Oct. 30, the Danish foreign ministry recalled its ambassador to Iran and announced that it would seek EU sanctions against Tehran. The reason was the attack by a Norwegian citizen of Iranian origin on the activist of the Arab Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA) – an organization that seeks to separate Khuzestan, the oil-rich province in the Persian Gulf, from Iran. Copenhagen believes Teheran was behind the assault. Given the possible involvement of ASMLA in the September terror attacks in the town of Ahwaz, the operations of Iranian special services may seem justified. However, such Iranian crackdown on the separatists is estimated by some EU countries as a violation of human rights and crime on the European soil. Iran risks getting its "Skripal case," which became an appropriate pretext to unite almost every member state around British anti-Russian initiatives and forced even the U.S. to impose sanctions against Russia. Thus, Danish accusations may destroy the pan-European consensus concerning avoiding the U.S. sanctions against Iran and non-imposition of its own. Such attempts emanated not only from loyal U.S. allies, such as Denmark, which gave full backing to Washington's war in Afghanistan and Iraq. In June, a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment was launched in France, which accused Tehran in attempt to launch a bombing attack on a demonstration in Paris with the participation of the Iranian opposition. For its own part, the White House will warm up the European fears. In May, after Trump denounced the JCPOA, Pompeo accused Iran's Revolutionary Guard of carrying out "assassination operations in the heart of Europe." Now he says to the Europeans – either work with the U.S. or with Iran. After signing the nuclear deal, the EU's trade with Iran has tripled from 7 billion to 21 billion euros. Dozens of EU companies – including Total, Eni and BASF – signed multibillion contracts to develop Iran's infrastructure, gas fields and construction sector. Whether or not Brussels withstands the U.S. pressure on Iran, will define not only the future of European revenues and energy security, but also its readiness to be independent from the United States. * Political scientist, specialist on the Middle East, Turkey, Russia and the EU; Ph.D. degree (Dr. Phil.) from Salzburg University

News article:
The first of the sanctions that had been suspended under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal went back into effect in August, after which the European Union began to explore means to incentivize Iran to remain a party to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In recent weeks the EU announced its intention to create a “special purpose vehicle” for facilitating transfers between European businesses and the Islamic Republic. The prospects for that plan are now being tested as Iran copes with renewed sanctions on 700 entities while the Europeans contemplate their future relations with both Iran and the United States. Many analysts have questioned the SPV’s viability or the extent of its prospective effectiveness as helping Iran to evade US sanctions. Others have raised doubts about the long-term political will or European powers when it comes to standing against the US on this issue. Nevertheless, many representatives of the EU and its member states have continued to give the impression that they are both committed to helping Iran and actually capable of doing so. In some cases, remarks to this effect have come from what are arguably the unlikeliest sources. On Wednesday, Newsweek quoted French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire as saying, “Europe refuses to allow the U.S. to be the trade policeman of the world.” Le Maire went on to urge the Europeans as a whole to assert their independence, and he boasted of the ongoing development of plans to implement and utilize the SPV. He did not, however, going into detail about those plans, thus leaving them open to criticism or scrutiny by those who believe that Europe will waver or that the SPV will face insurmountable logistical obstacles. The potential for such obstacles was underscored when the Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication announced that it would be barring Iranian banks from accessing the system. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the European Commission had issued a statement describing the decision as “regrettable.” It is a sentiment that European authorities had previously expressed with regard to other European entities’ decisions to fully comply with US sanctions even ahead of their ultimate re-imposition at the start of this week. However, such condemnation of the growing financial and logistical gulf between Europe and the Islamic Republic is at odds with European commentary on closely related issues, such as the Iranian threat to regional stability and Western security. The latter issue was brought into sharper focus in late October after Danish authorities announced the arrest of an Iranian operative who was accused of plotting at least one assassination on Danish soil. This in turn highlighted the surprising nature of recent French statements in support of Iranian transactions, since a previously thwarted terror plot had sought to detonate explosives just outside Paris. The earlier incident targeted the annual international rally of Iranian expatriates and their political supporters, organized by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which maintains a headquarters in France. The NCRI itself gathered and publicized information about the plot in its immediate aftermath, underscoring the fact that it had been approved at the highest levels of the Iranian regime. This information was subsequently corroborated by French intelligence, with government officials formally holding Tehran accountable only weeks before the revelation of the Danish plot amplified the apparent Iranian terror threat. Although French officials have been vocal in their defense of the JCPOA, they have also been credited with some of the strongest European positions on holding Iran accountable for its overall malign activity. In keeping with this observation, Newsweek noted that in September, after the first round of US sanctions had been re-imposed, French President Emmanuel Macron declared that although he disagreed with the White House over the nuclear deal and the relevant sanctions, he agreed with Trump administration’s underlying goals. Those goals have been clearly and repeatedly described as a complete reversal of Iran’s policies in a number of key areas, mostly relating to the regime’s strategy of regional force projection and the development of foreign militant proxies. The return and prospective escalation of US sanctions is widely expected to limit the regime’s ability to finance and direct those proxies. But in the short term, the controversy surrounding the sanctions may drive many of Iran’s proxies and partners to cleave to the regime and express solidarity in the face of nascent pressure. This possible trend was illuminated by statements from – and subsequent criticism of – the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. On Monday, the organization accused the US of undermining “security and stability in the region” while strengthening “the Zionist project.” Hamas also expressed general “solidarity with Iran’s government,” according to The Tower. This led to Anwar Gargash, the United Arab Emirates’ Minister of Foreign Affairs, to criticism Hamas for ignoring the widespread anxiety among Arab powers regarding Iran’s pursuit of regional hegemony. “Hamas’s solidarity with the Iranian government… pushes the Palestinian issue into a maze and confirms the opinion that the movement, in its orientation, is nothing more than an Iranian regional tool,” he said. While this sort of commentary, coming from regional actors, may put significant pressure upon entities whose position between Iran and its Arab adversaries is in question, the same commentary may also help to keep pressure on European governments to recognize the dangerous and destabilizing role that Iran plays in the broader Middle East. Certainly, some such pressure is already being exerted by the Trump administration via the public statements and diplomatic outreach that accompanies the renewed enforcement of sanctions. And as that pressure mounts, it may yet encourage Paris and other European governments to accept the strategies put forth by the White House, as well as its goals. On the other hand, some of this pressure has come from entities whose recent actions have undermined their credibility as critics of Iran’s penchant for human rights violations and support for terrorism. In recent weeks, much attention has been focused on the apparent execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by agents of Iran’s leading regional adversary, Saudi Arabia. Somewhat surprisingly, though, this has actually prompted some commentators and media outlets to draw connections between that killing and the crimes and abuses of the Iranian regime. And this in turn has encouraged European powers to clarify their stance on issues of human rights and terrorism in general. Late in October, IranWire published an article along these lines, arguing that the international community’s reaction to the Khashoggi killing should be informed by historical experiences with the Iranian regime’s “chain murders” on European soil in the 80s and 90s. The article noted that at least two instances of similar killings apparently occurred last year – a fact that it tentatively attributes to a recent lack of pressure and a trend toward international focus on issues other than Iran’s assault on opposition figures. This stands in contrast to the clear and multi-faceted pressure that apparently led to the earlier halt of the chain murders. While this can be read as an indictment of European entities that are standing against the US sanctions, another IranWire article extended aspects of the criticism to the United States itself. That article, which discussed the renewed sanctions in the context of Iran’s recent and ongoing public protests, accused the White House of being too narrowly focused on Iran’s regional activities, to the exclusive of its domestic policies and violent repression of dissent. This is not to say that the administration has never condemned that repression, but IranWire argues that the mullahs may have gotten the impression that “they will need to give concessions over their regional policies only” and that this could lead to “new potential risks for the Islamic Republic.” But the article also pointed to the potential for reinvigorated public protests in the wake of re-imposed US sanctions. It argued that the outcome would depend in large part upon the positions taken by traditional US allies, and whether they try to mitigate the sanctions’ effects or direct them toward Iran’s domestic behavior as well as its threats to the region. If those dual aspects of the Islamic Republic appear to be worsening, the Europeans may be incentivized to add their own pressure, even if it takes different forms. This is precisely what Emmanuel Macron seemed to advocate for in September when he said that a multilateral, long-term Iran strategy “can’t just boil down to sanctions and containment.” Of course, this is not to say that sanctions cannot be part of an effective strategy, and it remains to be seen whether the governments of France, the UK, Germany, and the rest of Europe will come around to recognizing the potential effectiveness of sanctions as part of a broader effort to exert pressure on the mullahs’ regime.

The prospects for that plan are now being tested as Iran copes with renewed sanctions on 700 entities while the Europeans contemplate their future relations with both Iran and the United States. Many analysts have questioned the SPV’s viability or the extent of its prospective effectiveness as helping Iran to evade US sanctions. Others have raised doubts about the long-term political will or European powers when it comes to standing against the US on this issue. Nevertheless, many representatives of the EU and its member states have continued to give the impression that they are both committed to helping Iran and actually capable of doing so. In some cases, remarks to this effect have come from what are arguably the unlikeliest sources. On Wednesday, Newsweek quoted French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire as saying, “Europe refuses to allow the U.S. to be the trade policeman of the world.” Le Maire went on to urge the Europeans as a whole to assert their independence, and he boasted of the ongoing development of plans to implement and utilize the SPV. He did not, however, going into detail about those plans, thus leaving them open to criticism or scrutiny by those who believe that Europe will waver or that the SPV will face insurmountable logistical obstacles. The potential for such obstacles was underscored when the Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication announced that it would be barring Iranian banks from accessing the system. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the European Commission had issued a statement describing the decision as “regrettable.” It is a sentiment that European authorities had previously expressed with regard to other European entities’ decisions to fully comply with US sanctions even ahead of their ultimate re-imposition at the start of this week. However, such condemnation of the growing financial and logistical gulf between Europe and the Islamic Republic is at odds with European commentary on closely related issues, such as the Iranian threat to regional stability and Western security. The latter issue was brought into sharper focus in late October after Danish authorities announced the arrest of an Iranian operative who was accused of plotting at least one assassination on Danish soil. This in turn highlighted the surprising nature of recent French statements in support of Iranian transactions, since a previously thwarted terror plot had sought to detonate explosives just outside Paris. The earlier incident targeted the annual international rally of Iranian expatriates and their political supporters, organized by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which maintains a headquarters in France. The NCRI itself gathered and publicized information about the plot in its immediate aftermath, underscoring the fact that it had been approved at the highest levels of the Iranian regime. This information was subsequently corroborated by French intelligence, with government officials formally holding Tehran accountable only weeks before the revelation of the Danish plot amplified the apparent Iranian terror threat. Although French officials have been vocal in their defense of the JCPOA, they have also been credited with some of the strongest European positions on holding Iran accountable for its overall malign activity. In keeping with this observation, Newsweek noted that in September, after the first round of US sanctions had been re-imposed, French President Emmanuel Macron declared that although he disagreed with the White House over the nuclear deal and the relevant sanctions, he agreed with Trump administration’s underlying goals. Those goals have been clearly and repeatedly described as a complete reversal of Iran’s policies in a number of key areas, mostly relating to the regime’s strategy of regional force projection and the development of foreign militant proxies. The return and prospective escalation of US sanctions is widely expected to limit the regime’s ability to finance and direct those proxies. But in the short term, the controversy surrounding the sanctions may drive many of Iran’s proxies and partners to cleave to the regime and express solidarity in the face of nascent pressure. This possible trend was illuminated by statements from – and subsequent criticism of – the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. On Monday, the organization accused the US of undermining “security and stability in the region” while strengthening “the Zionist project.” Hamas also expressed general “solidarity with Iran’s government,” according to The Tower. This led to Anwar Gargash, the United Arab Emirates’ Minister of Foreign Affairs, to criticism Hamas for ignoring the widespread anxiety among Arab powers regarding Iran’s pursuit of regional hegemony. “Hamas’s solidarity with the Iranian government… pushes the Palestinian issue into a maze and confirms the opinion that the movement, in its orientation, is nothing more than an Iranian regional tool,” he said. While this sort of commentary, coming from regional actors, may put significant pressure upon entities whose position between Iran and its Arab adversaries is in question, the same commentary may also help to keep pressure on European governments to recognize the dangerous and destabilizing role that Iran plays in the broader Middle East. Certainly, some such pressure is already being exerted by the Trump administration via the public statements and diplomatic outreach that accompanies the renewed enforcement of sanctions. And as that pressure mounts, it may yet encourage Paris and other European governments to accept the strategies put forth by the White House, as well as its goals. On the other hand, some of this pressure has come from entities whose recent actions have undermined their credibility as critics of Iran’s penchant for human rights violations and support for terrorism. In recent weeks, much attention has been focused on the apparent execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by agents of Iran’s leading regional adversary, Saudi Arabia. Somewhat surprisingly, though, this has actually prompted some commentators and media outlets to draw connections between that killing and the crimes and abuses of the Iranian regime. And this in turn has encouraged European powers to clarify their stance on issues of human rights and terrorism in general. Late in October, IranWire published an article along these lines, arguing that the international community’s reaction to the Khashoggi killing should be informed by historical experiences with the Iranian regime’s “chain murders” on European soil in the 80s and 90s. The article noted that at least two instances of similar killings apparently occurred last year – a fact that it tentatively attributes to a recent lack of pressure and a trend toward international focus on issues other than Iran’s assault on opposition figures. This stands in contrast to the clear and multi-faceted pressure that apparently led to the earlier halt of the chain murders. While this can be read as an indictment of European entities that are standing against the US sanctions, another IranWire article extended aspects of the criticism to the United States itself. That article, which discussed the renewed sanctions in the context of Iran’s recent and ongoing public protests, accused the White House of being too narrowly focused on Iran’s regional activities, to the exclusive of its domestic policies and violent repression of dissent. This is not to say that the administration has never condemned that repression, but IranWire argues that the mullahs may have gotten the impression that “they will need to give concessions over their regional policies only” and that this could lead to “new potential risks for the Islamic Republic.” But the article also pointed to the potential for reinvigorated public protests in the wake of re-imposed US sanctions. It argued that the outcome would depend in large part upon the positions taken by traditional US allies, and whether they try to mitigate the sanctions’ effects or direct them toward Iran’s domestic behavior as well as its threats to the region. If those dual aspects of the Islamic Republic appear to be worsening, the Europeans may be incentivized to add their own pressure, even if it takes different forms. This is precisely what Emmanuel Macron seemed to advocate for in September when he said that a multilateral, long-term Iran strategy “can’t just boil down to sanctions and containment.” Of course, this is not to say that sanctions cannot be part of an effective strategy, and it remains to be seen whether the governments of France, the UK, Germany, and the rest of Europe will come around to recognizing the potential effectiveness of sanctions as part of a broader effort to exert pressure on the mullahs’ regime.

News article:
Iran almost managed to carry out some of its threats against Europe in recent weeks, but it learned its lesson the hard way and discovered that its agents operating in the West have been exposed. Two attempts to attack Iranian dissidents were foiled. One was in France against the People's Mujahedeen of Iran conference; the other was in Denmark against Ahwazi activists. While the security agencies in several European capitals believe that Tehran will not stop such efforts, Paris did not think it necessary to do more than expel an Iranian diplomat. What's more, there was no special media focus on the incident. The authorities in Copenhagen, meanwhile, urged EU countries to support the demand for economic sanctions against Iran. Will this mean more sanctions to join those imposed by the US? Iran's action against dissidents who challenge its security must put relations with "friendly" countries at risk. If Tehran doesn't understand that, it is misjudging the situation. READ: Europe's central banks to open channel for Iran In the French and Danish cases, it was confirmed that efforts to save the nuclear agreement were not connected to the thwarting of the two terrorist attacks. Perhaps the fact that Iranian citizens were targeted meant that the situation did not escalate. According to The Economist, the Europeans are interested in maintaining the nuclear agreement with Iran because it should delay Tehran's acquisition of a nuclear weapon. If the deal is discarded, Iran may resume uranium enrichment in secret locations that weapons inspectors cannot get to and the capacity to build a nuclear bomb may result. This is a situation that Europe does not want to think about, as they fear that it would open the door to worse prospects, most notably armed conflict. The Europeans welcome Donald Trump's invitation to Iran to negotiate but consider his demand for a new agreement imposed by force through the use of new sanctions to be unrealistic in its objective of convincing the government in Tehran to agree to talks. The US is relying on the impact of the sanctions to bring the Iranians to the table, but the EU is stepping up its efforts to establish a plan to overcome or ease them. Over a year after the US pulled out of the nuclear deal, Europe's rejection of such a move has not changed, although the dispute with America may be costly. The Iranians believe that pressure on Europe could push the US President to back down, or they could play on the difference between the Western allies. The irony is that Tehran has gone so far as to make threats, with Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the Commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and his deputy, Hossein Salami, have hinted since November last year that the range of Iran's missiles could be increased to over 2,000 km. They clearly meant to let the EU know that Europe could be targeted "if it posed a threat to Iran." The Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation also used threatening language against Europe just days after the US pulled out of the deal in May, warning of the consequences if the EU reneges on the terms of the agreement. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei outlined a list of requirements from Europe's commitment to the deal and said that it would be considered null and void if they are not fulfilled. In September, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif threatened that his country might curb its implementation of the agreement and increase its work on uranium enrichment if Europe does not compensate Iran for the consequences of the US sanctions. He added that Europe must be ready to pay for its security. Such threats apparently did not frighten the Europeans. However, it is surprising that they did not reject them or respond in any other way. Instead, their dealings with Iran since have been intended to appease and reassure Tehran, to no apparent avail. Iran may be able to resume its nuclear programme, but not now, as it needs time to regain its former momentum. It is, however, using this card to put pressure on Europe, which wants to preserve its economic interests but is reluctant to be seen to be giving in to any blackmail. This has strengthened Tehran, which is using the Europeans in its confrontation with Washington. READ: Europe must offset US pullout from nuclear deal It may have succeeded in part with the idea of forcing Europe to "compensate" Iran for its losses as a result of the US sanctions. There is an international precedent for this; the Obama administration compensated Israel for not taking action against the nuclear deal. The whole game will be revealed soon because any European measures will be limited and formal and will not constitute worthy "compensation". Furthermore, Iran has not accompanied its threats with any genuine offers that would help Europe to argue to the US that Tehran intends to change its behaviour. What's more, the Danish Prime Minister has insisted that maintaining the nuclear agreement is not a blank cheque to cover up unacceptable Iranian actions on European soil. Denmark's leader made this statement in the context of a call to punish Iran for the foiled attacks against its dissidents.

(Adds comment on SWIFT) LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States is not too concerned by Europe's idea for a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to circumvent U.S. sanctions with Iran as companies are withdrawing from the country in droves, the senior official for financial intelligence said. "I think the bigger news in Europe is that companies are withdrawing from Iran in droves," Under Secretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelker told reporters in London. She is due to travel to other European capitals. "I am not concerned by the SPV actually at all," she said. "I do believe we are going to find additional mechanisms by which we can work together." The United States, Mandelker said, would strictly enforce its sanctions on Iran. When asked what was next on Iran, she said: "On Iran you are going to see a lot more from us." SWIFT, which facilitates the bulk of global cross-border payments, has already cut off the Iranian central bank and other financial institutions, Mandelker said. (Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge.

News article:
The United States increased pressure on European banks and firms that engage in a special European Union initiative to protect trade with Iran, warning them on Thursday that they will be at risk from newly reimposed U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported. “European banks and European companies know that we will vigorously enforce sanctions against this brutal and violent regime,” the U.S. Special Representative, Brian Hook, said in a telephone briefing with reporters. “Any major European company will always choose the American market over the Iranian market,” Hook charged. The biggest European companies have already pulled out of Iran, among them French oil giant Total and German engineering conglomerate Siemens. Hook observed it was, therefore, “no surprise” that EU efforts to establish a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) were collapsing over fear in EU capitals that hosting it would provoke U.S. punishment. The SPV is a central part of European attempts to salvage the 2015 nuclear accord with the Islamic Republic, aiming to circumvent the U.S. sanctions regime. However, negotiations over the initiative are proving difficult and no country is keen to host the SPV. The main European powers — Germany, France, and Britain — are putting pressure on the Benelux states after Austria refused to manage the plan, threatening its viability. In theory, the SPV would act as a financial and commercial intermediary for exports and imports between Iran and the EU and will be open to other countries that are trading with Iran. It would use Euros or sterling, rather than U.S. dollars, to minimize the exposure of participating businesses to U.S. sanctions. The EU had wanted to have the SPV set up by this month, but six senior diplomats told Reuters this week that the initiative was on the brink of collapse. “Austria has indeed refused. It’s not dead, but it’s not going in the right direction. We are going to try again with Luxembourg, but we’re under no illusions,” a European official said on Wednesday. Hook, meanwhile, reiterated a warning that attempts to bypass U.S. sanctions was sending “the wrong signal, at the wrong time,” and instructed EU business to stop trading with Iran or face serious consequences. Hook stressed, however, that waivers were granted to eight of Iran’s biggest oil importers to ensure the U.S. sanctions regime did not harm allies or raise oil prices. “We have looked at these on a case by case basis, taking into account the unique needs of friends and partners, and also ensuring that as we impose sanctions on Iran’s oil sector that we do not lift the price of oil,” Hook said.

The main European powers — Germany, France, and Britain — are putting pressure on the Benelux states after Austria refused to manage the plan, threatening its viability. In theory, the SPV would act as a financial and commercial intermediary for exports and imports between Iran and the EU and will be open to other countries that are trading with Iran. It would use Euros or sterling, rather than U.S. dollars, to minimize the exposure of participating businesses to U.S. sanctions. The EU had wanted to have the SPV set up by this month, but six senior diplomats told Reuters this week that the initiative was on the brink of collapse. “Austria has indeed refused. It’s not dead, but it’s not going in the right direction. We are going to try again with Luxembourg, but we’re under no illusions,” a European official said on Wednesday. Hook, meanwhile, reiterated a warning that attempts to bypass U.S. sanctions was sending “the wrong signal, at the wrong time,” and instructed EU business to stop trading with Iran or face serious consequences. Hook stressed, however, that waivers were granted to eight of Iran’s biggest oil importers to ensure the U.S. sanctions regime did not harm allies or raise oil prices. “We have looked at these on a case by case basis, taking into account the unique needs of friends and partners, and also ensuring that as we impose sanctions on Iran’s oil sector that we do not lift the price of oil,” Hook said.

The United States increased pressure on European banks and firms that engage in a special European Union initiative to protect trade with Iran, warning them on Thursday that they will be at risk from newly reimposed U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported. “European banks and European companies know that we will vigorously enforce sanctions against this brutal and violent regime,” the U.S. Special Representative, Brian Hook, said in a telephone briefing with reporters. “Any major European company will always choose the American market over the Iranian market,” Hook charged. The biggest European companies have already pulled out of Iran, among them French oil giant Total and German engineering conglomerate Siemens. Hook observed it was, therefore, “no surprise” that EU efforts to establish a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) were collapsing over fear in EU capitals that hosting it would provoke U.S. punishment. The SPV is a central part of European attempts to salvage the 2015 nuclear accord with the Islamic Republic, aiming to circumvent the U.S. sanctions regime.

News article:
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers showed cautious support on Monday for possible new economic sanctions on Iran in a shift of policy after accusations of Iranian attack plots in France and Denmark, diplomats said. Denmark and France briefed their EU counterparts at a meeting in Brussels on the alleged plots and ministers agreed to consider targeted sanctions on Iranians in response, although no details or names were discussed, five diplomats told Reuters. Though still at an early stage, the EU’s readiness to penalize Iranians would be the first such move in years after months of internal division over how to punish Iranians accused of destabilizing activities in Europe and the Middle East. Until now, the EU has been straining to uphold the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers that U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May. It has been less willing to consider sanctions, instead seeking talks with Tehran. Iran has warned it could ditch the nuclear deal if EU powers do not protect its trade and financial benefits. France has already imposed sanctions on two Iranians and Iran’s intelligence service over what it says was a failed plot to carry out a bomb attack at a rally near Paris organized by an exiled Iranian opposition group. One option is to establish those asset freezes at an EU-wide level, diplomats said. Denmark, which in October said it suspected an Iranian government intelligence service had tried to carry out an assassination plot on its soil, is also open to EU-wide sanctions, the diplomats told Reuters. In October, France said there was no doubt that Iran’s intelligence ministry was behind the June plot to attack the demonstration by Iranian exiles near Paris. It froze assets belonging to Tehran’s intelligence services and two Iranian nationals - a Vienna-based diplomat now under arrest in Belgium for the plot and the deputy minister and director general of intelligence, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam. Neither appear to have held any assets in France. Paris also discreetly expelled an Iranian diplomat, diplomatic sources told Reuters last month. Iran has denied any involvement in either alleged plot. Under the 2015 deal, Iran restricted its disputed nuclear program, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions against it. MISSILE SANCTIONS DIDN’T FLY In March, Britain, France and Germany proposed to sanction Iran over its development of ballistic missiles and its role in Syria’s war, but the initiative failed to gather sufficient support across the EU to take effect. Italy was one EU country unwilling to countenance new measures as it sought to preserve business ties with Iran. In an effort to balance Iran policy, the ministers at their meeting on Monday also tried to press ahead in setting up a special mechanism to trade with Iran that could be under EU, not national, law. The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a kind of clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods in an effective barter arrangement circumventing U.S. sanctions, which are based on global use of the dollar for oil sales. Despite technical difficulties and delays, the EU believes this formula could shield individual member states from being hit by U.S. sanctions that have been reimposed on trade with Iran after Washington’s pullout from the nuclear deal. “There is a willingness for the financial vehicle ... to be set up quickly,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters. However, no country has come forward as a potential host. Their reluctance arises from fears that SPV reliance on local banks to smooth trade with Iran may incur U.S. penalties, severing the lenders’ access to U.S. markets, diplomats said. Luxembourg is seen as a good candidate to manage the Iran SPV given its experience in creating a similar mechanism during the 2009-12 euro zone financial crisis.

News article:
It is now Europe’s turn to fulfill commitments: Iran envoy IRNA – Terming US sanctions against Iran as ‘unfair’, Iranian Ambassador to Italy Hamid Bayat said ‘The US intends to target our country’s dignity. We have fulfilled out commitments and now it is Europe’s turn (to do so).’ In an interview to Italian newspaper ‘Il Messaggero’, Bayat in response to a question if the sanctions would affect Iran’s international relations particularly its ties with the European Union, said that would depend on EU’s performance. ‘The EU has played a prominent role in shaping the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) and Iran has been fully compliant with its commitments under the deal as verified in 13 reports of the International Atomic Energy Organization,’ he said. Unfortunately, he said, the United States (even before Donald Trump announced his country’s withdrawal from the JCPoA) and European states failed to fully comply with their commitments under the deal. Now Iran expects European states, the EU in particular, to fulfill their obligations in the wake of the US exit from the multilateral international deal which is part of the UN Security Council resolution 2231, the ambassador said. ‘We are aware that the EU is working on a mechanism in order to continue its trade and commercial ties with Iran. The stands taken by Ms Mogherini (EU foreign policy chief) in support of the JCPoA are good and we appreciate it. But we are still awaiting to see these statements translated into deeds,’ Bayat said. To another question on the impacts of US sanctions, the ambassador replied ‘The US action in exerting extra pressure (on Iran) has actually targeted people’s livelihood and the country’s economy and is quite in contradiction with its claim of support for (Iranian) people. ‘ By exerting pressure on people’s life, a country that claims to be an advocate of human rights, has actually ignored the Iranian people’s right and that is an inhuman act. The US secretary of state (Mike Pompeo) has said that if Iran wants to feed its people it should listen to what the US says. So, it is quite clear that the goal of the United States is not merely to defeat Iran economically rather attack the Iranians’ dignity and honor,’ the ambassador said. Referring to numerous agreements signed by Italy and Iran in recent years, Bayat said that Tehran-Rome economic and cultural ties dated back to centuries ago. In the post JCPoA era, the volume of Iran-Italy trade exchanges increased 4.5 folds in less than three years, he said, adding that in 2017, mutual trade between Iran and Italy amounted to 5.1 billion dollars annually, causing Italy to be Iran’s fist trade partners among European states. ‘Following the signing of the JCPoA, President Hassan Rouhani embarked on his first European tour by paying an official visit to Italy during which memoranda of understanding and agreements worth 27 billion Euros were inked by the two countries for economic and commercial cooperation. In January 20-18, an agreement on a 5-billion -euro credit line was signed in Rome which we hope both countries can make it operational under the new situation,’ the Iranian envoy said. Replying to another question, the Iranian ambassador said the US exit from the nuclear deal would undoubtedly affect international political equilibriums. ‘By imposing the secondary sanctions, the United States are practically breaching the sovereignty of other countries including its allies. The world is familiar with the US language of threat. Should a country that hosts the UN headquarters trample upon international norms and UN resolutions this way? Will the world sit idle and tolerate such behaviors?’ he questioned. ‘The conflict is not over Iran. This is a test for the world in general and EU member states in particular to choose between unilateralism and multilateralism, between the language of threat and language of interaction, between imposition of American laws on their own countries and protection of their national sovereignty and finally between global peace and stability and chaos and instability of the world,’ Bayat said. Asked about the reasons behind tensions in the Middle East region or whether there are some solutions through which peace can be established in the region, Bayat replied ‘Over years some factors have contributed to intensifying conflicts, wars and unrests in the Middle East the most important of which are intervention of extra-territorial forces, ignoring nations’ rights, rejection of dialogue and negotiations and attempts to impose will and demands on them by means of threats and intimidation. ‘To this end, the United States’ wrong policies have served to intensify these conflicts and violence through supporting terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida and Daesh. No doubt that establishing security and stability in the region requires that such policies be changed and priority be given to the fight against terrorism. ‘During these years, Iran stood by the people of Syria and Iraq fighting a fierce battle against Daesh which led to the defeat of the dangerous group in both countries. Under present circumstances we believe that holding negotiations with participation of all groups and allowing regional nations to take part in running the affairs without any foreign interference is the only way to reduce conflicts and establish stability in the entire Middle East region ranging from Syria and Yemen to Bahrain,’ the Iranian envoy said.

It is now Europe’s turn to fulfill commitments: Iran envoy IRNA – Terming US sanctions against Iran as ‘unfair’, Iranian Ambassador to Italy Hamid Bayat said ‘The US intends to target our country’s dignity. We have fulfilled out commitments and now it is Europe’s turn (to do so).’ In an interview to Italian newspaper ‘Il Messaggero’, Bayat in response to a question if the sanctions would affect Iran’s international relations particularly its ties with the European Union, said that would depend on EU’s performance. ‘The EU has played a prominent role in shaping the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) and Iran has been fully compliant with its commitments under the deal as verified in 13 reports of the International Atomic Energy Organization,’ he said. Unfortunately, he said, the United States (even before Donald Trump announced his country’s withdrawal from the JCPoA) and European states failed to fully comply with their commitments under the deal. Now Iran expects European states, the EU in particular, to fulfill their obligations in the wake of the US exit from the multilateral international deal which is part of the UN Security Council resolution 2231, the ambassador said. ‘We are aware that the EU is working on a mechanism in order to continue its trade and commercial ties with Iran. The stands taken by Ms Mogherini (EU foreign policy chief) in support of the JCPoA are good and we appreciate it. But we are still awaiting to see these statements translated into deeds,’ Bayat said. To another question on the impacts of US sanctions, the ambassador replied ‘The US action in exerting extra pressure (on Iran) has actually targeted people’s livelihood and the country’s economy and is quite in contradiction with its claim of support for (Iranian) people. ‘ By exerting pressure on people’s life, a country that claims to be an advocate of human rights, has actually ignored the Iranian people’s right and that is an inhuman act. The US secretary of state (Mike Pompeo) has said that if Iran wants to feed its people it should listen to what the US says. So, it is quite clear that the goal of the United States is not merely to defeat Iran economically rather attack the Iranians’ dignity and honor,’ the ambassador said. Referring to numerous agreements signed by Italy and Iran in recent years, Bayat said that Tehran-Rome economic and cultural ties dated back to centuries ago. In the post JCPoA era, the volume of Iran-Italy trade exchanges increased 4.5 folds in less than three years, he said, adding that in 2017, mutual trade between Iran and Italy amounted to 5.1 billion dollars annually, causing Italy to be Iran’s fist trade partners among European states. ‘Following the signing of the JCPoA, President Hassan Rouhani embarked on his first European tour by paying an official visit to Italy during which memoranda of understanding and agreements worth 27 billion Euros were inked by the two countries for economic and commercial cooperation. In January 20-18, an agreement on a 5-billion -euro credit line was signed in Rome which we hope both countries can make it operational under the new situation,’ the Iranian envoy said. Replying to another question, the Iranian ambassador said the US exit from the nuclear deal would undoubtedly affect international political equilibriums. ‘By imposing the secondary sanctions, the United States are practically breaching the sovereignty of other countries including its allies. The world is familiar with the US language of threat. Should a country that hosts the UN headquarters trample upon international norms and UN resolutions this way? Will the world sit idle and tolerate such behaviors?’ he questioned. ‘The conflict is not over Iran. This is a test for the world in general and EU member states in particular to choose between unilateralism and multilateralism, between the language of threat and language of interaction, between imposition of American laws on their own countries and protection of their national sovereignty and finally between global peace and stability and chaos and instability of the world,’ Bayat said. Asked about the reasons behind tensions in the Middle East region or whether there are some solutions through which peace can be established in the region, Bayat replied ‘Over years some factors have contributed to intensifying conflicts, wars and unrests in the Middle East the most important of which are intervention of extra-territorial forces, ignoring nations’ rights, rejection of dialogue and negotiations and attempts to impose will and demands on them by means of threats and intimidation. ‘To this end, the United States’ wrong policies have served to intensify these conflicts and violence through supporting terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida and Daesh.

European Union foreign ministers showed cautious support on Monday for possible new economic sanctions on Iran in a shift of policy after accusations of Iranian attack plots in France and Denmark, diplomats said. Denmark and France briefed their EU counterparts at a meeting in Brussels on the alleged plots and ministers agreed to consider targeted sanctions on Iranians in response, although no details or names were discussed, five diplomats told Reuters. Though still at an early stage, the EU’s readiness to penalize Iranians would be the first such move in years after months of internal division over how to punish Iranians accused of destabilizing activities in Europe and the Middle East. Until now, the EU has been straining to uphold the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers that US President Donald Trump pulled out of in May. It has been less willing to consider sanctions, instead seeking talks with Tehran. Iran has warned it could ditch the nuclear deal if EU powers do not protect its trade and financial benefits. France has already imposed sanctions on two Iranians and Iran’s intelligence service over what it says was a failed plot to carry out a bomb attack at a rally near Paris organized by an exiled Iranian opposition group. One option is to establish those asset freezes at an EU-wide level, diplomats said. Denmark, which in October said it suspected an Iranian government intelligence service had tried to carry out an assassination plot on its soil, is also open to EU-wide sanctions, the diplomats told Reuters. In October, France said there was no doubt that Iran’s intelligence ministry was behind the June plot to attack the demonstration by Iranian exiles near Paris. It froze assets belonging to Tehran’s intelligence services and two Iranian nationals - a Vienna-based diplomat now under arrest in Belgium for the plot and the deputy minister and director general of intelligence, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam. Neither appear to have held any assets in France. Paris also discreetly expelled an Iranian diplomat, diplomatic sources told Reuters last month. Iran has denied any involvement in either alleged plot. Under the 2015 deal, Iran restricted its disputed nuclear program, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions against it.

News article:
The European initiative known as the “special purpose vehicle” aiming to facilitate financial transactions between the Green Continent and Iran’s regime – read bypass US sanctions – is very shaky and unstable. What at first seemed to be a bold rising to the challenge by the European Union has now suffered major and controversial setbacks following a series of foiled, Iran-orchestrated terror plots on European soil, including Albania, France and Denmark. These developments have made EU/Iran political relations all the more complicated, to say the least. Advertisement Logically, Iran would need to tone down its foreign bellicosity to allow Brussels present an argument vis-à-vis Washington. However, Tehran’s need to save face back home against its opposition in exile, the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI / MEK), leaves it no choice but to launch such illogical measures from a diplomatic relations point of view. That being a broad subject for another day, this piece will provide another perspective into why this EU/Iran initiative will most certainly end in failure. Harsh reality While introduced a few months ago, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) dossier is facing a conglomerate of obstacles and hurdles. Experts are now asking does this mechanism actually intend to provide the Europeans the means to purchase Iran’s oil and gas while bypassing the ongoing buildup of US primary and secondary sanctions. “So far, her ‘vehicle’ is stuck in bureaucratic mud, unable to take off as European firms leave Iran in droves,” as described by Benny Avni in a New York Post piece in reference to EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini as the SPV architect. Even media outlets known for promoting a return to the Obama era of US/Iran engagement are voicing growing concerns about the SPV sailing into unknown waters. “Officials have said they are watching such engineering attempts closely, although few economists and officials in Europe believe such efforts will offer Tehran much in the way of sanctuary from American penalties immediately,” according to the New York Times. Despite the brouhaha launched in western media by Iranian regime apologists and lobbyists, along with remnants of the Obama-era pro-appeasement voices, the on-the-ground reality strikes alarming reminders for those serious about doing business. “The European payment mechanism doesn’t shield you if you use the US financial system ... you can pay but don’t expect to be on their Christmas card list,” said Alex Beard, chief executive for oil and gas at Glencore, to Reuters. Eventually, tensions are rising between Tehran and Brussels, as the Iranian regime’s patience began to grow thin. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his deputy Abbas Araqchi have most recently voiced their disappointment in Europe not meeting their expectations to launch the SPV as a lifesaving mechanism against mounting US sanctions beginning to take their toll in crippling fashion. Finally, the nail in the coffin. “A special European Union initiative to protect trade with Iran against newly re-imposed US sanctions faces possible collapse with no EU country willing to host the operation for fear of provoking US punishment,” according to another recent Reuters report. “A bit crazy” Despite its noisy coming to life, the EU SPV gradually grew to become “little more than a glorified arrangement with limited scope” and even described as “largely symbolic.” More disturbing for businesses is the fact that the SPV, while aiming to become an alternative to the SWIFT global messaging system, falls miserably short. The SPV will lack the necessary ability to “conduct business in dollars or to access US institutions and the US financial system as a whole,” as explained Joel Gehrke in The Washington Examiner. Taking this slate of reservations into consideration and all the measures of various parties, the nuts and bolts of Europe’s SPV remains a mystery and even Mogherini failed to provide any actual timetable for its launch. Adding insult to injury for the EU and Iran is the reluctance shown by a variety of European countries to host the SPV, including Luxembourg, Austria and Belgium, leaving the entire project literally homeless. At the end of the day, Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the EU, dismissed the planned SPV as “nothing more than a paper tiger.” In spite of its strong support of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, France has yet to make a firm decision regarding the SPV and minister recently told Le Monde the entire idea is “a bit crazy.” Disclaimer - This author is writing under a pseudonym to protect his identity.

PARIS/BRUSSELS/VIENNA - France and Germany are to take joint responsibility for an EU-Iran trade mechanism to minimise the risk of US punishment but few now believe it will cover oil sales, heightening fears for the fate of the landmark international nuclear deal with Iran. Diplomats said the French-German gambit is a "safety-in-numbers" tactic to overcome the refusal of individual EU states to host the mechanism to sidestep the risk of being targeted by the revived US sanctions regime against Iran. But with US threats of retribution for sanctions-busting unrelenting, they told Reuters that the goals of the nascent trade mechanism could be scaled back to encompass only less sensitive items such as humanitarian and food products. That may well fall short of what Iran's moderates wish for to fend off anti-Western hardliners demanding Tehran ditch the 2015 nuclear deal which they opposed in the first place.

News article:
Iran’s latest ballistic missile test has caused alarm in European capitals. The testing over the weekend of medium-range missiles capable of carrying multiple warheads was not something that even the veteran conciliators in London and Paris could ignore, and it led them to request a closed-door Security Council meeting to discuss the matter. Outside closed doors, the Western allies are full of concern. The U.K. foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he was “deeply concerned by the Iranian test firing. Provocative, threatening and inconsistent with UNSCR 2231. Our support for JCPOA in no way lessens our concern at Iran’s destabilizing missile program and determination that it should cease.” On Monday the French president’s office also called the tests “provocative and destabilizing,” and urged Iran to stop. In the Iranian capital, by contrast, there is no concern at all about the Western reaction. On the contrary, true to the steely diplomatic style it has so effectively displayed over recent years, Tehran was openly assertive of its right to do what it pleased, no matter how much it displeased the West. As the head of the Iranian air force, Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh, said: “One of our most important programs is increasing the range of missiles and ammunition. We don’t see any limitations for ourselves in this field,” he added. Nasirzadeh did not give details on how far Iran would like to increase that range. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif argued that Iran had violated nothing, that the U.N. Security Council resolution which endorsed the nuclear agreement did not ban Tehran from developing its missiles. If one accepts Iran’s narrow interpretation of the resolution, he may have a case. The language of the U.N. resolution “calls on” rather than “forbids” Iran from testing its missiles, according to Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council. The diplomats from Iran and Europe certainly knew what they were doing when they agreed on such language. The purpose of the ambiguity was, it would seem, to enable the West to at least appear to be taking a tough line with Tehran to put a stop to their missile program, while, as all knew perfectly well, it did not bind the Iranians to show any restraint, except of the voluntary kind. As the Islamic Republic is rather short on voluntary restraint when it comes to military matters, they feel no compunctions about the testing, no reason to apologize and no reason even to talk about stopping. This was, of course, to be expected by anyone who has followed Iranian foreign policy, and the Europeans (and their American allies at the time) have only themselves to blame. The Trump administration has been prodding its allies for almost two years to join in revising or scrapping the Iran nuclear accord, imposing new sanctions and demanding that Tehran desist from expanding its missile capabilities, as well as its terror activities. It has been scorned all during that time for taking unilateral actions that risk all the hard-won gains of the nuclear accord and the U.N. resolution supposedly reining in Iran’s nuclear and missile programs. At the same time, European business concerns have eagerly sought to renew contacts with the Iranian regime and return to business as usual. The Trump administration, by withdrawing from the accord and imposing the sanctions, has made diplomatic and business life very uncomfortable for them indeed. Despite the European reaction to the Iranian missile test, they have hardly come over to the American way of seeing things. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that “this test violates U.N. Security Council resolution 2231 that bans Iran from undertaking ‘any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology’.” Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative on Iran, went further and criticized the European allies, saying that since leaving the deal, U.S. officials had found “freedom and leverage” to tackle Iran’s regional influence, and he said that other nations should get on board. “The current international environment has created unacceptably low expectations for the regime in Tehran,” he said. “[If] the demands of … the Iranian regime seem too many, it is because Iran’s malign activities are too numerous.” “Iran’s recent ballistic missile test was dangerous and concerning, but not surprising,” U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in a statement. “The international community cannot keep turning a blind eye every time Iran blatantly ignores Security Council resolutions.” All of this is still too much for the Europeans, who are not going so far as to say the test was an outright violation of the U.N. resolution, but merely inconsistent with it. Whether Iran has violated the words of U.N. Security Council resolutions or only the spirit of them, it is clear that the Islamic Republic is once again doing everything it thinks it can get away with in its fanatic quest for domination of the Middle East and beyond by any means, including conventional and unconventional weapons. Even if Britain and France succeed in getting the Security Council to condemn the missile test, what will that accomplish? It will not deter Iran from its missile program for a single moment. The regime will continue to thumb its nose at the West, pointing to the language of the resolution, which they understand to allow them to pursue their aims. What is needed from the Europeans is not expressions of concern or even — wow! — a U.N. Security Council condemnation. Such things do not faze the regime in Tehran. The seemingly warm, engaging smiles of their diplomats are, and have always been, smiles of contempt for Western weakness in the face of endless provocations. The time has come for the signers of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to listen to what the United States has been saying and face reality.

As the head of the Iranian air force, Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh, said: “One of our most important programs is increasing the range of missiles and ammunition. We don’t see any limitations for ourselves in this field,” he added. Nasirzadeh did not give details on how far Iran would like to increase that range. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif argued that Iran had violated nothing, that the U.N. Security Council resolution which endorsed the nuclear agreement did not ban Tehran from developing its missiles. If one accepts Iran’s narrow interpretation of the resolution, he may have a case. The language of the U.N. resolution “calls on” rather than “forbids” Iran from testing its missiles, according to Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council. The diplomats from Iran and Europe certainly knew what they were doing when they agreed on such language. The purpose of the ambiguity was, it would seem, to enable the West to at least appear to be taking a tough line with Tehran to put a stop to their missile program, while, as all knew perfectly well, it did not bind the Iranians to show any restraint, except of the voluntary kind. As the Islamic Republic is rather short on voluntary restraint when it comes to military matters, they feel no compunctions about the testing, no reason to apologize and no reason even to talk about stopping. This was, of course, to be expected by anyone who has followed Iranian foreign policy, and the Europeans (and their American allies at the time) have only themselves to blame. The Trump administration has been prodding its allies for almost two years to join in revising or scrapping the Iran nuclear accord, imposing new sanctions and demanding that Tehran desist from expanding its missile capabilities, as well as its terror activities. It has been scorned all during that time for taking unilateral actions that risk all the hard-won gains of the nuclear accord and the U.N. resolution supposedly reining in Iran’s nuclear and missile programs. At the same time, European business concerns have eagerly sought to renew contacts with the Iranian regime and return to business as usual. The Trump administration, by withdrawing from the accord and imposing the sanctions, has made diplomatic and business life very uncomfortable for them indeed. Despite the European reaction to the Iranian missile test, they have hardly come over to the American way of seeing things. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that “this test violates U.N. Security Council resolution 2231 that bans Iran from undertaking ‘any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology’.” Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative on Iran, went further and criticized the European allies, saying that since leaving the deal, U.S. officials had found “freedom and leverage” to tackle Iran’s regional influence, and he said that other nations should get on board. “The current international environment has created unacceptably low expectations for the regime in Tehran,” he said. “[If] the demands of … the Iranian regime seem too many, it is because Iran’s malign activities are too numerous.” “Iran’s recent ballistic missile test was dangerous and concerning, but not surprising,” U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in a statement. “The international community cannot keep turning a blind eye every time Iran blatantly ignores Security Council resolutions.” All of this is still too much for the Europeans, who are not going so far as to say the test was an outright violation of the U.N. resolution, but merely inconsistent with it. Whether Iran has violated the words of U.N. Security Council resolutions or only the spirit of them, it is clear that the Islamic Republic is once again doing everything it thinks it can get away with in its fanatic quest for domination of the Middle East and beyond by any means, including conventional and unconventional weapons. Even if Britain and France succeed in getting the Security Council to condemn the missile test, what will that accomplish? It will not deter Iran from its missile program for a single moment. The regime will continue to thumb its nose at the West, pointing to the language of the resolution, which they understand to allow them to pursue their aims. What is needed from the Europeans is not expressions of concern or even — wow! — a U.N. Security Council condemnation. Such things do not faze the regime in Tehran. The seemingly warm, engaging smiles of their diplomats are, and have always been, smiles of contempt for Western weakness in the face of endless provocations. The time has come for the signers of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to listen to what the United States has been saying and face reality.

News article:
Many EU policymakers are deeply resentful of President Trump’s decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal. This resentment has fueled several shortsighted proposals that will only harm EU businesses and institutions. This approach to Iran, championed by High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Frederica Mogherini, is increasingly discordant with the direction taken by national governments in Europe. Foreign ministers in the Council have said that they will examine imposing sanctions on the Iranian regime, while the Danish government has called for stronger action. Furthermore, the implementation of these misguided schemes has been stifled by unenthusiastic European business leaders, whose consent and cooperation are necessary to put most of the plans into motion. Apparently, European business leaders believe they know what’s best when it comes to matters of European business. For example, despite efforts by EU politicians to keep trade flowing to Tehran, countless European entities – including Renault, Volkswagen, Total, Siemens, and even long-time holdouts like Volvo – have all announced plans to vacate their Iran business and trade relationships. In a more recent example, the Brussels-based financial messaging service SWIFT last month announced it was disconnecting Iranian banks from its system, greatly inhibiting Iran’s ability to do business. Like other European businesses, SWIFT resisted short-sighted demands of EU policymakers and relied on its own judgment and risk evaluation to decide how to proceed. By contrast, EU politicians – led by Mogherini in Brussels and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in Berlin – have pushed myopic schemes that effectively force European entities to engage in Iran activities that they simply do not want. In a speech in late August, Maas proposed that the EU establish payment channels independent of the US, and a European monetary fund, with the express goal of circumventing US sanctions on Iran. Not to be upstaged, Mogherini engineered the passage of a blocking mechanism prohibiting EU companies from complying with US sanctions and a €50 million package, charged to the European taxpayer, to compensate the Iranian regime for lost trade revenue. What Mogherini and Maas refuse to acknowledge is that irrespective of US sanctions, EU business leaders are independently arriving at the conclusion that the challenges and risks of operating in Iran far outweigh any benefit or financial gain. The basic logic underpinning the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the Iran nuclear deal is formally known, was that Iran would receive relief from sanctions in exchange for placing restrictions on its nuclear program. But European entities and taxpayers should not be forced to pay-up to sustain this crumbling construct, especially given that Iran uses the very profits gleaned from European trade and business activity to fund terrorism on European soil. While EU politicians such Mogherini are working hard to increase business links, national governments in Europe are beginning to take a stand. On Monday 19 November, foreign ministers in the Council agreed to examine possible sanctions on the regime in response to the overt aggression displayed in Denmark and France. Mogherini’s own plan to circumvent US sanctions has also run into roadblocks in the form of EU member state governments. The success of her blocking mechanism depends on a European country being willing to host the vehicle delivering it. This, however, has proved impossible so far: no country has accepted Mogherini’s albatross, presumably because they know just how negatively it will impact their relationship with the US. This fact, combined with the onset of re-imposed US sanctions and Iran’s record of support for terrorism in Europe and worldwide, should compel remaining European businesses to leave Iran. There is no justification for Europeans to provide goods or services that help the Iranian regime fund terror attacks in Europe. A clear-eyed evaluation should lead any responsible actor to steer clear of Iran – the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and the bankroller of slaughter and misery in Syria. European political resentment over the failure of the JCPOA will eventually fade – but the costs and the stigma for businesses and commercial entities working with the brutal Iranian regime may not.

Official hails growing trend in Iran’s exports to Iraq Tasnim – The secretary general of Iran-Iraq joint chamber of commerce highlighted an upward trend in the export of Iranian products to Iraq. In a meeting with Iranian and Iraqi trade delegations, Hamid Hosseini pointed to a growing trend in Iran’s exports to the Arab country, saying its daily value stands at $45 million and sometimes reaches $70 million. Noting that most of the oil and gas projects in Iraq are undertaken by European and Chinese contractors, he deplored that although Iranian companies have won the bidding to carry out such projects in Iraq, a series of problems have prevented them from starting the job in the Arab country. He was referring to the US sanctions on Iran and Washington’s pressures on Baghdad to stop doing business with Tehran. Iraq’s new Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Alhakim has made it clear that his country cannot cut off trade ties with Iran under the US sanctions, saying the value of annual trade between Iran and Iraq amount to $12 billion.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Dec. 16 By Elnur Baghishov – Trend: Iran exports goods worth about $45 million a day and sometimes up to $70 million to Iraq, Hamid Hosseini, secretary-general of the Iran-Iraqi Chamber of Commerce, said. Iraqi companies were invited to work in oil and gas fields as contractors, Trend reports referring to Tasnim News Agency. Iranian companies are participating in tenders on behalf of Iraqi companies and this way participate in Iraq’s oil, gas and engineering projects, Hosseini added. The Iraqi companies do not have the necessary potential to implement those projects, he said. Iranian companies can join Iraqi projects through cooperation with them, Hosseini said. Presently, European and Chinese companies have most of oil and gas projects in Iraq, he said. Though Iranian companies won the tender, they were unable to operate in this country, Hosseini said. The agreements must be signed between the two countries in the field of export of agricultural products, Hosseini added. Iraqi officials would like these agreements to be signed, he said. But Iranian officials say that Iraqi officials have been invited to Iran, but they have not come, Hosseini said. It is necessary to pay attention to this issue. Iran wants to export its products, so it should take the first step, he added.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Dec. 30 By Elnur Baghishov – Trend: The products $2.222 billion were exported to Afghanistan during eight months of this Iranian year (started on March 21, 2018) compared to the same period of last Iranian year, Mohammad Mehdi Javanmard Qasab, head of Trade Promotion Organization of Iran's Afghanistan Desk, said. This figure increased by 26 percent in terms of value compared to the same period of last Iranian year, Qasab added, Trend reports referring to ILNA. During the reporting period, the goods worth $7.6 million were imported, which is 44 percent less compared to the same period of last Iranian year. Iran mainly imports sesame, agricultural products and marble from Afghanistan, he added. The export of Iranian goods to Afghanistan increased as a result of the activity of the representatives of the Iranian Trade and Development Organization, as well as the Iranian trade attachés in Afghanistan, he said. This growth has accelerated since 2011. Over the last few years, Afghan businessmen have been investing in Iran’s various economic sectors, namely, carpet weaving, food industry and hotel industry, Qasab said.

News article:
Iran crude vital for sustaining balance in oil trade MNA – Iranian crude in the global market is extremely important for sustaining a balance in oil trade, says Sanjiv Singh, chairman of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. India is one of the largest consumers of crude oil and since Iran has been one of the key suppliers, the country hopes the US will extend sanctions waiver, Singh said, Hindu Business Line reported. On November 5, the US announced exempting eight countries, including India, from the sanctions for importing oil from Iran. This exemption is for six months and Washington will review the 180-day waiver it gave to India and seven others after April 2019. Asked about what IndianOil’s strategy will be once the six-month period is over, Singh told BusinessLine “Let us see, we have six months.” On the impact of sanctions on oil supply in the market, an Indian oil trader said on the condition of anonymity that even before the waiver was given, the market had already factored in a shortfall from Iran. “So, the market was prepared. In fact, India has played its card very well — while it has not buckled under the US sanctions, it has continued to get reasonable supply from Iran.” By continuing to buy from Iran, India has also been able to sustain a balance in the market, the trader said. Meanwhile, senior officials in the government said India is likely to continue purchasing oil from Iran in 2019, although at lower levels than the previous year, and were hopeful that it will not lead to acrimony with the US. New Delhi is expecting a positive result when the US reviews the waiver, according to government officials. India and Iran, however, have yet to resolve the way in which payments have to made for oil. New Delhi is keen that the rupee payment mechanism, used to partly pay for oil from Iran last time there were sanctions against the country, will be used this time as well. But alternative mechanisms, in which payments are made through currencies other than dollar, are also being examined.

News article:
India has reportedly handed Iran a tax break worth hundreds of millions of dollars, effectively green-lighting a crude oil import deal that had thus far been hindered by sweeping US sanctions. India, one of among eight countries exempted from those sanctions for six months, has moved to pay for the oil in its currency, rupee, since the main banking channels dealing with global currencies are blocked by Washington’s measures. The $1.5 billion crude oil deal was signed on November 2 between India’s finance ministry and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), Reuters reported Monday, citing a government order. Such a payment to a foreign company operating in India would have normally been subject to a tax of 42.5 percent, or $637.5 million — a deal-breaker for the Iranians — according to the report. The exemption from that tax was signed by the Indian finance ministry on Friday and is backdated to November 5, the report said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The payment to NIOC will be in rupees — a currency that can’t be freely traded internationally — and will be used by Tehran to pay for imports from India, invest in Indian businesses and pay expenses of Iranian missions and students in India. “In the previous round of sanctions Iran was allowed to use funds for imports from India but this time we have expanded the scope for use of funds to benefit both nations,” an unnamed Indian government official was quoted by Reuters as saying. In November, US President Donald Trump’s administration reinstated all of Washington’s sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. Advertisement The sanctions were the second batch that the Trump administration has reimposed on the Islamic Republic since it withdrew from the nuclear agreement last year. The rollback ended US participation in the Obama-era accord, which now hangs in the balance as Iran no longer enjoys the billions of dollars in sanctions relief it was granted under the deal in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Iran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its rial currency has plummeted and oil exports have steeply fallen, though India and China have continued to purchase it. Most Europeans, as well as Japan and South Korea, have stopped. Agencies contributed to this report

News article:
NEW DELHI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - State-run Bharat Petroleum Corp will import 1 million barrels of Iranian oil in February after a gap of three months, with the nation’s overall purchases from Tehran remaining at 9 million barrels, three industry sources said. The United States in early November granted India a six-month waiver from sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. Under the agreement, New Delhi must restrict its Iranian oil purchases to 1.25 million tonnes, or 9 million barrels. BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corp will lift 1 million barrels each of Iranian crude oil in February, the sources said. HPCL this month resumed purchases of Iranian oil after a gap of six months. The company halted Iranian oil purchases in July after its insurance company refused to provide cover for the crude because of U.S. sanctions, although its chairman said HPCL may resume buying Iranian oil under sanctions waivers. Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, will lift 5 million barrels of Iranian oil in February, the same as this month. Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd will buy 2 million barrels compared with 3 million barrels this month, the sources said. An IOC official had previously said his firm would lift 180,000 bpd - the full volume contracted under an annual deal with Iran for this fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. India recently exempted rupee payments to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for crude oil imports from a steep withholding tax, paving way for pending dues to be cleared. HPCL, IOC and BPCL did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while MRPL declined comment. (Reporting by Nidhi Verma, editing by David Evans)

FILE PHOTO: A gas flare on an oil production platform in the Soroush oil fields is seen alongside an Iranian flag in the Persian Gulf, Iran, July 25, 2005. REUTERS/Raheb Homavandi/File Photo LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey has resumed imports of Iranian crude oil after a one-month hiatus in November when U.S. sanctions on Iran were reimposed, trading and shipping sources said. The United States granted Turkey and other countries import waivers in early November. Turkey said it was permitted to take 3 million tonnes a year, equivalent to about 60,000 barrels per day (bpd), under the waiver. Turkey used to import about 200,000 bpd of Iranian crude before Washington announced last year that it would pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions. Turkey had reduced its imports from Iran in the months prior to sanctions coming into force in early November. Its imports fell to zero in November. But in December Turkey took delivery of two tankers carrying Iranian crude, equivalent to about 54,000 bpd during December, according to a shipping and trading source familiar with the matter. The Solan tanker delivered into the port of Aliaga, while the Sea Topaz I discharged at Tutunciftlik. So far in January, Turkey is set to receive a cargo from the Iranian-owned tanker Sinopa, the sources and Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking showed. Turkish officials and Tupras were not immediately available to comment.

Iranian scholar: US had no way but to exempt Chabahar from sanctions IRNA – The fact that the US has exempted Iran’s port of Chabahar from the sanctions imposed against Iran indicates the significance of the port, its global impact and its benefits to the US, Netherlands Leiden University instructor said in Tehran on Wednesday. At a workshop regarding the Iranian southern port city of Chabahar and regional cooperation hosted by the Faculty of Law and Political Science at the University of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Foroukh said Chabahar is Iran’s only oceanic port where giant ships can dock. In Iran’s foreign policy the focus is on political and security issues while geographic and economic capabilities of the country should also be taken into account, he went on to say. ‘The advances made by China and India, and the position Iran enjoys as the world’s crossroads has resulted in these countries and in particular India’s interest in Iran’s Chabahar port,’ he added. The Leiden University instructor said as a super power, the US is on the decline and China is emerging as a key power, adding regional countries such as Iran and Turkey cannot be ignored. Foroukh said internationalization requires transit routes and if Iran wants to become active internationally, it should pay more attention to the issue and Chabahar as Iran’s only oceanic port has considerable importance in this regard.

India begins settling Iran oil debt after US sanctions Iran Press TV Wed Jan 9, 2019 11:36AM Indian refiners have begun clearing their oil debt to Iran under a new payment mechanism which they put in place after the US reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic. The development comes after the Indian government intervened recently to exempt some $1.5 billion of Iranian oil money held at state-owned UCO Bank from withholding taxes. It also coincided with a visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to New Delhi where he said Tehran was working with its traditional partners such as China, Russia and India to circumvent the US sanctions. UCO Bank "received a good amount from some oil companies" which have pending payments to Iran, its executive director Charan Singh told Reuters. India is Iran's second biggest oil customer after China. Oil accounted for about 90 percent of Indian imports from Iran, which totaled about $11 billion between April and November. "Iran has been and will be a reliable source of oil supply to India," Zarif said on Monday as he arrived in New Delhi to take part in an annual research forum attended by economists and entrepreneurs. India was among the eight countries which got US waivers late last year to continue crude oil imports from Iran for six months. On Tuesday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for economic diplomacy Gholamreza Ansari called on India to try to get another waiver from US sanctions. Indian refiners have said they want to continue buying Iranian oil for which they are accorded free shipping and an extended credit period. They also pay Iran all in rupees under a new transaction mechanism which Tehran has worked out with its trade partners in the face of dawdling by the EU to put a much-hyped special purpose vehicle into operation. Trading partners such as India, Russia, China and Turkey have agreed to use national currencies in transactions with Iran. India settled 45 percent of oil payments in rupees and the remainder in euros in the previous round of sanctions but this time it has been allowed to make all payments in rupees. Iran will use the money to import Indian goods and pay its diplomatic staff based in that country. Indian Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday his country can provide steel rails and locomotive engines to Iran, and receive urea in return. He also said India had agreed to allow Iran's Bank Pasargad to open a branch in Mumbai within the next three months to process mutual transactions. "We are very happy that both UCO Bank of India and Pasargad Bank of Iran are getting started with the business," said Zarif who has taken along a big business delegation on the three-day visit. Meanwhile, Ansari said Indian companies still have a chance to get development rights for Iran's Farzad B gas field and that Tehran could ease some terms associated with the project.

Tehran, Iran, Jan.12 Trend: Iran's deputy foreign minister for economic diplomacy predicted that Iran's oil export exemption by US would be extended. "My assessment is that the request of all countries that have received exemptions will certainly not be rejected in the second time," Iran's deputy foreign minister for economic diplomacy Gholamreza Ansari said, Trend reports citing Donyaye Eghtesad newspaper. Washington gave a six-month waiver to eight countries, including India, allowing them to import Iranian oil. Ansari highlighted the agreements between Tehran and New Delhi in the three fields, including oil, money and banking, and the Chabahar port, noting that Iran and India are two complementary economies. “One of the issues to be clarified between Iran and India is the banking issue,” he said. “A few weeks ago, an agreement was signed between the Central Bank of Iran and the Ministry of Finance of India, which is an instruction for how to use Iran's funds in India.” The deputy minister said that this agreement allows Iran to use its resources in India in very diverse areas, including in the fields of investment, securities and stocks in India, which is among the most trusted stocks in the world. Ansari went on to mention two very serious and good programs between the two countries. “First, follow-up program will be set up between the central banks of the two countries; and the second is the establishment of Pasargad bank`s branch in India,” he added. The branch of Pasargad bank will open within next two months (close to New Iranian Year on March 21). “On the other hand, the Indians have again introduced the UCO Bank, which has had good experience in cooperation with Iran in the past. Other banks could be added to the portfolio, in order to meet the volume of trade between the two countries,” said Ansari. On December 19, some Indian sources announced that India will deposit payments for crude oil imported from Iran into escrow accounts of five of their banks held with state-run UCO Bank Ltd. after the two nations agreed on a payment mechanism to overcome U.S. sanctions. “Iran considers to spend 50 percent of its oil revenues to purchase Indian products or products available in India,” said Ansari. “For the other 50 percent, Indians have declared that they will transfer money through any banking system which Iran introduces.”

S. Korea to restart oil imports from Iran in Jan-Feb IRNA – South Korean oil buyers are expected to restart oil imports from Iran in late January or early February, the head of South Korea’s SK Innovation, which owns South Korea’s biggest oil refiner SK Energy, said on Wednesday, Reuters reported. In November, South Korea won a six-month waiver from sanctions, imposed by the United States, allowing to purchase a limited amount of Iranian oil. “As South Korea received a waiver and has been in talks with Iran about the first import volume, it seems (Iran oil) could be brought in late in January or early February at the earliest,” SK Innovation Chief Executive Officer and President Kim Jun told Reuters on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. South Korean and Japanese buyers were expected to restart Iranian oil imports early this year, industry sources said in November. South Korea can buy up to 200,000 barrels per day of Iran oil, mostly condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil under the waiver, the sources said. South Korea was the third-biggest buyer of Iranian oil and the largest importer of Iranian condensate before the US sanctions were reimposed in November. Kim also said that SK Innovation, a supplier of electric vehicle (EV) batteries to Daimler and Volkswagen, may increase the investment into its US-based EV battery manufacturing business to $5 billion to secure more of the market.

Korea to restart oil imports from Iran in Jan-Feb IRNA – South Korean oil buyers are expected to restart oil imports from Iran in late January or early February, the head of South Korea’s SK Innovation, which owns South Korea’s biggest oil refiner SK Energy, said on Wednesday, Reuters reported. In November, South Korea won a six-month waiver from sanctions, imposed by the United States, allowing to purchase a limited amount of Iranian oil. “As South Korea received a waiver and has been in talks with Iran about the first import volume, it seems (Iran oil) could be brought in late in January or early February at the earliest,” SK Innovation Chief Executive Officer and President Kim Jun told Reuters on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. South Korean and Japanese buyers were expected to restart Iranian oil imports early this year, industry sources said in November. South Korea can buy up to 200,000 barrels per day of Iran oil, mostly condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil under the waiver, the sources said. South Korea was the third-biggest buyer of Iranian oil and the largest importer of Iranian condensate before the US sanctions were reimposed in November. Kim also said that SK Innovation, a supplier of electric vehicle (EV) batteries to Daimler and Volkswagen, may increase the investment into its US-based EV battery manufacturing business to $5 billion to secure more of the market.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean oil buyer is set to receive about 2 million barrels of Iranian condensate in January, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. The cargo marks the first Iranian oil import by South Korea in four months after the world’s fifth-largest oil buyer halted imports before the U.S. reimposed sanctions on Iran in November. The first cargo of about 960,000 barrels of condensate, a type of light crude oil typically produced in association with natural gas, is expected to arrive this week at the port of Incheon, said the source, who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. The Silvia 1, a vessel carrying 955,000 barrels of Iranian oil, is set to arrive in South Korea on Jan. 15, trade flow data from Refinitv Eikon showed. A second cargo of 990,000 barrels will arrive later this month, the source said. In November, South Korea won a temporary waiver from the United States to purchase a limited amount of Iranian oil. The U.S. reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil sector in November to pressure the country to end its nuclear programme and to curtail its support for Syria and militants in Yemen. South Korea can buy up to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil under the sanctions waiver, mainly condensate, according to industry sources. South Korean oil buyers were expected to restart oil purchases from Iran in late January or early February, the head of SK Innovation, owner of South Korea’s top refiner SK Energy, told Reuters last week. South Korean buyers of Iranian crude and condensate include SK Energy and SK Incheon Petrochemical, owned by SK Innovation, Hyundai Oilbank Corp [INPTVH.UL] and Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co [SMCHE.UL].

Japan banks set to resume Iran oil transactions after regulatory clearance MNA – Major Japanese banks are set to resume Iranian oil transactions after receiving final regulatory clearance, paving the way for the country’s refiners to begin loadings as early as this month, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told S&P Global Platts Tuesday. The Japanese banks will be able to issue letters of credit for relevant deals after the clearance from the Japanese and US regulatory authorities, one of the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said. These banks are expected to accept payment by Japanese refiners for importing Iranian barrels mainly in yen, the source added. One of the Japanese banks declined to comment Tuesday. Japanese refiners and shipping companies have recently clarified their concerns over relevant shipping insurance. Japan’s JXTG Holdings intends to resume loading oil from Iran at the end of January, while Cosmo Oil aims to load around 1.8 million barrels of Iranian crude at the end of this month upon final clearances, the presidents of the companies told S&P Global Platts on January 7. Japan was among eight countries to receive a 180-day waiver from the US sanctions. The waiver expires in early May, when the country will be expected to cut purchases significantly.

News article:
India to share Iran oil with state refiners MNA – India will not share the limited supply of Iranian crude allowed under a US waiver from sanctions with private refiners, according to the sources. The government has asked its four state refiners led by Indian Oil Corp. to share the entire 9 millions barrels of Iranian oil available every month under a 180-day waiver from US sanctions, the people said, asking not to be identified. Private refiner Essar Oil, now rechristened Nayara Energy after it was acquired by Rosneft PJSC and partners, was allowed to buy about half of the Iran volumes when a similar curbs were imposed in 2012. Indian refiners — state-run or private — scramble for Iranian crude because it is less expensive and offers a longer credit cycle, apart from savings in freight cost. Iranian shipments to India jumped 2.5 times in about a year after the economic curbs on the Persian Gulf nation were lifted under a 2015 accord. Reserving Iranian crude for state-run refiners will deprive the private processors of these benefits, forcing them to look for costlier alternatives. An Indian oil ministry spokesman couldn’t immediately comment. Private refiners such as billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. have greater agility to source and process cheaper crude than the state-run refiners and should not be allowed to eat into the Iranian barrels, especially when there isn’t scarcity of supply in the global oil market, said an oil ministry official. Reliance and Nayara Energy together imported close to a third of India’s total oil imports from Iran last year, according to shipping data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s despite both halting Iranian purchases months before US restrictions against oil dealings with Iran went back into effect in early November. India plans to continue with this strategy to protect Iran oil supplies only for its state-run refiners if waivers are extended beyond April, as it continues talking to the Trump administration for the rollover, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

LONDON: Japan has started the process of importing Iranian oil, which was suspended due to U.S. sanctions, the governor of Iran's central bank said on Monday. The resumption of oil imports comes after Tokyo was granted a waiver from U.S. sanctions that went into effect in November. Iran is the fourth-largest oil producer among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. "After China, South Korea, India and Turkey, Japan also started the process of importing Iranian oil," Abdolnaser Hemmati was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. Iran's oil exports have fallen sharply since U.S. President Donald Trump said in May 2018 the United States would withdraw from a pact curtailing Iran's disputed nuclear programme and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. However, exemptions have been granted to Iran's biggest oil clients - Japan, China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Italy, Greece and Turkey - which allow them to import some oil for another 180 days. Iranian oil accounted for 5.3 percent of Japan's total crude imports in 2018.

Japan says it will continue oil purchase from Iran IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Jan 21, IRNA -- Japanese refiner Fuji Oil was loaded with Iranian crude oil in the first cargo to head for the East Asian country since Tokyo received a waiver from the US sanctions on Tehran. Japan says it will continue purchasing Iranian oil as the crude 'plays an important role in the country's long-term plans'. 'We've had hard and complex negotiations with the US to buy oil from the Islamic Republic and finally the Japanese oil tanker berthed at Iran's ports,' Japanese Ambassador to Iran Mitsugu Saito was cited as saying by Iran's parliament website (ICANA). 'Japan will continue buying Iranian oil as it has an important role in our long-term plans,' added the Japanese envoy following a meeting with the Iranian lawmaker Kazem Jalali. Soito stressed that some Japanese companies are still in cooperation with the 'Islamic Republic' although some western countries abandoned Iran following restored unilateral US sanctions. Japanese and Iranian diplomatic relations date back to 90 years ago. 'We hope our bilateral cooperation would increase,' said the Japanese official. For his part, Jalali, who is head of the Parliament's Research Center, expressed the hope that long-standing ties between the two countries would lead to an increase in their economic cooperation. The Iranian parliamentarian said the US unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 international treaty with Iran on its nuclear programme, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), will harm all countries.

Japan's Iran oil loading to continue through March ISNA - Iranian Students' News Agency Sat / 26 January 2019 / 14:01 Tehran (ISNA) - Japanese refiners will continue to lift oil from Iran through March after receiving a waiver from U.S. sanctions on crude imports in November, Takashi Tsukioka, president of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ) said. Japan resumed oil liftings from Iran this month after refiners Fuji Oil Co Ltd and Showa Shell Sekiyu KK loaded cargoes onto a tanker that is expected to arrive in Japan on Feb. 9, according to Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide. Japan's oil refining industry will continue to ask its government to seek an extension of the U.S. sanctions waivers after the initial 180-day exemption is over in May, he said Japanese refiners will likely be able to secure alternative supplies from other Middle Eastern countries, he added. Japan's Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd plans to buy the remainder of its contractual volumes of Iranian oil between February and March, said Tsukioka, who also serves as Idemitsu's chairman. Idemitsu is likely to renew its term contracts for Iranian oil although details have not been decided, he said. End Item NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Kabul: The Taliban discussed Afghanistan´s "post-occupation situation" with Iran in their latest meeting, the group said Tuesday, as Tehran makes a more concerted and open push for peace ahead of a possible US drawdown. The remarks come after Iran confirmed Monday that the Taliban had visited Tehran for a second round of talks in just a few days that are aimed at ending the 17-year conflict. The Taliban delegation discussed with Iran "the post-occupation situation, restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region", the militants said in a statement posted on social media and emailed to journalists. It signals a growing confidence among the Taliban for US troops to pull out of Afghanistan, after US officials last month told various media outlets that President Donald Trump had decided to slash the number of boots on the ground. There have been reports in the past of talks between Iran and the Taliban, but they have typically been denied by Tehran. Tehran´s peace push will be viewed with concern by hawks in Washington, who fear that Trump´s planned withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan will cede regional influence to Iran. The Taliban also met with the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in the United Arab Emirates earlier in December as part of a flurry of diplomatic efforts to end the war. But the Taliban refused to meet a delegation from Afghanistan. The group said Saturday its representatives would not meet "with those of the Kabul administration" at the next meeting expected to be held in Saudi Arabia later this month. Iran´s deputy foreign ministry Abbas Araghchi will travel to Afghanistan in the next two weeks, the foreign ministry said, without giving further details. Iran and Afghanistan share a nearly 600-mile (960-kilometre) border, and have had a complex relationship in recent years.

News article:
Members of the Taliban stand at the site of the execution of three men in Ghazni province, Afghanistan, April 18, 2015. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo Kabul – Jamal Ismail The Afghan Taliban confirmed sending a delegation to Tehran in order to discuss the future withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the question of regional security and stability. “The delegation visited Tehran to share Taliban’s views on ‘post-occupation’ scenario and establishment of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region with Iranian officials,” Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for Taliban, said in a statement that reflected a growing confidence among the Taliban for a soon US exit from Afghanistan. This is the second Taliban delegation to visit Iran after a round of Afghan peace talks were held in the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, some two weeks ago. Mujahid didn't give away any details concerning Taliban members who visited Tehran and met with Iranian officials. Taliban delegations publicly admitting to having visited Iran is an indicator for warming relations between the ultra-conservative Afghan movement and the Tehran cleric-led regime. Before, Iran would actively deny hosting any delegation linked to the group. Iran’s shift in policy came a few days after US President Donald Trump announced plans to pull out troops from Afghanistan. Tehran, threatened by an American presence in neighboring Afghanistan, a country with which it shares a land border stretching some 960 km, has actively resorted to supporting and arming the Taliban. Washington has long accused Tehran of supplying the armed group with anti-tank mines and tanks in order to target US forces in Afghanistan. On another note, General Scott Miller, who commands US forces and the NATO-led non-combat Resolution Support (RS) mission in Afghanistan, reiterated the need for a political settlement to end the conflict. “Peace talks [are] out there, regional players pressing for peace, the Taliban talking about peace, the Afghan government is talking about peace,” Miller told dozens of NATO soldiers who had gathered at RS headquarters in Kabul. “As long as the Taliban want to fight we are going to fight,” said Colonel David Butler, spokesman for US Forces in Afghanistan. He added that 2019 would bring a unique opportunity for peace in the country that has been at war on and off for almost 40 years, since US-backed Afghan guerrillas fought to repel Soviet Union forces in the late 1970s.

It is a measure of the go-strategic importance of Afghanistan that after US president Donald Trump announced last month his intention to withdraw half of American troops—7,000 out of 14,000 — from Afghanistan, there has been a flurry of activity around the issue of restoring peace in war-ravaged Afghanistan.Regional countries — Iran, Pakistan and Russia — are actively trying to bring an end to the 17-year-long conflict. In December, US special representative on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad met Taliban representatives and discussed issues pertaining to future troop withdrawal as well as proposal for a ceasefire. On Dec 31, Iran said the Afghan Taliban had visited Tehran for a second round of peace talks in just a few days. A spokesman for the Iranian government said on Dec 30 a delegation of the Taliban held lengthy negotiations with Iran’s deputy foreign minister in Tehran. This came just days after Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, visited Kabul and told reporters that talks had been held with the Taliban in Kabul.Peace in Afghanistan will benefit all neighbouring countrires, most important of all Pakistan where 2.7 million Afghan refugees (the figure is Prime Minister Imran Khan’s) are still living. Peace in Afghanistan will facilitate return of these refugees to their homeland thereby easing Pakistan’s difficult economic situation. Some quarters in the US, however, are apprehensive that the vaccum created by the US military withdrawal from Aghanistan and Syria might help Iran expand its influence in the region. The proposed US troop withdrawal and the possibility of formation of a government in Afghanistan led by the Taliban have rang alarm bells in New Delhi as it sees this scenario a major threat to its influence in Afghanistan.

By RFE RL (RFE/RL) — Iran says a Taliban delegation has made a rare visit to Tehran for talks with a senior Iranian official on efforts to end Afghanistan’s 17-year-long war. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on December 31 that the Taliban delegation arrived on December 30 and met with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. Qassemi said talks focused on “security issues aimed at driving the peace process in Afghanistan.” He said Kabul was informed about the meeting. It was not the first such meeting between the Taliban and Iranian officials. Ali Shamkhani of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council confirmed last week in Kabul that such talks have taken place in the past and would continue. The Taliban have recently held talks in several regional countries amid Washington’s plans to withdraw up to half the 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

News article:
Deputy FM: Iran not to forget Taliban’s past crimes FNA – Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araqchi stressed that despite playing a mediatory role in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, Tehran can never forget the killing of its diplomats by the group in Mazar-i Sharif in 1998. Araqchi wrote on his twitter page on Sunday that during his current trip to Afghanistan to meet and confer with high-ranking Afghan officials to discuss the recent visit by a Taliban delegation to Tehran to hold talks and help the peace process in the war-torn country, he has also made a visit to Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i Sharif where the Iranian diplomats were martyred by the Taliban in 1998. He underlined that Iran feels a heavy responsibility on its shoulder with regard to the blood of its martyrs, and added, “We look to the future but will never forget the past.” The 1998 killing of the Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan refers to the siege of the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e Sharif, Afghanistan, during the Taliban and Northern Alliance battles of Mazar-e Sharif. Initially the death of 8 Iranian diplomats was reported, but later two other diplomats and a journalist were also confirmed dead. On August 8, 1998 Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif. After this incident, 11 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent from Iran’s state news agency (IRNA) were attacked at the Iranian consulate and subsequently disappeared. Unofficial reports from the city indicated that all these men were killed. Later it was confirmed that 8 of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA correspondent were killed by the Taliban militia attacking the consulate. The Taliban spokesmen said the Iranians had been killed by renegade forces who had acted without orders. It was also reported that some of the personnel of the consulate were taken hostage by the Taliban, but they were later released. During his visit to Kabul, Araqchi announced on Saturday that his country was committed to the continued peace process in Afghanistan with the country’s government taking the lead. Araqchi made the remarks in a meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul on Saturday. He also presented a report on the recent meeting between the Iranian officials and the Taliban in Tehran. During the meeting, the two sides underlined the importance of developing all-out ties between the two countries, emphasizing Tehran and Kabul’s full coordination in all aspects to attain better results. Last Monday, Iran confirmed talks with the Taliban to help the peace process, but meantime, stressed that negotiations with the Afghan group did not mean shared views or stances. “A delegation from the Taliban was in Tehran yesterday and extensive talks were held at the foreign ministry with Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs (Seyed Abbas) Araqchi,” Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi told reporters in Tehran on Monday. “The main goal of the negotiations is finding a solution and grounds to facilitate assistance to the talks between the Afghan groups and the government of this country to help the peace process in Afghanistan,” he added. Qassemi underlined that talks with the Taliban “do not necessarily mean that Iran’s positions are similar to those of the group”, and expressed the hope that negotiations could yield results for the Afghan nation and establish security and stability in the country. He also emphasized that the Afghan government was informed of Iran’s talks with the Taliban, and added, “We are not the only country which has held talks with the Taliban and many other states also have interactions with them.” His remarks came as the Pentagon acknowledged in December Iran’s key role in restoring peace and stability to war-torn Afghanistan, backtracking on Washington’s earlier claims that Tehran supports the local Taliban militant group. “Iran seeks a stable Afghan government that is responsive to Iranian goals, the elimination of ISIS-K, the removal of the US/NATO presence, and the protection of Iranian concerns, such as water rights and border security,” the US Department of Defense said in a report sent to Congress. The Pentagon also admitted Iran’s influence in Afghanistan, saying that Tehran pursues “a multitrack strategy” of engaging with the Afghan government and seeks to boost bilateral economic ties with Kabul.

News Event Perspective: This image provides a visual representation of the Taliban's treatment of women in Afghanistan. The women are wearing burqas, which are full-body coverings that only leave a small opening for the eyes. This is a symbol of the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law, which requires women to cover their faces and bodies in public.

The second round of Afghan peace talks will soon be held in Saudi Arabia. Pakistan is instrumental in brokering these talks seeking a political solution to the Afghan war. The first round was hosted by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The fact that another round is now scheduled in Jeddah shows there was forward movement in parleys at Abu Dhabi.Saudi Arabia, which has remained at the periphery as far as the Afghan peace process is concerned, has now assumed the centre stage, something that is seen with suspicion by countries such as Iran, Russia, Qatar and even Turkey. Their suspicion stems from fears that the Afghan peace deal negotiated by Saudi Arabia may advance the US interest in the region at the expense of other countries.That is why Iran has also opened the channel of communications with the Taliban. In fact, Tehran has been talking to the Taliban for months but only acknowledged it publicly now in a calculated move to send a message that Saudi Arabia is not the only player in Afghanistan.Pakistan is mindful of the competing interests of these regional countries in Afghanistan. That was the reason that soon after the Abu Dhabi talks, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi rushed to Iran, Russia, Qatar and China. The purpose was to assure Tehran, Moscow, Doha and Beijing that there was no shift in Pakistan’s approach on Afghanistan.For many years Islamabad has been pushing for a regional consensus on Afghanistan. Interestingly, many officials privately admit that Pakistan has more convergence with Russia, Iran and China on Afghanistan than with the US. Pakistan, like Russia, Iran and China, is also skeptical of the ultimate objective of the US in Afghanistan. Washington has its own list of grievances often accusing Islamabad of double play. That has been the primary reason that both countries despite being ostensible allies have failed to find a common ground on Afghanistan. But the scenario has changed after Saudi Arabia got involved in peace efforts pushing Pakistan away from the regional approach.Yet, Islamabad is still striving for taking key regional stakeholders on board for any political solution on Afghanistan. It is, however, facing a tricky situation because of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Both these countries have extended financial assistance to the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan at a time when Pakistan was in real danger of getting bankrupt. So the PTI government is apparently under compulsion to follow what Saudis have been saying.The latest push for a peace deal may be aimed at giving an ‘honourable exit’ to the US, which has already lost the war, but Tehran and Moscow fear the US through Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Pakistan is pushing the Taliban to accept permanent US bases as part of the final deal. This is where the actual problem lies. Russia, Iran and even China are concerned that permanent presence of the US military in Afghanistan will be destabilising for the region.In this backdrop, Pakistan’s work is really cut out. On the one hand, it has to return the favour to Saudi Arabia and the UAE for their “generous financial support” but at the same time take into account the larger implications of any peace deal that does not have the backing of key regional countries.This means despite renewed optimism, the road to peace is bumpy and fraught with dangers. It is not only the intra-Afghan dialogue which is essential for any political settlement but also players sitting outside Afghanistan have to come on the same page.But who would bring Tehran and Riyadh or Washington and Moscow on the same page given their divergent strategic interests? And don’t forget the Indo-Pak angle in this power play in Afghanistan.Published in The Express Tribune, January 7, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

Members of the US delegation in Kabul approached senior Iranian officials to negotiate an end to the conflict in Afghanistan, Tehran has said. The secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, was cited by the Iran Revolutionary Guard-aligned Tasnim News Agency as saying: “the Americans have asked me twice for negotiations”. The US officials reportedly approached Mr Shamkhani when the senior Iranian official was visiting Kabul in December to increase co-operation between the two governments. According to the Iranians, their delegation members had been negotiating with the Taliban, with the knowledge of the Afghan government. Mr Shamkhani was also quoted as saying the US had failed in its attempts to counter ISIS and restore peace to Afghanistan. The United States has been leading an international coalition of states fighting the Taliban and supporting the Afghan government since it ousted the Taliban in 2001. The National contacted the US State Department, but they did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publishing. It is unclear what the US officials want to negotiate, but Iran has previously been accused of assisting the Taliban. _______________ [ Taliban blames US and Afghan forces for most civilian casualties in 2018 ] [ Iran says they held Taliban talks as Afghan peace push continues ] [ Afghans brace for an even deadlier 2019 as hope for peace fades ] Saudi Arabia to host third round of Taliban peace talks _______________ In October, the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council imposed sanctions on two Iranian Quds Force officers and seven others for providing financial and military support to the group. “Iran’s provision of military training, financing, and weapons to the Taliban is yet another example of Tehran’s blatant regional meddling and support for terrorism," US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the time. In November, the US displayed remnants of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to militants in Afghanistan. Iran denies supplying arms to the Taliban. The US move was designed to pressure Tehran to limit its regional activities. Tensions between Iran and the US spiked last May when President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran and reimposed sanctions lifted under the terms of the pact. Iran has simultaneously claimed it is open to talks, while also rejecting US olive branches, framing each rejection of talks as a rebuke to the re-imposition of sanctions, which are crippling the Iranian economy. The United States has led two rounds of peace talks with the Taliban, with a third due to take place in Riyadh next month. The talks are aimed at achieving a ceasefire and bringing the Afghan government and the Taliban to the same negotiating table. But the Taliban have refused to meet with the Afghan government and said they would only talk with the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The United States might hope to use Tehran to convince the Taliban to meet the internationally recognised Afghan government. Meanwhile, Afghanistan is going through one of its bloodiest periods since the US invasion, with the Taliban launching armed assaults and suicide attacks on civilians and government buildings across the country.

News article:
DUBAI: A close aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday US officials had approached him during a visit he made last month to Afghanistan to request talks with Tehran, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. Tensions between arch foes, Iran and the United States, have increased since last May, when President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers, and then reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic that had been lifted under the terms of the pact. “During my visit to Kabul last month, the Americans... asked to hold talks,” the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, was quoted as saying, without specifying what the US side wanted to discuss. US officials were not immediately available to comment on the report. In 2001, Iran worked with the United States to help set up a new Afghan government to replace the Taliban, which had been toppled by a US-led military campaign following Al-Qaeda’s September 11 attacks on US cities. Shamkhani was in Kabul last month for talks with the Taliban “to help curb the security problems in Afghanistan.” He said the Kabul government had known of his talks with the Taliban. Majority-Shiite Iran has long had close ties to Shiites in neighboring Afghanistan whose militias have fought the Taliban’s Sunni militants. Washington accuses Iran of trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan by providing military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban, a charge Tehran denies. Shamkhani’s comments came days after reports of talks between US and Taliban officials over proposals for a cease-fire in Afghanistan and a future withdrawal of foreign troops ahead of possible peace negotiations. Khamenei slapped down an offer of direct talks made by Trump last year and Iranian officials have said Washington’s crippling sanctions would fail to wreck the economy. In July, Iranian authorities said Tehran had rejected eight US requests for a meeting between Trump and President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in Sept 2017. “America’s fantasy and hostile measures have led nowhere, in spite of all their vengeful efforts toward the Iranian people, and will certainly not in the future,” Iranian state TV quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi as saying on Monday. “Our nation will never yield to the cruel pressures of the United States. We will never bend to those who talk the language of sanctions and build walls instead of bridges.”

News article:
KABUL, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Afghan Taliban representatives and U.S. officials will sit down to two days of peace talks on Wednesday in Qatar but Afghan government officials will not be involved, senior Taliban members said. The Taliban have rejected numerous requests from regional powers to allow Afghan officials to take part in the talks, insisting that the United States is their main adversary in the 17-year war and that Kabul is a "puppet" regime. The insurgents, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops, called off their meeting with the U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia this week because of Riyadh's insistence on bringing the Western-backed Afghan government to the table. The talks will be the fourth in a series between Taliban leaders and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. "After mutual consultations, we are going to meet U.S. officials in Doha on Wednesday. The meeting will continue for two days - Wednesday and Thursday," said a senior member of the Afghan Taliban on condition of anonymity. Pakistani and Iranian officials said they were trying to persuade the Taliban to meet Afghan officials. Another senior Taliban leader confirmed the Qatar meeting and said no other country would be involved. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) took part in the last round of talks in December. "This time we want to hold talks with the American officials," said a Taliban leader based in Afghanistan, adding that they would discuss a U.S. withdrawal, prisoner exchange and the lifting of a ban on movement of their leaders. The war in Afghanistan is America's longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly a trillion dollars and killed tens of thousands of people. The United States, which sent troops to Afghanistan in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troops in the country, withdrew most of its forces in 2014, but still keeps around 14,000 troops there as part of a NATO-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants. Reports last month about U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan triggered uncertainty in Kabul which depends on the United States and other foreign powers for military support and training. The U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Militants reject requests to meet "puppet" Afghan government By Jibran Ahmad PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Afghan Taliban representatives will meet U.S. officials for two days of peace talks starting on Wednesday, but they refuse to meet "puppet" Afghan government officials, senior Taliban members said. The Taliban have rejected requests from regional powers to allow Afghan officials to take part in the talks, insisting that the United States is their main adversary in the 17-year war. "This time we want to hold talks with the American officials," said a Taliban leader based in Afghanistan, adding that the talks in Qatar would involve a U.S. withdrawal, prisoner exchange and the lifting of a ban on movement of Taliban leaders. The insurgents, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops, called off a meeting with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia this week because of Riyadh's insistence on bringing the Western-backed Afghan government to the table. The war in Afghanistan is America's longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly a trillion dollars and killed tens of thousands of people. The talks will be the fourth in a series between Taliban leaders and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. "After mutual consultations, we are going to meet U.S. officials in Doha on Wednesday. The meeting will continue for two days," a senior member of the Taliban said on condition of anonymity. Former Afghan Interior Minister Umer Daudzai, who is senior adviser to President Ashraf Ghani, is due in Pakistan on Tuesday where he is expected to meet Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Pakistani officials say Afghanistan will need foreign economic aid for years, even after any peace agreement has been signed, and have also been trying to push the Taliban to accept talks with Kabul. PAKISTAN COOPERATION A close aide to Ghani said the government was ready to meet the Taliban "anywhere and any time". "Every country involved in Afghanistan expects the Taliban to hold direct talks with the Afghan government, but they have not agreed to meet us," the official said on condition of anonymity. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) took part in the last round of talks in December. Western diplomats based in Kabul said Pakistan's cooperation in the peace process will be crucial to its success. Independent security analysts and diplomats said the neighbouring country's powerful military has kept close ties with the Afghan Taliban. U.S. officials have accused Pakistan of providing safe haven to Taliban militants in its border regions and using them as an arm of its foreign policy. Pakistan denies the claim. Turkey has said it will host leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Last week, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met Ghani in Kabul to discuss the peace process. The meeting was held after Taliban officials met with Iranian authorities in Tehran. The United States, which sent troops to Afghanistan in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troops in the country, withdrew most of its forces in 2014. It keeps around 14,000 troops there as part of a NATO-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants. Reports last month about U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan triggered uncertainty in Kabul which depends on the United States and other foreign powers for military support and training. As peace talks gain momentum a draft agreement drawn up by the influential U.S. think tank RAND Corporation outlining the clauses for a potential peace deal has been circulated among Afghan officials and diplomats in Kabul. The document, reviewed by Reuters, suggests that the United States and NATO withdraw their military missions in phases over an expected period of 18 months. It adds that the United States may continue providing civilian assistance and seek contributions from other donors. The U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan and Zalmay Khalilzad's office in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

London- Asharq Al-Awsat US officials approached Iran’s supreme leader aide during a December visit to Afghanistan to request talks with Tehran, according to Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. Tensions between Iran and the United States have increased since May, when President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers and later reimposed sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the pact. “During my visit to Kabul last month, the Americans... asked to hold talks,” Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Shamkhani who did not specify what the US side wanted to discuss.

The Taliban must have a role in Afghanistan in future, Iran's foreign minister said on Wednesday, but added that the group should not have a dominant role.Efforts for a negotiated settlement of the 18-year war in Afghanistan have gathered pace in recent weeks, even as reports that US President Donald Trump plans to withdraw thousands of US troops have triggered uncertainty in Kabul.US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad has held three rounds of talks with the Taliban, but on Tuesday, the militants cancelled a fourth round, which had been due in Qatar this week.The militants said they called off the talks because of an "agenda disagreement", especially over the involvement of officials from the Western-backed Afghan government as well as a possible ceasefire.But Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on a visit to India that Iran has had intelligence contacts with the Taliban because it needed to secure border areas controlled by the Taliban on the Afghan side."I think it would be impossible to have a future Afghanistan without any role for the Taliban," Zarif, who is in New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders, told NDTV in an interview."But we also believe that the Taliban should not have a dominant role in Afghanistan."The Taliban, who are fighting to oust all foreign forces and defeat the government, want to re-impose strict Islamic law in Afghanistan after their 2001 ouster by US-led troops.Zarif said it was up to Afghans to decide what role the Taliban should have but Afghanistan's neighbours would not want them to be in overall control."Nobody in the region believes that a Taliban dominated Afghanistan is in the security interests of the region.

News article:
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah said on Wednesday that the Taliban’s refusal to involve the government in peace talks means the end to a conflict that has lasted 17 years can only remain a dream. FILE PHOTO: An Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier keeps watch at a check point on the outskirts of Kabul, Afghanistan December 31, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani Abdullah’s remarks came a day after the Taliban called off a fourth round of talks with U.S. officials in Qatar, due to start this week, over disagreements about the involvement of Afghan officials, a possible ceasefire and prisoner exchange. Efforts for a negotiated settlement have gathered pace in recent weeks, even as reports that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops triggered uncertainty. The United States is pressing Taliban leaders to sit down with Afghan government officials but the Taliban see the United States as the main power and dismiss the Kabul administration as a puppet. “In any peace deal in which the rights of our citizens, that have been gained with a lot of sacrifices, are not respected, the deal is a dream and will never happen,” Abdullah told gathering in Kabul, commemorating the 15th anniversary of the constitution. “Today the talk about the withdrawal of foreign forces is an excuse for continuation of war and gaining more opportunities.” A Taliban leader told Reuters that the talks, which would have been the fourth round with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, would have focused on a U.S. withdrawal, prisoner exchange and the lifting of a ban on movement of Taliban leaders. Taliban sources said that they had demanded that U.S. authorities release 25,000 prisoners and that they would free 3,000, but that U.S. officials were not keen to discuss the exchange. The war in Afghanistan is America’s longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly $1 trillion and killed tens of thousands of people. “NO CHANGE IN TALIBAN” Abdullah, who shares power with President Ashraf Ghani after a U.S.-brokered political deal in 2014 that led to formation of a coalition government, said the Taliban have not changed since their austere regime was toppled by U.S.-led forces in 2001. “We haven’t seen any change in the Taliban so far and that country that supports them, has not unfortunately changed its policies toward us either,” said Abdullah, referring to neighbouring Pakistan which Kabul accuses of harbouring Taliban leaders. Pakistan denies the charge and says it is encouraging the Taliban to talk directly with the Afghan government. A senior Afghan government official said the talks also would have involved discussion about the formation of an interim administration known as the “peace government” after U.S. forces announce a withdrawal and the Taliban accept a ceasefire. The peace government would bring all warring parties under one administration until the Taliban are fully integrated and election are held. But Ghani has strongly opposed any interim government. Abdullah called on Afghans to support the current administration instead. “They say they are not the Taliban of the past and they have learnt lessons and are in favour of an inclusive government, but they instead go and talk to some individuals and call them elders which is against our national interest,” Abdullah said, referring to political figures. “They do this to show that the government is either weak or does not exist,” he added. The impasse over the talks comes as Afghanistan prepares to hold presidential elections in July with many Afghans believing the vote may be cancelled if a peace deal is reached with the Taliban. Presidential candidates, including Ghani who seeks a second five-year term, have not officially announced they are running as coalition-building among leaders of various ethnic groups debated whom to support. The United States sent troops to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. At its peak the U.S. deployment involved more than 100,000 troops, but Washington withdrew most in 2014 and now has around 14,000 troops in the country as part of a NATO-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on a visit to India on Wednesday that the Taliban must have a role in Afghanistan in future, but not a dominant role.

News article:
ISLAMABAD: Renewed efforts for finding a path towards lasting peace and security inside Afghanistan was the main topic of discussion between Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Afghan President's Special Envoy on Afghan Reconciliation Omer Daudzai at the Foreign Office on Tuesday. With a change in dynamics of the Afghan issue, Pakistan is in the forefront and Islamabad is the first capital that Daudzai has chosen to visit after he took over his new office. Kabul hopes that Pakistan can push the Afghan Taliban to agree to start talks with the government of Ashraf Ghani. So far, the Taliban call the shots and have refused any such meeting. “Pakistan will continue to play its vigorous role for bringing lasting peace in Afghanistan. Peace and stability in Afghanistan is in Pakistan’s own best national interest, and necessary for economic development and prosperity in the region,” Qureshi was quoted by his office as telling the Afghan dignitary. He told the Afghan dignitary that there was a growing international convergence on the need to end the suffering of the people of Afghanistan through peaceful settlement of conflict. Qureshi recently visited several regional countries with Afghanistan on top of his agenda, where there was an agreement that a political solution was the only answer to the conflict inside Afghanistan. In this regard, Pakistan says it will do all to help the people of Afghanistan and see the earliest possible end to bloodshed to enter a new phase of peace and prosperity. As Daudzai flew into Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban have cancelled peace talks with officials from the United States in Qatar which were to start today (Wednesday) following disagreements over the agenda of the meeting, the group confirmed on Tuesday. As the US tried to rope in representatives of the Kabul government, the Taliban rejected the participation of the Afghan government officials in the deliberations. Daudzai conveyed the deep appreciation of the sincerity and vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan for peace and stability in Afghanistan. “The foreign minister’s visits to Kabul within on bringing the Western-backed Afghan government to the table. The talks will be the fourth in a series between Taliban leaders and US special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad. "After mutual consultations, we are going to meet US officials in Doha on Wednesday. The meeting will continue for two days - Wednesday and Thursday," said a senior member of the Afghan Taliban on condition of anonymity. Pakistani and Iranian officials said they were trying to persuade the Taliban to meet Afghan officials. Another senior Taliban leader confirmed the Qatar meeting and said no other country would be involved. At the request of the US, a Taliban office was established in Doha in 2013 to facilitate peace talks. But the office had to be closed after the Taliban came under pressure for hoisting the same flag at their office that the group used during its rule in Afghanistan. Subsequently, the then Afghan President Hamid Karzai halted all peace efforts, saying the Doha office was presenting itself as an unofficial embassy for a government-in-exile. The flag has since been taken down and the office has remained empty with no official announcements of a possible reopening. Talks with the Taliban have since been taking place elsewhere in Doha.

ISLAMABAD: The Indian Army Chief, General Bipin Rawat, called on Narendra Modi government to hold talks with Taliban but these should be without any preconditions. He has termed the Taliban as “Terror Outfit” in his statement. The Indian army chief’s comments on Wednesday, at the Raisina Dialogue, on engaging with Taliban are first such public remarks by a senior functionary of the Indian government on the subject. It is certain that India is poking its nose into the Afghan affairs and this would be out-rightly rejected by all concerned. At a time the United States and Russia are reaching out to the Taliban in Afghanistan,the Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat said “the terror outfit” should be engaged. Rawat who is known for issuing irresponsible statements has said that peace and stability in Afghanistan will be in interests of India, Pakistan and the entire region. “Yes, there should be talks with Taliban so long as they do not come out with any preconditions and solong as they are looking at lasting peace in Afghanistan and bring about stability in that country. It is in our interests, it is in the region’s interests and it is in Pakistan’s interests,” General Rawat said. He was asked about several countries engaging the Taliban as part of the Afghan peace process. “There can be no preconditions attached because when you start attaching preconditions, then it kind of gives a sense of a notion of victory (to them),” he said. The Indian army chief said Pakistan has always kept the Taliban in its backyard and cautioned Islamabad that it may be a cause of concern for the country’s security. Major Powers like China, the US and Russia are reaching out to the Taliban as part of efforts to push the stalled Afghan peace process. India has been using Afghan soil as its pawn for its nefarious activities against Pakistan, now is trying to find a role in the affairs of the war-torn country. India had sent two former diplomats in a “non-official” capacity to a conference on the Afghan peace process in Moscow in November which was attended by a high-level Taliban delegation. The Indian diplomats couldn’t attract attention of interlocutors. The conference organised by Russia was attended by representatives of Afghanistan as well as from several other countries including Pakistan, China and the United States. According to the media reports it was learnt that Iran is also engaged in talks with the Taliban. Iranian sources have said that in case India wants to use Iran’s channels of communication with the Taliban, Tehran will be open to such a proposition.

Iranian sources have said that in case India wants to use Iran’s channels of communication with the Taliban, Tehran will be open to such a proposition.

News article:
To clearly understand the voices coming from Washington on Afghanistan, the following seems to be honest appraisals and coherent insight into the burning issue. Noted journalist Pamela Constable wrote in The Washington Post recently: “Everyone, it seems, is pushing for peace in Afghanistan these days. President Trump’s special envoy is racing around the region, trying to drum up support for talks with the insurgent Taliban. The Russians, eager to get into the act, have hosted a conference on the issue. The Pakistanis insist they want to help end the war. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani hopes to win reelection in April as the man who brought peace to his country after 17 years. The Taliban, however, seems to be in no hurry at all.” Earlier, in August 2018, columnist Max Boot commented in the Washington Post: “There are certain enduring rituals in US foreign policy that are pursued whether they have any chance of success. Every administration since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s has tried to improve relations with Moscow. Every administration since Harry S Truman’s has tried to solve the Israeli-Arab dispute. Every administration since Jimmy Carter’s has tried to persuade the Iranian mullahs to behave better. And every administration since Bill Clinton’s has tried to negotiate with the Taliban.” Max Boot added: “The only thing preventing the fall of the government is the presence of 14,000 US troops. But the United States’ determination to remain in Afghanistan after nearly 17 years is wearing thin… If you were the Taliban, why would you negotiate now? From the Taliban’s perspective, an agreement would only make sense if, like the Paris Peace Accords with North Vietnam in 1973, it was supposed to provide the United States a ‘decent interval’ between its pullout and the defeat of its local allies.” Jason Lyall of Yale University came out with five key lessons from Taliban’s deadly resurgence in 2018, especially the attack on Ghazni: He said that (1) Talking and fighting are complements, not substitutes for the Taliban. (2) Afghan forces are nowhere near ready to stand on their own. (3) The Afghan government has a major credibility problem. (4) The Taliban can’t capture cities but that may not matter. (5) Air power is not a silver bullet. Lyall concluded: “We are unlikely, then, to see any substantial reductions in violence in the near term as negotiations with the Taliban continue. While temporary cease-fires may be honored, the Taliban will continue to seek tactical, often temporary, battlefield victories, until convinced that its political demands will be met. Talking and fighting might lead eventually to a negotiated settlement, but the path to that settlement is likely to be long and bloody.” The Wall street Journal in a piece commented: “Afghan and US government estimates put the number of Taliban as high as 70,000 fighters, including underground supporters and regular and auxiliary fighters. The movement has broadened beyond its ethnic Pashtun base to include Afghans of all ethnic backgrounds. “It is capable of implementing governance policy across a large territory from top to bottom,” according to Ashley Jackson, a researcher who surveyed 20 districts controlled at least in part by the Taliban. “Experts say the Taliban’s unity, largely maintained throughout its existence and shown in a three-day cease-fire this summer, is remarkable for an insurgency. That suggests the leadership could enforce any peace deal it signs. “The Taliban have strong command-and-control that they demonstrated in a nationwide cease-fire in which tens of thousands of fighters to a person obeyed,” said Johnny Walsh, formerly lead adviser on the Afghan peace process at the US State Department.” Meanwhile, Pakistan has actively demonstrated its diplomatic outreach for making the peace process a success. Pakistan has facilitated the first round of negotiations. In the aftermath, Pakistan’s foreign minister has carried out shuttle diplomatic tour of Afghanistan, Iran, China and Russia, taking these important regional players into confidence about the progress in talks.
