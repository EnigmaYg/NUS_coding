(MENAFN- IANS) Tehran, Feb 15 (IANS) A top Iranian security official said that the success of the Vienna talks on the restoration of a 2015 nuclear deal depends on the US' political determination. Nuclear negotiations in Vienna have reached a stage where 'the outcome can be announced without guesswork', Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said in a tweet on Monday. The US political decision on whether to accept the requirements conducive to the conclusion of 'a credible and lasting deal' based on the principles in the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Xinhua news agency quoted Shamkhani as saying. Iran signed the JCPOA with world powers in July 2015. However, former US President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the agreement in May 2018 and reimposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, which prompted the latter to drop some of its nuclear commitments one year later and advance its halted nuclear programmes. Since April 2021, eight rounds of talks have been held in the Austrian capital between Iran and the remaining JCPOA parties, namely Russia, China, France, the UK and Germany, to revive the landmark deal. The US, which has been indirectly involved in the Vienna negotiations, has said it has until the end of February to resuscitate the nuclear pact, or Washington will launch 'aggressive efforts' against Iran. --IANS ksk/

News article:
According to Ali Shamkhani, the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, the task of the Iranian negotiator in the new round of nuclear negotiations which began on 7 February is limited to lifting sanctions. His tweet to that effect pre-empted the talks in Vienna. This has been confirmed by a number of other Iranian officials, who sent a clear message that any solution must start from the sanctions issue. The negotiations had paused for a week, during which the delegations returned to their capitals for consultations. Apparently, the Iranian delegation was more determined to restore the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was approved by the administration of former US President Barack Obama. This makes me rather sceptical of the diplomatic claims that a great deal of progress has been made in terms of negotiation, or that the parties are close to reaching a final formula. This round of talks began in a strained atmosphere, with the US preoccupied with the Ukrainian crisis, and the EU countries also interested in Ukraine, but seemingly determined to revive the JCPOA. European countries are hoping to enjoy a boost to their national economies if sanctions against Iran are lifted. It is difficult to read Israel's position on all of this, as it appears to stand against reviving the 2015 agreement, despite its conviction that this would mean Iran could develop its nuclear programme without limits. Everyone agrees that having no restrictions would be dangerous, and could lead to Iran producing a nuclear bomb in just a few weeks. Israel has warned about this before anyone else, and has proposed a military strike to end Tehran's nuclear ambitions, although this is not a risk-free option either, which explains the reluctance to go ahead with it. Nobody can predict with confidence how Iran might react. READ: Vienna and the future of relations between the West and Iran The problem with lifting sanctions is not limited to the funds that this would release; it would also remove the obstacles to Iran being a partner in global trade, including arms production and sales. In this regard, many countries in the region fear that Iran will benefit by being able to expand its weapons industry and sell them to hostile parties. The statement by Mohammad Bagheri, the Chief of the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, that his country will become one of the largest arms exporters in the world if the US sanctions are lifted does not help to allay any fears in this regard. Given that Iran has developed ballistic missiles, drones and its navy while it is basically under siege, what could it do if sanctions are lifted and it is free to trade around the world? On the eve of the negotiations, Saeed Jalili reappeared. He is important not only as the presidential candidate who withdrew in favour of President Ibrahim Raisi, but also because he is a former nuclear negotiator. Ali Bagheri Kani, the assistant foreign minister and head of the current Iranian negotiating team, worked as Jalili's assistant when the latter was Iran's chief negotiator during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government (2008-2011), and the two men still have a good relationship. Reports in some media say that Jalili, a fundamentalist who is close to the decision-making process and a member of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, submitted a paper in which he protested against the negotiation track, calling for more firmness in the Iranian position. His office quickly denied the reports, which were attributed to a group close to him monitoring foreign policy. What is certain is that this paper represents the point of view of the fundamentalists, who reject the negotiations in their current form. They call for an immediate withdrawal from the talks in Vienna and for Iran to continue enriching uranium. Moreover, in alignment with the fundamentalist Iranian vision, the paper suggested that neither the US nor the UN Security Council should be feared as long as Iran enjoys the friendship of Russia and China. The logic is that more force must be shown to get the US to return to direct negotiations, which fits in with the mutual "edge of the abyss" relationship which has existed between Tehran and Washington for years. What the paper could not guarantee, though, is that the US will not resort to a sudden blow against Iran's nuclear facilities. It is fairly obvious that the fundamentalists in Iran have not learnt from previous mistakes. Underestimating the international community, especially during the Ahmadinejad era, led to an unprecedented intensification of pressure on Iran, which reached its peak with UN Resolution 1929 in June 2010 which really suffocated the country and paved the way for its economic isolation and current fragile position. READ: Iran and its arms The US negotiator is also under pressure and stressing that time is important, and that if an agreement is delayed, the talks will become meaningless. According to CNN, influential officials in the Biden administration have given negotiators until the end of this month, and if the agreement is not saved by then, there will be no alternative to the military option. Furthermore, as statements confirmed that a new deal is imminent, more than thirty Republican Senators, led by Ted Cruz, warned President Joe Biden against making any deal with Iran without first presenting it to the Senate for approval. Opponents point out that any new agreement must have the support of two-thirds of Congress, but would still be non-binding on the next US president. Optimism about the outcome of the current negotiations remains difficult, not only because of the internal pressures — US negotiators obliged to make changes to the agreement; the Iranians calling for the complete lifting of sanctions — but also because of the other Iranian demand for a pledge that a new deal will remain in effect even when the US administration changes. The difficulty in this is that it is not related to America's relationship with Iran, but to the nature of the US political system, which refuses to make any agreement or treaty binding on future administrations. At the moment, the Iranian negotiator does not want to understand this, and instead insists on pressing for a guarantee which the Biden administration cannot provide.

News article:
Iran’s top negotiator to the talks between Tehran and the remaining signatories of a 2015 deal says the ball is in the other side’s court to make the negotiations come to a conclusion by taking “serious decisions.” “Our negotiating partners need to be realistic, avoid intransigence, and heed lessons of past 4yrs,” Ali Baqeri-Kani tweeted on Wednesday. After weeks of intensive talks, we are closer than ever to an agreement; nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, though. Our negotiating partners need to be realistic, avoid intransigence and heed lessons of past 4yrs. Time for their serious decisions. https://t.co/kRnSte9Bzu — علی باقری‌کنی (@Bagheri_Kani) February 16, 2022 The United States left the deal in 2018, returning the sanctions that it had lifted. The Austrian capital of Vienna has been hosting eight rounds of talks to examine the potential of removal of the inhumane and illegal sanctions and a US return to the accord. The Iranian official also said, “After weeks of intensive talks, we are closer than ever to an agreement,” warning, however, that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” His remarks echoed those made earlier by Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian to the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, in which the top diplomat asserted that a final agreement hinged on the other side’s conduct. “The Iranian side’s initiatives have put an agreement within reach, but the conclusion of a final agreement depends on the Western side’s responsible conduct,” the top diplomat said he had told the European official on Tuesday. The Western side that is attending the talks includes the UK, France, and Germany, US allies that have been complying closely with Washington’s sanctions against Tehran. Also on Wednesday, Mohammad Marandi, an advisor to the Iranian negotiating team in Vienna, corroborated Baqeri-Kani’s remarks about the prospect of reaching an agreement, but asserted likewise that there were “some issues,” the resolution of which was tied to the other side’s attitude. We are approaching an agreement in Vienna. However, there are some issues remaining that need a US/E3 decision. It's possible that a deal can be reached within days. pic.twitter.com/yO7SjJfqlT — Seyed Mohammad Marandi (@s_m_marandi) February 16, 2022 “We are approaching an agreement in Vienna.

Iran’s top negotiator to the talks between Tehran and the remaining signatories of a 2015 deal says the ball is in the other side’s court to make the negotiations come to a conclusion by taking “serious decisions.” “Our negotiating partners need to be realistic, avoid intransigence, and heed lessons of past 4yrs,” Ali Baqeri-Kani tweeted on Wednesday.

The Austrian capital of Vienna has been hosting eight rounds of talks to examine the potential of removal of the inhumane and illegal sanctions and a US return to the accord. The Iranian official also said, “After weeks of intensive talks, we are closer than ever to an agreement,” warning, however, that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” His remarks echoed those made earlier by Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian to the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, in which the top diplomat asserted that a final agreement hinged on the other side’s conduct. “The Iranian side’s initiatives have put an agreement within reach, but the conclusion of a final agreement depends on the Western side’s responsible conduct,” the top diplomat said he had told the European official on Tuesday. The Western side that is attending the talks includes the UK, France, and Germany, US allies that have been complying closely with Washington’s sanctions against Tehran. Also on Wednesday, Mohammad Marandi, an advisor to the Iranian negotiating team in Vienna, corroborated Baqeri-Kani’s remarks about the prospect of reaching an agreement, but asserted likewise that there were “some issues,” the resolution of which was tied to the other side’s attitude.

Iran’s top negotiator in Vienna said Wednesday that world powers are “closer than ever” to reaching an agreement to revive a multilateral nuclear accord, as the US said it was in the “very final stages” of indirect talks with the Islamic Republic. “After weeks of intensive talks, we are closer than ever to an agreement,” Iranian diplomat Ali Bagheri Kani wrote on Twitter before clarifying that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, though.” Kani urged negotiating partners to “be realistic,” adding that it was time for “serious decisions.” Asked about the status of talks in Vienna aimed at a joint US-Iran return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, State Department spokesman Ned Price said the parties were “in the midst of the very final stages” of talks and that the US would have a better assessment of Iran’s seriousness “in the coming days.” Indirect talks in Vienna between Iran and the United States on reviving the tattered agreement resumed last week after a 10-day hiatus. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms US President Joe Biden came into office vowing to return to the JCPOA, which was signed in 2015. His predecessor Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018, implementing a wide array of sanctions against Iran, which led Tehran to begin enriching uranium at levels that violate the original agreement. World powers have held eight rounds of negotiations in Vienna aimed at reviving the JCPOA. Those talks resumed last week after a 10-day hiatus. Earlier Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian briefed lawmakers in his country that Iran has days, not weeks, to decide whether it wanted to return to the JCPOA.

News article:
The United States said on Thursday that a nuclear deal is possible within days if Iran “shows seriousness”, AFP reported. Stating that "substantial progress has been made in the last week," a State Department spokesperson told AFP that "if Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days.” But "anything much beyond that would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave risk," the spokesperson added. The remarks come as the indirect talks between the US and Iran, which resumed in Vienna several days ago, continue. Iran has gradually scaled back its compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal it signed with world powers in response to former US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement in May of 2018. It has held several rounds of indirect negotiations with the Biden administration on a possible return to the deal. The talks have been mediated by the other signatories to the deal, with US and Iranian representatives not meeting directly. On Wednesday, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, said that an agreement between Iran and world powers is closer than ever. "After weeks of intensive talks, we are closer than ever to an agreement; nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, though," he said, according to Reuters. Iran has insisted that all sanctions that have been imposed on it when Trump left the deal be lifted. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi reiterated that demand on Monday, saying, "The rights of the Iranian people must be respected." Meanwhile, nearly 200 House Republicans have written to President Joe Biden warning that any nuclear deal made with Iran without Congress' approval "will meet the same fate" as the 2015 agreement. "We will view any agreement reached in Vienna which is not submitted to the US Senate for ratification as a treaty — including any and all secret agreements made with Iran directly or on the sidelines of official talks — as non-binding," the GOP lawmakers wrote to Biden, according to Axios.

Topic: Iran Nuclear Region: ViennaUnited StatesIran Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: Nuclear Security Talks In Vienna, high-level diplomatic talks are meant to address Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. But will they work? On Thursday, U.S. officials claimed they had made “substantial progress” toward reaching an agreement with Iran over the future of the country’s nuclear program after a months-long diplomatic standoff between Washington and Tehran. Despite this progress, however, ongoing issues between the two remain, putting the outcome of the final negotiating session in question. The Vienna negotiations have continued since late 2021 and are currently in their ninth round. The discussions are being held between Iran, Germany, and permanent members of the UN Security Council. Thus far, the Iranian delegation has refused to engage directly with the United States, blaming Washington for the country’s economic misfortunes following President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the original deal, the “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action” (JCPOA), and his subsequent reimposition of sanctions in 2018. A State Department spokesperson claimed that, “if Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days,” according to Agence France-Presse. The spokesperson added, however, that “anything much beyond that”—e.g., an agreement attempting to resolve other issues in the U.S.-Iran relationship, such as Iran’s ballistic missile program or its support for Tehran-aligned private militias in neighboring countries—“would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave risk.” While Trump’s “maximum pressure” sanctions caused severe damage to the Iranian economy and led to an increase in tensions in the Persian Gulf region, it also allowed Iran to return to its enrichment of uranium—a process the country had largely abandoned following the JCPOA’s implementation in 2015. By now, Iran is estimated to have nearly enough highly-enriched uranium to create a nuclear weapon. Western diplomats have urged the creation of a settlement before the threshold is crossed; French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the timeframe as “a matter of days.” Further, Iran has never acknowledged that it intends to construct a nuclear weapon, although blueprints for nuclear devices and nuclear-capable missiles have been found and stolen from Iranian government computers. Iranian authorities have requested a guarantee from the administration of President Joe Biden that the United States would remain within the deal for the foreseeable future to avoid a repeat of Trump’s 2018 JCPOA withdrawal. However, nearly two hundred members of the House of Representatives, all Republicans, published a letter earlier in the week explicitly announcing that “they would work to obstruct a renewed deal if certain controversial measures were not included.” This effectively indicates that a potential agreement is vulnerable to cancellation if the GOP reclaims the White House.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN that he is “very optimistic” about reaching an agreement in ongoing talks with world powers in Vienna to revive a landmark 2015 agreement on Iran’s nuclear program.

The US has participated indirectly in the Vienna talks because it withdrew from the deal in 2018 under then-US president Donald Trump. US President Joe Biden has signaled that he wants to rejoin the deal. Under Trump, the US reimposed heavy sanctions on Iran. Tehran has responded by publicly increasing the purity and amounts of uranium it enriches and stockpiles, in breach of the accord. Israel opposed the original agreement when it was signed in 2015, with then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu arguing that it actually paved the path to an Iranian nuclear arsenal. Israel has publicly vowed it will not allow Iran to get nuclear weapons.

The US has participated indirectly in the Vienna talks because it withdrew from the deal in 2018 under then-US president Donald Trump. US President Joe Biden has signaled that he wants to rejoin the deal. Under Trump, the US reimposed heavy sanctions on Iran. Tehran has responded by publicly increasing the purity and amounts of uranium it enriches and stockpiles, in breach of the accord. Israel opposed the original agreement when it was signed in 2015, with then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu arguing that it actually paved the path to an Iranian nuclear arsenal. Israel has publicly vowed it will not allow Iran to get nuclear weapons.

News article:
By Hassan Shokouhi nasab The eighth round of the talks in Vienna aimed at removing sanctions on Iran can be considered the longest, the most complex and, at the same time, the most sensitive political negotiations. In the meantime, positive signals have been transmitted from the Austrian capital, showing steps forward, which may be slow, but advancing contrary to those in recent years. One of these signals is the recent US move to restore sanctions waivers on some of Iran's civilian nuclear activities. On January 21, the US State Department informed Congress that it had suspended some sanctions against Iran's civilian nuclear activities in order to allow the two sides to return to their commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Although some described the US measure as a mere show in line with the interests of the sanctioning country rather than those of Iran, it is only part of the jigsaw puzzle in the provisions over which there is already an agreement as reported by the media. Observers believe the United States is pursuing both overt and covert objectives from this issue, ranging from reassuring its regional allies about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear activities after an agreement and easing worries about Iran's nuclear breakout time to addressing domestic rifts in Congress as well as tensions between the White House and the Republicans. Behind-the-scenes goals of the dual use of "nuclear breakout" and "time constraints" The issue of "nuclear breakout,” i.e. the time needed for enrichment to produce an atomic bomb, has always been raised by the West and its Hebrew-Arab allies. The anti-Iranian axis uses the issue as a leverage to put pressure on Tehran and build a consensus against the Islamic Republic. They are pursuing their "Iranophobia" project by showing that Iran’s nuclear breakout time is near; This is while the country is not seeking to develop and use atomic bombs based on a fatwa (religious decree) by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. Mohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), has also said that the country does not go beyond 60% uranium enrichment. Moreover, from the observers' point of view, the benefits that Iran derives from "reaching the threshold" far outweigh those of its "nuclearization." Regardless of Iran's official position, however, the Western media, from The Wall Street Journal to Axios, are trying to portray Iran’s nuclear breakout time as very near. The Wall Street Journal claims that this time is now less than a year and possibly reduced to six months, and Axios alleges that the time required for Tehran to produce an atomic bomb is a maximum of four to six months. Since the start of the eighth round of the Vienna talks until today, the element of "time" has been used as a tool to exert pressure on Iran and reduce Tehran's maximum demands. A look at the repeated positions of White House press secretary Jen Psaki and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the unanimity of diplomats from the European trio regarding insufficient time reveal the portrayal of a state of emergency; A situation in which Iran is far from rational and deliberate decisions and trapped in excitement. However, as the eighth round of the Vienna talks lengthens, it can be understood that the Iranian team has prioritized achieving the desired result over reaching a swift unfavorable agreement. Congress’s help to White House in "potentially" final round of Vienna talks Now, at the last minute of the Vienna talks, when some news indicates the drafting of an agreement, US senators, disguised as opponents, came to the help of the White House in order to lower Tehran's expectations. The summoning of US Special Envoy for Iran Rober Malley to a secret meeting with members of Congress, as well as the letter of 33 Republican Senators addressed to President Joe Biden, can be assessed to that aim. Even if we assume that the dispute between Congress and the White House is not fabricated, the outcome of the tension is a temporary agreement; The deal, which Iran has opposed so far, but according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, there is still a long way to go before the 2015 Iran nuclear deal can be revived. It should be noted that in the JCPOA and subsequent UN Security Council Resolution 2231, temporary restrictions were considered for Tehran. In addition to the 15-year limit on Iran’s nuclear activities, the resolution included a five- and eight-year ban on Iran's arms and missile activities, which are called "sunset clauses." The arms embargo expired last year, and we will see the lifting of the restrictions on Iran’s missile program in the near future. This is one of the concerns of the West and its regional allies. So far, they have made endeavors to make the embargoes permanent, but they not gone nowhere. The empty place of the Parliament (Majlis), which previously helped reduce the West’s acts of sabotage by approving the plan of "proportionate, reciprocal action of the Iranian government in the implementation of the JCPOA" is felt, but Tehran has used other means of leverage at the current critical time. The firm positions of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as well as the increasing defense-military capability, such as the unveiling of the strategic missile dubbed Khaybar Shekan, can be analyzed in this regard. Therefore, it is expected, by looking through realistic lenses and understanding the current situation, the West will stop making fictitious deadlines and playing the "nuclear breakout" and other worn-out fruitless games. It is also expected that Iran, as an influential player in the region and beyond, will agree to a win-win deal with reciprocal and balanced obligations and rights.

News article:
Iran, on Monday, cited "significant progress" in talks with world powers in Vienna on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, Anadolu News Agency reports. Foreign Ministry spokesman, Saeed Khatibzadeh, said Tehran insists on lifting all sanctions that contradict the nuclear deal. The spokesman, however, did not provide any details about the nature of the progress in the talks. Negotiations are under way in Vienna between delegations from Russia, China, Germany, France, the UK and Iran. Washington is indirectly involved in the talks. Iran nuclear deal draft puts prisoners, enrichment, cash first; oil comes later – diplomats The nuclear deal was signed between Iran and world powers in 2015, under which Iran was required to limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. However, in May 2018, former US President, Donald Trump, announced withdrawal from the landmark deal, followed by sanctions. In recent years, Iran has ramped up its nuclear activities as a counter-measure, stirring up tensions with the West. Meanwhile, Khatibzadeh said Iran is ready to hold talks with neighbouring countries, in a reference to Saudi statements about preparations to hold a fifth round of talks with Tehran. He said the success of the talks with Saudi Arabia depends on a real willingness from Riyadh to do so. On Saturday, Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, said his country plans to hold a fifth round of direct talks with Tehran. "We are looking to schedule a fifth round of direct talks with Iran,, despite a lack of substantive progress so far," bin Farhan said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference. Tehran and Riyadh severed diplomatic relations in January 2016 following an attack on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, after Shia cleric Nimr Al-Nimr was executed by Saudi authorities. 2015 nuclear deal has become an 'empty shell', Iran's top security official says The relationship between the two rivals deteriorated further after Iran, in September 2016, accused Riyadh of deliberately causing the deaths of around 400 Iranian pilgrims in a 2015 stampede in the Muslim holy city of Mecca. The two sides have since been engaged in a strong regional rivalry, often accusing each other of waging a proxy war for regional influence. The two regional rivals held four rounds of talks, hosted by Iraq, in an effort to normalise their relations and ease tensions between the two neighbours.

News article:
After almost a year of negotiations, talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran are entering the 11th hour with signs on either side that talks are reaching what the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described as “the moment of truth.” On Saturday French President Emmanuel Macron spoke for one and half hours with his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, to convince him to embrace a deal and hinted that talks had come to a solution respectful of all parties’ interests. While the Americans say the deal is a few weeks away, the French talk about days. Attending the Munich Security Conference on Sunday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian also reiterated that Tehran wants the US to show “tangible steps of goodwill,” in a possible reference to freeing Iran’s blocked funds abroad. The talks include a phased out revival where Iran would get back to 5 per cent uranium enrichment, unfreezing of Iranian assets abroad and the release of prisoners indicating reciprocal steps that aim at building confidence. US sanctions directly linked to Iran’s nuclear activities, slammed by the Donald Trump administration, would also be lifted. Aside from a few details — and incentives — the deal seems on the anvil. Not limited to its nuclear activities Even the Israelis who are against the revival of the deal appear to see it coming through. On Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that Iran may “shortly” agree to a new nuclear deal with major powers but warned it will be weaker than the original 2015 agreement. And his Defence Minister Benny Gantz warned in Munich that Iran’s threat is not limited to its nuclear activities but extends to its drone system and its regional proxies. Talks on reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) have been held in Vienna since mid last year and they involve Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia directly and the United States indirectly. The revival of the agreement has been a divisive issue in US presidential elections in 2020 and continues to be in US Congress. Ironically, it is also a polarising issue for Iranian hardliners who called on the Raisi government to make sure that future US administrations cannot walk away from the agreement or impose the so-called “snapback mechanism”. If the deal is revived, even for a short time — since the US midterm elections are a few months away and a Republican victory would bode ill for the future of the agreement in the 2024 presidential elections — it could mean a major shift in current regional politics. Despite hard-line opposition, the deal would be a major relief for a suffocating Iranian economy where domestic discontent is on the rise. How the Iranian leadership will deal with sudden financial relief remains to be seen. Those opposed to any deal in the region will have to recalibrate their policies taking into consideration a number of factors including the fact that the US is slowly leaving the region, the aftermath of the current Russia-Ukraine standoff. A starting point On Saturday Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, said the Kingdom was looking to schedule a fifth round of direct talks with Iran despite a “lack of substantive progress” in previous rounds. He added that if the 2015 nuclear pact was revived that should be “a starting point, not an end point” in order to address regional concerns, and that Riyadh remained interested in talks with Iran. While the revival of the nuclear deal with Iran may not cover critical issues like its regional agenda and its long-range missile and drone programmes, the onus will be on Tehran to change its behaviour and maintain good ties with its neighbours. That would be a major geopolitical shift that could lead to a more secure and stable Middle East. Failing to adhere to a new good neighbourly policy would be amiss and a major miscalculation by Tehran. Iran needs friends in the region and not enemies and it cannot do that by supporting non-state actors and other proxies. It is already a key regional player but it needs to understand that a new Middle East is emerging and that it has to behave as a normal state.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says the Vienna talks on the removal of anti-Iran sanctions and revival of the 2015 landmark deal have not reached a conclusion yet and it is time for the United States to make its difficult decision. Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in a Monday hearing before the Iranian Parliament’s Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy. During the hearing, the Iranian foreign minister first explained about the efforts made by the incumbent Iranian administration and the negotiating team to clinch a deal through the ongoing talks in the Austrian capital. “The negotiations are not over yet and it is time for the United States to make difficult political decisions, but it has not made such decisions yet,” Iran’s top diplomat said. The US unilaterally left the 2015 agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018 and re-stored the sanctions that had been lifted under the accord. Washington’s European allies in the deal—France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—have been toeing the sanctions line closely by ending their trade activities with Iran. The Vienna talks began last April between Iran and the remaining parties to the JCPOA on the assumption that the US, under the Joe Biden administration, is willing to repeal the so-called maximum pressure policy pursued by former president, Donald Trump, against Tehran. Iran says it won’t settle for anything less than the removal of all US sanctions in a verifiable manner. It also wants guarantees that Washington would not abandon the agreement again. In a Saturday phone call, the Iranian foreign minister told European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell that the Islamic Republic seeks a good agreement through the ongoing talks in the Austrian capital, but is determined not to cross its red lines. During the Monday meeting, the Iranian lawmakers also stressed the importance of preserving the Islamic Republic's red lines on national interests in the course of the negotiations, including removing sanctions, and obtaining the necessary guarantees and the required opportunity for accurate verification. They emphasized that the Islamic Republic does not accept any deadline in securing its national interests and said, "The real deadline for the Iranian nation is the interests of the Iranian nation and the removal of obstacles in the way of Iran's foreign trade." The Iranian legislators added that they are concerned about safeguarding the country's nuclear capabilities, securing complete removal of sanctions and improving people's livelihood, saying they have prioritized economic benefit of the Iranian nation from the JCPOA through the removal of sanctions. More than 200 Iranian lawmakers issued a joint statement earlier this month, calling on the incumbent administration not to back down from its red lines and national interests in the course of the Vienna negotiations. “We must learn from the past and set the Iranian nation’s interest as a red line, and do not commit ourselves to any agreement unless necessary guarantees have been received,” the statement read. Iran lead negotiator, EU official meet in Vienna Meanwhile, Iran's lead negotiator to the Vienna talks Ali Bagheri Kani and Enrique Mora, the European Union’s deputy foreign policy chief and head of the JCPOA Joint Commission, held a meeting in Vienna on Monday.

It added that the council has also stressed "the need to quickly resolve the remaining issues that put the negotiations on the border between agreement and dead end," while emphasizing that the acceptance of any agreement depends on settlement of the outstanding issues.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh has warned the US administration against “bluffs and blusters” in the Vienna talks on the revival of the 2015 Iran deal, stressing that Tehran is willing to reach an agreement through negotiations but will not wait forever. Khatibzadeh made the comment in a post on his Twitter account early on Tuesday after US State Department’s spokesman Ned Price said Washington was prepared to walk away from the talks in the Austrian capital if Iran displayed “an intransigence to making progress.” The US is not a party to the Vienna talks because it is no longer a member of the nuclear deal, but it has sent a delegation to the Austrian capital to keep abreast of the negotiations. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that since the US was the party to have withdrawn from the landmark deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Tehran had to make sure it would not happen again. “US has already "walked away" from JCPOA. We must make sure it won't happen again. Everyone has its own plan B, though US' has proven hollow. Blusters & bluffs have/will not work. Decisions do,” Khatibzadeh tweeted. “A deal is at hand, if WH makes its mind. Iran is willing, but will not wait forever.” US has already "walked away" from JCPOA.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh has warned the US administration against “bluffs and blusters” in the Vienna talks on the revival of the 2015 Iran deal, stressing that Tehran is willing to reach an agreement through negotiations but will not wait forever. Khatibzadeh made the comment in a post on his Twitter account early on Tuesday after US State Department’s spokesman Ned Price said Washington was prepared to walk away from the talks in the Austrian capital if Iran displayed “an intransigence to making progress.” The US is not a party to the Vienna talks because it is no longer a member of the nuclear deal, but it has sent a delegation to the Austrian capital to keep abreast of the negotiations. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that since the US was the party to have withdrawn from the landmark deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Tehran had to make sure it would not happen again. “US has already "walked away" from JCPOA. We must make sure it won't happen again. Everyone has its own plan B, though US' has proven hollow. Blusters & bluffs have/will not work. Decisions do,” Khatibzadeh tweeted. “A deal is at hand, if WH makes its mind. Iran is willing, but will not wait forever.” US has already "walked away" from JCPOA. We must make sure it won't happen again. Everyone has its own plan B, though US' has proven hollow. Blusters & bluffs have/will not work. Decisions do. A deal is at hand, if WH makes its mind. Iran is willing, but will not wait forever. — Saeed Khatibzadeh | سعید خطیب‌زاده (@SKhatibzadeh) February 28, 2022 Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Monday that the Vienna talks on the removal of anti-Iran sanctions have not reached a conclusion yet and it is time for the United States to make its difficult decision. Amir-Abdollahian also explained about the efforts made by the incumbent Iranian administration and the negotiating team to clinch a deal through the ongoing talks in the Austrian capital. The US unilaterally left the 2015 agreement in 2018 and re-stored the sanctions that had been lifted under the accord.

Iran’s foreign minister has underlined the significance of the remaining issues at the Vienna talks, saying the Western parties need to get realistic and make political decisions to reach an agreement on reviving the 2015 Iran deal. “Tehran has unveiled many initiatives to resolve the issue so far, and now reaching an agreement requires a political decision and a realistic attitude from the West,” Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said during a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Wednesday. He stressed the need for the outcome of the Vienna process to safeguard Iran’s national interests, including in the economic sphere. In recent days, diplomats participating in the eighth round of negotiations in the Austrian capital have said that “a deal is within reach” provided that the remaining, narrowed-down issues are resolved. The Vienna talks began last April between Iran and the other parties to the Iran deal on the assumption that the US, under the Joe Biden administration, is willing to repeal the so-called maximum pressure policy against Tehran. Former US president Donald Trump instigated the maximum pressure campaign after he pulled the US out of the Iran deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018 and unleashed what he called the “toughest ever” sanctions against the Islamic Republic. One key issue on which Iran and the US are now in agreement is that the maximum pressure campaign of sanctions has failed. At the talks, Tehran maintains that it won’t settle for anything less than the removal of all of those sanctions. It also seeks the formation of a verification regime on the removal of the sanctions, as well as guarantees that Washington would not abandon the agreement again. During his phone conversation, Amir-Abdollahian also expressed satisfaction with the close cooperation between Iran and China in Vienna and said it is vital that the two countries continue such a trend. For his part, the Chinese foreign minister also noted the close contacts between Tehran and Beijing in the Vienna talks, saying many achievements have been secured through coordination and joint efforts. Wang said the remaining issues in Vienna are important. China understands and supports the rational demands of the Iranian side, he said. He also expressed hope that the talks continue to make progress and ultimately lead to an agreement. In recent months, the United States and its three major European allies have repeatedly warned that there are “only a few weeks left” to strike a deal that would salvage the original JCPOA, warning to walk away from the talks. US State Department spokesman Ned Price reiterated on Monday that “we are prepared to walk away if Iran displays an intransigence to making progress.” A senior State Department official also said the signatories of the JCPOA only have a “handful of weeks left” to work out a deal, while claiming that Washington was not imposing an “artificial deadline” or “an ultimatum.” On the other side, Iran has remained calm and voiced readiness to ink a “good agreement” immediately, but at the same time, it has asserted that it would not agree to a flawed deal. The Islamic Republic has made clear that it wants “an airtight deal” bereft of any loopholes that the Americans and the Europeans could exploit again.

WASHINGTON — The United States said Thursday that “a possible deal” on a new Iranian nuclear accord is close but several sticking points have prevented an agreement and time is running out. Negotiators meeting in Vienna to try and salvage the 2015 nuclear deal, which is meant to prevent Tehran from acquiring an atomic bomb, have made “significant progress,” State Department deputy spokeswoman Jalina Porter told reporters, echoing other nations in recent weeks. “We are close to a possible deal, but a number of difficult issues still remain unsolved,” she said. “We will not have a deal unless we resolve quickly the remaining issues,” she added. However, “if Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding of mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days,” she said, using the acronym for the 2015 accord. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Enrique Mora, the European Union’s coordinator for the talks, also said they were in the “final stages.” “Some relevant issues are still open and success is never guaranteed,” he tweeted, adding “we are definitely not there yet.” The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed in 2015, secured sanctions relief for Iran in return for strict curbs on its nuclear program. Advertisement The agreement was between Iran on one side and Germany, China, the United States, France, Britain and Russia on the other. The agreement unraveled when former US president Donald Trump withdrew from it, with Israeli encouragement, in 2018. Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium has now reached more than 15 times the limit set out in the 2015 accord, the UN’s IAEA nuclear watchdog said Thursday. The coming days are seen as critical by the West, which believes that the agreement could soon be irrelevant at the rate Iran is making nuclear advances. Several observers believe that the West could leave the negotiating table and chalk the deal up to a failure if a compromise is not reached by this weekend. Among the problem points, Tehran is calling for the closure of the IAEA’s investigation into the presence of nuclear material at undeclared sites. IAEA Director General Rafael Gross, who has said the agency would “never abandon” its attempts to get Iran to clarify the previous presence of nuclear material at the sites, will travel to Iran on Saturday to meet with officials from the country.

Indirect talks between Iran and the United States on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are close to reaching an agreement, the chief British and French envoys said on Friday as they and their German colleague flew home to brief ministers. “We are close. E3 negotiators leaving Vienna briefly to update Ministers on state of play. Ready to return soon,” Stephanie Al-Qaq said on Twitter, referring to the chief British, French and German diplomats involved in the talks. “Hoping to return quickly to reach a conclusion because we are very, very close to an agreement,” the French envoy, Philippe Errera, said on Twitter. Their departure raised the possibility that the United States and Iran, which have been talking indirectly because Tehran refuses to meet face to face, might be preparing to sit down together though diplomats said there were no such plans. “As far as I know, the Iranians are not ready for direct talks,” Russian envoy Mikhail Ulyanov told reporters. “We will have a deal maybe in the middle of next week. We are talking about the last efforts before crossing the finish line.” Negotiators have worked for 11 months to try to revive the 2015 deal under which Iran limited its nuclear program to make it harder to obtain fissile material for a bomb – an ambition Tehran denies – in return for relief from economic sanctions. Western powers, China and Russia have for almost a year worked closely to revive the accord but the war in Ukraine is creating a sense of urgency to conclude talks before cooperation with Moscow may become more difficult. Then-U.S. President Donald Trump reneged on the pact in 2018, restoring U.S. sanctions that have slashed Iran's oil exports, and prompting Iran to begin violating the deal's nuclear limitations about a year later. On Thursday, Ulyanov had said he did not think the talks would now collapse and a ministerial meeting – typically where a deal would be blessed – was likely, but he could not say if it would be on Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Myriad pieces must fall into place for a deal to happen. One wildcard is an effort by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to resolve questions about nuclear material that the Vienna-based agency suspects Iran failed to declare. The IAEA has found particles of processed uranium at three apparently old sites that Iran never declared and has repeatedly said Tehran has not provided satisfactory answers. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi arrived in Tehran early on Saturday, Iranian news agencies reported, hoping to agree on a process that would lead to the end of the investigation and potentially clearing a way for the wider deal, diplomats said. Another open question is the fate of Western prisoners in Iran. While U.S. officials say talks on the two issues are separate, the top U.S. negotiator has said Washington unlikely to strike a nuclear deal unless Tehran frees four U.S. citizens that the United States says Iran holds hostage. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian hinted a nuclear agreement may be close but said the West's “haste” to reach one “cannot prevent the observance of Iran’s red lines.” “We are ready to finalize a good and immediate agreement,” Iranian media quoted Amirabdollahian as telling the EU’s top diplomat Joseph Borrell by telephone. “Most of Iran's requests have been considered in the upcoming agreement.”

Ready to return soon,” Stephanie Al-Qaq said on Twitter, referring to the chief British, French and German diplomats involved in the talks. “Hoping to return quickly to reach a conclusion because we are very, very close to an agreement,” the French envoy, Philippe Errera, said on Twitter. Their departure raised the possibility that the United States and Iran, which have been talking indirectly because Tehran refuses to meet face to face, might be preparing to sit down together though diplomats said there were no such plans. “As far as I know, the Iranians are not ready for direct talks,” Russian envoy Mikhail Ulyanov told reporters. “We will have a deal maybe in the middle of next week. We are talking about the last efforts before crossing the finish line.” Negotiators have worked for 11 months to try to revive the 2015 deal under which Iran limited its nuclear program to make it harder to obtain fissile material for a bomb – an ambition Tehran denies – in return for relief from economic sanctions. Western powers, China and Russia have for almost a year worked closely to revive the accord but the war in Ukraine is creating a sense of urgency to conclude talks before cooperation with Moscow may become more difficult. Then-U.S. President Donald Trump reneged on the pact in 2018, restoring U.S. sanctions that have slashed Iran's oil exports, and prompting Iran to begin violating the deal's nuclear limitations about a year later. On Thursday, Ulyanov had said he did not think the talks would now collapse and a ministerial meeting – typically where a deal would be blessed – was likely, but he could not say if it would be on Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Myriad pieces must fall into place for a deal to happen. One wildcard is an effort by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to resolve questions about nuclear material that the Vienna-based agency suspects Iran failed to declare. The IAEA has found particles of processed uranium at three apparently old sites that Iran never declared and has repeatedly said Tehran has not provided satisfactory answers. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi arrived in Tehran early on Saturday, Iranian news agencies reported, hoping to agree on a process that would lead to the end of the investigation and potentially clearing a way for the wider deal, diplomats said. Another open question is the fate of Western prisoners in Iran. While U.S. officials say talks on the two issues are separate, the top U.S. negotiator has said Washington unlikely to strike a nuclear deal unless Tehran frees four U.S. citizens that the United States says Iran holds hostage. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian hinted a nuclear agreement may be close but said the West's “haste” to reach one “cannot prevent the observance of Iran’s red lines.” “We are ready to finalize a good and immediate agreement,” Iranian media quoted Amirabdollahian as telling the EU’s top diplomat Joseph Borrell by telephone. “Most of Iran's requests have been considered in the upcoming agreement.”

The United States is “getting closer” to reaching a new nuclear deal with Iran, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. Speaking to reporters during a daily press briefing, Psaki noted that there are “important components” that both sides have yet to agree on. She dismissed questions regarding the possibility of US sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine hindering talks in Vienna, saying both Moscow and Washington share a common goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Her comments came several hours after a meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid. During the meeting, which also focused on the situation in Ukraine, Lapid noted Israel’s concerns about the nuclear negotiations potentially at the point of a breakthrough, saying Israel has well-known differences with the US on a deal, even if they share the end goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “It’s no secret we have our differences on this, but it’s a conversation between allies that have a common goal, which is preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear threshold country, and to stop Iran’s ability to spread terror and instability all around the world,” Lapid said. Blinken responded that both Israel and the United States are “united and committed to the proposition that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon.” The foreign minister said the latest events in Ukraine are a reminder that Israel cannot rely on others to defend itself. Advertisement Noting that Israel reserves the right to act militarily against Iran’s nuclear program, Lapid said, “This war is a reminder to Israel. We have friends, we have allies, but our security must always be in our hands only.” The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed in 2015, secured sanctions relief for Iran in return for strict curbs on its nuclear program. The agreement was between Iran on one side and Germany, China, the United States, France, Britain, and Russia on the other. The agreement unraveled when former US president Donald Trump withdrew from it, with Israeli encouragement, in 2018. Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium has now reached more than 15 times the limit set out in the 2015 accord, the UN’s IAEA nuclear watchdog said last week. The coming days are seen as critical by the West, which believes that the agreement could soon be irrelevant at the rate Iran is making nuclear advances. Advertisement Several observers believe that the West could leave the negotiating table and chalk the deal up to a failure if a compromise is not reached by this weekend. Among the problem points, Tehran is calling for the closure of the IAEA’s investigation into the presence of nuclear material at undeclared sites. IAEA Director General Rafael Gross, who has said the agency would “never abandon” its attempts to get Iran to clarify the previous presence of nuclear material at the sites, will travel to Iran on Saturday to meet with officials from the country.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s top diplomat at months-long talks aimed at restoring its tattered nuclear deal with world powers flew home late Monday for a sudden trip, a sign of the growing pressure on Tehran as the negotiations appear to be nearing their end.

The 2015 nuclear deal saw Iran put advanced centrifuges into storage under the watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency, while keeping its enrichment at 3.67% purity and its stockpile at only 300 kilograms (661 pounds) of uranium. As of February 19, the IAEA says Iran’s stockpile of all enriched uranium was nearly 3200 kilograms (7,055 pounds). Some has been enriched up to 60% purity — a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

Iran will not back down on its red lines in nuclear talks with major powers, President Ebrahim Raisi said on Tuesday, as the United States and France warned there was little time left to revive their 2015 accord. Eleven months of negotiations to restore the deal which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program have reached their final stages. The European Union has said Washington and Tehran must now take the political decisions needed for agreement. 'This is Putin's show, he has several ways to take it nuclear'. LISTEN Iran has sought to remove all sanctions, and it wants guarantees from the United States that it will not abandon the agreement once more, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. Iran's top negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, unexpectedly returned to Tehran on Monday for consultations. A European and an Iranian official said he is expected, for now, to be back in Vienna on Wednesday. "The government pursues nuclear negotiations in full accordance with the principles and framework set by the Supreme Leader," Raisi said, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in Tehran's decision. "It has not and will not back down on any of these red lines," the semi-official Fars news agency quoted him as saying. Talks coordinator Enrique Mora of the European Union said on Monday that the political decisions needed to conclude the negotiations successfully must be taken in the next few days. Open gallery view International Atomic Energy Organization, IAEA, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, March 2022. Credit: AP Photo/Vahid Salemi The United States and France echoed that urgency: "There is some but very little time remaining for steadfast diplomacy to put us on the collective path to a mutual return to full implementation" of the accord, a U.S. statement to the United Nations nuclear watchdog's Board of Governors said. France, another of the parties to the Vienna talks, said further delays could jeopardize the chances of reaching agreement. "We are very close to an agreement. It is essential we conclude while we still can," French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre told reporters in a daily briefing. "We are concerned by the risks that further delays could weigh on the possibility of concluding." 'New era' The United States said success would mark a "new era in our approach to Iran’s nuclear program", although Central Intelligence Agency director William Burns cautioned that whether a deal is reached, challenges would persist. Diplomats say several differences still need to be overcome in the talks, which were also hit by a last-minute demand from Russia for a guarantee from the United States that Russian trade, investment and military-technical cooperation with Iran would not be hindered by sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken played down the issue during a visit to Estonia. "Russia continues to be engaged in those efforts, and it has its own interest in ensuring that Iran is not able to acquire a nuclear weapon," Blinken said.

Should the talks collapse, it could carry the risk of Tehran getting to within a short sprint of nuclear weapons and igniting a fresh war in the Middle East. It could also prompt the West to impose more harsh sanctions on Iran and further escalate world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict. European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany had already temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could go, and it was now up to the two main protagonists to agree on outstanding issues, including the extent to which sanctions on Iran would be rolled back. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is under U.S. sanctions, successfully put a second military satellite into orbit, state media said on Tuesday, in what would be another advance for Iran's military.

Iran will not back down on its red lines in nuclear talks with major powers, President Ebrahim Raisi said on Tuesday, as the United States and France warned there was little time left to revive their 2015 accord. Eleven months of negotiations to restore the deal which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program have reached their final stages. The European Union has said Washington and Tehran must now take the political decisions needed for agreement. 'This is Putin's show, he has several ways to take it nuclear'. LISTEN Iran has sought to remove all sanctions, and it wants guarantees from the United States that it will not abandon the agreement once more, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. Iran's top negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, unexpectedly returned to Tehran on Monday for consultations. A European and an Iranian official said he is expected, for now, to be back in Vienna on Wednesday. "The government pursues nuclear negotiations in full accordance with the principles and framework set by the Supreme Leader," Raisi said, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in Tehran's decision. "It has not and will not back down on any of these red lines," the semi-official Fars news agency quoted him as saying. Talks coordinator Enrique Mora of the European Union said on Monday that the political decisions needed to conclude the negotiations successfully must be taken in the next few days.

Credit: AP Photo/Vahid Salemi The United States and France echoed that urgency: "There is some but very little time remaining for steadfast diplomacy to put us on the collective path to a mutual return to full implementation" of the accord, a U.S. statement to the United Nations nuclear watchdog's Board of Governors said. France, another of the parties to the Vienna talks, said further delays could jeopardize the chances of reaching agreement. "We are very close to an agreement. It is essential we conclude while we still can," French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre told reporters in a daily briefing. "We are concerned by the risks that further delays could weigh on the possibility of concluding." 'New era' The United States said success would mark a "new era in our approach to Iran’s nuclear program", although Central Intelligence Agency director William Burns cautioned that whether a deal is reached, challenges would persist. Diplomats say several differences still need to be overcome in the talks, which were also hit by a last-minute demand from Russia for a guarantee from the United States that Russian trade, investment and military-technical cooperation with Iran would not be hindered by sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken played down the issue during a visit to Estonia. "Russia continues to be engaged in those efforts, and it has its own interest in ensuring that Iran is not able to acquire a nuclear weapon," Blinken said.

Should the talks collapse, it could carry the risk of Tehran getting to within a short sprint of nuclear weapons and igniting a fresh war in the Middle East. It could also prompt the West to impose more harsh sanctions on Iran and further escalate world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict. European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany had already temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could go, and it was now up to the two main protagonists to agree on outstanding issues, including the extent to which sanctions on Iran would be rolled back. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is under U.S. sanctions, successfully put a second military satellite into orbit, state media said on Tuesday, in what would be another advance for Iran's military.

Iran’s top diplomat at months-long talks aimed at restoring its tattered nuclear deal with world powers returned on Wednesday to Vienna, Reuters reported, citing the Iranian semi-official ISNA news agency. Ali Bagheri Kani made a sudden trip back to Tehran earlier this week. Iran’s state-run news agency IRNA described the trip as being “within the framework of the usual consultations during the talks,” while others believed it a sign of the growing pressure on Tehran as the negotiations appear to be nearing their end. The top negotiator for the European Union seemed to suggest that whether the talks succeeded or failed now depended on the Islamic Republic. “There are no longer ‘expert level talks.’ Nor ‘formal meetings,’” Enrique Mora wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, responding to comments by an Iranian analyst. “It is time, in the next few days, for political decisions to end the #ViennaTalks. The rest is noise.” Mora’s comments mirror those of British and French negotiators at the Vienna talks, which have been trying to find a way to resurrect the accord. The US unilaterally abandoned the deal in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump, and Iran has been scaling up nuclear activity, including enrichment, ever since. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The comments appeared to push back against a constant Iranian refrain in the last weeks of talks that sought to blame any delay on America. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday said he believed “we’re close” to reaching a deal, though there were “a couple of very challenging remaining issues.” The latest wrinkle, however, is a demand Saturday from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that Blinken offer written guarantees over Moscow’s ability to continue trade with Iran as it faces sanctions over its war on Ukraine. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian spoke Monday by phone with Lavrov, with the sanctions threat apparently discussed, according to a statement from his office. Advertisement “We are against war and imposition of sanctions, and it is clear that cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and any country, including Russia, should not be affected by the atmosphere of sanctions,” Amirabdollahian said in the statement. The 2015 nuclear deal saw Iran put advanced centrifuges into storage under the watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency, while keeping its enrichment at 3.67% purity and its stockpile at only 300 kilograms (661 pounds) of uranium. As of February 19, the IAEA says Iran’s stockpile of all enriched uranium was nearly 3,200 kilograms (7,055 pounds). Some has been enriched up to 60% purity — a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

By Ron Kampeas March 11, 2022 (JTA) — The United States’ negotiations to reenter the Iran nuclear deal were put on hold on Friday after a last-minute Russian maneuver to try to alleviate sanctions on its trade with Iran. The months-long negotiations in Vienna were so close to coming to a climax that a podium had been set up at the hotel where negotiators are meeting. The plan was reportedly to announce the terms for the United States’ reentry next week. But Russia, one of six countries involved in enforcing the original nuclear deal, attempted to carve out exemptions in the deal’s sanctions to preserve some of its own trade dealings with Iran. Russia, an ally of Iran, has been hit with its own historic sanctions from Western powers in response to its invasion of Ukraine and has seen its economy tank this month. President Joe Biden also called on Friday for suspending normal trade with Russia as the war intensifies. Josep Borrell Fontelles, the top European Union foreign affairs official who is coordinating the talks, hinted that Russia’s ask had stalled the progress, without elaborating on the “factors” for the pause. “A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors,” he wrote on Twitter. “A final text is essentially ready and on the table. As coordinator, I will, with my team, continue to be in touch with all #JCPOA participants and the U.S. to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement.” JCPOA refers to the 2015 deal’s formal name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The European Union helps negotiate the terms of the deal, along with Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Former President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018.

News article:
Talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal paused Friday after Russia upended negotiations with a sudden demand for a decrease in sanctions related to its military invasion in Ukraine. News that talks would need to be halted came in a tweet from Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign policy chief who acted as coordinator for the talks. Borrell declined to reference Moscow's new ultimatum when announcing the pause, instead blaming "external factors." "A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors," he tweeted. "A final text is essentially ready and on the table. As coordinator, I will, with my team, continue to be in touch with all #JCPOA participants and the U.S. to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement." Russia, which is serving as a negotiator on behalf of Iran, brought talks to a standstill this week by tying the outcome of the talks to sanctions Moscow is facing in response to it's efforts to overtake Ukraine. RUSSIA AND US ACCUSE EACH OTHER OF LYING ABOUT BIOWEAPONS LABS IN UKRAINE The top EU negotiator offered no timeline for when the talks, which have been taking place in Vienna, would restart. An Iranian representative discussing the pause on Twitter framed it in a positive light. "Pause in #ViennaTalks could be a momentum for resolving any remaining issue and a final return. Successful conclusion of talks will be the main focus of all,” Saeed Khatibzadeh, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, tweeted Friday. “No external factor will affect our joint will to go forward for a collective agreement.” Like Borrell, Khatibzadeh also did not identify the "external" issues at play. The Obama administration brokered the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015. The accord reduced sanctions against Iran in exchange for the country reducing its stockpile of enriched uranium needed to fuel nuclear weapons. It also capped the fissile purity at which Tehran could refine uranium at 3.67%, but it did not include limitations on delivery systems and other checks on Iran being able to produce a nuclear bomb when the deal expires.

Talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal paused Friday after Russia upended negotiations with a sudden demand for a decrease in sanctions related to its military invasion in Ukraine. News that talks would need to be halted came in a tweet from Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign policy chief who acted as coordinator for the talks. Borrell declined to reference Moscow's new ultimatum when announcing the pause, instead blaming "external factors." "A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors," he tweeted. "A final text is essentially ready and on the table. As coordinator, I will, with my team, continue to be in touch with all #JCPOA participants and the U.S. to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement." Russia, which is serving as a negotiator on behalf of Iran, brought talks to a standstill this week by tying the outcome of the talks to sanctions Moscow is facing in response to it's efforts to overtake Ukraine. RUSSIA AND US ACCUSE EACH OTHER OF LYING ABOUT BIOWEAPONS LABS IN UKRAINE The top EU negotiator offered no timeline for when the talks, which have been taking place in Vienna, would restart. An Iranian representative discussing the pause on Twitter framed it in a positive light. "Pause in #ViennaTalks could be a momentum for resolving any remaining issue and a final return. Successful conclusion of talks will be the main focus of all,” Saeed Khatibzadeh, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, tweeted Friday. “No external factor will affect our joint will to go forward for a collective agreement.” Like Borrell, Khatibzadeh also did not identify the "external" issues at play. The Obama administration brokered the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015. The accord reduced sanctions against Iran in exchange for the country reducing its stockpile of enriched uranium needed to fuel nuclear weapons. It also capped the fissile purity at which Tehran could refine uranium at 3.67%, but it did not include limitations on delivery systems and other checks on Iran being able to produce a nuclear bomb when the deal expires.

News article:
US pressure foiled Iran’s President Ebrahim Raeisi says Washington’s policy of maximum pressure has failed to achieve its goals. Raesi said that Iran’s policy of maximum resistance has offset the US pressure. Raeisi made the remarks during a visit to the mausoleum of the late founder of Islamic Republic Imam Khomeini, on the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. Back in 2018, former president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, and intensified a campaign of sanctions to force Tehran to negotiate a new agreement. US involvement in Yemen war The United States says it will send 5th-generation fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates in the wake of Yemeni forces striking targets deep inside the Persian Gulf state. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says Washington will also deploy guided missile destroyer USS Cole to Abu Dhabi. The US will also continue to provide early warning intelligence to the UAE. The Yemeni army has warned that it will continue to strike the Emirates as long as it keeps targeting Yemeni people. On Monday, Yemeni armed forces targeted a number of sensitive facilities in the capital Abu Dhabi. The UAE is part of the Saudi coalition that’s been waging a bloody war on Yemen for seven year. Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis have been killed directly from the war, or indirectly from hunger and disease. Tensions over Ukraine Tensions over Ukraine are escalating, with Britain now warning that it will impose sanctions on Russia, the moment it moves to invade its neighbor. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says it is vital for Russia to pull back its troops and choose diplomacy. He says any invasion would be a disaster. Johnson made the remarks during his visit to Ukraine where he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian leader, for his part, said Kiev would resist any incursion. The Western states, mainly the United States, continue to beat the drums of war, saying Russia is preparing for military action against Ukraine despite repeated denials by Moscow. Meantime, Russia is warning that the US is seeking to drag it into a war.

News article:
Threatening Chinese Firms The standoff between the US and Russia over Ukraine, now expanding into China. Washington warns Chinese firms over evading export controls and sanctions the US says will impose on Russia if it invades Ukraine. Washington says it has an array of tools it can deploy, if foreign firms, including those in China, get around U-S sanctions. It says Russia won’t be able to make up for the consequences, even if it gets closer to China. The reaction came after China said Beijing and Moscow had coordinated their position on Ukraine during a meeting between their foreign ministers. Russian president Vladimir Putin has also met his Chinese counterpart XI Jinping in Beijing. Moscow denies US allegations that Russia prepares to invade Ukraine. Moscow says Washington wants to drag it into war. Bahrain-Israel Ties Bahrain’s main opposition group, al-Wefaq, says any security or military agreement between the kingdom and Israel is unlawful and has no legitimacy. Al-Wefaq says the Bahraini regime is in crisis and has no authority to take such actions on behalf of its people. The group also slammed the Thursday visit by the Israeli minister of military affairs to Bahrain, saying it crossed red lines. During the visit, Benny Gantz signed a security agreement, the first between the regime and a Persian Gulf Arab state. Bahrain and several other Arab states established diplomatic relations with Israel two years ago under US-brokered deals. Palestinians see normalization with Israel as a stab in their back and a betrayal of their cause. Racial Tensions In US Activists in the US city of Chicago call for justice, after a white former police officer convicted of murdering a black teenager in 2014 was released early from prison. Justice is on trial now. That’s what Chicago’s Catholic Priest Father said at a rally against the early release of ex-cop, Jason Van Dyke. He was freed after 39 months in prison instead of serving an 81-month sentence. Chicago authorities say the ex-cop showed good behavior while in detention. Van Dyke murdered Laquan McDonald, 17 years old, in October 2014. But, he was charged more than a year later, following public pressure. That happened after released dash cam video showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times within seconds, as the teenager was walking away. African Americans have long been subjected to brutality by white police officers, with the majority of cases going unpunished.

Iran leader warning Leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says the United States is taking a blow from where it least expected. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the previous and current US presidents have joined hands to further disgrace Washington. The leader added that the enemy has launched an inclusive, multi-front invasion against Iran, and highlighted the need for a multi-pronged response. The leader made the remarks in a meeting with a group of commanders and staff members of Iran’s Air Force. The meeting was held on the anniversary of the historic pledge of allegiance made by the Air Force officers to the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini, on this day, 43 years ago. Sanctions removal talks And just as the parties involved in the Vienna negotiations are preparing to take up the talks where they left off, bipartisan divisions continue to prevail in the United States, with dozens of Republican senators warning President Joe Biden that they might block any new nuclear agreement with Iran. In a letter to Biden, a group of 33 lawmakers have said they would thwart the implementation of any new accord, if his government does not allow Congress to review and vote on its terms. The group of legislators is being led by Senator Ted Cruz, a long-time opponent of the Iran deal. They have threatened to use the full range of options and leverage available, to ensure that the Biden administration would adhere to US laws, before reaching any new deal with Iran. US-Taiwan arms sales China issues a stern warning to the United States over its plans to provide up to 100 million dollars worth of arms and military services to Taiwan. The foreign ministry says the arms sales would seriously undermine China’s security and sovereignty. The ministry says Beijing will take robust measures to protect its security interests. Taiwan, however, has welcomed the US move, saying the deal will take effect in March. Washington has increased its military support to Taipei over the past years, amid rising tensions with Beijing. China considers Taiwan as an inseparable part of its territory, and has warned Washington that it could trigger war by further pushing the island territory to seek independence.

News article:
'West must remove Iran sanctions' The Iranian foreign minister has called on the West to adopt a realistic stance in the JCPOA revival talks and make a serious and effective decision with regards to the removal of sanctions. In a phone call with his Chinese counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the West must demonstrate its meaningful departure from the failed policies of the former US administration. He said this is possible through the removal of all sanctions inconsistent with the 2015 deal and the adoption of serious measures to provide guarantees that the US will not abandon the deal again. For his part, the Chinese foreign minister said the US’s unilateral withdrawal from the deal in 2018 has inflicted damage on Iran and violated its legitimate rights. Wang Yi said Beijing supports Tehran’s reasonable demands and proposals in the talks in Vienna. Russia-West tensions The Russian president says his country’s military buildup is conducted on its own soil, dismissing as baseless allegations that Russia is posing a threat to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin made the remarks at a joint press conference with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron in Moscow. Putin warned that European countries will be drawn into a military conflict with Russia in case NATO admits Ukraine as a member. He expressed hope that the standoff over Ukraine will be settled through dialogue, referring to concerns that Moscow expects the West to respond to. During the conference, Macron talked about the security guarantees he has proposed to Putin. UK's economic woes The United Kingdom is facing a rise in inflation at rates not seen in the past three decades. A major retail company is now warning that the worst is yet to come. Britain’s biggest retailer, Tesco, says the prices of its products can go up as much as five percent in the months to come. The company blames the matter on the rise in energy bills. That’s partly due to the cold winter, lower gas deliveries from Russia, and tensions in East Europe. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the second time in three months after forecasting that the peak inflation will reach record 7-percent in April.

Iran president speech Iran’s President Ebrahim Raeisi met with dozens of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. During his speech at the event, the president drew an analogy between the current and the former US administrations. He said the Biden administration is no different from its predecessor in its policies and actions. The president also talked about Iran's 2015 deal, saying the status quo is the result of Washington’s withdrawal and the inaction of other signatories. President Raeisi said diplomacy only works when all sides abide by their commitments. And pointing out to the ongoing Vienna talks, he said any negotiations should guarantee Iran’s national interests. Yemen downs aircraft The Yemeni army says it has shot down another intruding Saudi spy drone. The spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces says air defenses downed the CH-4 spy aircraft while carrying out hostile acts over Hajjah province. Yahya Saree adds that the surface-to-air missile targeting the plane has not yet been unveiled. Yemen has brought down tens of drones in the course of Saudi Arabia’s seven-year aggression on the country. The war has left hundreds of thousands of Yemenis dead, and displaced millions more. It has also destroyed Yemen’s infrastructure and spread infectious diseases. Syria condemning Israeli strikes Syria has strongly condemned Israel’s latest missile strike on its territory. The Foreign Ministry says the aggression is a violation of international law, UN principles and its resolutions. It says the attacks come amid an international silence and under the protection of the US that encourages Tel Aviv to repeat its aggression on Syria. It says Damascus has the right to use all legitimate means to respond. Israel unleashed a missile strike on Qudsayya City near the capital Damascus early Wednesday. A soldier was killed and five others were wounded. It also caused damage to residential buildings.

Iran political independence Iranians have taken to the streets all across the country to mark the 43rd anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution. But the coronavirus pandemic has given a different look to this national celebration. US stealing Afghan money The Taliban have slammed as theft, an executive order by the US president that allows Washington to seize half of the Afghan funds frozen in New York’s Federal Reserve. A Taliban spokesman says the move represents the lowest level of the human and moral decay of a country. Under the order, half of the 7 billion dollars of Afghan assets held in the US could be used to compensate families of 9/11 victims. The other half can be released for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. The move on the funds is pending a judicial decision. A senior US administration official says it will take months to unfreeze funds for aid to Afghanistan. This comes as rights groups and the United Nations have warned of a deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the country. “West’s disinformation on Ukraine” Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu says Moscow’s ties with London have hit the rock bottom as their tensions soar over Ukraine. Shoigu also called for steps to reduce existing tensions. He slammed the West for what he called goring Ukraine with weapons. Shoigu stressed that Moscow does not plan to invade the country. He made the comments during a meeting with his British counterpart Ben Wallace in Moscow. Wallace said British troops are in Ukraine for training purposes. He claimed that the weapons Britain supplied to Ukraine also don’t pose a threat to Russia. He warned Moscow of tragic consequences in case of an invasion. The British defense secretary however expressed hope for de-escalation with Russia.

Sanctions crime against humanity Iran’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations says unilateral sanctions against her country amount to crimes against humanity. Zahra Ershadi denounced the sanctions on medication and humanitarian goods. She said a lot of Iranian children have lost their lives due to drug shortages caused by such inhuman bans. The Iranian envoy stressed that countries which impose sanctions on other nations should not go unpunished. Ershadi emphasized that her country demands an immediate halt to all coercive measures, including imposing sanctions. She said a removal of sanctions on Iran can provide the country with guarantees for achieving economic and social development. The United States has imposed illegal sanctions against Iran with the aim of crippling its economy. It further stepped up the bans after unilaterally withdrawing from the 2015 deal. ‘Iran not to compromise on redlines’ Iran tells the EU foreign policy chief that it will not back down from its redlines in the Vienna negotiations, blaming the West’s lack of serious will for prolongation of the talks. Israeli PM in Bahrain Palestinian resistance movements condemn the Israeli prime minister’s visit to Bahrain. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said such visits can never legitimize the regime’s occupation of Palestinian lands. Barhoum held Bennett responsible for the atrocities Israeli forces commit against Palestinian people. Also the Islamic Jihad movement strongly condemned Bahrain for hosting the Israeli prime minister, saying such trips bring nothing but threat and danger to Arab states. Bennett arrived in Manama on Monday and will meet Bahrain's Crown Prince and Prime Minister during his two-day stay in the country. Meanwhile, hundreds of people rallied in Manama to voice solidarity with Palestinians and denounce Bennett’s visit, which coincides with the anniversary of their 2011 uprising against the Al Khalifa regime.

News article:
Russia troops withdrawal Baseless hysteria: that’s how Moscow describes as the West’s allegation regarding an imminent Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine. Repeated accusations of a possible Russian attack on Ukraine by the US and its Western allies have heightened tensions in Eastern Europe for weeks now. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow yet another attempt by a European leader to ease the ongoing tensions. During a joint presser following the meeting Scholz said all Europeans are aware that sustainable security on the continent can only be achieved together with Russia. Putin, for his part, stressed that his country is not after a war in Europe. US “non- compliance” Tehran calls on the western parties to the 2015 deal to take a realistic approach toward the Vienna talks. The Iranian foreign minister says in that case, a good deal will be within reach. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in a tweet following a phone call with his British counterpart, Elizabeth Truss. This as Iran and the remaining signatories to the JCPOA are engaged in intensive negotiations in Vienna to restore the agreement, left in limbo following the US withdrawal in 2018. Iran’s top security official has however, warned that the proven US non-compliance is the most significant threat to any agreement. Ali Shamkhani says the verifiable removal of sanctions and guarantees, the two main demands set out by Iran, are the integral part of a good agreement. Iran has also repeatedly dismissed any outside interference in the Vienna talks between the JCPOA signatories. US seizure of Afghan money Protesters also demanded Washington compensate tens of thousands of Afghans killed during the US-led war on the country over the past two decades. Washington’s decision to seize Afghan funds comes as the country’s economy is on the brink of collapse. Afghanistan relied heavily on international aid but that too stopped once the Taliban rose to power in August, last year.

News article:
JCPOA revival talks Iran’s president says any agreement to revive the 2015 deal requires the removal of anti-Iran sanctions while ensuring the interests of the Iranian nation with credible guarantees. Ebrahim Raeisi made the remarks during a joint presser with Qatari Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. He also said that the Vienna talks cannot succeed unless the US shows its will and remove sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic. On ties with Doha, Raeisi noted that his administration is seeking to expand cooperation with the Persian Gulf Arab nation. The Qatari Emir, for his part, echoed the call and said Doha also wants to boost bilateral ties with Tehran. Earlier, the two countries signed over a dozen of agreements and memorandum of understandings. This is Raeisi’s first visit to a Persian Gulf neighbor since becoming President in June last year. He is in the Qatar to attend the sixth summit of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum. Israeli land grab The United Nations denounces the Israeli regime for its plan to evict Palestinian families from their ancestral homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of occupied al-Quds. Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN secretary general, slammed the move as a violation of international law. He said the UN has repeatedly called for an end to the forced eviction and demolition of homes in the occupied West Bank and al-Quds. The UN official called on Tel Aviv to adopt necessary measures to protect civilians, including Palestinian refugees. He made the comments after a UN delegation visited the occupied Palestinian territories. Sheikh Jarrah has been a flashpoint, witnessing crackdowns by Israeli forces on the Palestinians protesting against the expulsion of dozens of families in favor of Israeli settlers. Russia-Ukraine tensions Tensions along Russia’s border with Ukraine are escalating. Moscow says a shell fired from Ukraine has destroyed a border facility that was used by the Russian border guard service. The incident happened in the Rostov region, some 150 meters from the two countries' joint border. No casualties have been reported. Sporadic shelling across the line dividing Ukrainian government troops and pro-Russian forces in the east has intensified since last week. On Sunday, pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine said government troops had shelled the flashpoint region, killing two civilians. In recent days, thousands of residents from the Donetsk region have been evacuated amid fears of an imminent attack by Ukrainian government forces. The evacuees are being accommodated in southwestern Russian cities.

News article:
Military operation in Donbass After weeks of speculation over rising tensions in Eastern Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorizes a special military operation in Ukraine’s Donbass region. Putin says NATO's expansion to include Ukraine is unacceptable and that Russia has been left with no choice but to defend itself against threats emanating from Ukraine. Still, Putin says Russia has NO plans to occupy Ukrainian territory. He called on the Ukrainian military forces to lay down their arms and go home. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine is ready for anything and that it will win. He's asking citizens not to panic and has introduced martial law across the country. Israel on decline Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warns Israel against waging a war on Lebanon, adding that his forces are completely prepared for any attack. In an interview with al-Manar TV, Nasrallah said the Israeli regime is on the decline and on the path to demise. He said the demise of the Israeli regime is only a matter of time, suggesting that the term “temporary regime” to be used for Israel. Nasrallah said Hezbollah seeks justice and peace, and would defend the Lebanese people and their freedom. US Ansarullah sanctions The United States imposes sanctions on a number of entities and individuals, accusing them of providing tens of millions of dollars to Yemen’s Ansarullah movement. The action freezes any assets of the designated individuals that are subject to U-S jurisdiction and bars Americans from doing business with them. Those targeted include a UAE and Sweden-based commodities trader and his company as well as money exchange houses in Turkey and Yemen. They are accused of shipping fuel and other petroleum products and commodities throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia with the proceeds financing Ansarullah. This comes as the movement, along with the Yemeni army, has been defending the country against Saudi Arabia’s years-long aggression. The war, which started in 2015, has so far killed hundreds of thousands of Yemenis, mostly civilians. The United Nations says the country is facing the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

News article:
Sanctions removal talks The Iranian foreign minister dismisses Western allegations that Moscow could stand in the way of an agreement to revive the 2015 deal, known as the JCPOA. Hussein Amirabdollahian cites assurances he received from his Russian counterpart in Moscow. The top Iranian diplomat also expressed hope that the US would drop what he described as its excessive demands. He said the current pause in the talks can pave the ground for resolving the outstanding issues and all sides returning to compliance with their commitments. For his part Sergey Lavrov said Russia seeks the swift revival of the JCPOA and that the US should rejoin the agreement and remove sanctions on Iran. Lavrov said, Moscow has received written guarantees from the US that anti-Russia sanctions would not hinder cooperation within the framework of the Iran deal. Also in the press conference, the Iranian foreign minister said he has delivered a message from his Ukrainian counterpart to Lavrov for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Russia-Ukraine conflict Russian forces are closing in on the city of Kiev as they push ahead with their operation in Ukraine, now in its 20th day. The capital has come under increasing fire. An attack on an apartment block left several people dead. A cameraman for Fox News has been killed when his vehicle was struck near Kiev. The city’s mayor announced a 35-hour curfew for the city starting on Tuesday night. Russia says its forces have taken full control of the southern region of Kherson. Several Ukrainian cities including Sumy and Mariupol are still under siege. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country should recognize that it will not join the NATO alliance.

Israel rejected Friday evening the new peace initiative by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. A senior Israeli official said that Fabius' threat to recognize a Palestinian state should the talks reach a dead end effectively incentivizes the Palestinians to try to see the talks end in deadlock. "The foreign minister of France says up front that if his initiative reaches a dead end, France will recognize a Palestinian state. This statement is an incentive for the Palestinians to bring about a dead end. Negotiations cannot be held nor peace achieved in this manner." Fabius announced Friday that France will try to convene an international peace summit in the next few weeks to renew diplomatic efforts between Israeli and the Palestinians. Fabius threatened that should the diplomatic offensive fail, France will formally recognize a Palestinian state. The Palestinians welcome the French call "for serious international involvement towards ending the Israeli occupation that began in 1967," the PLO's negotiations affairs department, led by chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, said in a statement. Open gallery view French Foreign Affairs minister Laurent Fabius waves as he arrives before a meeting with the Iranian president at the Elysee Palace in Paris on January 28, 2016. Credit: AFP "We will be contacting France, as well as other international partners, to advance in that direction (of an international conference). We have been calling upon the international community to have an international conference for Palestine based on international law and UN resolutions," Erekat said. Speaking in Paris at a conference of French diplomats, Fabius said "unfortunately, [Israeli] settlement construction continues. We must not let the two-state solution unravel. It is our responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council." In December 2014, France tried to push for a UN Security Council resolution to lay down a framework for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, these efforts failed due to opposition from Israel and the U.S. on one hand, and an unwillingness of the Palestinians on the other to compromise on the exact wording of the decision in order to win final approval from the Obama administration. In the summer of 2015, France raised the possibility of creating an international support group for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. This group met on the sidelines of the UN last September. The meeting was attended by the foreign ministers of Quartet-member nations (U.S., Russia, the EU and the UN) together with another 30 Western and Arab countries - but without Israel or the Palestinians Since that meeting, Fabius tried to push for a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, but this effort also failed to gain traction. In the last few weeks, Fabius and other French officials held talks with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and other PA officials. The Palestinians expressed support for the creation of an international peace committee to be based on the Arab peace initiative. Fabius' comments on Friday were, in effect, the response to this Palestinian proposal.

Paris will recognize the Palestinian state if France fails to break a deadlock between the Israelis and Palestinians in the coming weeks, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has announced. “If this attempt to achieve a negotiated solution reaches a dead end, we will take responsibility and recognize the Palestinian state,” Fabius said Friday. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, France has a duty to maintain efforts to find a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, he explained during a media-conference in Paris. “France will engage in the coming weeks in the preparation of an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European, Arab, notably to preserve and make happen the solution of two states,” the French FM is cited as saying by Reuters. Fabius expressed hope that the international peace summit will be attended by Israelis and Palestinians, who haven’t been talking since 2014, as well as other key international players, including the US, EU states and Arab nations. “Unfortunately, [Israeli] settlement construction continues. We must not let the two-state solution unravel,” he said. An unnamed Israeli official has already told a journalist for the Haaretz newspaper that the French peace initiative will be rejected, as recognizing it would only encourage Palestinians to avoid direct negotiations with Tel-Aviv.

In October of 2014, Sweden became the first EU nation to recognize Palestinian statehood, followed shortly by the UK. The first Palestinian embassy opened in Stockholm in January 2015. Last September, the Palestinian flag was hoisted at UN headquarters for the first time as a symbolic gesture in the territory’s quest for statehood.

News article:
France is looking to quickly revive plans for an international conference to "bring about the two-state solution" to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Friday. "In the coming weeks, France will take... steps in order to organize an international conference gathering each of the parties' principle partners -- principally Americans, Europeans and Arabs -- in order to preserve and to bring about the two-state solution," he said in remarks to diplomats. France has in recent years raised the idea of hosting an international conference to revive peace efforts which would bring in all the key players in a show of support for a final settlement of the decades-long conflict. But the idea has never taken concrete shape. "We must not allow the two-state solution to fall apart," he said, noting that there had been no halt to Israel's settlement activity on land the Palestinians want for a future state. Peace talks collapsed in April 2014 and since then, the situation has deteriorated, with the prospects of fresh dialogue appearing more remote than ever. A wave of Palestinian knife, gun and car-ramming attacks which began on October 1 has killed 25 Israelis, while over the same period, 159 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most while carrying out attacks although others died in clashes and demonstrations. - Recognizing Palestine? - Should efforts to breathe life into the moribund peace process fail, France would move to unilaterally recognize Palestine as a state, Fabius said. "And what will happen if this last-ditch attempt at reaching a negotiated solution hits a stumbling block?" he said. "In that case, we will have to live up to our responsibilities and recognize a Palestinian state." In November 2014, the French parliament backed a motion urging the government to recognize Palestine as a state as a way of achieving a "definitive resolution of the conflict" in a move which Paris has said could happen if the peace process remained in the doldrums. France has also pushed for a U.N. resolution that would guide negotiations leading to an independent Palestinian state and which could include a timeframe for talks. Until now, France's diplomatic efforts have been largely rebuffed by Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting that peace would only come through direct negotiations between the parties and not through U.N. resolutions "imposed from the outside." Earlier on Friday, the Palestinians began waging a new campaign at the United Nations to revive peace prospects, with envoy Riyad Mansour highlighting the need for a "collective approach" to solve the conflict and saying a resolution condemning Israel's settlement expansion could be a first step.

PARIS (Reuters) - France will recognise a Palestinian state if a final push that Paris plans to lead for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians fails, its foreign minister said on Friday.

REUTERS/Ruben Sprich U.S.-led efforts to broker peace for a two-state solution collapsed in April 2014 and since then there have been no serious efforts to resume talks. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has repeatedly warned that letting the status quo continue risks killing off a two-state solution and playing into the hands of Islamic State militants. Last year he failed in efforts to get the United States on board to push for a U.N. Security Council resolution to set parameters for talks between the two sides and set a final deadline for a deal. The expansions of settlements by Israel since then have been described by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as “provocative acts” that raise questions about its commitment to a two-state solution. “We cannot let the two-state solution disintegrate. It is our responsibility as a U.N. Security Council member and a power seeking peace,” Fabius told an annual gathering of foreign diplomats. Fabius has previously called for an international support group comprising Arab states, the European Union and U.N. Security Council members that would essentially force the two sides to compromise. He said Paris would begin preparing in the “coming weeks” an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European and Arab. If this last attempt at finding a solution hits a wall, “well ... in this case, we need to face our responsibilities by recognising the Palestinian state”, he said. A French diplomatic source said the aim was to launch the conference before the summer and that it would not be accompanied by a U.N. Security Council resolution, which would inevitably fail. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously criticised recent French initiatives, calling them “counter-productive”. Despite anger in the U.S. administration over Israeli settlements, there is little prospect of U.S. President Barack Obama supporting any initiative that could upset the U.S. Jewish lobby 10 months before an election. A U.S. official responded cautiously to Fabius’ statement. “The U.S. position on this issue has been clear. We continue to believe that the preferred path to resolve this conflict is for the parties to reach an agreement on final status issues directly,” the official said. Nabil Abu Rdainah, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said he welcomed the move. “There is no doubt that a French recognition of the Palestinian state will contribute to building peace and stability in the region,” he said. An Israeli official, who declined to be identified, said: “The foreign minister of France says up front that if his initiative reaches a dead end, France will recognise a Palestinian state. This statement constitutes an incentive for the Palestinians to bring about a dead end. Negotiations cannot be held nor peace achieved in this manner.” Palestine has non-member observer status at the United Nations and its flag flies with those of member states at UN headquarters in New York. Sweden became the first EU member nation to recognise the Palestinian state in 2014 and has been followed by several others. Palestinians seek a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, parts of which have been occupied by Israel since a 1967 war.

News article:
PARIS: France will recognize a Palestinian state if its efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at an international conference fail, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Friday. He told French diplomats that the conference will aim to bring together the two parties and their American, European and Arab partners in order “to make happen a two-state solution.” If this attempt faces a deadlock, Fabuis said, France will have to recognize a Palestinian state. France’s Socialist government supports the idea of two states, but had previously argued that it was too early for outright recognition of a Palestinian state. Fabius’ announcement comes as the Palestinians, buoyed by the successful Iran nuclear talks and the start of UN-mediated talks on Syria, have been exploring steps that could lead to a two-state solution including an international conference and a Security Council resolution that would demand an end to illegal Israeli settlement building. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, told AP: “The Palestinian leadership do welcome the announcement of foreign minister Fabius today in Paris in connection with the convening of an international conference in the next few weeks, and if things fail the recognition of the state of Palestine by France.” “I think the objective of this conference ... has to be to open the process that would lead to the end of the occupation and the preservation of the two-state solution,” he said. As for recognition, Mansour said, “France promised us some time ago that if there is no opening for a meaningful political process — a collective process that would lead to the end of occupation and independence of the state of Palestine and therefore saving the two-state solution soon — then they will recognize the state of Palestine.” He said the Palestinians wanted recognition from France “some time ago,” noting that the French parliament has unanimously recommended recognizing the state of Palestine. “And we hope that they do that,” Mansour said. “If they are tying it to the political process, that is their thinking. But eventually if you believe in a two-state solution, then recognizing the state of Palestine is an investment.” Israel’s UN Mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Friday, at UN headquarters in New York, Mansour said the nuclear talks on Iran and talks on Syria, Yemen and Libya have spurred the Palestinians to seek a broader international framework to try to settle the decades-old conflict with Israel. “This is a new culture — and why shouldn’t that spread to the Palestinian issue?,” he asked. Mansour said the Palestinians don’t accept that in 2016 “the door is closed” and nothing can be done to make progress toward a two-state solution because of the US presidential election in November. He said that’s why he has been engaging all 15 members of the Security Council, including Israel’s close ally the US, as well as the UN Secretariat and other “friends,” on their readiness to take steps, especially since virtually all members at the last Mideast meeting spoke out against Israeli settlement building. Mansour commended Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon “for characterizing correctly the settlements as illegal, illegitimate and a major obstacle to peace.” Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Ban’s remarks justify terrorism. Besides a new resolution on settlements and an international conference, Mansour said he has raised the French idea of “a support group” of other countries to promote progress toward peace, an expansion of the Quartet of Mideast mediators — the US, UN, European Union and Russia. He said adoption of a Security Council resolution would be “a signal” that the council and key world powers want to end the conflict and see an independent Palestinian state.

PARIS: France will recognize a Palestinian state if its efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at an international conference fail, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Friday. He told French diplomats that the conference will aim to bring together the two parties and their American, European and Arab partners in order “to make happen a two-state solution.” If this attempt faces a deadlock, Fabuis said, France will have to recognize a Palestinian state. France’s Socialist government supports the idea of two states, but had previously argued that it was too early for outright recognition of a Palestinian state. Fabius’ announcement comes as the Palestinians, buoyed by the successful Iran nuclear talks and the start of UN-mediated talks on Syria, have been exploring steps that could lead to a two-state solution including an international conference and a Security Council resolution that would demand an end to illegal Israeli settlement building. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, told AP: “The Palestinian leadership do welcome the announcement of foreign minister Fabius today in Paris in connection with the convening of an international conference in the next few weeks, and if things fail the recognition of the state of Palestine by France.” “I think the objective of this conference ... has to be to open the process that would lead to the end of the occupation and the preservation of the two-state solution,” he said. As for recognition, Mansour said, “France promised us some time ago that if there is no opening for a meaningful political process — a collective process that would lead to the end of occupation and independence of the state of Palestine and therefore saving the two-state solution soon — then they will recognize the state of Palestine.” He said the Palestinians wanted recognition from France “some time ago,” noting that the French parliament has unanimously recommended recognizing the state of Palestine. “And we hope that they do that,” Mansour said. “If they are tying it to the political process, that is their thinking. But eventually if you believe in a two-state solution, then recognizing the state of Palestine is an investment.” Israel’s UN Mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Friday, at UN headquarters in New York, Mansour said the nuclear talks on Iran and talks on Syria, Yemen and Libya have spurred the Palestinians to seek a broader international framework to try to settle the decades-old conflict with Israel. “This is a new culture — and why shouldn’t that spread to the Palestinian issue?,” he asked. Mansour said the Palestinians don’t accept that in 2016 “the door is closed” and nothing can be done to make progress toward a two-state solution because of the US presidential election in November. He said that’s why he has been engaging all 15 members of the Security Council, including Israel’s close ally the US, as well as the UN Secretariat and other “friends,” on their readiness to take steps, especially since virtually all members at the last Mideast meeting spoke out against Israeli settlement building. Mansour commended Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon “for characterizing correctly the settlements as illegal, illegitimate and a major obstacle to peace.” Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Ban’s remarks justify terrorism. Besides a new resolution on settlements and an international conference, Mansour said he has raised the French idea of “a support group” of other countries to promote progress toward peace, an expansion of the Quartet of Mideast mediators — the US, UN, European Union and Russia. He said adoption of a Security Council resolution would be “a signal” that the council and key world powers want to end the conflict and see an independent Palestinian state.

France warned Friday that it will recognize a Palestinian state if its imminent efforts to end the deadlock in peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians end without result. “France will engage in the coming weeks in the preparation of an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European, Arab, notably to preserve and make happen the solution of two states,” Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said. France, Fabius said, has a responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to sustain efforts to reach a two-state solution. Should efforts to breathe life into the moribund peace process fail, France would move to unilaterally recognize Palestine as a state, Fabius made clear. “And what will happen if this last-ditch attempt at reaching a negotiated solution hits a stumbling block?” he said. “In that case, we will have to live up to our responsibilities and recognize a Palestinian state.” The Palestinian Authority envoy to the UN, Riyad Mansour, said Friday that PA officials are waging a new campaign at the UN to revive peace prospects, with the starting point possibly a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements.

France says it will recognize a Palestinian state if efforts to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict come to nothing. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told a Friday gathering of foreign diplomats that Paris has a responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to keep up efforts to find a solution between Israel and Palestine. "We cannot let the two-state solution disintegrate. It is our responsibility as a UN Security Council member and a power seeking peace," Fabius said. He noted that France is planning to hold an international conference in the "coming weeks" to bring together the Israeli and Palestinian sides as well as the US and some European and Arab states. If this last attempt at finding a solution ends in a deadlock, "we need to face our responsibilities by recognizing the Palestinian state," Fabius said. Meanwhile, a senior US official said President Barack Obama's administration is aware of the French stance, adding that Washington will not speculate about the proposed conference. "The US position on this issue has been clear. We continue to believe that the preferred path to resolve this conflict is for the parties to reach an agreement on final … issues directly," the official said. People take part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, calling for the recognition of the state of Palestine and a boycott of Israel, October 10, 2015. (AFP) Reacting to the French minister’s remarks, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, welcomed the move. "There is no doubt that a French recognition of the Palestinian state will contribute to building peace and stability in the region," he said. In December 2014, both the French Assembly and Senate adopted resolutions urging Paris to recognize Palestine’s statehood. The Palestinians are seeking to create an independent state on the territories of the West Bank, East al-Quds (Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, with East al-Quds as the capital. They are also demanding that Israel withdraw from the Palestinian lands occupied in a 1967 war. The Tel Aviv regime, however, has refused to return to the 1967 borders and is unwilling to discuss the issue of al-Quds. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly voted to upgrade Palestine’s status at the UN from “non-member observer entity” to “non-member observer state” despite strong opposition from the Israeli regime and the US. Palestine's flag was hoisted for the first time at the United Nations headquarters in New York in September last year.

News article:
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announced at a conference of French diplomats in Paris on Friday that while France will work towards convening an international conference to jump-start negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, if negotiations fail, France will recognize a Palestinian state. “France will engage in the coming weeks in the preparation of an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European, Arab, notably to preserve and make happen the solution of two states,” he said. “Unfortunately, settlement construction continues. We must not let the two-state solution unravel. It is our responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council,” he added. “If this attempt to achieve a negotiated solution reaches a dead end, we will take responsibility and recognize the Palestinian state,” said Fabius. Israel rejected France’s proposal, saying there is no incentive for the Palestinian Authority (PA) to comply or to negotiate in a manner designed to end in success. “The foreign minister of France says up front that if his initiative reaches a dead end, France will recognize a Palestinian state. This statement is an incentive for the Palestinians to bring about a dead end. Negotiations cannot be held nor peace achieved in this manner,” said an Israeli official. The PA’s chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, welcomed the initiative. “We welcome the call made by France for serious international involvement towards ending the Israeli occupation that began in 1967,” Erekat said. “We will be contacting France, as well as other international partners, to advance in that direction. We have been calling upon the International community to have an international conference for Palestine based on International law and UN resolutions.” A senior official from the White House was quoted by Reuters as rejecting Fabius’ ultimatum. “We are aware of Foreign Minister Fabius’ remarks,” the US official said. “We are not going to speculate about the proposed conference. We obviously continue to engage with our partners to find a constructive way forward in terms of advancing our shared goal of a two-state solution.” “The US position on this issue has been clear. We continue to believe that the preferred path to resolve this conflict is for the parties to reach an agreement on final status issues directly,” the official said. PA Ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, told reporters last week, “We will not accept that the year 2016 is a year when we cannot do anything. We have to open some doors to keep the hope alive and keep the two-state solution alive.” He cited the international nuclear deal with Iran as a precedent that a “collective approach” is needed to solve the conflict with Israel. He also threatened that the ongoing wave of violence that has plagued Israel since September will be “much, much worse than what we see now.” Mansour recently met with the envoys from the permanent Security Council members, Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, and suggested a resolution condemning Israel’s expansion of the settlements.

France will recognise a Palestinian state if a final push that Paris plans to lead for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians fails, its foreign minister said on Friday.US-led efforts to broker peace for a two-state solution collapsed in April 2014 and since then there have been no serious efforts to resume talks.Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has repeatedly warned that letting the status quo continue risks killing off a two-state solution and playing into the hands of Islamic State militants.Last year he failed in efforts to get the United States on board to push for a UN Security Council resolution to set parameters for talks between the two sides and set a final deadline for a deal.The expansions of settlements by Israel since then have been described by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as "provocative acts" that raise questions about its commitment to a two-state solution."We cannot let the two-state solution disintegrate. It is our responsibility as a UN Security Council member and a power seeking peace," Fabius told an annual gathering of foreign diplomats.Fabius has previously called for an international support group comprising Arab states, the European Union and UN Security Council members that would essentially force the two sides to compromise.He said Paris would begin preparing in the "coming weeks" an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European and Arab.If this last attempt at finding a solution hits a wall, "well ... in this case, we need to face our responsibilities by recognising the Palestinian state", he said.A French diplomatic source said the aim was to launch the conference before the summer and that it would not be accompanied by a UN Security Council resolution, which would inevitably fail.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously criticised recent French initiatives, calling them "counter-productive".Despite anger in the US administration over Israeli settlements, there is little prospect of US President Barack Obama supporting any initiative that could upset the US Jewish lobby 10 months before an election.A US official responded cautiously to Fabius' statement."The US position on this issue has been clear. We continue to believe that the preferred path to resolve this conflict is for the parties to reach an agreement on final status issues directly," the official said.Nabil Abu Rdainah, spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said he welcomed the move."There is no doubt that a French recognition of the Palestinian state will contribute to building peace and stability in the region," he said.An Israeli official, who declined to be identified, said:"The foreign minister of France says up front that if his initiative reaches a dead end, France will recognise a Palestinian state. This statement constitutes an incentive for the Palestinians to bring about a dead end. Negotiations cannot be held nor peace achieved in this manner."Palestine has non-member observer status at the United Nations and its flag flies with those of member states at UN headquarters in New York. Sweden became the first EU member nation to recognise the Palestinian state in 2014 and has been followed by several others.Palestinians seek a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, parts of which have been occupied by Israel since a 1967 war.

News article:
Israel – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Sunday for a more “sober” approach toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in dismissing a French peace initiative as only encouraging Palestinians to shun compromise. The proposal on Friday by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius for an international peace conference was the latest sign of Western frustration over the absence of movement toward a two-state solution since the collapse of U.S.-brokered negotiations in 2014. Fabius said that if the French plan did not break the deadlock, Paris would recognize a Palestinian state. Such a step would raise concern in Israel that other European countries, also long opposed to its settlement-building in occupied territory, would follow suit. In public remarks to his cabinet, Netanyahu did not explicitly reject the notion of an international conference – an aide said Israel would examine such a request once it was received – but he made clear that reported details of the plan made it a non-starter. Netanyahu said a “threat” to recognize a Palestinian state if France’s peace efforts did not succeed constituted “an incentive to the Palestinians to come along and not compromise”. “I assess that there will be a sobering up regarding this matter,” Netanyahu added. “In any event, we will make effort so that there is a sobering up here, and our position is very clear: We are prepared to enter direct negotiation without preconditions and without dictated terms.” On Saturday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the French proposal, telling an African summit in Ethiopia that “the status quo cannot continue”. But Washington responded with caution to the French move, saying it continued to prefer that Israel and the Palestinians reach an agreement on final-status issues through direct talks. While aware the initiative may struggle to get off the ground, French officials said Paris had a responsibility to act now in the face of ongoing Israeli settlement activity and the prospect of continued diplomatic inaction as the United States focuses on a presidential election in November. And, the officials said, Netanyahu had gone a step too far in accusing U.N. Secretary of State Ban Ki-moon of giving a “tailwind to terrorism” by laying some of the blame for four months of stabbings and car rammings by Palestinians at Israel’s door. Ban angered Israel by saying last week that it is “human nature to react to occupation”. The United States, European Union – Israel’s closest allies – have also issued unusually stern criticism of Israel in recent weeks, reflecting their own frustration with the policies of Netanyahu’s right-wing government. The criticism, particularly about the settlements, where some 550,000 Jews live in around 250 communities scattered across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, has raised Palestinian hopes that world powers might finally be minded to support a U.N. resolution condemning Israel’s policy outright. WEST BANK ATTACK Since October, Palestinian attacks, partly fueled by tensions over the freeze in peace talks, have killed 26 Israelis and a U.S. citizen. In the latest incident, on Sunday, a Palestinian gunman wounded three Israelis near the West Bank settlement of Beit El and was then shot dead by soldiers, the Israeli army said. Palestinian officials said he worked as a bodyguard for a Palestinian prosecutor in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Over the past four months, Israeli forces have killed at least 152 Palestinians, 98 of them assailants according to authorities. Most the others have died in violent protests. “I don’t see anything that warrants living as long as the occupation smothers us and kills our brothers and sisters … You were first and I am following you,” the Beit El assailant, Amjad Abu Omar, wrote on Facebook. Palestinians seek a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, parts of which have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. Palestine has non-member observer status at the United Nations and its flag flies with those of member states at UN headquarters in New York. Sweden became the first EU member nation to recognize the Palestinian state in 2014. A total of 136 U.N.-member countries, mostly in Africa, Latin America and Asia, now do so.

Israel to consider French invitation to talks, but believes France made mistake by saying it will recognise Palestinian state if they fail * France says it will recognise Palestinian state if talks fail * Israel rejects French call to recognise Palestinian state * Israeli-Palestinian peace talks frozen since 2014 * Palestinian President Abbas welcomes call for conference By Ori Lewis JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Israel would consider a French invitation to peace talks with the Palestinians, but believes France has made a mistake by saying it will recognise a Palestinian state if the talks fail, an Israeli government official said on Saturday. "If and when we get an invitation to a conference, we will examine it and respond to it," the official, who declined to be named, said in a statement. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told foreign diplomats on Friday that if the conference he proposes hit a wall, "well ... in this case, we need to face our responsibilities by recognising the Palestinian state". The Israeli official dismissed the idea, saying: "Why would the Palestinians budge on even a comma in a conference if they already know that, without making progress, they will get what they want?" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking to African leaders at a summit in Ethiopia, urged them to back France's conference plan. But two Israeli cabinet ministers, both allies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel should boycott such a meeting. "Unequivocally, Israel will not attend a conference under threat," Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz told Channel 2 television, echoing a comment by Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz to Channel 1. PEACE EFFORTS STALLED U.S.-led efforts to broker a "two-state solution" collapsed in 2014, and there has been no serious attempt to revive them. Fabius has previously called for an international support group comprising Arab states, the European Union and U.N. Security Council members to put pressure on the two sides to compromise. But Netanyahu has called France's initiatives "counterproductive". A U.S. official responded cautiously to Fabius's statement. "The U.S. position on this issue has been clear. We continue to believe that the preferred path to resolve this conflict is for the parties to reach an agreement on final status issues directly," the official said. Despite anger in the U.S. administration over Israeli settlement building, there is little prospect of President Barack Obama supporting any initiative that could upset the U.S. Jewish lobby 10 months before an election. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called Israel's expansion of Jewish settlements in occupied land "provocative" and said that it raises questions about its commitment to a two-state solution. Palestine has non-member observer status at the United Nations and its flag flies with those of member states at U.N. headquarters in New York. Sweden became the first member of the European Union to recognise a Palestinian state in 2014, and several other states have followed. Palestinians seek a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, parts of which have been occupied by Israel since 1967.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday criticized France's threat to recognize a Palestinian state if plans to renew peace efforts fail, arguing that it gives Palestinians no incentive to compromise. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Friday his country was working to quickly revive plans for an international conference to work toward a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Should efforts to breathe life into the moribund peace process fail, France would move to unilaterally recognize Palestine as a state, Fabius said. "This will be an incentive for the Palestinians to come and not compromise," Netanyahu said at the start of a cabinet meeting on Sunday. "The substance of negotiations is compromise and the French initiative, as it has been reported, in effect gives the Palestinians in advance reasons not to do so." The rightwing premier said "I believe that we will see a sobering up on this issue. In any case, we will work to bring this about and our position is very clear: We are prepared to enter into direct negotiations without preconditions and without dictated conditions." Palestinian officials have welcomed the French initiative, having long argued for an international process to end the Israeli occupation and bring about the two-state solution. Peace talks collapsed in April 2014 and the situation has since deteriorated, with the prospects of fresh dialogue appearing increasingly remote. A wave of Palestinian knife, gun and car-ramming attacks erupted in October, with 25 Israelis, an American and an Eritrean killed, according to an Agence France Presse count. At the same time, 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most while carrying out attacks but others during clashes and demonstrations.

News article:
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday welcomed a French initiative aimed at resuming peace talks between Palestinians and Israel. “We welcome the new initiative announced by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius to hold an international conference to resume the peace process and resolve the Palestinian issue based on a two-state solution,” Abbas said at the 26th session of the Assembly of the African Union in Addis Ababa. Abbas stressed the need to hold an international conference devoted to the issue and activate the UN Security Council’s role vis-a-vis the Palestinian national cause. He also urged the international community to end the Israeli occupation through an abiding Security Council resolution and to provide international protection for the Palestinian people. “Peace negotiations must have a time limit and guarantee the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” he said. On Friday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announced France’s support for an international conference aimed at resuming stalled peace talks. Fabius said that, if the conference ended in failure, France would unilaterally recognize the state of Palestine. (MEMO)

News article:
A Palestinian protester hurls stones towards Israeli troops as others run for cover from tear gas during confrontations, near Israel's Ofer Prison close to the West Bank city of Ramallah, Friday (Reuters photo) OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Sunday for a more "sober" approach towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in dismissing a French peace initiative as only encouraging Palestinians to shun compromise. The proposal on Friday by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius for an international peace conference was the latest sign of Western frustration over the absence of movement towards a two-state solution since the collapse of US-brokered negotiations in 2014. Fabius said that if the French plan did not break the deadlock, Paris would recognise a Palestinian state. Such a step would raise concern in Israel that other European countries, also long opposed to its settlement-building in occupied territory, would follow suit. In public remarks to his Cabinet, Netanyahu did not explicitly reject the notion of an international conference — an aide said Israel would examine such a request once it was received — but he made clear that reported details of the plan made it a non-starter. Netanyahu said a "threat" to recognise a Palestinian state if France's peace efforts did not succeed, constituted "an incentive to the Palestinians to come along and not compromise". "I assess that there will be a sobering up regarding this matter," Netanyahu added. "In any event, we will make effort so that there is a sobering up here, and our position is very clear: We are prepared to enter direct negotiation without preconditions and without dictated terms." On Saturday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the French proposal, telling an African summit in Ethiopia that "the status quo cannot continue". But Washington responded with caution to the French move, saying it continued to prefer that Israel and the Palestinians reach an agreement on final-status issues through direct talks. US Secretary of State John Kerry called Abbas and the two discussed the French initiative and "the tense political situation in the region", WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency reported on Sunday. While aware the initiative may struggle to get off the ground, French officials said Paris had a responsibility to act now in the face of Israeli settlement activity and the prospect of continued diplomatic inaction as the United States focuses on a presidential election in November. And, the officials said, Netanyahu had gone a step too far in accusing UN Secretary of State Ban Ki-moon of giving a "tailwind to terrorism" by laying some of the blame for four months of violence. Ban angered Israel by saying last week that it is "human nature to react to occupation". The United States, European Union — Israel's closest allies — have also issued unusually stern criticism of Israel in recent weeks, reflecting their own frustration with the policies of Netanyahu's right-wing government. The criticism, particularly about the settlements, where some 550,000 Jews live in around 250 communities scattered across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, has raised Palestinian hopes that world powers might finally be minded to support a UN resolution condemning Israel's policy outright. Palestinians seek a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, parts of which have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. Palestine has non-member observer status at the United Nations and its flag flies with those of member states at UN headquarters in New York. Sweden became the first EU member nation to recognise the Palestinian state in 2014. A total of 136 UN-member countries, mostly in Africa, Latin America and Asia, now do so.

And, the officials said, Netanyahu had gone a step too far in accusing UN Secretary of State Ban Ki-moon of giving a "tailwind to terrorism" by laying some of the blame for four months of violence. Ban angered Israel by saying last week that it is "human nature to react to occupation". The United States, European Union — Israel's closest allies — have also issued unusually stern criticism of Israel in recent weeks, reflecting their own frustration with the policies of Netanyahu's right-wing government. The criticism, particularly about the settlements, where some 550,000 Jews live in around 250 communities scattered across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, has raised Palestinian hopes that world powers might finally be minded to support a UN resolution condemning Israel's policy outright. Palestinians seek a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, parts of which have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. Palestine has non-member observer status at the United Nations and its flag flies with those of member states at UN headquarters in New York. Sweden became the first EU member nation to recognise the Palestinian state in 2014. A total of 136 UN-member countries, mostly in Africa, Latin America and Asia, now do so.

News article:
February 1, 2016 “The French initiative caught us unprepared. We didn’t expect them to surprise us like that,” admitted a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s inner circle speaking on condition of anonymity in response to the diplomatic initiative announced by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on Jan. 29. The initiative itself is quite problematic, at least as far as Israel is concerned. Briefing French ambassadors a few weeks before leaving office, Fabius said that France will be taking steps over the next few weeks to convene an international conference with the participation of the United States, Europe and Arab states. The purpose would be to ensure that the two-state solution remains a viable and tenable option. As he put it, “Unfortunately, Israeli settlement construction continues. … We must not let the two-state solution unravel.” This is not the first time that France has presented an initiative to advance a two-state solution in the past few years. What distinguishes this particular effort, however, is the ultimatum accompanying the proposal: If the conference fails, France will unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. This means that the international pressure Israel has faced over the past few years, because of diplomatic stalemates stemming from Netanyahu governments, has risen to a whole new level. France is a country friendly to Israel. It is also a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and in the nuclear negotiations with Iran, it took an even tougher stance than the Americans over the timing for lifting sanctions. The obstacles that the French put in the way were, among other things, a consequence of talks that Fabius had had with Netanyahu when the prime minister was still lobbying to block the agreement, which was ultimately reached last July. When Fabius met with Netanyahu on June 21 during a visit to Israel, he expressed concern about the ongoing deadlock in the diplomatic process. At the time, Netanyahu told him that he was prepared to return to the negotiating table without preconditions and accused the Palestinians of incendiary rhetoric. It is quite possible that the prime minister believed that this would buy him more time, at least as far as France was concerned. Then Fabius popped up Jan. 29 with a new ultimatum, creating a whole new set of circumstances. In response, Israeli diplomatic sources took aim at the French foreign minister, alleging that the conference Fabius is orchestrating and the ultimatum he put on the table are direct consequences of his desire to leave a mark in the history books, before he leaves office, and that the move itself makes no sense. Thus, in the end, it will vanish just as quickly as it appeared. Even if these sources are correct, it should not be taken lightly that a country like France is issuing an explicit ultimatum over the Palestinian issue. France is not Sweden. It is a major European state, and its ultimatum culminating in unilateral support for a Palestinian state should be a warning sign for Israel. Also, even if the reason behind the French ultimatum is Fabius' personal desire to go down in history, it still represents increased pressure on Israel by one of its closest friends. Unfortunately, as the train that is unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state barrels down the tracks, Netanyahu’s government continues to keep its blinders on, responding in a confused manner, without a systematic foreign policy approach. Israel responded as follows to the surprise Fabius dropped on it: First came attacks on Fabius' motives from the inner circle of the prime minister, who also happens to be Israel's foreign minister. This was followed by reported sarcastic remarks by diplomatic sources. For example, “Will France be calling for an international conference with the Islamic State, too? It has, after all, been conducting terrorist attacks on French territory.” Another snide remark attributed to diplomatic sources in Jerusalem asserted, “Past experience teaches that this is just another one of many French initiatives that will never be implemented.” Amid these jumbled responses, Zionist Camp and Knesset opposition leader Isaac Herzog was accused of coordinating the move with the French during a visit to Paris Jan. 22. At that time, he met with Fabius, as well as with President Francois Hollande. Of course, Herzog denies the charges. Daniel Shek, a former Israeli ambassador to Paris who accompanied Herzog to meetings, said in an interview with the Israeli news site Walla that he left the meetings without any impression that the French were about to launch such an initiative. According to him, over the course of the talks, the French did say, however, that they were troubled by the absence of a diplomatic process between Israel and the Palestinians, and that consequently, they were considering a number of options. Nevertheless, he said, they did not sound like they were about to act immediately. While Israel went on the defensive and took an aggressive stance against the initiative to relaunch negotiations, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas praised the French effort. In a speech in Addis Ababa Jan. 30, Abbas promised that the Palestinians would make contact with France and other countries to advance the initiative. By doing so, he managed to present himself, yet again, as the side interested in negotiations in contrast to Israel’s stubborn rejection. In fact, Israel’s reaction to the ultimatum remained confused for some 48 hours. It took two whole days for Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Netanyahu to officially respond. As expected, he launched a bitter attack against the effort, using the photo op before the weekly Cabinet meeting Jan. 31 to say that the initiative actually offers the Palestinians incentive not to compromise. He added, “Our position is very clear: We are prepared to enter into direct negotiations without preconditions and without dictated conditions.” Although Netanyahu’s response represented the death knell for the possibility of convening a regional conference, it will not be enough to stop even Israel’s closest friends from continuing in the general direction they have been going. Israel’s allies are losing patience with the diplomatic standstill of Netanyahu’s fourth government. They will not be satisfied by the prime minister’s platitudes about his desire for negotiations. While his previous two governments — which included parties from the center and the left — made attempts to restart negotiations, the current right-wing government isn’t even willing to give the impression that it is engaged in dialogue. In this atmosphere, even if nothing comes of the French ultimatum, it is a step in a dangerous direction as far as Israel is concerned. It signals that even friendly states, like France, are no longer willing to simply keep waiting for Israel’s next move on the diplomatic front.

News article:
French foreign Minister Laurent Fabius wants to revive the talks between Israelis and Palestinians in an effort to come to an agreement regarding a two-state solution. Mr. Fabius is hoping to be able to break the current deadlock. Peace in the Middle East has become some sort of “Holy Grail” in global diplomacy. Some key players like the United States and several countries in the European Union have tried–to no avail– to play their role in bringing peace to the region. France is at it again with Mr. Fabius “ultimatum.” I would commend France for such an effort if it wasn’t so one-sided. Actually, I would venture to say that it is more than one-sided. It is not much of an ultimatum, and it is devious at best. Mr. Fabius just announced that Israel and Palestine need to work towards reviving the peace talks. It sounds like France is expecting Israelis and Palestinians to come to some sort of compromise towards a two-state solution. Yet, if Israel doesn’t flex under France’s pressure, France will de facto recognize “the State of Palestine.”It is obvious that France is biased in favor of the Palestinian since nothing is expected of them. As a matter of fact, why would they do or say anything since Israel failure to comply will get them statehood recognition from France? Is it possible that Mr. Fabius knows full well that the talks will amount to nothing if in fact they resume at all? If this is the case, then Mr. Fabius could be accused of moving forward with in tent to fully fail, only for the purpose of recognizing Palestine. This is not only biased, it is also a very coward move by France. Seriously, if you want to recognize Palestine, just say it since all your deeds already point towards it. Everything already lead us to believe that France doesn’t care much about Israel and/or the Jewish people. Currently the third largest Jewish community in the world after Israel and the United States, France is losing its Jewish community fast. Almost 16,000 Jewish people made Aliyah from France in the last 2 years because of anti-Semitism. As a matter of fact, up to 25% of French Jews have expressed their desire to move to Israel. That is between 100,000 and 125,000 people. Laurent Fabius’ decision to recognize Palestine shouldn’t surprise the Jewish community. Frankly, I am surprised that it hasn’t already happened. It was Sweden that lead the pack within the European Union in 2014, and first recognized Palestine. Diplomatic relations between Israel and Sweden have been hurt as a result. Today, Sweden continues to widen the gap by allowing more anti-Semitic acts to freely take place within their borders, such as the publishing of schoolbooks where Israel doesn’t exist. This is just one small–not so influential–country of the EU that has recognized Palestine. France, on the other hand is a major international player. If Mr. Fabius goes ahead with Palestinian recognition, many more European countries will undoubtedly follow suit. France’s hypocrisy is so painful to watch. One one hand, Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared that France without her Jews would no longer be France, and on the other hand, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius decides to slap Israel in the face with a “damn if you do/damn if you don’t” pseudo ultimatum. This would already be wrong if both Israel and the Palestinians were equally at fault. This makes the decision even more imbalanced when one consider the terror dispensed by Hamas and Fatah on a daily basis. Was Hamas asked to stop the violence? No! Was anything said about the numerous knife stabbings of the last few months? Not really! What is so tragic about France’s one-sided decision to recognize Palestine with no strings attached and no accountability, is that it isn’t going to stop the violence. On the contrary, it will most likely embolden the Palestinians and encourage them to pursue terrorism. Even though the spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said” There is no doubt that a French recognition of the Palestinian state will contribute to building peace and stability in the region”, we know that the opposite will happen. After all, if all that they are doing to Israel is rewarded with statehood, why stop now?

News article:
French foreign Minister Laurent Fabius wants to revive the talks between Israelis and Palestinians in an effort to come to an agreement regarding a two-state solution. Mr. Fabius is hoping to be able to break the current deadlock. Peace in the Middle East has become some sort of “Holy Grail” in global diplomacy. Some key players like the United States and several countries in the European Union have tried–to no avail– to play their role in bringing peace to the region. France is at it again with Mr. Fabius “ultimatum.” I would commend France for such an effort if it wasn’t so one-sided. Actually, I would venture to say that it is more than one-sided. It is not much of an ultimatum, and it is devious at best. Mr. Fabius just announced that Israel and Palestine need to work towards reviving the peace talks. It sounds like France is expecting Israelis and Palestinians to come to some sort of compromise towards a two-state solution. Yet, if Israel doesn’t flex under France’s pressure, France will de facto recognize “the State of Palestine.”It is obvious that France is biased in favor of the Palestinian since nothing is expected of them. As a matter of fact, why would they do or say anything since Israel failure to comply will get them statehood recognition from France? Is it possible that Mr. Fabius knows full well that the talks will amount to nothing if in fact they resume at all? If this is the case, then Mr. Fabius could be accused of moving forward with in tent to fully fail, only for the purpose of recognizing Palestine. This is not only biased, it is also a very coward move by France. Seriously, if you want to recognize Palestine, just say it since all your deeds already point towards it. Everything already lead us to believe that France doesn’t care much about Israel and/or the Jewish people. Currently the third largest Jewish community in the world after Israel and the United States, France is losing its Jewish community fast. Almost 16,000 Jewish people made Aliyah from France in the last 2 years because of anti-Semitism. As a matter of fact, up to 25% of French Jews have expressed their desire to move to Israel. That is between 100,000 and 125,000 people. Laurent Fabius’ decision to recognize Palestine shouldn’t surprise the Jewish community. Frankly, I am surprised that it hasn’t already happened. It was Sweden that lead the pack within the European Union in 2014, and first recognized Palestine. Diplomatic relations between Israel and Sweden have been hurt as a result. Today, Sweden continues to widen the gap by allowing more anti-Semitic acts to freely take place within their borders, such as the publishing of schoolbooks where Israel doesn’t exist. This is just one small–not so influential–country of the EU that has recognized Palestine. France, on the other hand is a major international player. If Mr. Fabius goes ahead with Palestinian recognition, many more European countries will undoubtedly follow suit. France’s hypocrisy is so painful to watch. One one hand, Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared that France without her Jews would no longer be France, and on the other hand, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius decides to slap Israel in the face with a “damn if you do/damn if you don’t” pseudo ultimatum. This would already be wrong if both Israel and the Palestinians were equally at fault. This makes the decision even more imbalanced when one consider the terror dispensed by Hamas and Fatah on a daily basis. Was Hamas asked to stop the violence? No! Was anything said about the numerous knife stabbings of the last few months? Not really! What is so tragic about France’s one-sided decision to recognize Palestine with no strings attached and no accountability, is that it isn’t going to stop the violence. On the contrary, it will most likely embolden the Palestinians and encourage them to pursue terrorism. Even though the spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said” There is no doubt that a French recognition of the Palestinian state will contribute to building peace and stability in the region”, we know that the opposite will happen. After all, if all that they are doing to Israel is rewarded with statehood, why stop now?

News article:
The same week pitiful images emerged of French President Hollande greeting the fiendish “President” Hassan Rouhani of Iran, France announced it would formally recognize a state of Palestine, should brokered negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians break down. Israel wasted no time issuing a statement about that. “The foreign minister’s statement offers incentive to the Palestinians to reach a deadlock,” an Israeli official said. “It is not possible to conduct negotiations or to achieve peace in such a manner.” This comes a few days after China’s president said essentially the same thing, and some European countries are condemning Israel’s methods in the West Bank, while the EU supports boycotts against Israeli goods. According to the Jerusalem Post, France’s foreign minister outlines the latest colossal blunder regarding diplomacy: “France will engage in the coming weeks in the preparation of an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European, Arab, notably to preserve and make happen the two-state solution.” This international conference will commence in the summer. France left no doubt as to its intentions: “If this last attempt at finding a solution hits a wall, ‘well…in this case, we need to face our responsibilities by recognizing the Palestinian state,’ [Foreign Minister Laurent] Fabius said.” Fabius used disturbing language that he is unaware contributes to a climate of anti-Semitism not seen in 70 years: “We see that unfortunately colonization continues and that recently, the Israeli prime minister went so far as to reproach the UN secretary-general for encouraging terrorism on the basis that he had reminded of colonization’s illegality and asked that it cease.” Colonization. That means they believe Israel has stolen Palestinian land. Further, the UN’s Ban Ki-moon is immoral, in his view that the “occupation” gives the Palestinians the right to commit acts of terror. This is a repulsive and grotesque worldview, and one that will eventually condemn the international community. We who study Bible prophecy and who love Israel must never take our eyes off the focus: God’s unfolding plan is rapidly unfolding, and with an international conference about to convene, to condemn Israel and seek to force a Palestinian state, the endgame approaches. Ki-Moon has called Israel’s “settlements” as “provocative acts.” Can you imagine?! These aren’t stupid people, or people ignorant of history. They know Israel has displayed remarkable restraint, and they know Israel has given back 90 percent of the territory taken in the Six-Day War! Which proves they are driven by Jew-hatred. Let’s call it what it is. Now, tragically for those of us who grew up in a great nation, the United States political establishment/regime is also a foe of the Jewish state. Further from the Jerusalem Post: “The United States, European Union and the United Nations have issued unusually stern criticism of Israel, provoking a sharp response from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and raising Palestinians’ hopes of steps against their neighbor.” In part, the international community seeks to throw Israel to the wolves, in hopes the wolves will not come for them. This is also historical folly; all barbarians eventually eat the dupes. History will shame the international community for its role in abandoning Israel. And the God of history will have His reckoning. Reprinted with author’s permission from Rapture Ready

News article:
By Stephen M. Flatow/JNS.org France’s announcement that it will try to convene an international conference to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been strongly criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But before anyone concludes that only “right-wingers” oppose such a conference, it’s worth recalling that one of the most outspoken critics of the conference idea was prominent peace process player Yitzhak Rabin. The year was 1985, and Rabin—later the co-signer of the Oslo Accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat—was Israel’s defense minister. Arab leaders had been pushing for the convening of an international peace conference. Rabin and other Israeli leaders were insisting on direct Arab-Israeli negotiations. In the United States, the Ronald Reagan administration had always supported Israel’s position. But in the spring of 1985, reports being appeared in the press suggesting that Secretary of State George Shultz was starting to warm up to the idea of an international conference. A worried Rabin flew to the U.S. for top-level discussions. Upon his arrival in the U.S., Rabin “made it clear he was concerned about Washington’s apparent weakening on the question of an international conference on the Middle East,” according to Near East Report, the weekly newsletter of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “If they are ready to make peace, let’s negotiate [directly],” Rabin was quoted as saying. “If someone wants to undermine any hope of peace, an international conference and bringing in the Soviets is the best way.” Rabin said that in his meetings with U.S. officials, “I heard about the ‘international umbrella.’” This was a phrase that some administration officials had begun using to try to sugarcoat the bitter pill. “Whenever anyone mention umbrella, it reminds me of Chamberlain and Munich,” Rabin declared. Rabin’s statements were pretty remarkable, when you think about it. He had formerly served as Israel’s ambassador in Washington, so he was keenly sensitive to the need not to anger U.S. officials. Yet he publicly leaked the fact that they were using that deceptive “international umbrella” term. Not only did he leak it, but he openly criticized it, right there in Washington. And not only did he criticize it—but he used the analogy of Chamberlain selling out to Hitler at Munich. For Rabin, of all people, to stand there in Washington and blast the U.S. administration and even invoke a Nazi analogy, was nothing less than astonishing. It really showed what a terrible threat an international conference (or “umbrella”) poses to Israel. Such a conference, if held today, would consist of a dozen or more Arab and European countries ganging up on Israel and demanding that the Israelis make unilateral concessions to the Palestinians. And given the Obama administration’s pro-Palestinian slant, one must assume that the U.S. would side with the Arabs and Europeans. The purpose of the conference would not be to achieve a genuine peace. How do we know? Because the sponsor, France, has already declared that if the conference fails to produce a Palestinian state, then the French will unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. That’s the goal—not peace, but a Palestinian state, as quickly as possible, no matter the risks to Israel. Which is why the Palestinian Authority’s Inciter in Chief, Mahmoud Abbas, is energetically supporting the conference idea. During the past year, France has suffered the worst terrorist attacks in the world since 9/11. One would think that the French would understand the folly of appeasing Islamic terrorists and why oppose creating what would be an overwhelmingly-Muslim Palestinian terrorist state. Yet just the opposite has happened. Why? Because the French are afraid. They are afraid of angering the Muslim world, afraid of more Muslim terrorism. The French believe that since they are defending themselves against Islamic State—which includes French planes bombing Muslim terrorists in Syria and the French police shutting down pro-terror mosques—they need to prove that they support Muslim causes. Supporting Palestinian statehood is France’s way of trying to appease the Muslim world. The international conference proposal is just another way of throwing Israel under the bus. No wonder the Israelis—Likud or Labor, Netanyahu or Rabin, right or left—aren’t too excited about that prospect. Stephen M. Flatow, an attorney in New Jersey, is the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered in an Iranian-sponsored Palestinian terrorist attack in 1995.

News article:
Here they go again. The French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, has announced a new initiative toward convening an international conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The history of such international gatherings, with the unique exception of the Madrid Peace Conference following the first Gulf War, has not been a good one. Most often, they become forums for bashing Israel rather than making real progress to break through on the toughest final status issues that still divide Israelis and Palestinians. This bad history is compounded, however, in this instance, by the accompanying statement by Mr. Fabius that if such a conference fails to lead to progress toward peace, France will recognize a Palestinian State. What incentive remains for the Palestinians to be forthcoming? This alone would guarantee the failure of a conference. It is always a challenge to get the Palestinians to be forthcoming toward Israel. If they know for certain that they will be rewarded for inaction, the likelihood of progress is even more remote. The French position reflects the fundamental fallacy of much of the international community in addressing the conflict. Because they see Israel as the occupier and stronger party, they see pressure on Israel as the way to move the process. In this view, there is nothing expected of the Palestinians. Make no mistake: Any hope for peace requires actions and compromises by both sides. Israel has to be forthcoming, as well as the Palestinians. The record, however, shows repeatedly that Israel can negotiate in good faith and offer solutions that give something to each side. This was true at Camp David in 2000, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered the Palestinians a state on more than 90 percent of the territory; this was true when his successor Ariel Sharon pulled Israel out of Gaza in 2005; this was true in 2008, when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered the Palestinians even more than Ehud Barak did for building a state. This was true ultimately in the recent effort of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to broker a compromise. While the Netanyahu government has been less willing to propose an initiative on peace, there is every reason to believe, based on Israel’s history of both the left and the right, that Israel will be there if Palestinians demonstrate they are prepared to truly engage in direct negotiations and willing to make important compromises for peace. Advertisement The so-called friends of the Palestinians, who blame Israel for every aspect of the conflict, do the Palestinians no favor by expecting nothing of their friends in return. A far more productive exercise for the international community, as counterintuitive as it may seem, is to direct its attention toward Palestinian behavior. The focus should be on what changes are necessary from the Palestinian side in order to bring an independent state closer to reality. This does not mean Israel is exempt from expectations that it make serious and sustained efforts to achieve peace. However, the world should expect the Palestinians to compromise as well. Such compromises that should be demanded of the Palestinians include accepting the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish State; the recognition that Palestinian refugees will be resettled in a Palestinian State, just as Jewish refugees were resettled in the Jewish State; the acknowledgement that a peace agreement between the sides will mean the end of the conflict and future demands; and the cessation of incitement campaigns against Israel and Jews and an end to celebrating to those who commit terrorist attacks. That’s a lot to ask of the Palestinians, you say, particularly because they are the occupied party. Advertisement Maybe so, but it has never been tried. And the Palestinians remain in their difficult situation. Meanwhile, Israeli initiatives have not only gone nowhere, they have often been followed by Palestinian violence. It is, however, not merely that this approach has not been tried. It is more that it speaks to the root of the problem and to understandable Israeli skepticism that the Palestinian goal has not changed at all from 1947 when it was clear that Israel’s destruction was its primary aim. However much one seeks to blame Israel for the Palestinian condition, it is Palestinians themselves, with a changed approach, who can bring about a fundamental change in the status quo. Israel’s reaction to a new Palestinian approach will undoubtedly be cautious but will be a response that could move things forward toward a two-state solution. Having said all this, Israel needs to think about taking its own initiative, not because any such move will ensure that there is peace — that can only happen when the Palestinians engage in the rethinking described above — but in order to credibly demonstrate to the world its commitment to peace. Internally, inaction has created a vacuum that is being filled by people who are against a two-state solution and who would like to erode Israel’s democratic values. Externally, boycotts and delegitimization campaigns continue to mount against Israel and one-state ideas gain momentum. An Israeli initiative — whether on halting settlements, better respecting Palestinians’ rights, or offering a plan — will not bring an end to anti-Israel activity. It will, however, weaken it significantly. It could draw away from it many well-meaning people who are frustrated with the decades-old stalemate and status quo. Responsibility for peace and for accepting at least parts of the others’ narrative lie on both parties. It is the Palestinian rethink, however, that could make all the difference. — Jonathan A.

BERLIN — France on Tuesday formally presented Israel with its plan to convene a regional peace conference to advance the two-state solution. In a Jerusalem meeting with Foreign Ministry political director Alon Ushpiz, French Ambassador Patrick Maisonnaive updated the Israeli government on Paris’ plans, though no further details have been released. “Israel supports direct negotiations with the Palestinians but opposes any attempt to predetermine the outcome of negotiations,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon said in a statement. The French push for new negotiations was announced several weeks ago, but was harshly rejected by Jerusalem after then- foreign minister Laurent Fabius said the talks’ failure would precipitate French recognition of Palestine. Officials close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently in Germany, later said they supported talks, but not the ultimatum.

However, it is Ramallah that refuses to enter peace talks, he added, citing Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki who on Monday appeared to rule out any future bilateral talks. “We will never go back and sit again in a direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations,” Malki said during a visit in Japan.

A senior official in Netanyahu’s entourage to Berlin said Monday night that Israel believes direct negotiations are the only way to solve the crisis, adding that the Palestinians know it too and are therefore refusing to sit down and talk. Netanyahu is in Berlin on Tuesday for a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel and annual government-to-government consultations. The Foreign Ministry’s Ushpiz, in his meeting with the French ambassador, also emphasized what he called Palestinian “incitement to hate and violence” and called on the international community to fight this phenomenon. Fabius’s successor, Jean-Marc Ayrault, has apparently adopted the French initiative.

News article:
Paris – France has presented Israel and the Palestinians with a proposal for an international peace conference, the sides said Tuesday, but the plan received a cool response from Israel, casting doubt on the first push for peace in nearly two years. France has for months been preparing to hold a conference that would bring together the two parties and their American, European and Arab partners in order to revive the peace process. While the Palestinians welcomed the proposal, the conference does not seem to be generating much enthusiasm from Israel or the international community, which is struggling to cope with far deadlier Middle East conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Palestinian official Ahmad Majdalani said France presented general ideas but no specifics about its plan. Still, he said the Palestinians support the initiative. He said a support group is expected to emerge from the conference which would help guide the negotiations. A French diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because the details of the proposal have not been publicized, said his country hopes to hold the conference this summer. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said France’s ambassador to Israel met a ministry official Tuesday but declined to provide details or discuss whether Israel would participate. In a statement, Nahshon reiterated Israel’s support for “direct negotiations with the Palestinians,” adding that Israel “opposes attempts to predetermine the outcome of negotiations.” Washington, which has traditionally acted as a peace broker in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has not taken a public position on the French plan and appears to be waiting to hear more details. The last peace negotiations, mediated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, collapsed in April 2014, and the period since has been fraught with conflict. A war between Gaza militants and Israel later that year killed more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis, and there is no end in sight to the current round of deadly Israeli-Palestinian violence that erupted last fall. Israel says the current violence is fueled by a Palestinian campaign of lies and incitement. The Palestinians say it springs from frustrations over nearly half a century of Israeli occupation and failed peace efforts. France has warned that if its peace efforts fail, it will recognize a Palestinian state. Israel says that would provide an incentive for the Palestinians to refuse to compromise. It insists a Palestinian state can only come about through direct negotiations.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected on Tuesday the French initiative to hold an international peace conference, saying it is "curious" and bound for failure. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter France has for months been preparing to hold a conference that would bring together the two parties and their American, European and Arab partners in order to revive the peace process. Paris has warned that if its peace efforts fail, it will recognize a Palestinian state. Speaking during a press conference in Germany with Chancellor Angela Merkel, Netanyahu said this threat "ensures that the conference will fail, because if the Palestinians know that their demand will be met a priori, and they do not need to do anything." Netanyahu and Merkel hold press conference in Berlin (Photo: Amos Ben Gershom, GPO) The proposal, Netanyahu said, does not take into consideration the complexities of the conflict. "It does not matter if this Palestinian state could become another Islamic dictatorship, one of many in the Middle East. It does not matter if it will not genuinely commit to ending the conflict and recognizing the state of the Jews. It does not matter if there will not be security arrangements that will prevent the capturing of territory that Israel would be due to evacuate by Daesh or Hamas or both of them. It does not matter," he said of the proposal. The Palestinians welcomed the proposal, but the conference does not seem to be generating much enthusiasm from Israel or the international community, which is struggling to cope with far deadlier Middle East conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Palestinian official Ahmad Majdalani said French officials had not discussed specifics about their country's plan. Still, he said the Palestinians support the initiative, and that he expected an international group would be formed after the conference to support the negotiations. Netanyahu and Merkel during the meeting in Berlin (Photo: Reuters) A French diplomat said his country hopes to hold the conference this summer. Merkel, meanwhile, struck a relatively downbeat tone on prospects for peace. "As a member of the EU, Germany is trying hard to pursue a realistic approach," she said. "Now is undeniably not the time to make a major step forward but we can achieve improvements here and there and we agreed Germany will help in terms of financial support," she said. She also said that while Israel and Germany have different views on a sanctions-ending nuclear deal between world powers including Germany and Israel's arch foe Iran, there was a limit to how friendly Germany could be with Tehran. Merkel and Netanyahu in Berlin (Photo: Reuters) "We have made it very clear that there cannot be friendly relations with Iran as long as Iran has not recognised Israel's right to exist," she said. Earlier, Germany's foreign minister said the situation in the Palestinian territories isn't sustainable in the long term. In an op-ed published ahead of the G2G meeting in the German daily Bild, Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned the near-daily street attacks by Palestinians as "despicable terror." Steinmeier stressed Germany's view that only serious negotiations aimed at a fair, two-state solution can offer hope of peace for Israel and the Palestinians. 'Israel is West's protective wall' The Israeli prime minister and the German chancellor spoke to the media after the sixth G2G (government to government) meeting in Berlin. The two governments discussed the civil war in Syria, the fight against ISIS and other Islamic terror organizations in the Middle East and in Africa, and the wave of refugees flooding into the European continent. Netanyahu thanked Merkel for Germany's cooperation with Israel, particularly in matters of defense, security and cyber security. Netanyahu's comments during press conference with Merkel (צילום: רויטרס) X He stressed Israel and Germany's shared interests in dealing with the new situation in the Middle East. "In the midst of this terrific storm and the midst of these global turmoil there's one country in the Middle East that maintains not only an advanced society, a democratic society, an innovative society, but a society that maintains the very values that you here in Europe and you in Germany hold dear," Netanyahu said. "We defend ourselves, there's no question about that, but in so doing we defend also your values. And by being where we are, in the center of the Middle East, by defending our flanks, by helping defend the neighborhood, we are preventing the addition of as many as a 100 million more people to the tragedy and turbulence of militant Islam," he continued. Merkel and Netanyahu meet in Berlin (Photo: AFP) "If Israel didn't exist, the entire Western part of the Middle East would be flooded by the forces of extremist Islam, and with this flood many additional millions would flow into Europe. Israel is the protective wall of Western civilization in the heart of the Middle East," Netanyahu concluded. The prime minister also discussed the end of the crisis between Israel and the European Union, which began when the EU decided to label products originating from Israeli settlements, and escalated further when Netanyahu decided to suspend contacts with EU officials over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "I heard from Federica Mogherini several very clear things: First, they will not surprise us with further initiatives. Second, they are against BDS and boycotts. What they have determined does not relate to the setting of the permanent borders of the State of Israel in a future agreement. And, as has been noted, we stood on (our) interests," he said. Suspension bill Netanyahu rejected criticism from President Reuven Rivlin and Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein about the suspension bill he proposed. "There is a difference between anarchy and democracy. Democracy must protect itself. We won't allow for democracy to be taken advantage of in an effort to try and bring to its collapse," Netanyahu said. Israeli and German governments (Photo: AP) The suspension bill would empower the Knesset to suspend its members if they worked toward advancing or inciting terrorism. The bill would require an amendment to one of the state's Basic Laws. Prime Minister Netanyahu proposed the legislation in the wake of a meeting Balad MKs held with family members of Palestinian terrorists and the outrage that followed. "When MKs back movements that openly call for the destruction of Israel, when they support terrorism and observe a minute of silence in memory of the murderers of children, the Knesset needs to act against them based on existing legislation," he continued. "I've spoken to the Knesset speaker and told him we were moving ahead with the legislation. I hope members of opposition parties will also join the effort to pass the bill. There are limits a democracy must maintain in order to protect itself." Netanyahu also rejected criticism of the NGO labeling bill from a German journalist who drew a comparison between human rights in Israel and human rights in Russia or Egypt. "The NGO bill is one of transparency. It's not one of censorship," the prime minister said.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected on Tuesday the French initiative to hold an international peace conference, saying it is "curious" and bound for failure. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter France has for months been preparing to hold a conference that would bring together the two parties and their American, European and Arab partners in order to revive the peace process. Paris has warned that if its peace efforts fail, it will recognize a Palestinian state. Speaking during a press conference in Germany with Chancellor Angela Merkel, Netanyahu said this threat "ensures that the conference will fail, because if the Palestinians know that their demand will be met a priori, and they do not need to do anything." Netanyahu and Merkel hold press conference in Berlin (Photo: Amos Ben Gershom, GPO) The proposal, Netanyahu said, does not take into consideration the complexities of the conflict. "It does not matter if this Palestinian state could become another Islamic dictatorship, one of many in the Middle East. It does not matter if it will not genuinely commit to ending the conflict and recognizing the state of the Jews. It does not matter if there will not be security arrangements that will prevent the capturing of territory that Israel would be due to evacuate by Daesh or Hamas or both of them. It does not matter," he said of the proposal. The Palestinians welcomed the proposal, but the conference does not seem to be generating much enthusiasm from Israel or the international community, which is struggling to cope with far deadlier Middle East conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Palestinian official Ahmad Majdalani said French officials had not discussed specifics about their country's plan. Still, he said the Palestinians support the initiative, and that he expected an international group would be formed after the conference to support the negotiations. Netanyahu and Merkel during the meeting in Berlin (Photo: Reuters) A French diplomat said his country hopes to hold the conference this summer. Merkel, meanwhile, struck a relatively downbeat tone on prospects for peace. "As a member of the EU, Germany is trying hard to pursue a realistic approach," she said. "Now is undeniably not the time to make a major step forward but we can achieve improvements here and there and we agreed Germany will help in terms of financial support," she said. She also said that while Israel and Germany have different views on a sanctions-ending nuclear deal between world powers including Germany and Israel's arch foe Iran, there was a limit to how friendly Germany could be with Tehran. Merkel and Netanyahu in Berlin (Photo: Reuters) "We have made it very clear that there cannot be friendly relations with Iran as long as Iran has not recognised Israel's right to exist," she said. Earlier, Germany's foreign minister said the situation in the Palestinian territories isn't sustainable in the long term. In an op-ed published ahead of the G2G meeting in the German daily Bild, Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned the near-daily street attacks by Palestinians as "despicable terror." Steinmeier stressed Germany's view that only serious negotiations aimed at a fair, two-state solution can offer hope of peace for Israel and the Palestinians. 'Israel is West's protective wall' The Israeli prime minister and the German chancellor spoke to the media after the sixth G2G (government to government) meeting in Berlin. The two governments discussed the civil war in Syria, the fight against ISIS and other Islamic terror organizations in the Middle East and in Africa, and the wave of refugees flooding into the European continent. Netanyahu thanked Merkel for Germany's cooperation with Israel, particularly in matters of defense, security and cyber security. Netanyahu's comments during press conference with Merkel (צילום: רויטרס) X He stressed Israel and Germany's shared interests in dealing with the new situation in the Middle East. "In the midst of this terrific storm and the midst of these global turmoil there's one country in the Middle East that maintains not only an advanced society, a democratic society, an innovative society, but a society that maintains the very values that you here in Europe and you in Germany hold dear," Netanyahu said. "We defend ourselves, there's no question about that, but in so doing we defend also your values. And by being where we are, in the center of the Middle East, by defending our flanks, by helping defend the neighborhood, we are preventing the addition of as many as a 100 million more people to the tragedy and turbulence of militant Islam," he continued. Merkel and Netanyahu meet in Berlin (Photo: AFP) "If Israel didn't exist, the entire Western part of the Middle East would be flooded by the forces of extremist Islam, and with this flood many additional millions would flow into Europe. Israel is the protective wall of Western civilization in the heart of the Middle East," Netanyahu concluded. The prime minister also discussed the end of the crisis between Israel and the European Union, which began when the EU decided to label products originating from Israeli settlements, and escalated further when Netanyahu decided to suspend contacts with EU officials over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "I heard from Federica Mogherini several very clear things: First, they will not surprise us with further initiatives. Second, they are against BDS and boycotts. What they have determined does not relate to the setting of the permanent borders of the State of Israel in a future agreement. And, as has been noted, we stood on (our) interests," he said. Suspension bill Netanyahu rejected criticism from President Reuven Rivlin and Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein about the suspension bill he proposed. "There is a difference between anarchy and democracy. Democracy must protect itself. We won't allow for democracy to be taken advantage of in an effort to try and bring to its collapse," Netanyahu said. Israeli and German governments (Photo: AP) The suspension bill would empower the Knesset to suspend its members if they worked toward advancing or inciting terrorism. The bill would require an amendment to one of the state's Basic Laws. Prime Minister Netanyahu proposed the legislation in the wake of a meeting Balad MKs held with family members of Palestinian terrorists and the outrage that followed. "When MKs back movements that openly call for the destruction of Israel, when they support terrorism and observe a minute of silence in memory of the murderers of children, the Knesset needs to act against them based on existing legislation," he continued.

JERUSALEM (JTA) — France has presented Israel and the Palestinians with a proposal for an international peace conference. The French ambassador to Israel, Patrick Maisonnave, in a meeting Tuesday morning with the head of the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s diplomatic office, Alon Ushpiz, disclosed details of the initiative to bring the two sides together for a conference that would include officials from the United States, Europe and the Arab countries. The summit would be held in the summer, according to the proposal, and would launch new negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. U.S.-brokered negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, the last diplomatic process to try to solve the conflict, broke down in April 2014. Ushpiz told the French ambassador at the meeting that Israel supports direct negotiations and opposes any attempt to predetermine the outcome of talks, Haaretz reported, citing the Foreign Ministry. Ushpiz reportedly also discussed the recent wave of Palestinian terror, as well as incitement in Palestinian media, schools and other areas. French diplomats said the Palestinian response to the French initiative was very positive, according to Haaretz. On Monday while visiting Japan, Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki said the Palestinians would never again hold direct talks with Israel. “We will never go back and sit again in a direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations,” he said at a news conference. The French initiative to convene an international peace summit was first announced in a Jan. 29 speech by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius at the Foreign Ministry in Paris. Fabius also said in the address that if the French initiative to convene a peace conference fails, then Paris would officially recognize a Palestinian state. Israel reacted strongly to the threat and called it “an incentive for the Palestinians to come and not compromise.” Fabius has since resigned from his position. His successor, Jean-Marc Ayrault, is continuing with the initiative.

News article:
They said it was over. They said it was dead, a reminder of simpler times. But as with '80s music, apparently some people are still trying to bring back the two-state solution - yes, the one Thomas Friedman eulogized just last week. This week, France officially proposed an international summit in Paris, bringing together Israeli and Palestinians, with European, American and Arab mediators, in order to end that pesky conflict thing once and for all. The aim, said the outgoing French Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius, is to “preserve and make happen the two-state solution.” And if the initiative fails, France warned, it would recognize a Palestinian state. Israel, predictably, responded to the French initiative with perplexity. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the French initiative “puzzling,” explaining that the “threat” to recognize a Palestinian state ensures the talks will fail. (The Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, welcomed the initiative). To be fair to Netanyahu, if taken at face value, the French proposal is puzzling. Israel is dealing with an unorganized wave of horizontal terrorism that seems more and more like an intifada, while Palestinians are reckoning with the realization that Israel will not grant them statehood, simply because it doesn't want to. At this time (proposing an old-fashioned peace summit sounds hopelessly out-of-touch. Neither side is in any mood to compromise, or has the political ability to push for radical solutions, and even the would-be mediators seem to have lost interest. Europe is preoccupied with the constantly-escalating refugee crisis, the Arab states are dealing with ISIS and each other, and the U.S. is in an election year and has essentially relinquished the Israeli-Palestinian issue since its last effort to broker peace talks in 2014 collapsed. The only one really interested in this summit seems to be Fabius, who during his almost four years as foreign affairs minister, has been very active on the Israeli-Palestinian front. Last year, he tried and failed to promote a resolution at the UN Security Council outlining terms for ending the conflict. None of his efforts to move the Israel-Palestinian needle in a more positive direction bore fruit. His latest initiative is probably more of a last-ditch effort before he leaves the ministry. But he isn't alone: The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, visited Israel-Palestine this week, ostensibly to promote a two-state solution that the Obama administration itself seems to have given up on. The thing is, neither the French nor Power's initiative mean that anyone believes the two-state solution is still viable. Haaretz’s Barak Ravid suggested the conference is an idea that was designed to fail, a way for Fabius to leave behind a legacy by opening the door to alternatives on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, like recognizing a Palestinian state. If that is true, then the proposed peace conference isn’t meant to be a revival of the peace process, but its funeral, and Netanyahu’s government (once again falling victim to its own myopia) has played into the hands of its ideological rivals by automatically rejecting it. Open gallery view French FM Laurent Fabius gestures as he speaks to journalists during a press conference following a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas (unseen) at the Mukataa, June 21, 2015. Credit: AFP The insistent way in which the two-state concept refuses to die and stay buried is rooted not in belief, but in the simple fact that the system is highly vested in it. There are dozens of think tanks, organizations and lobby groups dedicated to promoting a two-state solution. The American left supports a two-state solution, the European left supports a two-state solution, and the majority of the Israeli left, despite Labor leader Isaac Herzog’s strange plan to unilaterally disengage with the Palestinians, still believes there is no other way. Yet with the PA on the verge of collapse and with recent Israeli policies skirting the thin line between South African apartheid (tossing Arab MKs out of the Knesset) and Loony Tunes cartoons (like “We will surround all of the State of Israel with fences and barriers to defend ourselves against the wild beasts”), it’s difficult to imagine that many people honestly believe there’s hope for peace accord anytime soon. The allure of the two-state solution is that it’s familiar, it’s relatively simple to understand, and there’s already an infrastructure supporting it. But the Jews and the Palestinians are already in an undeclared de-facto binational state, with one side living under military occupation (or, in the case of Gaza, the world’s largest prison), and the other free to enjoy (some of) the benefits of democracy. The only way forward is equality, but achieving equality will require uneasy compromises by both parties, responsible leadership able to contain what is sure to be a tumultuous process, committed foreign allies with will and resources, and most importantly: a willingness to recognize that the current situation is simply untenable. However, in lieu of all that, I guess talking about a two-state solution is also something to do.

None of his efforts to move the Israel-Palestinian needle in a more positive direction bore fruit. His latest initiative is probably more of a last-ditch effort before he leaves the ministry. But he isn't alone: The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, visited Israel-Palestine this week, ostensibly to promote a two-state solution that the Obama administration itself seems to have given up on. The thing is, neither the French nor Power's initiative mean that anyone believes the two-state solution is still viable. Haaretz’s Barak Ravid suggested the conference is an idea that was designed to fail, a way for Fabius to leave behind a legacy by opening the door to alternatives on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, like recognizing a Palestinian state. If that is true, then the proposed peace conference isn’t meant to be a revival of the peace process, but its funeral, and Netanyahu’s government (once again falling victim to its own myopia) has played into the hands of its ideological rivals by automatically rejecting it. Open gallery view French FM Laurent Fabius gestures as he speaks to journalists during a press conference following a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas (unseen) at the Mukataa, June 21, 2015. Credit: AFP The insistent way in which the two-state concept refuses to die and stay buried is rooted not in belief, but in the simple fact that the system is highly vested in it. There are dozens of think tanks, organizations and lobby groups dedicated to promoting a two-state solution. The American left supports a two-state solution, the European left supports a two-state solution, and the majority of the Israeli left, despite Labor leader Isaac Herzog’s strange plan to unilaterally disengage with the Palestinians, still believes there is no other way. Yet with the PA on the verge of collapse and with recent Israeli policies skirting the thin line between South African apartheid (tossing Arab MKs out of the Knesset) and Loony Tunes cartoons (like “We will surround all of the State of Israel with fences and barriers to defend ourselves against the wild beasts”), it’s difficult to imagine that many people honestly believe there’s hope for peace accord anytime soon. The allure of the two-state solution is that it’s familiar, it’s relatively simple to understand, and there’s already an infrastructure supporting it. But the Jews and the Palestinians are already in an undeclared de-facto binational state, with one side living under military occupation (or, in the case of Gaza, the world’s largest prison), and the other free to enjoy (some of) the benefits of democracy. The only way forward is equality, but achieving equality will require uneasy compromises by both parties, responsible leadership able to contain what is sure to be a tumultuous process, committed foreign allies with will and resources, and most importantly: a willingness to recognize that the current situation is simply untenable. However, in lieu of all that, I guess talking about a two-state solution is also something to do.

They said it was over. They said it was dead, a reminder of simpler times. But as with '80s music, apparently some people are still trying to bring back the two-state solution - yes, the one Thomas Friedman eulogized just last week. This week, France officially proposed an international summit in Paris, bringing together Israeli and Palestinians, with European, American and Arab mediators, in order to end that pesky conflict thing once and for all. The aim, said the outgoing French Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius, is to “preserve and make happen the two-state solution.” And if the initiative fails, France warned, it would recognize a Palestinian state. Israel, predictably, responded to the French initiative with perplexity. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the French initiative “puzzling,” explaining that the “threat” to recognize a Palestinian state ensures the talks will fail. (The Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, welcomed the initiative). To be fair to Netanyahu, if taken at face value, the French proposal is puzzling. Israel is dealing with an unorganized wave of horizontal terrorism that seems more and more like an intifada, while Palestinians are reckoning with the realization that Israel will not grant them statehood, simply because it doesn't want to. At this time (proposing an old-fashioned peace summit sounds hopelessly out-of-touch. Neither side is in any mood to compromise, or has the political ability to push for radical solutions, and even the would-be mediators seem to have lost interest. Europe is preoccupied with the constantly-escalating refugee crisis, the Arab states are dealing with ISIS and each other, and the U.S. is in an election year and has essentially relinquished the Israeli-Palestinian issue since its last effort to broker peace talks in 2014 collapsed. The only one really interested in this summit seems to be Fabius, who during his almost four years as foreign affairs minister, has been very active on the Israeli-Palestinian front.

France has informed UN Security Council member states that it intends to convene an international peace conference to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts in April, with a view to brokering direct negotiations between the two sides in July, a TV report said Friday. Israel’s Channel 2 said France has submitted a document to the 15 Security Council members, detailing plans for the July conference, to include representatives from the Middle East Quartet — the US, Russian EU and UN — and several Arab states. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week dismissed the nascent French initiative as “baffling” and bound for failure. The Obama administration has indicated that it does not believe there is a possibility of achieving a peace accord in its remaining time in office, but has stressed its determination to keep alive possibilities of a two-state solution. Friday’s TV report said that Secretary of State John Kerry, who is expected in Amman, Jordan on Saturday for talks with King Abdullah, would “apparently” meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas as well. France has for months been preparing to hold a conference that would bring together the two parties and their American, European and Arab partners in order to revive the peace process. France has also warned that if its peace efforts fail, it will recognize a Palestinian state.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said France’s ambassador to Israel met a ministry official Tuesday to set out details of the planned conference. Advertisement Washington, which has traditionally acted as a peace broker in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has not taken a public position on the French plan. The last peace negotiations, mediated by Kerry, collapsed in April 2014, and the period since has been fraught with conflict. Since last fall, a wave of Palestinian terrorism and violence has seen the killings of some 30 Israelis — the latest being Tuvia Yanai Weissman, a 21-year-old off-duty IDF soldier, who was stabbed to death by two Palestinian teenagers in a West Bank supermarket on Thursday. Some 160 Palestinians have died in the same period, about three-quarters of them in the course of attacking Israelis.

The French proposal for a Palestinian-Israeli conflict resolution is the country's first since the 1967 Six-Day War, when France severed relations with Israel after then-leader Ben Gurion invaded Egypt. According to the French government, the initiative would serve to end the "American monopoly" on hosting the peace process in the region. But, says Talhami, France is now considered to be simply another Western power, along with the US, attempting to announce a major peace initiative to end the longstanding hatred between many Israelis and Palestinians. "Everybody knows that the US is really withdrawing from the Middle Eastern arena. I think we have seen it in Syria where the initiative has been seized by Russia. We have seen that the US worked through surrogates, particularly Turkey," Talhami said. The professor asserts that the Middle East is a region that the US would like to extricate itself from, following the country's many failures, both military and diplomatic. Europeans, facing an enormous immigration from Syria, are concerned that an escalation in the endemic Israel-Palestine violence will result in increased numbers of refugees seeking asylum in Europe, an era-defining event that is "baffling and upsetting for many Europeans." "I don't think for one moment that Europeans will ever act on their own, particularly on the Arab-Israeli arena. I think they probably have been consulted [by the US] and they probably were given some ideas," Talhami suggested. In December 2014 the French parliament took a non-binding vote, recognizing Palestine as an independent sovereign entity, and this contributed to the recent French peace initiative, according to the American professor.

News article:
France’s announcement that it will try to convene an international conference to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been strongly criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But before anyone concludes that only “right-wingers” oppose such a conference, it’s worth recalling that one of the most outspoken critics of the conference idea was prominent peace process player Yitzhak Rabin. The year was 1985, and Rabin—later the co-signer of the Oslo Accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat—was Israel’s defense minister. Arab leaders had been pushing for the convening of an international peace conference. Rabin and other Israeli leaders were insisting on direct Arab-Israeli negotiations. In the United States, the Ronald Reagan administration had always supported Israel’s position. But in the spring of 1985, reports appeared in the press suggesting that Secretary of State George Shultz was starting to warm up to the idea of an international conference. A worried Rabin flew to the U.S. for top-level discussions. Upon his arrival in the U.S., Rabin “made it clear he was concerned about Washington’s apparent weakening on the question of an international conference on the Middle East,” according to Near East Report, the weekly newsletter of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). “If they are ready to make peace, let’s negotiate [directly],” Rabin was quoted as saying. “If someone wants to undermine any hope of peace, an international conference and bringing in the Soviets is the best way.” Rabin said that in his meetings with U.S. officials, “I heard about the ‘international umbrella.’” This was a phrase that some administration officials had begun using to try to sugarcoat the bitter pill. “Whenever anyone mentions umbrella, it reminds me of Chamberlain and Munich,” Rabin declared. Rabin’s statements were pretty remarkable, when you think about it. He had formerly served as Israel’s ambassador in Washington, so he was keenly sensitive to the need not to anger U.S. officials. Yet he publicly leaked the fact that they were using that deceptive “international umbrella” term. Not only did he leak it, but he openly criticized it, right there in Washington. And not only did he criticize it—but he used the analogy of Chamberlain selling out to Hitler at Munich. For Rabin, of all people, to stand there in Washington and blast the U.S. administration and even invoke a Nazi analogy, was nothing less than astonishing. It really showed what a terrible threat an international conference (or “umbrella”) poses to Israel. Such a conference, if held today, would consist of a dozen or more Arab and European countries ganging up on Israel and demanding that the Israelis make unilateral concessions to the Palestinians. And given the Obama administration’s pro-Palestinian slant, one must assume that the U.S. would side with the Arabs and Europeans. The purpose of the conference would not be to achieve a genuine peace. How do we know? Because the sponsor, France, has already declared that if the conference fails to produce a Palestinian state, then the French will unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. That’s the goal—not peace, but a Palestinian state, as quickly as possible, no matter the risks to Israel. Which is why the Palestinian Authority’s Inciter in Chief, Mahmoud Abbas, is energetically supporting the conference idea. During the past year, France has suffered the worst terrorist attacks in the world since 9/11. One would think that the French would understand the folly of appeasing Islamic terrorists and why oppose creating what would be an overwhelmingly Muslim Palestinian terrorist state. Yet just the opposite has happened. Why? Because the French are afraid. They are afraid of angering the Muslim world, afraid of more Muslim terrorism. The French believe that since they are defending themselves against Islamic State—which includes French planes bombing Muslim terrorists in Syria and the French police shutting down pro-terror mosques—they need to prove that they support Muslim causes. Supporting Palestinian statehood is France’s way of trying to appease the Muslim world. The international conference proposal is just another way of throwing Israel under the bus. No wonder the Israelis—Likud or Labor, Netanyahu or Rabin, right or left—aren’t too excited about that prospect. Stephen M. Flatow, an attorney in New Jersey, is the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered in an Iranian-sponsored Palestinian terrorist attack in 1995.

Upon his arrival in the U.S., Rabin “made it clear he was concerned about Washington’s apparent weakening on the question of an international conference on the Middle East,” according to Near East Report, the weekly newsletter of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). “If they are ready to make peace, let’s negotiate [directly],” Rabin was quoted as saying. “If someone wants to undermine any hope of peace, an international conference and bringing in the Soviets is the best way.” Rabin said that in his meetings with U.S. officials, “I heard about the ‘international umbrella.’” This was a phrase that some administration officials had begun using to try to sugarcoat the bitter pill. “Whenever anyone mentions umbrella, it reminds me of Chamberlain and Munich,” Rabin declared. Rabin’s statements were pretty remarkable, when you think about it. He had formerly served as Israel’s ambassador in Washington, so he was keenly sensitive to the need not to anger U.S. officials. Yet he publicly leaked the fact that they were using that deceptive “international umbrella” term. Not only did he leak it, but he openly criticized it, right there in Washington. And not only did he criticize it—but he used the analogy of Chamberlain selling out to Hitler at Munich. For Rabin, of all people, to stand there in Washington and blast the U.S. administration and even invoke a Nazi analogy, was nothing less than astonishing. It really showed what a terrible threat an international conference (or “umbrella”) poses to Israel. Such a conference, if held today, would consist of a dozen or more Arab and European countries ganging up on Israel and demanding that the Israelis make unilateral concessions to the Palestinians. And given the Obama administration’s pro-Palestinian slant, one must assume that the U.S. would side with the Arabs and Europeans. The purpose of the conference would not be to achieve a genuine peace. How do we know? Because the sponsor, France, has already declared that if the conference fails to produce a Palestinian state, then the French will unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. That’s the goal—not peace, but a Palestinian state, as quickly as possible, no matter the risks to Israel. Which is why the Palestinian Authority’s Inciter in Chief, Mahmoud Abbas, is energetically supporting the conference idea. During the past year, France has suffered the worst terrorist attacks in the world since 9/11. One would think that the French would understand the folly of appeasing Islamic terrorists and why oppose creating what would be an overwhelmingly Muslim Palestinian terrorist state. Yet just the opposite has happened. Why? Because the French are afraid. They are afraid of angering the Muslim world, afraid of more Muslim terrorism. The French believe that since they are defending themselves against Islamic State—which includes French planes bombing Muslim terrorists in Syria and the French police shutting down pro-terror mosques—they need to prove that they support Muslim causes. Supporting Palestinian statehood is France’s way of trying to appease the Muslim world. The international conference proposal is just another way of throwing Israel under the bus. No wonder the Israelis—Likud or Labor, Netanyahu or Rabin, right or left—aren’t too excited about that prospect. Stephen M. Flatow, an attorney in New Jersey, is the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered in an Iranian-sponsored Palestinian terrorist attack in 1995.

News article:
US Secretary of State John Kerry said efforts to revive the stalled Israeli Palestinian peace process need to take a “slightly different” course than they have in the past, but stopped short Wednesday of endorsing a French proposal for a regional peace conference. Kerry also said he saw the justification behind the multilateral confab, backing comments reportedly made by an Israeli general weeks ago that rampant violence over the past month would only get worse without a diplomatic effort on the horizon. Paris’s proposal — to convene two regional peace conferences aimed at advancing the implementation of the two-state solution, and unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood should the effort fail — is “a reflection of the frustration the international community feels” about the turmoil in the region, the US top diplomat told a hearing on foreign policy at the US House of Representatives. “That why we remain committed to Israel, to Israel’s stability, committed also, however, to move the process forward and bring the parties to the table.” But Kerry said the US was still not ready to support the plan, which Israel opposes, saying Washington was “evaluating it.” “We don’t have all the details,” Kerry said about the French plan. “We’re trying to get some details of what exactly is it trying to achieve and how and what are the rules of the road would be.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Kerry asserted at the hearing that the US government opposed any unilateral steps toward Palestinian statehood. “But what’s happening now is that there’s a multilateral movement that is growing that is concerned about any number of things,” he said. Also in the hearing, Kerry quoted Israel media reports about statements made by IDF military intelligence chief Herzl Halevi, who told a Knesset committee that lack of progress with the Palestinians could lead to more violence. Advertisement “So my hope is everybody will take note of that, not as a threat but as a sense of reality about the downward spiral that comes if there isn’t an active process that is genuine, and I think that requires a slightly different formula than has existed previously,” Halevi said. Twenty-nine Israelis and three foreign nationals have been killed in a wave of Palestinian terrorism and violence since October, during which nearly 170 Palestinians have also been killed, some two-thirds of them while attacking Israelis, and the rest during clashes with troops, according to the Israeli army. Meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah at the same time as Kerry spoke, US President Barack Obama said they discussed ways to reduce the violence via a diplomatic solution. “We continue to agree that it’s important for us to provide both sides a sense of possibility and hope, and not simply despair,” Obama said. Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the French proposal during a press conference in Berlin. “The French initiative, as it has been published, is questionable,” Netanyahu said in response to a question by The Times of Israel. “There is one way to advance peace – direct negotiations without preconditions between the sides. This is the true way and I think that anyone who tries to deviate from it will not advance successful negotiations.” Advertisement Speaking on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Kerry called on both sides to take measures to signal “readiness and willingness to reduce the violence.” Netanyahu, he said, is currently preparing “some major initiatives with respect to economics” and “security relations” in the West Bank. Kerry, who met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday in Amman, said he has asked him to combat anti-Israel incitement. “We are working very directly with him with respect to any aspects of incitement. I called him on occasion him to encourage him to condemn acts of violence. He has on occasion, but not with consistency, regrettably.” But Kerry also said Israel was at least partially responsible for the moribund peace efforts. “I don’t think the situation is helped by additional settlement construction and building,” he said. “I think that we know we need to see measures taken on both sides to indicate a readiness and willingness to try to proceed forward and reduce the violence.” Joshua Davidovich and AP contributed to this report

– MOSCOW (Sputnik), Daria ChernyshovaIn late January, then French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius proposed an initiative to arrange an international conference to help resume the stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks. He stressed that Paris would be ready to recognize Palestinian statehood if the talks yielded no results. Israel has rejected the French plan. "It is certainly worthwhile to pursue, because nothing else is happening right now, the so-called peace process is stuck, the situation on the ground is not static, you have violence perpetrated by individuals against Israelis, the situation is in turmoil, so that any initiative should be welcomed. Whether the French initiative can succeed is a different question, and I think that is more problematic," Daniel Kurtzer said on the sidelines of Valdai International Discussion Club's Middle East forum in Moscow. He added the French initiative might fail even of Israel agrees to take part in the conference as the Hamas movement has also rejected the plan while the Palestinian National Authority alone does reflect the entire Palestinian spectrum of opinions.

Abbas eyes French peace initiative on Iran deal model Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope Tuesday that a French initiative to hold an international Middle East peace conference could lead to a solution like breakthrough talks on Iran's nuclear deal. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in April 2014 and since then, the situation has deteriorated, with the prospects of fresh dialogue appearing more remote than ever. A wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories since October has killed 178 Palestinians as well as 28 Israelis, an American, a Sudanese and an Eritrean, according to an AFP toll. Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas heads a meeting at his office in the West Bank city of Ramallah on March 1, 2016 ©Fadi Arouri (Pool/AFP) In January, then French foreign minister Laurent Fabius announced plans by Paris to revive plans for an international conference to "bring about the two-state solution" to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abbas said he hoped the proposal "would allow the creation of a mechanism for a political solution on the model of what happened between the Europeans, Americans and Iran". Last year Iran struck a historic deal with world powers, that agreed to provide Tehran relief from crippling sanctions in exchange for limits on its atomic programme. The July 15, 2015, accord concluded in Vienna ended 12 years of crisis and was reached after 21 months of protracted negotiations. Should efforts to breathe life into the moribund peace process fail, France would move to unilaterally recognise Palestine as a state, Fabius said in January.

News article:
A big question is looming regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict: How serious is the French initiative that aims at leading an international effort to help kick start negotiations on the two-state solution? Equally important is to figure out where exactly Washington stands on this proposal. When the Obama administration said publicly that it did not expect the two-state solution to happen under President Barack Obama’s watch, was that a hint and a wink to Europe to take a lead role? While second term US presidents are usually free of pressure from pro-Israel lobbyists, some believe that Obama spent all his political capital on the Iran nuclear deal and is not interested in dealing with a case with questionable potential for success. The French initiative of former prime minister Laurent Fabius appears to have gained (rather than lose) steam after his departure and replacement with Jean-Marc Ayrault. The difference is that Fabius had warned Israel that if it rejects the initiative, France would recognise the state of Palestine, as the French public wants, while Ayrault preferred to keep Plan B under cover rather than make it public. France, as well as the rest of the international community, would certainly be happy to participate in some sort of process that could produce tangible results in a conflict that continues to poison the region. Special American assistant for Arab-Israeli affairs, Robert Malley, had publicly said that the Palestine issue was a constant recruiter to extremism and highlighted the need to resolve it. France, with clear and strong support from the Obama administration, would be perfect to begin a process that can include all international parties as well as the two protagonists. Europe, the US, Russia and the Arab world are all needed to help Palestinians and Israelis find a solution. Many believe that a solution exists (based on the Clinton parameters, more or less), but to implement it requires strong and unbreakable political will. The only party that can stop such an international process would be the US and, specifically, various elements of the pro-Israel lobby who have tremendous power over the Republican and to a lesser degree the Democratic Party. An incentive to encourage all parties to negotiate seriously is necessary. Strengthening sanctions, as Hillary Clinton keeps reminding us, was a key element in convincing the Iranians to make serious concessions during talks. But what would make the Israelis under Netanyahu do the same? Fabius may be right when he believes that recognition of Palestine might be the stick that needs to be waived to the Israelis to encourage them to come to Paris next July determined to negotiate the two-state solution or else face Western recognition of Palestine. If France, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, takes its public’s desire and recognises Palestine formally, the UK and all of Europe would come on board, thus leaving the US as the possible only world power holding out. If the talks in the summer and fall fail, and Europe recognises Palestine, an intriguing issue might ensue. What if Clinton wins the November US elections and is privately consulted about the issue? Her head might tell her that this is the right decision to make, but the donors and lobbyists that she is beholden to might tell her otherwise. But then, Obama, who will still have a little more in office, can present a solution that Clinton can accept after inauguration as part of reality, without having to take a position either way. The US Supreme Court ruled last year on a case regarding the city of Jerusalem, deciding that the executive branch, i.e., the president, has the sole and absolute right to recognise countries. The possibility of a US parallel to the Balfour Declaration, this time in favour of the Palestinians, might seem far-fetched, but should appeal to a president of African and Muslim ancestry who cares about how history will view his presidency. For the above idea to take shape, Israel will have to show total obstructionism (which will not be hard) and France and the UK will have to have the courage to recognise Palestine and push for a Security Council resolution on which the Obama administration, if all the stars are aligned, might choose to abstain.

News article:
http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/03/french_diplomacy_on_palestine_will_run_aground.html France is proposing to lead the Middle East Quartet on a new foray into Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy. This is understandable as a part of French politics. The Palestinians, however, are setting up to be at least as difficult a client for France as they have ever been for the U.S. Of the members of the P5+1 negotiating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran last summer, France was least happy with the result and said so publicly. Since President Obama needed all five other nations to sign onto the deal, he bowed to a previously expressed French interest in midwifing a Palestinian state in exchange for French acquiescence on Iran. Aside from its traditional delusions of influence in the Middle East, France wanted to appease its large, unassimilated, unhappy, and increasingly violent Muslim population, which is predominantly Sunni with no love for Iran – and not much love for the French State. France is also part of the anti-Sunni ISIS coalition, which angers parts of the French Muslim population as well. President François Hollande perhaps thought he could buy time or space by inserting himself in the issue of Palestinian statehood – not resolving the problems that bedevil Israelis and Palestinians, but just producing a Palestinian state. Hollande & Co. will run afoul of two trends: one French, one Palestinian. First, France’s Muslim population, while increasingly anti-Jewish, is not particularly interested in a Palestinian state. Watching Israel sold down the river by a Western country may have some visceral appeal, but it will not let Hollande off the hook for France’s perceived sins against its Muslim population or the Sunni Muslim cause. Second, France is offering the Palestinian Authority nothing the Palestinians have not previously rejected – and will reject this time as well for the same reasons. Three firm offers of Palestinian statehood have been tried: the U.N. Partition Plan of 1947 that called for “a Palestinian Arab State and a Palestinian Jewish State” (Jews were called Palestinians before the establishment of Israel made them Israelis); the Olmert offer of 2000, made at Camp David with the active assistance and blessing of President Clinton, including 97% of the West Bank, free passage to Gaza (this was before the Hamas-Fatah civil war in 2007), and rights in Jerusalem; and the 2006 Barak offer. The Arab states rejected the first, Arafat the second, and Abbas the third. The Palestinians have always had three bottom lines: Establishment of an internationally recognized state without permanent borders. This leaves open the possibility of future claims against Israeli territory. The right of return by the original 1948-49 refugees and their descendants to places inside the “Green Line” from which they or their ancestors claim to have originated. Jerusalem as the internationally recognized capital of Palestine. Simply stating the parameters makes it clear that any true negotiation is unlikely to succeed – not that France was offering one, but the parties always paid lip service to the idea of a negotiated settlement. The Palestinians have now decided that even that is risky. Palestinian Authority foreign minister Riyad al-Malki told a press conference in Japan, “We will never go back and sit again in a direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.” Then, as Palestinians often do, he almost told the truth about why. He warned that radical forces in the West Bank are growing and threatening “moderate” Palestinian rule. “If Daesh takes advantage of a lack of brokers … then of course they might come and try to fill [the vacuum]. This is very dangerous.” Hamas, the main enemy of Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, has indeed made inroads in the West Bank, and ISIS-supporters are found there as well. P.A. corruption and repression have produced a citizenry that is poor, angry, and fearful – fertile ground for radicals. And while the P.A. blames Israel, 81 percent of Palestinians in a poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research believe that the P.A. is corrupt. Al Shabaka, which calls itself “The Palestinian Policy Network,” noted in a 2015 study, “Palestinians have been increasingly frustrated with corruption in the PA over the last decade, leading to street protests in 2004, and the election of Hamas in 2006. Dealing with corruption effectively would require structural change of the political system, including an effective legislature, an independent judiciary, civil society monitoring, and a reformed international aid system.” The same report notes: Employment in the PA public sector does not necessarily imply job security: If employees express criticism of PA policies, they are likely to be forced into early retirement, denied salary payments, or arbitrarily removed from their posts. They may also face a series of punitive measures, including denial of promotion or transfer to distant areas. Just this week, the P.A. set up security checkpoints – you know, like the hated Israeli checkpoints? But not for security – the P.A. was attempting to prevent Palestinian teachers from demonstrating for payment of their salaries. The P.A. threatened the bus companies that drove the teachers to Ramallah for the demonstration. In the past year, the P.A. has arrested more than 50 Palestinians for social media activity. It is in hopes of channeling public anger that the P.A. provides direct and indirect support to the stabbing campaign against Jews. But at the same time, the P.A. continues to coordinate with the IDF in the territories so that Israel can continue to arrest Hamas and ISIS operatives – which serves both PA and Israeli interests – as well as arresting Palestinians organizing and supporting terror against Israel. Palestinians claim that security coordination is forced upon them and would cease if the “occupation” ended. This is a necessary double game for Abbas. Palestinian security forces make up 44% of total PA employees and use 30-35% of its total budget (much of which is supplied by the U.S.), but without the support and coordination of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories, Abbas would find it impossible to stay in power. His fear isn’t that Israel won’t give enough at the negotiating table; it is that Israel might concede so much that France might force him into a deal that will remove IDF protection from his corrupt regime. There is little chance that France could succeed, but enough of one that Abbas won’t risk sitting in the room with Israel.

The so-called Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in April 2014 and since then, the situation has deteriorated, with the prospects of fresh dialogue appearing more remote than ever.Twenty-eight Israelis and three foreign nationals and over 170 Palestinians have been killed in fresh clashes between the occupying forces of Zionist regime and Palestinians since October.In January, then French foreign minister Laurent Fabius announced plans by Paris to revive plans for an international conference to “bring about the two-state solution” to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.According to the Agence France-Presse (AFP), Abbas said he hoped the proposal “would allow the creation of a mechanism for a political solution on the model of what happened between the Europeans, Americans and Iran.”Last year, Iran struck a deal with world powers that agreed to provide Tehran relief from sanctions in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.The July 15, 2015, accord concluded in Vienna ended 12 years of crisis and was reached after 21 months of protracted negotiations.Zionist regime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed France’s proposal, describing it as “mystifying” and counterproductive, arguing that it gives Palestinians no incentive to compromise.9191**2329

News article:
(MENAFN- The Journal Of Turkish Weekly) >Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has reaffirmed his support for a French proposal to convene an international conference aimed at resuming stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. Abbas' remarks came at a meeting of the Fatah movement's Revolutionary Council held in Ramallah on Wednesday night. "We consider [Israeli] settlement construction to be illegal and ask the [UN] Security Council to investigate it and issue a decision on it" Abbas said at the meeting. In a reference to the 1993 Oslo Accords Abbas warned that the Palestinian Authority (PA) -- of which he is the head -- would not comply with past agreements with Israel if the latter failed to respect them. He went on to say that the Palestinians sought a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Abbas said that the PA’s next step would depend on Israel’s response to its demands. Peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators collapsed in April 2014 over Israel's refusal to release a group of Palestinian political prisoners despite earlier pledges to do so. Since then all attempts to revive negotiations between the two sides have failed due mainly to Israel's insistence on continuing settlement construction on occupied territories. Palestinian negotiators insist that Israeli settlement building on Arab land must stop before a comprehensive peace agreement can be reached. On Wednesday evening Abbas also stressed the need for reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas noting that the two factions had held several meeting over the past month. "We are committed to achieving Palestinian reconciliation as soon as possible" he said. He went on to note that a Fatah delegation would soon leave for another round of meetings in Doha with Hamas representatives. By Anees Bargouthi

News article:
(MENAFN- The Journal Of Turkish Weekly) >Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has reaffirmed his support for a French proposal to convene an international conference aimed at resuming stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. Abbas' remarks came at a meeting of the Fatah movement's Revolutionary Council held in Ramallah on Wednesday night. "We consider [Israeli] settlement construction to be illegal and ask the [UN] Security Council to investigate it and issue a decision on it" Abbas said at the meeting. In a reference to the 1993 Oslo Accords Abbas warned that the Palestinian Authority (PA) -- of which he is the head -- would not comply with past agreements with Israel if the latter failed to respect them. He went on to say that the Palestinians sought a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Abbas said that the PA’s next step would depend on Israel’s response to its demands. Peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators collapsed in April 2014 over Israel's refusal to release a group of Palestinian political prisoners despite earlier pledges to do so. Since then all attempts to revive negotiations between the two sides have failed due mainly to Israel's insistence on continuing settlement construction on occupied territories. Palestinian negotiators insist that Israeli settlement building on Arab land must stop before a comprehensive peace agreement can be reached. On Wednesday evening Abbas also stressed the need for reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas noting that the two factions had held several meeting over the past month. "We are committed to achieving Palestinian reconciliation as soon as possible" he said. He went on to note that a Fatah delegation would soon leave for another round of meetings in Doha with Hamas representatives. By Anees Bargouthi

France’s special envoy for its peace initiative to renew Israeli-Palestinian peace talks will meet this week with officials in Ramallah and Tel Aviv, the Palestinian envoy to France said Saturday. Ambassador Salman al-Harfi confirmed to the Palestinian Ma’an news outlet that Pierre Vimont will meet with Israeli and Palestinian officials to discuss preparations for an international peace summit to renew stalled peace talks. The summit is scheduled to take place in June or July, despite Israeli complaints that peace negotiations should take the form of direct talks. Before visiting the region, Vimont will attend the The 5th Extraordinary Islamic Summit on Palestine and Al-Quds (Jerusalem), which begins in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Sunday. The summit, entitled “Uniting for a Just and Lasting Solution,” will also be attended by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

The April meeting is for an international support group composed of world powers US, Russia, China, France and the UK, as well the “Arab quartet,” Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt. Additionally, Brazil, Japan, Germany, South Africa and India will also attend the support meeting. Neither Israeli or Palestinian officials will attend the meeting in April. Harfi stressed that Israel had not yet confirmed its official stance on the conference, but that high international support will see the initiative move forward regardless of Jerusalem’s position, according to Ma’an. Advertisement The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to a request for a comment. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had earlier dismissed France’s proposal. He said an ultimatum issued by Paris that it would recognize a Palestinian state if talks fail was “mystifying” and counterproductive, arguing that it gave Palestinians no incentive to compromise. Jerusalem has also maintained that direct talks are needed to reach an agreement. In January, then French foreign minister Laurent Fabius announced plans by Paris for an international conference to “bring about the two-state solution” to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hamas rejected the French proposal last Wednesday. “The initiative is a bid to stop the ongoing Jerusalem Intifada and cancel the Palestinian rights in Jerusalem and the right of return,” said a statement from the lslamist group, which rules the Gaza Strip. Hamas’s statement followed remarks by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas last Tuesday, who voiced hope that the French initiative could lead to a solution reminiscent of the breakthrough talks on Iran’s nuclear deal.

News article:
France will not “automatically” recognize a Palestinian state if a Paris initiative to host an international conference to revive Israel-Palestinian peace talks fails, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Wednesday. His predecessor, Laurent Fabius, who proposed such a conference in January stirred Israeli anger by saying France would “recognize a Palestinian state” if the effort failed. “There is never anything automatic. France will present its initiative to its partners. It will be the first step, there is no pre-requisite,” Ayrault said when asked at a press conference in Cairo about Fabius’s remarks. Ayrault is on a two-day visit to Egypt to discuss the French initiative for hosting an international conference “by this summer” to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which collapsed in April 2014. “What we want, and that is our commitment, is to resume the negotiation process,” he said. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had rejected Fabius’s ultimatum as counterproductive, arguing that the confab was doomed to fail since the Palestinians were being told they would gain recognition if no results were achieved. Still, Jerusalem has maintained that it will study the framework for the conference when official invitations are sent out and will carefully weigh its response. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms On Wednesday, neither the Prime Minister’s Office nor the Foreign Ministry had an immediate comment on Ayrault’s change of course. “The French initiative, as it has been published, is questionable,” Netanyahu said last month at a press conference in Berlin. “It says: We will hold an international conference but if you do not succeed we are already predetermining the result – we will recognize a Palestinian state. It does not matter if this state could become another Islamic dictatorship… It does not matter if it will not genuinely commit to ending the conflict and recognizing the state of the Jews… It does not matter. We will determine that there is a state, without any conditions regarding recognition, security or anything.” Such an approach, Netanyahu said bitterly, “ensures that this conference will fail because if the Palestinians know that their demand will be met a priori, and they do not need to do anything, then there is certainly an internal contradiction here, because they will not do anything.” Advertisement The only way to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace is via direct negotiations without preconditions between the sides, he argued. “This is the true way and I think that anyone who tries to deviate from it will not advance successful negotiations,” he said. Palestinian Authority Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has expressed support for the idea of a peace conference in Paris. Earlier this week during a meeting with the secretary-general of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Iyad Ameen Madani, he called the planned confab would be “an all-inclusive international mechanism involving many countries.” The Obama Administration this week denied a Wall Street Journal report that it was planning a new peace initiative, and stressed that solutions must come through direct negotiations between the sides. “Our position has been clear,” a White House official said. “We believe a two-state solution is absolutely vital for peace between Israelis and Palestinians and will only come through negotiations.” The official said the Obama administration would continue to urge both sides to return to the table and not to act unilaterally. “We continue to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to take affirmative steps which we think are important to stop the violence, improve conditions on the ground, and restore confidence in the two-state solution,” the official said in a statement. “We also continue to engage with our partners to find a constructive way forward in terms of advancing our shared goal of a two-state solution.” JTA contributed to this report.

Iran Seeks to Buy New Russian Weapons - Adviser to Supreme Leader Sputnik News 17:05 04.02.2016(updated 17:43 04.02.2016) Iran wishes to acquire new Russian weapons, and the defense cooperation between the two countries is developing, adviser to Iran's supreme leader Ali Akbar Velayati said Thursday. MOSCOW (Sputnik) – Iran wishes to acquire new Russian weapons, and the defense cooperation between the two countries is developing, adviser to Iran's supreme leader Ali Akbar Velayati said Thursday. 'As far as I am aware, the defense cooperation between our countries is developing. Iran wishes to purchase additional volumes [of weapons] from Russia, and the Russian government also has a desire to positively respond to such requests. Considering this, the sides should be able to reach an understanding,' Velayati told reporters. On Monday, Velayati arrived in Russia for a four-day visit to discuss bilateral relations and regional issues with Russian senior officials. He has met, among other officials, with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, with whom he has also discussed military-technical cooperation between the two countries, particularly with an aim to ensure regional and international security. Last month, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Dehghan, signed an intergovernmental agreement on long-term military cooperation in Tehran. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Tehran will buy more Russian-made military hardware, an advisor to Iran’s supreme leader has said during a three-day visit to Moscow. Defense ties, among other issues, were at the heart of discussions during the trip. “Iran is willing to buy additional amounts [of weapons] from Russia, and the Russian government wants to positively respond to such requests as well,” said Ali Akbar Velayati, adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as quoted by RIA Novosti. Velayati arrived in Russia on February 1 to discuss strategic cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. He is believed to be one of the most important figures in the Iranian establishment, given his decades-long experience as Iran’s foreign minister and two presidential campaigns. It is still unclear which weapons systems could be purchased by the Iranian military, as certain sanctions, including on military procurement, remain in place under a UN Security Council resolution adopted in July 2015. In November, Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan announced that Tehran will receive Russian S-300 air defense systems by the end of the Iranian year, which is March 20, 2016. The contract to supply the S-300s to Iran was signed in 2007, but three years later the deal was put on hold by Moscow. Tehran hit back, filing a nearly-$4 billion lawsuit against Russian arms dealer Rosoboronexport with a Geneva arbitration tribunal. Most of the anti-Iranian economic and financial sanctions were lifted in January as part of the so-called nuclear deal. But Iran is only allowed to purchase conventional arms such as tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, large-caliber artillery systems, combat aircraft and naval vessels – and only if the UN Security Council unanimously approves such deals. Nevertheless, on January 17 the US Treasury imposed a new set of sanctions on 11 companies and individuals which it claimed had helped to supply Iran’s ballistic missile program. The Obama administration delayed enforcing the sanctions for more than two weeks while negotiations to release two US prisoners being held in Iran were taking place, according to Reuters. Previously, senior officials from Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) – Russia’s flagship military plant and the world’s largest tank manufacturer – said it could take part in various arms deals with Iran. Alexey Zharich, deputy director general of UVZ, told RIA Novosti on Wednesday the company is ready to launch licensed production of T-90S main battle tanks in Iran, if the remaining sanctions are lifted. “We always said we are ready to work with Iran,” he added. BREAKING VIDEO: Iran state TV footage of moment of arresting 2 US boats & personnel pic.twitter.com/Ts4dbCBLyZ — Sobhan Hassanvand (@Hassanvand) January 13, 2016 With its 425,000-strong armed forces, Iran is considered one of the most powerful military actors in the region. It currently operates various weapons systems, including dozens of British-made Chieftain and US-made M-60 Patton tanks, apparently supplied to Iran before the 1979 revolution. A remarkable share of the Iranian military’s inventory is made up by Soviet- and Russian-built systems. Iran has been known to take successful steps to survive military sanctions by domestically developing its own modern arms, including Zulfiqar battle tanks, Shahab-3 ballistic missiles, Moudge-class frigates and various other boats, submarines, drones, military vehicles and fighter planes.

Topic: Security Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: Russian MilitaryIranian MilitaryTankT-90SDefenseTechnologySecurity The addition of the T-90 would greatly enhance Iran’s conventional forces. Russia’s Uralvagonzavod is willing to allow Iran to license-build the T-90S main battle tank domestically once restrictions are lifted on technical cooperation with Tehran. The Russian company is also willing to help Iran modernize its existing T-72 fleet. Tehran, however, seems to have decided that it can build its own tanks without Moscow’s help. The addition of the T-90 would greatly enhance Iran’s conventional forces, which are largely equipped with antiquated Russian and Chinese designs interspersed with some newer Soviet models. Though it is ultimately a highly modernized version of the Soviet-era T-72, the T-90 series tanks are, nonetheless, formidable fighting machines—according to U.S. Army officials—that are more capable than anything Tehran currently possesses. The fact that Iran has decided to build its own “indigenous” tanks rather than purchase the sophisticated T-90 (for now) can really only be seen as a positive development for the United States and its regional allies. “If restrictions on military-technical cooperation with Iran are lifted, the corporation together with Rosoboronexport is ready to continue cooperation, in particular, on the licensed production of the T-90S tanks, modernization of the T-72S tanks and their production capacities,” Uralvagonzavod’s deputy director general Alexey Zharich recently told the TASS news agency . While Tehran had been interested in purchasing the T-90, in recent days the country has backtracked. Instead, Iran says that it can develop its own main battle tanks that are as capable as the T-90. “We were once interested in buying the Russian tanks. But since we can manufacture similar models within the country and we plan to do so in the near future, the deal is now off,” Iranian army ground forces commander Brig. Gen. Ahmad Reza Pourdastan told the semi-official Fars News Agency. The two most capable tanks in Iran’s inventory are the T-72S, of which it has 480 examples, and the domestically manufactured Zulfiqar, of which it has 150. The latter is a modified copy of the U.S.-built M60 Patton. There is no evidence to suggest that Iran has the technological wherewithal to build a machine in the same league as the T-90—or for that matter—a vehicle that could hope to engage a M1A2 Abrams or Leopard II on an equal footing. Iran often boasts about the prowess of its military industrial complex. But more often than not, Tehran’s defense projects turn out to be poorly constructed and ineffective—like the so-called Qaher F-313 'stealth' fighter that was unveiled in 2013. After all, it’s equally likely that Tehran abandoned its efforts to purchase the T-90 due financial reasons rather than any technical breakthrough on its part.

Iran, Russia Likely to Sign Su-30 Warplane Deal Next Week: Source Posted on by sukhoi-30mki TEHRAN (Tasnim) â Iranâs Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan will probably sign a contract in his forthcoming trip to Moscow on Tehranâs purchase of Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, a Russian source announced Thursday. Sputnik quoted a source in Iranâs Defense Ministry as saying on Thursday that General Dehqan will go to Moscow on February 16 to discuss Russiaâs delivery of S-300 air defense missile system to Iran as well as purchase of Su-30 Flanker multirole jet fighters. âMinister Dehqan is taking a number of the Defense Ministryâs representatives to the Russian capital to meet with their Russian colleagues and other highly-ranked officials,â the source said. During the upcoming meeting, the minister plans to discuss Iranâs need for the Su-30 and sign a contract on its delivery, the report added. âThe last stages will be discussed of delivering Iran the S-300 complex, the first part of which should arrive before the end of next month, and the second by the end of June. Minister Dehqan will also discuss the delivery of Su-30 airplanes because the Defense Ministry believes the Iranian Air Force needs this type of plane. Weâve moved far in these discussions of purchases and I think that during the upcoming visit a contract will be signed,â the source told Sputnik. Iran and Russia in recent years have boosted their cooperation in various defense fields including the supply of military equipment. In the most recent case, Russia started delivering the S-300 missile defense system to Iran in late 2015. Back in October last year, General Dehqan highlighted the significance of defense collaborations between Tehran and Moscow, especially under the current circumstances in the region. âThe current situation necessitates that Iran and Russia, through the political wills of the two countriesâ leaders, develop their cooperation in political, economic, and defense fields,â General Dehqan said at the time.

The expert further said, “Iran sees Russia as a strategic partner for many years to come. Tehran has expressed interest in the purchase of automated air defense systems and missile defense. Iranian submarines are also in need of modernization. In order to solve this problem, specialized modern weapons need to be purchased and Russia has something to offer,” the expert told Sputnik Persia. Abshenas mentioned that Iran is interested in purchasing modern Russian Su-30, Su-35 aircraft. The purchase of Russian weapons, such as the anti-missile defense system S-400 and its upgraded models are also probably going to be a part of the forthcoming discussion. The ordnances such as the Russian tanks T-90 and T-95 may also be highlighted during the talks. “In general, it should be noted that Iran is willing to offer Russia cooperation in the military-industrial complex to jointly create tanks, missile weapons and marine navigation systems. Therefore, we will wait to see what agreements Dehgan will reach during his visit to his Russian colleagues. It can be assumed that as a result a number of contracts will be signed.” It should be recalled that in April 2015, the head of the Defense Ministry of Iran also paid an official visit to Moscow and took part in the International Conference on Security. As part of that visit the parties discussed the exact contract for the supply of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems to Iran.

Tehran has shown interest in the deliveries of Russian S-400 air defense systems but the two countries are not currently holding any negotiations on the topic, Russian Special Presidential Envoy on Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov said, Sputnik International news agency reported. "No, there are no talks being held on the S-400," Kabulov said. "The Iranians have noted that they would principally be happy [to receive them], but there haven't been any negotiations." A number of news outlets earlier cited Hossein Dehghan as saying that Tehran could purchase the S-400s from Moscow if necessary and that the issue was apparently being discussed. Kabulov also said that Russia will soon deliver S-300 air defense systems to Iran. "Deliveries will be made soon," Kabulov said. Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan earlier said that the first shipment of Russian S-300s would be made in the first quarter of 2016. Earlier, Iran ordered from Russia five S-300 divisions worth over $800 million. However, in autumn of 2010, the then President Dmitry Medvedev banned transfer of the equipment to Tehran. The contract was terminated, the prepayment was returned to Iran, but as the contract was not observed Iran filed a suit to the Geneva arbitration court claiming almost $4 billion. In spring 2015, Russia's President Vladimir Putin lifted the ban on supplies of the S-300 systems to Iran.

Moscow to deliver S-300 missile system to Iran in 'nearest time' Iran Press TV Mon Feb 15, 2016 10:44AM Russia will deliver the S-300 surface-to-air missile defense systems to Iran in "the nearest time" as part of a long-running contract between Tehran and Moscow, the country's Foreign Ministry says. "Deliveries will be made soon," Zamir Kabulov of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Asia department told RIA Novosti news agency on Monday. Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan, who arrived in Moscow on Monday, had said on February 10 that Tehran will take delivery of the first batch of the S-300 missile defense systems in the first quarter of 2016, adding that the Islamic Republic will receive the second batch by the first half of 2017. Kabulov also said the Islamic Republic has also shown interest in buying the more advanced S-400 missile systems, but no talks have been held on the matter. "There are no talks being held on the S-400. The Iranians have noted that they would principally be happy [to receive them], but there haven't been any negotiations," he said. Dehqan's trip to Moscow comes at the official invitation of his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu. The officials are scheduled to discuss the latest mutual, regional and international developments, as well as enhanced defense, military and technical cooperation between Tehran and Moscow. Russia committed to delivering the systems to Iran under a USD-800-million deal in 2007. Moscow, however, refused to deliver the systems to Tehran in 2010 under the pretext that the agreement was covered by the fourth round of the United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. The sanctions barred hi-tech weapons sales to Tehran. Following Moscow's refusal to deliver the systems, Iran filed a complaint against the relevant Russian arms firm with the International Court of Arbitration in Geneva. Tehran also developed its domestically-built Bavar-373 air defense system, which was successfully test-fired in August 2014. In April last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted a previous ban on the delivery of S-300 to Iran. In November 2015, Russia signed a new contract to supply Iran with the systems by the end of that year for the first time since the 2010 freeze on supplies under the UN Security Council resolutions. The development came after Iran and the P5+1 states – Russia, China, France, Britain, the US and Germany – reached a landmark agreement, dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), on Tehran's nuclear program in July last year. Under the JCPOA, limits are put on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for, among other things, the removal of all nuclear-related economic and financial bans against the Islamic Republic.

News article:
In the prospect of intensifying military cooperation between Russia and Iran, Hossein Dehghan, Iranian Minister of Defense arrived to Moscow and instigated deliberations with his peer Sergey Shoygu. Dehghan is also expected to later meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moreover, the agreement on Russia delivering the S-300 (missile system) to Iran is in accord on execution, after the deal being previously put to rest, an approximate 10 years, due to the economic and military sanctions that were imposed on Iran. Dehghan visiting Russia aims to acquire artillery bulk worth a near 8 billion dollars in planes and military equipment. He will also be conferring several regional and international suits, like the Syrian crisis and the relationship with Gulf countries especially Saudi Arabia, Military-Technical Cooperation (MTC) sources reported. Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, published that Tehran has provided Moscow a list on arms and equipment the Iranian army hopes on picking up. The list is the same one discussed with the Russian Ministry of Defense, the government, and kremlin. Iran also seems to want to get its hands on the advanced anti-aircraft weapon system S-400, the latest upgrade by the Almaz Central Design Bureau. It is the same missile system Russia has dispatched near Turkish borders north of Syrian Lattakia port city, after the downing of the Russian Sukhoi Su-24 fighter-jet near borders on Nov. 24. Iranian administration potentially looks forward to signing a deal on Sukhoi Su-30 advanced fighter-jets made by Sukhoi Aviation Corporation, or the regulation of a local production of fighter-jets in Iran under Russian licensing, Interfax reported. Sources stated that Russian-Iranian consultations also involve the possibility of importing K-300P Bastion-P Russian mobile coastal defense missile system equipped with Yakhont SS-N-26 anti-ship cruise missile. Iran, moreover, is looking into the chances of bringing in Yak-130 subsonic two-seat advanced jet trainer/light attack aircraft, Mil Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters, Russian made frigates, diesel-electric attack submarine, and many other war artillery. Observers in Moscow criticized Tehran’s requisition for being high on expenses and faced with several obstacles. One of the reasons that could stand in the way of Russia realizing each item on that list or some of them is because of the unavailability Iranian liquid assets that are sufficient to finance the deal through a Moscow-provided loan, which in the meantime makes it seem a far-reach possibility. One other reason would be the grave crises Russia now bares due to the sanctions imposed on it since the rupture of the Ukrainian crisis in 2014. Furthermore, the U.N. Security Council has yet not lifted sanctions on sending weapons and military equipment to Iran, which they have stated to remain imposed and according to resolution until year-2020. Moscow already made official statements broadcasted by RIA Novosti, Russia’s international news agency, on Russian interest in settling disputes between Saudi Arabia and Iran, especially in a time when the hitch on oil prices must be solved in a conjoined manner. Zamir Kabulov, Putin’s special envoy for Afghanistan, said that Tehran’s response to the Russian proposal on mediating between Iran and Saudi Arabia was positive. The proposal holds, and Iranian reaction is positive, Kabulov confirmed. Saudi Arabia has yet not responded to the proposition because of compiled tension and discontent present between the two countries’ relationship, according to Kabulov. RIA Novosti pointed out that Russian diplomat Kabulov did not confirm questions on the possibility of the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei visiting Russia. Controversially he revealed that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov might be paying Iran a visit this year, however, the date of the visit is not set. Despite that Iranian Deputy FM Ibrahim Rahim Bour had before said that Lavrov is expected to visit Iran in the first half of 2016.

News article:
Iranian military officials announced Monday that they plan to purchase $8 billion worth of arms from Russia, the latest sign of growing economic and military ties between the two countries in the wake of the nuclear deal signed last year. Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan and other senior defense officials have spent the last two days in Moscow, presenting to the Russians what the state-run Fars News Agency called a “shopping list” of military hardware requests. Dehghan told Iranian reporters before he left that Iran needs to “seriously focus on its air force and fighter jets.” The Russian state-funded news site Sputnik reported that Iran has requested Russia’s new Sukhoi Su-30SM fighter jet, which is used for air-to-air and air-to-surface combat. Iran also requested light attack aircraft and transport helicopters, as well as mobile coastal defense missile systems, frigates and submarines. The Russian business daily Kommersant reported that Iran was also considering asking for Russia’s help in repairing its largely Russian-made fleet of planes and submarines. The nuclear deal led to the cancellation of a UN Security Council arms embargo on Iran, though bans on selling offensive missile systems remain in place. The Russian news agency Interfax reported that Iran’s new shopping list included Russia’s S-400 anti-aircraft defensive missile system. Iran and Russia have talked for years about purchasing the S-300 system, its predecessor, despite American objections that the missiles could be used offensively. Russia has already installed the S-400 system at its base in Syria. Since the nuclear deal was signed, Tehran and Moscow have repeatedly made military overtures. The two countries held joint naval exercises in the Caspian Sea in August. Qassem Suleimani, the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Iran’s elite extraterritorial militia, has repeatedly been seen in Moscow despite being subject to an international travel ban. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu held talks with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran last month. Russia has also reportedly been supplying the Iran-backed terror organization Hezbollah with advanced weaponry, including laser-guided rockets and anti-tank weapons. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew claimed last April that “Iran is expected to use new revenues [from the lifting of sanctions] chiefly to address those needs, including by shoring up its budget, building infrastructure, maintaining the stability of the rial, and attracting imports,” rather than funding terrorism. President Barack Obama said in a speech at American University in August that “our best analysts expect the bulk of this revenue to go into spending that improves the economy and benefits the lives of the Iranian people.” [Photo: Alex Beltyukov / Wikimedia]

The agreement has paved the way for new perspectives of the Russia-Iran military-technical cooperation. According to experts, Iran needs modern weapons worth $13 billion, and all of them could be supplied by Russia. It was reported that on the sidelines of the recent talks Iranian military officials said they were willing to buy Russian weapons worth $8 billion. First of all, Iran is interested in Russia’s assistance in creating an integrated echelon air-defense system comprising short-, medium- and long-range components. Such a system could be built with Russian technologies. One of its main parts is Su-30SM Flanker multirole jet fighters. A contract for the delivery of Flankers to Iran will be signed in 2016, a high-ranking official in the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation said Wednesday. "Iran has actually expressed its interest in the purchase of an order of Su-30SM fighters, but so far the parties are only discussing the issue in negotiations. The contract will be signed this year," the official told RIA Novosti. Russia and Iran are also in talks on the deliveries of a wide range of weapons and military hardware, including Bastion coastal missile launchers with Yakhont anti-ship missiles, Yak-130 jet fighters, Mi-8/17 helicopters as well as diesel-electric submarines, frigates and T-90 tanks.

News article:
Russia’s Defense Ministry on Wednesday denied reports it was to set to deliver the S-300 air defense systems to Iran on Thursday. Some Russian media outlets had announced that the first batteries of the S-300 system would be arriving in the Islamic Republic on February 18, despite Western opposition. The reports, which were unconfirmed, claimed the Iranian defense minister would be present at a transfer ceremony slated to be held behind closed doors. There were also reports that Russia is set to supply several Sukhoi Su-30SM multi-role fighter jets to Iran as part of an arms deal between the two countries. “The beginning of deliveries of the first consignment of Favorit (S-300) missile systems cannot take place since the Iranian side has not paid the price enshrined in the contract as of February 16,” a high-ranking representative of the Russian defense ministry told TASS, the state-run Russian news agency, on Wednesday evening. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “Therefore, the presence of the Iranian defense minister in Astrakhan at the mythical ceremony of dispatching the first Favorit systems to Tehran is out of the question,” he added. Russia and Iran signed a contract for the delivery of five S-300 batteries in 2007.

News article:
February 22, 2016 TEHRAN, Iran — Prior to his recent trip to Russia, Iran's Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan announced that he will discuss the long-stalled transfer of the S-300 air defense system as well as the possibility of reaching an agreement on the purchase of multirole Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets. While in Moscow, he met with senior Russian officials, including his counterpart, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, and President Vladimir Putin. After the Feb. 16 visit, Russian media outlets reported that the first batch of S-300 missiles had been shipped Feb. 17 via the Caspian Sea, from Astrakhan in Russia to Bandar-e Anzali in Iran, and had officially been delivered in the presence of Dehghan himself. Sputnik News Agency quoted Russian sources on the latter and later published an interview with Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Maj. Gen. Mostafa Izadi, in which Izadi confirmed that Russia has indeed delivered the first shipment of the missiles. However, in spite of widespread expectations in Iran that Russia would take the first step toward implementing the S-300 deal, in order to rebuild trust, the Putin’s spokesperson suddenly announced that the missiles will not be delivered since Iran has not yet paid for them. The Russian reasoning was that it is therefore too soon to deliver the missiles. Although the reasons for Moscow’s sudden turnaround are not wholly clear, it can be argued that it has further increased Iranian distrust of the Russians. In regard to the possibility of Iran buying new fighter jets from Russia, Dehghan announced, “We know how many Sukhoi Su-30 fighters we are planning to buy. However, for now, we shall not announce the number.” Previously, some sources had mentioned the possibility of Iran buying Chinese J-10 fighters or French Mirage fighters. However, both of these possibilities were denied by Iranian military officials. Indeed, in a recent interview, Dehghan noted, “I have seen these fighters myself, but we are not planning to purchase the Chinese fighters.” Some Russian reports suggest that Tehran is likely to sign an $8 billion contract with Moscow for the purchase of military equipment. If this is true, the question is which kind of changes to Iran’s military capabilities the procurement of Sukhoi Su-30 fighters and the S-300 air defense system will bring about. What are the advantages of these weapons systems compared to those used by Iran’s regional rivals? Will purchasing military equipment from Russia enable Iran to fill the gap in its capabilities compared to rivals such as Israel, Turkey and some Arab states? Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, sanctions were imposed on the Iranian air force. The Islamic Republic was thus only able to purchase a limited number of J-7 fighters, MiG-29, Sukhoi-24 and Sukhoi-25 for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Forces. Consequently, the backbone of the Iranian air force is made up of old American fighters such as Phantoms, Tigers and Tomcats. Meanwhile, Iran’s regional rivals have rapidly developed their air forces, with all of them currently in possession of advanced fighters such as the F-15, F-16, F-18, Eurofighter Typhoon and Rafale. These countries are additionally slated to be equipped with the fifth-generation F-35 fighter over the course of the next decade. A mere cursory glance at electronic war capabilities, active phased array radars, armament systems, maneuverability, endurance and radar cross sections shows that the Sukhoi Su-30 is not capable of successfully confronting the aforementioned Western warplanes in a heavy aerial battle. Admittedly, compared to the Western fighter jets, the Sukhoi Su-30 has two relative advantages; namely, a long-range high-resolution radar and animated engine output, which helps its high agility. However, in other areas, and especially considering the weaknesses of Russian-made electronic armor and its very large radar cross section, Sukhoi fighters will not stand much of a chance against highly advanced radar and anti-radar systems or fourth and fifth generation fighters, many of which are currently in operation in the region. Nonetheless, the S-300 air defense system is still capable of dealing with rather advanced fighters, and it can partly compensate for weaknesses in Iran’s defenses. In terms of offensive capabilities, Iran is facing serious technological problems. In this vein, Russian failures in post-sale services and upgrade operations should also be added to the list of problems. For instance, the Iranians continue to face plenty of issues with the repair and maintenance of their Sukhoi-24 and MiG-29 fighters. President Hassan Rouhani’s administration is aware of these problems and is looking for an alternative to buying military equipment from Russia. Some rumors in Tehran have it that Iran is desperately trying to gain access to the technology necessary for designing and manufacturing these advanced fighters on its own. Perhaps the Russians have gotten the point, as soon after Dehghan’s return from Moscow, Shoigu appeared in Tehran on an “unexpected” visit. Reports say the Russian official brought a “special message” from Putin to Rouhani and discussed Syria as well as bilateral matters. If anything, it seems as if Moscow is seeking to keep Tehran as a customer by resorting to engaging in symbolic measures. For instance, while failing to live up to his commitment to deliver the S-300 missiles, Putin is, through measures such as personally bringing a special gift to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and dispatching an envoy to Tehran with a special message, trying to tell the Islamic Republic that he is a strategic ally of Iran. This is while the Rouhani administration is becoming increasingly pessimistic about Putin’s measures because of his failure to live up to his commitments. Indeed, Iran has expressed a desire to forge constructive cooperation with any country, and especially those of the West. In this vein, if the sanctions on arms deals are lifted as scheduled in the next five years, Iran will more than likely look to expand research and development cooperation with international companies in order to obtain the technology necessary for designing advanced fighters that are capable of dealing with threats to Iran. The fact that the Iranians continue to buy equipment from Russia, while fully aware of the problems it entails, only goes to show that Western countries remain reluctant to sell conventional military equipment to Iran. Ultimately, the outcome of the latter is that the Russians are bound to generate tens of billions of dollars in arms sales while their Western rivals will be deprived from such revenues.

News article:
Russian President Vladmir Putin reportedly froze the transfer of the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system to Iran after receiving evidence from Israel that Tehran had transferred advanced weapons to Hezbollah. The Kuwaiti newspaper al-Jarida published the unconfirmed report on Saturday, citing an unnamed source allegedly “familiar” with Putin. The source said that Putin scuppered the delivery after Israel showed that Iran had repeatedly attempted to transfer the SA-22 Greyhound short-range air defense system to the Lebanese-based terrorist group. The report also said that Russian pilots claimed to have detected the presence of advance anti-aircraft systems in Hezbollah-controlled territory straddling the Syria-Lebanon border. Israel, according to the report, has turned a blind eye to the Iranian-backed group’s possession of the Soviet-made SA-5 Gammon surface-to-air missile system, known also as the S-200. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Russia and Iran signed a contract for the delivery of five S-300 batteries in 2007. But in autumn 2010, Russia’s then-president Dmitry Medvedev banned the supply of the systems to Tehran amid escalating global sanctions against Iran’s nuclear program. The contract, worth more than $800 million, was annulled and the advance payment returned to the Iranians. Iran filed a $4 billion lawsuit in the Court of Arbitration in Geneva over breach of the contract. According to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, Moscow persuaded Tehran to withdraw the lawsuit after “long and tough negotiations.” In April 2015, shortly after the announcement of the Lausanne outline for the nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, Putin lifted the ban on S-300 deliveries to Tehran, over American and Israeli objections. Advertisement In August, Iran and Russia announced that the system would be delivered by the end of the year, with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov saying at the time that “just technical details” remained to be agreed upon. Iranian media has repeatedly reported on the ostensibly imminent arrival of the batteries.

News article:
Tehran, Iran, March 8 By Mehdi Sepahvand - Trend: An Iranian military official has said that there is no obstacle to hinder the delivery of Russia's S-300 defense missile system to the country. "The clear news about the case is that Iran and Russia have reached the agreements needed to do the job and as we speak there is no problem for conveying the S-300 missiles," Masoud Jazayeri, second-in-command of Iran's General Staff of Armed Forces said. "I think the job will be done in the near future," he noted, Tasnim news agency reported March 8. Some Israeli news outlets last week said Russia had been discouraged from delivering the missiles to Iran. After Israel gave Russian President Vladimir Putin intelligence proving that weapons Russia sold to Iran were ending up in the hands of Lebanon's Hezbollah, Putin froze the transfer of S-300 surface-to-air missile systems to Tehran, Breaking Israel News quoted Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jarida as reporting March 5. Jazayeri further explained that Iran and Russia's general agreements regarding the missiles are now to be transformed into minor, executive agreements in order to become practical. The $800-million contract to deliver S-300 to Iran was cancelled in 2010 by then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, falling in line with the UN sanctions imposed on Iran due to its disputed nuclear program. In turn, Tehran filed a currently pending $4 billion lawsuit against Russia in Geneva's arbitration court. However, Russia President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to lift the ban over delivering the long-overdue missile system to Iran in April 2015.

News article:
Egypt's president on Wednesday vowed to do everything he could to shed light on the fate of an Italian student found dead in Cairo bearing signs of having been tortured. The corpse of Cambridge University PhD student Giulio Regeni, 28, was found dumped in a ditch on the outskirts of Cairo in February, in a case that has strained ties between Italy and Egypt. Egyptian authorities are working "day and night" to solve the crime, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said in an interview with Italy's La Repubblica newspaper. "I promise you that we will do everything to shed light (on the case) and we will get to the truth," he said. Addressing Regeni's family, he added: "We will work with the Italian authorities to bring to justice and punish the criminals that killed your son." Sisi said that as a "father first and foremost", he understood the "pain and suffering that you feel at the loss of your son." "I feel the shock and bitterness that has broken your heart," he said. Regeni disappeared on January 25. Many Italians and Egyptian opposition figures believe he was abducted and killed by elements of the Egyptian security services, an allegation the authorities in Cairo have rejected as baseless. His slaying while he was in Cairo doing research for his doctoral thesis has become a cause celebre amongst academics around the world and has turned the spotlight on what rights and opposition groups say are increasing abuses by security services under the military-backed government in Cairo. Sisi did not respond directly to these suspicions but suggested that the murder was aimed, like terrorist attacks on tourist centers, "at hurting the Egyptian economy and isolating the country," -- comments that could be read as trying to blame Islamist groups. Sisi added: "We face a terrorist threat against our tourist sites and the frontier with Libya, and we need to forge unity and support rather than create divisions with friendly countries like Italy." Sisi also appeared to draw a parallel between the Regeni case and that of Adel Heikel, an Egyptian chef resident in Italy who went missing in Rome in October and whose whereabouts remain unknown. "Such incidents cannot be allowed to destroy the relationship between our countries," Sisi said. Italian leaders have warned Egypt repeatedly that the close ties between the two countries are on the line over what happened to Regeni and the European Parliament has also demanded full cooperation from Cairo. Italian investigators are still awaiting the handover of key pieces of evidence, including Regeni's mobile phone records and the full results of an autopsy carried out by Egyptian medics after the discovery of his corpse.

News article:
Italy rejects Egypt's claim to have found student's killers By Steve Scherer and Isla Binnie ROME, March 25 (Reuters) - Italy rejected on Friday Egypt's claim that it had identified the killers of an Italian graduate student whose tortured body was recovered last month, and Rome vowed to press on with its own murder investigation. The broken body of Giulio Regeni, 28, was found on the outskirts of Cairo. Human rights groups have said the signs of torture indicated the 28-year-old had been killed by Egyptian security forces, an allegation Cairo has vigorously denied. Regeni had written articles critical of the Egyptian government. On Thursday Egyptian authorities said a criminal gang that had been killed in a shootout had had Regeni's bag and passport in its possession - a statement that failed to convince Rome investigators, Italian politicians and also Regeni's family. "We are wounded and embittered by the latest attempt by Egyptian authorities to throw off track (the investigation) into the barbaric killing of our son, Giulio," the newspaper La Reppublica quoted the parents as saying in a statement. Rome's chief prosecutor, Giuseppe Pignatone, said the investigation into Regeni's murder would continue. The evidence so far shared with a team of Italian investigators in Cairo "is not adequate in clarifying the death of Giulio Regeni and in identifying those responsible for the homicide", he said in a statement. Pignatone called on Egyptian investigators to provide the seven-member Italian team sent to Cairo almost two months ago with all the evidence they have requested. "Italy insists: we want the truth," Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a tweet. The case has caused friction between Egypt and Italy, though it looks unlikely to drive a permanent wedge between them because of the two countries' economic ties and Egypt's strategic role in the Middle East. "I don't believe at all the 'truth' coming from the Egyptian authorities about Regeni's death," Giacomo Stucchi, president of Italy's parliamentary secret service committee, said in a tweet.

News article:
Egypt's Interior Ministry said Thursday it has killed members of a gang suspected of being linked to the killing of an Italian student whose torture and death sparked an international outcry over possible involvement of Egyptian police in his brutal killing. In a statement, the ministry said the gang members are specialized in abducting foreigners while posing as policemen, and found the personal belongings of the 28-year-old Giulio Regeni. In an exchange of gunfire, the four men were killed inside their vehicle in an eastern Cairo suburb, the ministry statement said. It added that the group is suspected of orchestrating the kidnapping of foreigners and robbery. A body was found inside the group's vehicle next to weapons and forged police identification cards. Ahmed Nagy, a state prosecutor investigating the Regeni case, told The Associated Press he has no information on the gang. He stressed, "there are no suspects," in the case. Last week, Egypt's Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi promised that investigators would work "night and day" to locate and prosecute those responsible for Regeni's killing. Regeni went missing on Jan. 25, the fifth anniversary of Egypt's 2011 uprising, when police were deployed across Cairo in a broad security sweep to prevent any demonstrations. In the statement, the ministry said that police raided one of the men's houses and found the personal belongings of Regeni, including his red handbag bearing the picture of the Italian flag, his passport and other identification cards, including one belonging to Cambridge University, in addition to his cellphones. The ministry posted pictures of Regeni's credit card, passport, and other IDs. It added that the Egyptian authorities have notified their Italian counterparts and expressed their appreciation for the Italians' cooperation. Italian officials have repeatedly complained about a lack of transparency from Cairo amid media speculation that Regeni might have been a victim of the widespread torture and secret detentions by police that have been denounced by rights groups. Regeni had been in Egypt since September conducting research on workers and labor rights a sensitive topic, since disgruntled workers were among the forces in the 2011 anti-Mubarak uprising and authorities still worry about worker discontent. Regeni was last seen on Jan. 25 heading from his apartment to meet a friend in downtown Cairo. He was on his way to the subway, which was packed with security personnel scanning bags and checking commuters' IDs.In the days following his disappearance, friends and colleagues launched a search, circulating Regeni's picture widely on social media. His body was found nine days later in an empty lot along a highway in the 6th of October suburb on Cairo's western outskirts. Nagi said earlier that Regeni's body carried marks of torture. "All of his body, including his face" had bruises, cuts from stabbings and burns from cigarettes, Nagi said, adding Regeni appeared to have suffered a "slow death." News of the slaying and evidence of torture spurred diplomatic tensions. An Italian government delegation cut short a visit to Cairo and Italy summoned the Egyptian ambassador in Rome, calling for a full investigation with participation by Italian experts. Egyptian media accused "evil hands" of orchestrating Regeni's killing to damage Egyptian-Italian relations. The term is usually used to refer to those who have been targeted by a ferocious crackdown since the 2013 military ouster of country's first democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi. The Italian media pointed fingers at the Egyptian security forces. A business daily, Il Sole 24 Ore, said "the strong suspicion" was that Regeni was "killed by Egypt ... by the system, by the security apparatus." Egyptian officials deny any police involvement. For years, rights groups have accused Egyptian police of regularly torturing detainees. Over the past year, they have also accused them of using "forced disappearances" detaining suspected activists in secret without reporting their arrest. shortlink copied KEYWORDS world

(Adds new date for visit in paragraph 4) CAIRO, April 4 (Reuters) - Egyptian officials have postponed a trip to Rome to discuss the investigation into the murder of an Italian student whose body was dumped on the outskirts of Cairo in February, judicial and security sources said on Monday. Human rights groups have said torture marks on the body of Giulio Regeni, 28, indicated he died at hands of Egyptian security forces, an allegation the Cairo government denies. The case has raised fresh questions about accusations of police brutality in Egypt, a strategic ally of the West and an important trade partner for Rome. Egyptian officials were initially due in Italy on Tuesday but have now put it off. They will now make the visit on Thursday and Friday, judicial sources said, giving no reason for the decision. They had earlier told Reuters there was no new date set for the visit. A senior Egyptian interior ministry official told Reuters the investigation concluded that Regeni - who was researching the rise of independent trade unions in Egypt - was being watched by security services but that it did not mean that they killed him as suspected by human rights groups. On March 25 Egyptian police said they had discovered Regeni's bag and passport following a shootout with a criminal gang whose members had posed as policemen. Italian officials dismissed the story and Regeni's family said it was clear Regeni had not been killed for criminal gain. The case has caused friction between Egypt and Italy, though it is unlikely to lead to a permanent rift because of the two countries' trade ties and Egypt's strategic role in the Middle East. On Sunday, Egypt's mass circulation Al-Ahram newspaper ran a front-page editorial by its chief editor calling on the government to take the case seriously or risk a break in ties with Rome, an unusual move for a state-run publication.

News article:
Cairo: An Egyptian delegation is to travel to Italy to present the results of Egypt’s investigation into the torture and death of an Italian researcher in Cairo, the state prosecutor general said on Tuesday. The visit comes amid mounting pressure on Egypt to reveal the circumstances that led to the brutal death of Guilio Regeni, a 28-year-old researcher abducted on a Cairo street on January 25, the day Egyptians marked the fifth anniversary of the uprising that ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Regeni’s brutally tortured body was found nine days later by the side of a road in a Cairo suburb. Prosecutor-General Nabeel Sadek said the Egyptian delegation, which will leave for Italy on Wednesday, will be led by his assistant, Judge Mustafa Sulaiman. Italian news agency ANSA reported on Monday that the delegation will also include another prosecutor and three security officers. Weeks after Regeni’s body was found, authorities linked the killing to a criminal gang, saying they found the Italian student’s personal belongings in a suspect’s home after a shootout that killed all the gang’s members. Regeni’s parents said the Egyptian explanation of their son’s death rang hollow and have pressed the Italian government to step up pressure on Cairo by declaring Egypt to be an “unsafe” country for Italian tourists. Meanwhile, Italian prosecutors are waiting for Egyptian investigators to hand over data from Regeni’s cellphone and video from surveillance cameras from the subway station area where he was last seen. An Egyptian security official said there was a conflict between the security and judicial agencies on who is to lead the team to Italy and what to present to the Italians. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss the case, said that the prosecutors were concerned security agencies attempted to “keep information” and not present it to the Italian side. Security expert Khalid Okasha said on Tuesday that if Egypt brings no news to the Italians, relations between the two countries will enter “a dark tunnel”.

(Updates with statement from Egypt, Italian comments) ROME, April 5 (Reuters) - Italy threatened on Tuesday to impose "immediate and proportionate" measures against Egypt if Cairo did not cooperate fully in uncovering the truth behind the murder of an Italian student. Giulio Regeni, 28, vanished from the streets of Cairo on Jan. 25. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture. "If there is not a change in tack (by the Egyptian authorities), the government is ready to react, adopting measures that are both immediate and proportionate," Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni told parliament. He did not elaborate, but the head of parliament's human rights committee said last month that Italy should recall its ambassador to Cairo and declare Egypt unsafe for visitors if the investigation went nowhere. Egypt said Gentiloni's words were a hindrance rather than a help. "We refrain from commenting on these statements, which complicate the situation," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Italian officials have openly ridiculed different versions of Regeni's death put forward by Egyptian investigators, including an initial suggestion that he had died in a traffic accident. Gentiloni said a change of tack "means not accepting twisted and convenient truths. It means finding out who was responsible for having probably put Giulio Regeni under surveillance before he disappeared". He called for more cooperation with Italy. Other parliamentarians then also took aim at Egypt. "Too many lies have been administered to us, bit by bit, for us to believe them any more," said Pier Ferdinando Casini, a former head of the lower chamber. After a series of delays, Egyptian investigators are due to hold talks with Italian magistrates in Rome on Thursday and Friday, Gentiloni said. Human rights groups have said the torture marks indicate that Regeni, a postgraduate student at Britain's Cambridge University, was killed by Egyptian security forces, an allegation Cairo has repeatedly denied. Regeni's mother said last week that her son's body had been so disfigured that she had only been able to recognise him by the tip of his nose. She has threatened to release the photographs of his corpse if the killers are not found. Italy has significant economic interests in Egypt, including the giant offshore Zohr gas field, being developed by Italy's state energy producer Eni.

Italy warns Egypt it expects truth about death of student ROME (AP) — Italy warned Tuesday that it is prepared to take "immediate and proportional measures" against Egypt if it fails to come clean with all it knows about the torture and death of an Italian graduate student in Cairo. Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni told the Senate that meetings this week in Rome between Italian and Egyptian prosecutors could be "decisive" to filling in gaps in the investigation of the death of Giulio Regeni. The 28-year-old researcher was abducted on a Cairo street Jan. 25, when police were out in force as Egyptians marked the fifth anniversary of the uprising that ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak.

"If there isn't a change, the government is ready to react by adopting immediate and proportional measures," Gentiloni warned. He didn't specify possible measures, but Regeni's parents have urged Italy to declare Egypt an "unsafe" country for Italian tourists. In Cairo, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said Gentiloni's comments "complicate matters further," given that they were made one day before the Egyptian team of prosecutors and police arrives in Italy to share the results of the Egyptian investigation with Rome investigators. Also in Cairo on Tuesday, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said his country deeply regretted Regini's death and intended to "transparently" continue its "full cooperation" with Italy to resolve the case and bring the culprits to justice. El-Sissi and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi have forged close ties since the Egyptian leader came to office in June 2014. Italy is Egypt's biggest EU trading partner and the two countries have been coordinating policies on Libya, Egypt's neighbor and Italy's former colony where the extremist Islamic State group has a local affiliate. "Close Italian-Egyptian relations, which stretch across history, are able to wisely deal with and get through such isolated incidents without creating negative consequences ...," presidential spokesman Alaa Youssef quoted el-Sissi as telling a visiting delegation from NATO's parliamentary assembly. An Egyptian security official said there was a conflict between the security and judicial agencies on who would lead the team and what to present to the Italians. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case, told The Associated Press that prosecutors were concerned that the security agencies had attempted to "keep information" and not present it to the Italian side. Weeks after Regeni's body was found, Egyptian authorities linked the killing to a criminal gang, saying they found the Italian student's personal belongings in a suspect's home after a shootout that killed all the gang's members. But Italian media immediately dismissed the claim and even Egypt's top state newspaper criticized the "naive stories" being offered about the death and urged Egyptian authorities to deal seriously with the case. ___ AP reporters Hamza Hendawi, Maggie Michael and Sam Magdy contributed from Cairo. ___ This story has been corrected to show el-Sissi said "wisely," not "widely" in quote about relations between Italy and Egypt.

(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) Italian foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni said his government is ready to undertake immediate and proportional measures against Egypt unless there is a change in the place of the investigations by the Egyptian prosecution in the case of Giulio Regeni. In a speech he delivered to the Senate on Tuesday, the minister added that his government will not allow Italy's dignity to be trampled on, according to the Italian news agency ANSA. The preliminary investigations dossier sent to Italy by Egyptian investigators in the beginning of March was lacking, Gentiloni said. It lacked at least two of the five chapters requested by Italian prosecutors, which are information about Regeni's phone data and CCTV footage from the Cairo Metro, the minister said. Regarding the Egyptian prosecution's declaration on Tuesday that a delegation of security members and investigators will fly to Rome on Wednesday morning to provide their Italian counterparts with results of the investigations, Gentiloni said that "important" meetings in Rome with the Egyptian delegation on Thursday and Friday "could be decisive for the development of investigations". Gentiloni described Regini's murder as "a shock" to the whole country "not because the life of an exemplary Italian was cut short, but because of the way in which he was atrociously tortured and killed; and for the lesson in composure by his parents". The minister said Italy will not give up until the truth is found, "the real one not the convenient one", according to ANSA. He said Italy would not lend credit to "distorted" truths and wants to obtain the missing information. Regeni, 28, was found dead in a ditch along the Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road on 3 February, nine days after his disappearance, amid allegations of possible security involvement due to his research related to Egypt's labour and connections to workers' unions and members of the Egyptian opposition.

News article:
Egypt handed Italian authorities on Thursday a 2,000-page report with testimonies from 200 people regarding the probe over the torture and death in Egypt of Italian PhD student Giulio Regeni, official Italian news agency ANSA reported. Regeni, who was in Cairo conducting research on independent trade unions, went missing on 25 January. His body was found bearing signs of torture on a roadside on the outskirts of Cairo on 3 February. The report presented to Italy includes "evidentiary material" that Italian authorities had requested several weeks ago, including video footage, phone records and medical reports. It is not yet clear whether Italian authorities will find the documents presented by Egypt to be satisfactory, as Italian investigators had previously said that they find “inconsistencies” in Egypt’s account of Regeni’s death. These doubts were expressed by Italian officials after the Egyptian interior ministry said that Regeni’s belongings, including his passport, were found in possession of an alleged gang of kidnappers whom the ministry says was targeting foreigners for robbery. The four alleged gang members were killed in a shootout with police before the documents were found in a Cairo apartment used by the gang, according to the ministry. ANSA reported that Italian investigators may request information on whether or not Regeni was under surveillance prior to his abduction, especially during his meetings with independent unions. The Egyptian and Italian officials are expected to discuss Regeni's case for two days starting Thursday. The meetings are being held at a police academy in Rome and attended by Italian top prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone and three other Italian officials. The Egyptian delegation is made up of five officials – two judges and three police officers – headed by Mustafa Soliman, the assistant to the Egyptian prosecutor-general. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Egyptian and Italian prosecutors and police are to start a two-day round of talks in Rome on Thursday to speed up the investigation in the case of Giulio Regeni, an Italian university researcher brutally killed in Cairo two months ago. The Egyptian delegation landed in the Italian capital late Wednesday and was to meet at 10 am (0800 GMT) with Rome chief prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone and other Italian magistrates and investigators. "We wait for the magistrates to hold their meetings, we are ready to follow that work with great determination. No attempt to wriggle out of the truth will be accepted," Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told Il Mattino newspaper on Wednesday. Rome has complained that Cairo has been reluctant to shed light on the crime, and Italian media has dismissed several implausible explanations conjured up by Egyptian officials as attempts to cover up the likely involvement of state security agencies. Regeni, who was in Cairo to research trade unions, disappeared on January 25, a day on which Egypt's security services were on high alert for possible demonstrations to mark the fifth anniversary of the uprising that ousted longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. Seven days later, the 28-year-old was found dead, and Italian officials saw clear signs of torture on his body. The revelations have renewed scrutiny of Egypt's rights record under President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi. On Tuesday, Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni threatened "immediate and proportional" measures against Egypt unless Cairo showed real determination to get to the bottom of the affair. Italian investigators want Egyptian authorities to provide mobile phone data tracking Regeni's movements and video footage from the Cairo underground station he is believed to have entered on the day of his disappearance, the minister said.

News article:
It is as if Giulio Regeni was crucified for us all, but instead of taking away our sins, he exposed the sins of Egypt's and the world's ruling elites. We may be unsure whether it is Egyptian security personnel who tortured and murdered him. We might never know, ever - simply because corrupt elites do not allow for transparency and the availability of information. But we do know he went missing on the fifth anniversary of the January 25 Uprising when Egyptian security apparatuses were on top alert, guarding the streets against any possible attempt at a commemoration of the 2011 Revolution in the public sphere. Regeni disappeared from the street on a day Cairo was littered with security personnel. Be the details surrounding Regeni's death as they may, he is still our messiah with his murder getting the world talking about so many other violations that we are sure happened at the hands of Egyptian security personnel: The 533 enforced disappearance cases that occurred in Egypt in the past eight months and the 396 cases that are still unaccounted for, according to Italy's Corriere Della Serra newspaper. The extrajudicial killings, including the killing of the five men whom the interior ministry scapegoated under the pretext that they were gangsters who allegedly killed Regeni. The extended pre-trial detention. The torture of detainees and suspects. The hundreds who got killed for a protest camp to be dispersed, and the 37 who were tear-gassed to death inside a small police truck on one of Cairo's hot summer days. Advertisement Regeni got the world asking with us questions that they had deliberately or obliviously ignored before his death: What happened to the Italian student who went missing in Cairo after heading for the metro station? How about the Egyptian video editor who went to buy food and never returned (Mostafa Massouny is his name and it has been eight months)? Where is the engineering student who was taken from outside his college and never showed up again? Where are the others? And why has Italy, Egypt's significant trading partner and good friend, never threatened to take "immediate" measures against the Egyptian government for their sake? He exposed the hypocrisy of Western politicians who remained silent about cases of torture and enforced disappearance for more than two years; then they spoke out only when an Italian led a similar fate. What is the value of the trade and investment deals that Italy and other Western countries have stuck with Egypt? More valuable than the lives, safety and freedoms of innocents? More questions that Regeni forced us to ask. Regeni revived solidarity among people who reject injustice and oppression. We learnt in the early months of 2011 that the secret to ordinary people's triumph over tyrants is the moment they realize that they are united for one cause - then they become no longer ordinary. Advertisement And here we are reckoning that Regeni's enforced disappearance, torture and murder constitute "non è caso isolato" (no isolated case), as Regeni's mother Paola Regeni said in a press conference in late March. Her son has become an icon just like Khaled Said, who was 28 like Regeni and who was tortured to death at the hands of Egyptian policemen in 2010. A Facebook page set up in his memory called for the January protests of 2011, united Egyptians, and sparked a revolution. Paola has become "a mother of a martyr" like Khaled Said's mother and like many mothers of "martyrs" whom we honor - because her son was "killed like an Egyptian." While an Egyptian official delegation is now in Rome to present Cairo's findings regarding Regeni's case, many Egyptians are in a state of confusion and uncertainty. Naturally, the Egyptian interior ministry has, for long, had little or no credibility, since even before Khaled Said's case. But at the same time, many of the Egyptians who do not believe the Egyptian interior ministry's narrative do not see the Italian official position as particularly credible either.

News article:
It is as if Giulio Regeni was crucified for us all, but instead of taking away our sins, he exposed the sins of Egypt's and the world's ruling elites. We may be unsure whether it is Egyptian security personnel who tortured and murdered him. We might never know, ever - simply because corrupt elites do not allow for transparency and the availability of information. But we do know he went missing on the fifth anniversary of the January 25 Uprising when Egyptian security apparatuses were on top alert, guarding the streets against any possible attempt at a commemoration of the 2011 Revolution in the public sphere. Regeni disappeared from the street on a day Cairo was littered with security personnel. Be the details surrounding Regeni's death as they may, he is still our messiah with his murder getting the world talking about so many other violations that we are sure happened at the hands of Egyptian security personnel: The 533 enforced disappearance cases that occurred in Egypt in the past eight months and the 396 cases that are still unaccounted for, according to Italy's Corriere Della Serra newspaper. The extrajudicial killings, including the killing of the five men whom the interior ministry scapegoated under the pretext that they were gangsters who allegedly killed Regeni. The extended pre-trial detention. The torture of detainees and suspects. The hundreds who got killed for a protest camp to be dispersed, and the 37 who were tear-gassed to death inside a small police truck on one of Cairo's hot summer days. Advertisement Regeni got the world asking with us questions that they had deliberately or obliviously ignored before his death: What happened to the Italian student who went missing in Cairo after heading for the metro station? How about the Egyptian video editor who went to buy food and never returned (Mostafa Massouny is his name and it has been eight months)? Where is the engineering student who was taken from outside his college and never showed up again? Where are the others? And why has Italy, Egypt's significant trading partner and good friend, never threatened to take "immediate" measures against the Egyptian government for their sake? He exposed the hypocrisy of Western politicians who remained silent about cases of torture and enforced disappearance for more than two years; then they spoke out only when an Italian led a similar fate. What is the value of the trade and investment deals that Italy and other Western countries have stuck with Egypt? More valuable than the lives, safety and freedoms of innocents? More questions that Regeni forced us to ask. Regeni revived solidarity among people who reject injustice and oppression. We learnt in the early months of 2011 that the secret to ordinary people's triumph over tyrants is the moment they realize that they are united for one cause - then they become no longer ordinary. Advertisement And here we are reckoning that Regeni's enforced disappearance, torture and murder constitute "non è caso isolato" (no isolated case), as Regeni's mother Paola Regeni said in a press conference in late March. Her son has become an icon just like Khaled Said, who was 28 like Regeni and who was tortured to death at the hands of Egyptian policemen in 2010. A Facebook page set up in his memory called for the January protests of 2011, united Egyptians, and sparked a revolution. Paola has become "a mother of a martyr" like Khaled Said's mother and like many mothers of "martyrs" whom we honor - because her son was "killed like an Egyptian." While an Egyptian official delegation is now in Rome to present Cairo's findings regarding Regeni's case, many Egyptians are in a state of confusion and uncertainty. Naturally, the Egyptian interior ministry has, for long, had little or no credibility, since even before Khaled Said's case. But at the same time, many of the Egyptians who do not believe the Egyptian interior ministry's narrative do not see the Italian official position as particularly credible either. Rome showed pragmatic support for the Egyptian government in the past few years, a support that continued unabated notwithstanding the Egyptian authorities' violations against dissident voices. Even after Regeni's murder, the Italian government started off with a weak reaction to the Italian student's disappearance and the Egyptian police's failure to unravel it; then their stance intensified later, prompting many to conclude that the Italian government started to give more attention to its citizen's murder only when pressure on it mounted at home.

News article:
By Steve Scherer ROME (Reuters) - Italy recalled its ambassador to Egypt for consultations on Friday after Egyptian investigators in Rome failed to provide evidence needed to solve the mystery of the murder of an Italian student in Cairo. Ambassador Maurizio Massari was called to the capital for "an urgent evaluation" of what steps to take to "ascertain the truth about the barbaric murder of Giulio Regeni", the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Egyptian authorities met with Rome prosecutors on Thursday and Friday, handing over some, but not all, of the evidence Italy had requested. The prosecutors said in a statement Egyptian investigators had still not handed over such evidence as details from Cairo cell towers that had connected to Regeni's mobile phone. Regeni, 28, vanished from the streets of Cairo on Jan. 25. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture. Regeni's mother said last week that her son's body had been so disfigured that she had only been able to recognise him by the tip of his nose. Human rights groups have said the torture indicates he was killed by Egyptian security forces, an allegation Cairo has repeatedly denied. "Recalling the ambassador for talks means that Italy confirms its commitment with itself and the Regeni family: We will stop only before the truth, the real truth," Renzi told reporters on Friday, adding that Italian prosecutors said this week's meetings had been "disappointing". Italian officials have openly ridiculed different versions of Regeni's death put forward by Egyptian investigators, including an initial suggestion that he had died in a traffic accident. Last month, Egyptian police said Regeni's belongings, including his passport, had been found in the possession of a band of thieves that were killed in a shootout with Egyptian police. Investigators in Italy quickly dismissed that story. Italy's move to escalate the diplomatic dispute is likely to further strain relations between the two countries, and it is a setback for Renzi's diplomatic efforts to make Italy the main European partner for Egypt. Egypt will "assess in a comprehensive manner" the situation when its investigative team returns home, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said in a statement. Egypt had not yet been officially notified of Italy's move to recall its ambassador, nor for "the reasons behind this decision", he said. Renzi had offered to be "a bridge" to Europe when Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi visited Rome in 2014, saying the two countries were strategic partners in the Mediterranean for fighting Islamist militants and combating people smuggling. Apart from common political aims, Italy has significant economic interests in Egypt, including the giant offshore Zohr gas field, which is being developed by Italy's state energy producer Eni . A delegation of Italian businessmen led by then-Industry Minister Federica Guidi cut short a visit to Cairo and returned home when Regeni's body was recovered in February.

Egypt says it hadn't been notified officially about the recall Italy recalled its ambassador to Egypt for consultations on Friday after two days of meetings between Italian and Egyptian investigators over the murder of an Italian PhD student whose body was found in Cairo in February. Egyptian foreign ministry's spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said the ministry hadn't been notified officially about the recall, and did not know the reasons for the decision, "particularly as no statement has been issued yet regarding the results of the meeting between the Egyptian and Italian investigation teams looking into the case of the murder of Italian student Giulio Regeni." An Egyptian delegation headed to Rome on Wednesday to submit a 2000-page report to chief prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone on Cairo's investigation into the killing of Regeni. Abu Zeid added the ministry is awaiting the return of the Egyptian team to Cairo to hear their evaluation about the results of the meetings, and what the Italian side would announce on the aftermath of the meetings being conducted in Rome for the last couple of days. Following the recalling of ambassador Maurizio Massari, the Italian foreign ministry said the decision was made to allow for "an urgent evaluation" of what steps to take to "ascertain the truth about the barbaric murder of Giulio Regeni", according to a statement. "Italy will stop only when it has the truth," Italian Prime Minister Renzi said on Facebook after the ambassador was recalled. The 28-year-old Regeni vanished from the streets of Cairo on 25 January. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Cairo nine days later, showing signs of extensive torture. Given the sensitive topic of Regeni's research – independent trade unions – his disappearance was quickly considered by some to be an instance of abduction by government agents, who human rights advocates blame for other cases of forced disappearance. However, the interior ministry strongly denied any link with Regeni's death. Last month Egyptian police said they had found the Italian's passport and other belongings in the possession of one of the families of a member of an alleged gang of kidnappers who robbed foreigners. Police killed all four members of the alleged gang in a shoot out in late March. Many Italian officials have publicly expressed scepticism towards the transparency of Cairo's investigation.

Cairo: Tensions between Italy and Egypt over the torture and death of an Italian graduate student in Cairo this year touched a new high on Friday, when Italy announced that it was withdrawing its ambassador to Egypt for urgent consultations to protest what it called a lack of cooperation in the joint investigation between the two nations. Italy’s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, announced the move at the end of two days of talks in Rome between Egyptian and Italian investigators over the death of Giulio Regeni, 28, whose brutalised body was discovered beside a highway on the edge of Cairo on Febrary 3. In particular, Italian officials wanted cellphone data and surveillance footage that could help determine the precise circumstances of Regeni’s disappearance on January 25. But that assistance did not materialise in recent days, Italian officials said. In a statement, Gentiloni said he was recalling Ambassador Maurizio Massari for an “urgent evaluation” of efforts to resolve what he termed a “barbaric murder”. The gesture falls short of a full withdrawal of the ambassador and will not entail closing Italy’s embassy in Cairo. In Cairo, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ahmad Abu Zaid, said the government had not been formally informed of the Italian decision and would await the return of the Egyptian investigators from Rome before taking further steps. Regeni’s killing has dominated the media in Italy for weeks, and public anger there has been driven by accounts of the injuries he suffered before his death. His body was found with cigarette burns, broken bones and signs that he had been beaten on the feet. Sharp questions arose over Egyptian attempts to link Regeni’s death to five men who the police said were members of a criminal gang that had been kidnapping foreigners. The men were shot dead at a police checkpoint on March 24. An emotional media appearance last month by Paola Regeni, the student’s mother, increased pressure on the Italian government to take a tough stance. She threatened to publish a photograph of her son’s battered body unless the Egyptian investigation made substantial progress. Italy wants other European countries to pressure Egypt on the Regeni investigation. But a united European front on the case may be complicated by competing economic and strategic interests. The president of France, Francois Hollande, is scheduled to arrive in Cairo on April 18 for a four-day visit during which the two countries are expected to sign a $1.1 billion (Dh4.04 billion) weapons deal.

Italy’s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, announced the move at the end of two days of talks in Rome between Egyptian and Italian investigators over the death of Giulio Regeni, 28, whose brutalised body was discovered beside a highway on the edge of Cairo on Febrary 3. In particular, Italian officials wanted cellphone data and surveillance footage that could help determine the precise circumstances of Regeni’s disappearance on January 25. But that assistance did not materialise in recent days, Italian officials said. In a statement, Gentiloni said he was recalling Ambassador Maurizio Massari for an “urgent evaluation” of efforts to resolve what he termed a “barbaric murder”. The gesture falls short of a full withdrawal of the ambassador and will not entail closing Italy’s embassy in Cairo. In Cairo, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ahmad Abu Zaid, said the government had not been formally informed of the Italian decision and would await the return of the Egyptian investigators from Rome before taking further steps. Regeni’s killing has dominated the media in Italy for weeks, and public anger there has been driven by accounts of the injuries he suffered before his death. His body was found with cigarette burns, broken bones and signs that he had been beaten on the feet. Sharp questions arose over Egyptian attempts to link Regeni’s death to five men who the police said were members of a criminal gang that had been kidnapping foreigners. The men were shot dead at a police checkpoint on March 24. An emotional media appearance last month by Paola Regeni, the student’s mother, increased pressure on the Italian government to take a tough stance. She threatened to publish a photograph of her son’s battered body unless the Egyptian investigation made substantial progress. Italy wants other European countries to pressure Egypt on the Regeni investigation. But a united European front on the case may be complicated by competing economic and strategic interests. The president of France, Francois Hollande, is scheduled to arrive in Cairo on April 18 for a four-day visit during which the two countries are expected to sign a $1.1 billion (Dh4.04 billion) weapons deal.

News article:
Two Egyptian experts say that Italy may bring the high-profile case of an Italian doctoral student who was found murdered in Cairo before the European Parliament with a view to having sanctions imposed on Egypt. Egyptian legal researcher Ahmed Mefreh said the Giulio Regeni murder case could lead to Egyptian individuals suspected of involvement being summoned by Interpol and official complaints against the Egyptian regime being submitted to international bodies. According to the Italian embassy in Cairo, Regeni, 28, came to Cairo last September to work on his doctoral thesis on the Egyptian economy. He disappeared on Jan. 25 in Cairo’s Dokki district before his body was found -- bearing signs of torture -- several days later. Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Mefreh said Italy’s recent decision to recall its ambassador in Cairo was proof that negotiations with Egypt -- which took place on Thursday and Friday -- had failed. "Italian investigation authorities have two options. The first is to continue investigations and submit the information they have to the Italian judiciary," Mefreh said. The second option, according to Mefreh, would be "to halt the investigation until new information emerges". In the latter case, he said, Italian investigators would provide all information currently at their disposal -- both what they have learned through the media and what has been found by Italian investigators who visited Egypt -- to the Italian judiciary. "This would give the Italian authorities the right to widen the circle of suspicion to include more suspects, with the possibility of eventually proving them guilty," said Mefreh. "In this case, the Italian judiciary could file a request to have these suspects detained." If the Egyptian government failed to surrender the accused individuals to the Italian authorities, Mefreh added, the latter could bring the case before the European Union and Interpol. - 'Lockerbie scenario' Said Sadek, a political sociology professor at the American University in Cairo, told Anadolu Agency that Egypt could -- in the event that it failed to surrender the suspects -- end up with a "Lockerbie scenario". The Lockerbie case involved a U.S. passenger plane that went down over the Scottish village of Lockerbie in 1988. Three years later, an arrest order was issued in the U.S. and Britain for two Libyans suspected of bombing the plane. Libya, however, refused the request and launched its own investigation, detaining the two suspects and asking both countries to provide what evidence it had against them. The case ultimately ended up with sanctions being imposed on Libya. "Italy’s decision to recall its ambassador in Cairo is a diplomatic escalation intended to express displeasure about the lack of progress in the Egyptian investigation and appease Italian public opinion -- and also to put pressure on Egypt," Sadek said. "It could eventually lead to diplomatic relations being cut." A second scenario is that the case may be raised at the European Parliament, after which foreign ministers from EU member states could impose sanctions on Egypt. On March 9, the European Parliament issued an urgent statement in which it advised member states to cut aid to Egypt due to perceived Egyptian stonewalling in the Regeni case. - Envoy recalled On Saturday, Italy officially notified Egypt that it had recalled its ambassador for "consultations", an Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman said. According to a statement issued by the Italian Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Maurizio Massari was summoned to Rome to discuss the Regeni case. The decision was taken after Egyptian and Italian prosecutors had discussed the matter in Rome, the statement added, going on to call for "an urgent evaluation" in order to "find the truth about the barbaric Regeni murder." Italy’s official ANSA news agency reported that Italian officials had found information provided by the Egyptian authorities to be "insufficient" and that the Italian side had left the meeting dissatisfied. Regeni vanished on Jan. 25 -- the fifth anniversary of a popular uprising that forced autocratic President Hosni Mubarak to step down after 30 years in power. At the time of Regeni’s disappearance, Egypt's sprawling security apparatus had been on high alert to prevent the eruption of any demonstrations marking the anniversary. On Feb. 3, the student’s dead body -- bearing signs of extreme abuse and torture -- was found in a ditch on Cairo’s outskirts. While the Egyptian authorities deny any involvement, informed observers say the signs of torture on the young man’s body were similar to those associated with Egyptian police torture.

The UK Foreign Office on Monday called for a "full and transparent" investigation into the murder of Italian student Guilio Regeni in Egypt. Regeni, whose body was found in a ditch on the outskirts of Cairo in February, was a PhD student at Cambridge University in the UK. "The British minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Tobias Ellwood, as well as British officials in London and Cairo, has stressed to the Egyptian authorities the need for a full and transparent investigation, in full cooperation with the Italian authorities," a spokesperson for the British embassy in Cairo told Ahram Online. A parliamentary petition calling on the British government to ensure a “credible” investigation into the killing this week reached 10,000 signatures. At 100,000 signatures, the petition will be considered for debate in Parliament. "As an Italian national, it’s right that the Italian authorities are taking the lead in Giulio Regeni’s case. The UK government is in close contact with the Italian government in Rome, Cairo, and London, and stands ready to support their efforts in any way we can," the spokesperson added. The 28-year-old vanished from the streets of Cairo on 25 January, the fifth anniversary of the 2011 revolution. His body, discovered nine days later, showed signs of extensive torture. On Friday, Italy recalled its ambassador to Egypt for consultations after two days of meetings between Italian and Egyptian investigators, saying Egypt had failed to provide requested evidence. Egyptian investigators said that the Italians had demanded call logs of thousands of phone numbers in the area where Regeni lived and where his body was found. The “illegal and unconstitutional" requests were denied, they said. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry has affirmed that Regeni's case is not closed, stressing that cooperation is still ongoing between Egypt and Italy even though Egypt refused the Italian demand.

Egypt has softened its rejection of Italy’s request to hand over phone records of mobile subscribers in a Cairo district where an Italian doctoral student lived before he was abducted, tortured and killed. Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri told reporters in Cairo on Tuesday that Egypt will examine the records and convey any findings to the Italians. Last week, a senior prosecutor said Egypt had rejected the Italian request because it violates the law and the constitution. Shukri repeated the same reasons for rejecting Italy’s request and did not explain exactly how Egypt would share findings with Rome. Giulio Regeni went missing on January 25, the anniversary of Egypt’s 2011 uprising. Police were out in force that day to prevent protests, fueling speculation they were behind his abduction and death. Egyptian authorities informed Italian authorities on February 3 that Regeni’s body had been found along a highway on Cairo’s outskirts.

Italian media have honed in on the hypothesis that elements in Egypt’s security force, which have been criticized by human rights champions, had arrested the young man before his death because he was in contact with Egyptian labor activists as part of his research. But Egypt’s interior minister retorted that his country’s investigators are working hard to solve the case and insisted Regeni had never been arrested.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said Egypt deeply regretted Regeni's death and intended to continue its "full cooperation" with Italy to resolve the case and bring the culprits to justice. Regeni, who studied at Cambridge University, was researching trade unions in Egypt, focusing on street vendors. In the aftermath of the 2011 uprising, vendors were often used by police to attack protesters or acted as informers. Some vendors were also targeted by the police for blocking roads. His obituary on the Cambridge University website said Regeni "sought to understand how the labor sector was changing in the country, in the context of economic globalization and greater international institutional linkages." Advertisement A colleague at Cambridge said Regeni had not flagged any concerns about his safety. But Regeni's research had raised the suspicions of police, a security source told Reuters. The trade union movement is seen as the origin of the 2011 uprising and the last bastion of dissent under Sisi's crackdown. Egypt's interior and foreign ministers both dismissed the allegation that security forces were behind Regeni's murder.

News article:
Giulio Regeni, a 28-year-old postgraduate student, was reportedly detained by police the day he vanished. His body was found on Feb. 3 with signs of torture. Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters (Reuters) - An Italian student who was tortured and murdered in Egypt had been detained by police and then transferred to a compound run by Homeland Security the day he vanished, intelligence and police sources say. The claims contradict the official Egyptian account that security services had not arrested him. Giulio Regeni, a 28-year-old postgraduate student, disappeared on Jan. 25, friends say. His body was found on Feb. 3, dumped on the side of a road outside Cairo. It showed signs of torture, according to forensic and prosecution officials in Egypt. Advertisement Egyptian officials have strongly denied any involvement in Regeni's death. Soon after his body was found, police suggested he was the victim of a car accident. Weeks later they said he might have been killed by a criminal gang impersonating policemen. But three Egyptian intelligence officials and three police sources independently told Reuters the police had custody of Regeni at some point before he died. Asked if Regeni had been taken to the Izbakiya police station in Cairo, as some of the sources asserted, an official in the Interior Ministry said: "We did not issue a statement on this matter." Mohamed Ibrahim, an official in the media department of Homeland Security, said: "There is no connection whatsoever between Regeni and the police or Interior Ministry or Homeland Security. He has never been held in any police station or here. The only time he came into contact with police was when the police officials stamped his passport when he landed in Egypt. Advertisement "If we had any suspicions concerning his activities the solution would have been simple: Expel him." Activists hold placards that read, among others, "Giulio, one of us and killed like us", during a memorial outside of the Italian embassy in Cairo on Feb. 6. Egyptian officials have strongly denied any involvement in Regeni's death. Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters Regeni's fate has re-focused attention on broader allegations of police brutality in Egypt and created tensions between Cairo and Italy, one of Egypt's most important trading partners. A senior forensic official told Reuters that Regeni had seven broken ribs, signs of electrocution onhis penis, traumatic injuries all over his body, and a brain haemorrhage. He had been killed by a sharp blow to the head. Pointing to the signs of torture, human rights groups such as the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms and Amnesty International have suggested Regeni may have been killed by Egyptian security services. Rome is demanding Egypt find Regeni's murderers. All six intelligence and police sources told Reuters that Regeni was picked up by plainclothespolice near the Gamal Abdel Nasser metro station in Cairo on the evening of Jan. 25. Security had been heightened that day because it was the anniversary of the beginning of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. Advertisement An Egyptian man was picked up at the same time. Three sources gave his name but Reuters was unable to verify the man's identity. His connection to Regeni, if any, is unclear. It is also unclear why the men were picked up, though all the sources said the two had not been specifically targeted but were detained as part of a general security sweep. Regeni's coffin is carried during his funeral in Fiumicello, northern Italy, on Feb. 12, 2016. His death has re-focused attention on broader allegations of police brutality in Egypt and created tensions between Cairo and Italy. Stringer/Reuters One of the intelligence officials said the two men were taken to the Izbakiya police station, a fortress-like compound located beneath a flyover near downtown Cairo. "They were transported in a white minibus with police license plates," he said. The three police sources said officers on patrol in the area that night confirmed to them that Regeni had been taken to Izbakiya. Advertisement "We were told that an Italian was arrested and he was taken to Izbakiya police station," said one of the police officers, who confirmed the detainee was Regeni. A senior police official in the Izbakiya station told Reuters that he recalled an Italian being brought in and said he would check the records to confirm the name. He subsequently declined to comment. "I don't know anything about it," he said. "I checked the books. Regeni's name was not there." One of the intelligence sources said that Regeni was held at Izbakiya for 30 minutes before he was transferred to Lazoughli, a state security compound run by Egyptian Homeland Security. The sources did not say what happened to the Italian after that. Reuters was unable to obtain information on the whereabouts of the Egyptian.

ROME, ITALY - 2016/02/13: A signpost against the current government in Egypt during demonstration for Giulio Regeni in Rome. The piazza Santi Apostoli demonstrate to demand justice for the death of Giulio Regeni and other victims of the Al Sisi government in Egypt. (Photo by Andrea Ronchini/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) COPENHAGEN -- Exactly five years since the Arab upheavals, Western policy in the Middle East has come full circle. On Jan. 25 this year, the fifth anniversary of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, Giulio Regeni, a Cambridge University PhD researcher from Italy, disappeared near Tahrir Square in Cairo. About a week later, he was found dead on a sidewalk on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital, his body bearing the unmistakable signs of torture. Advertisement Regeni's death immediately prompted suspicions that Egypt's mighty security apparatus was implicated in the killing. That would make Regeni one of the few foreigners to join a growing list of almost 2,000 Egyptians subject to "enforced disappearances" since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2014. The ensuing standoff between Italy, until then a friendly Western government, and an increasingly authoritarian Arab regime has dramatically brought to the fore the inadequacy of the policy repertoire at the West's disposal. 'My promise to the Regeni family, as a father: we'll find who killed Giulio.' For Italians, those words were followed only by deception and delays. Ever since the murder, the Italian government has been pressing Cairo for collaboration in the investigation. Sisi personally offered cooperation to solve the case: "My promise to the Regeni family, as a father: we'll find who killed Giulio." But for Italians, those words were followed only by deception and delays. At a meeting in Rome in early April, Egyptian investigators refused to share the phone records of suspects, citing privacy concerns. That was apparently too much for the Italian government, which recalled its ambassador to Egypt and warned of unspecified consequences "proportional" to the situation, which might include declaring Egypt an unsafe destination for tourists. Advertisement Sisi at the al-Qubaa palace in Cairo on April 17. (KHALED DESOUKI/AFP/Getty Images) That's one of the keywords of this sad story: a "proportional" response presupposes an incrementalism and a predictability that these five years have utterly disproved. The Arab uprisings had started as a euphoric, often violent, domino effect of popular revolts fueled by resentment and outrage. With the possible exception of Tunisia, indignation turned into disillusion and finally stagnation. A half decade on, the Middle East and North Africa have reverted to some of the conditions that preceded the revolutions. And so has European policy, which is still marked by the kind of gradual engagement -- or, as in this case, withdrawal thereof -- something known in Euro-jargon as the "more-for-more" principle. Anyone wishing that gradualism will be replaced by a quantum leap in European policy will typically encounter calls for the creation of a Marshall Plan for the Mediterranean. Instead, the Middle East has received a plethora of transactional measures addressing some of the pressing urgencies of today. The latest of those is a migration "compact" that the Italian government proposed in early April, in advance of a foreseen surge of immigrant arrivals by sea. The proposal plans to reallocate already earmarked funds and to issue joint so-called Eurobonds to fund infrastructure projects in countries of migrant origins, mostly in Africa. More controversially, the plan proposes to replicate the controversial EU-Turkey deal signed last month -- where Europe returns refugees to Turkey in exchange for money -- with war-torn Libya problematically cast in Ankara's role. Western policy in the Middle East has come full circle. It is doubtful whether the compact will see the light of day. Germany already flatly rejected the idea of issuing Eurobonds to Africa. But precisely against such background, the attention being raised by Regeni's brutal murder is hugely important. Not only does it shine a light on the abuses of Sisi's increasingly authoritarian regime -- it also makes it apparent that the West has no better options in the region than it had five years ago, whether it is to accompany change or to protect some of its basic values. At a time when terror has returned to strike at the heart of the Europe, it is understandable for Europe to covet stability. Less defensible is that authoritarian stagnation is used to lubricate business interests that, in Egypt's case, range from gas contracts with Italy to the provision of two warships from France. Advertisement Protestors shout anti-government slogans in front of Parliament headquarters in Cairo on March 27. (REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh) But when it comes to a strategic vision for the region, the best way to honor Regeni's memory is to actually remember what he was doing in Egypt. The late doctoral student was researching Egyptian labor unions, a movement that in Tunisia was so instrumental to democratic transition that it won the 2015 Nobel Peace prize as part of the so-called Tunisian quartet. The circumstances in Egypt have been different and increasingly prohibitive. And yet, as Regeni wrote in his last article, "independent trade unions are refusing to give up." That may well read as the epitaph to his untimely death, as well as to the kind of imaginative leap that the West's Middle East policy has failed to perform. Earlier on WorldPost:

News article:
March 15, 2016 RAMALLAH, West Bank — Hamas leaders on Feb. 25 announced significant progress on Israeli-Turkish reconciliation negotiations, especially on a proposed floating harbor off the Gaza Strip. The negotiations have inspired optimism in the Hamas movement, but the harbor proposal evokes quite a different reaction from the Palestinian Authority (PA). On Feb. 29, the Israeli Hebrew newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said a joint Turkish-Israeli statement would be issued about the offshore harbor within days. The news angered the Fatah-controlled PA, which governs the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank. However, a statement has yet to be issued as negotiations continue. The PA rejects the negotiations between Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s representative Joseph Ciechanover and acting Israeli National Security adviser Jacob Nagel. The negotiations are designed to finalize a reconciliation agreement between the two countries, whose relationship deteriorated when the Israeli army attacked the Turkish Mavi Marmara ship off the coast of the Gaza Strip in 2010. During the negotiations, Turkey raised three conditions for normalization of relations: a public apology for the 2010 attack, financial compensation for its victims and a lift of the blockade Israel has imposed on Gaza. Based on the positions of Palestinian officials from the PA and PLO factions, it seems that these Palestinians have been infuriated by these negotiations, which started in December without any coordination with the PA or the PLO. They fear that the talks could be a step toward Turkish supervision of the Gaza Strip through Turkish-Israeli security and economic understandings and could further entrench the divide between the West Bank and the Strip. One idea for ​​creating a floating harbor off the Gaza Strip was raised by Israeli Minister of Transport Yisrael Katz on July 24, 2014. The idea consisted of constructing an artificial island 4.5 kilometers (almost 3 miles) off the coast of Gaza with port and power facilities and an airport to transport goods into the Gaza Strip. The island was to be linked to Gaza by a bridge with a checkpoint, and the bridge was to be used to transmit electricity and allow the transportation of water, goods and persons. The project was supposed to be subject to international control and supervision, provided that Israel handled maritime security, as well as port inspections. The floating harbor would be served by a Turkish Cyprus port, some 250 miles or more away. Azzam al-Ahmad, a Fatah Central Committee member and head of the Fatah reconciliation delegation, told Al-Monitor, “President Mahmoud Abbas and the concerned Palestinian authorities tried to inquire of the Turkish side about the Turkish position on this matter, but we have not received any response yet.” On Turkey's role in the harbor negotiations, Ahmad said, “The mediations from outside the framework of the PA are unacceptable, since they consecrate division. Turkey or any other country is not entitled to negotiate with Israel on any part of our country. The legitimate Palestinian leadership did not ask Turkey to intervene and negotiate on our behalf.” As the PA lacks any legal parameters to confront the issue of this port, it is relying on political and diplomatic efforts to obstruct the project. Many factors are worrying the PA, including its concerns over the potential for Turkish administration of Gaza. That move could be seen as support for the internal divide separating the Gaza Strip from the West Bank by establishing a maritime route to Gaza that is not under the PA’s control. For the PLO, Turkey’s proposed floating harbor is less than what it would have gained in the Oslo Accord signed with Israel on Sept. 13, 1993. Article 7(d) of the accord specified that “in order to enable the [self-government] council to promote economic growth, upon its inauguration, the council will establish, among other things, a Palestinian Electricity Authority and a Gaza Sea Port Authority.” Ahmad said, “Gaza’s international airport and the [uncompleted] seaport project fall within the Palestinians' rights by virtue of the signed agreements between the PLO and Israel. These rights may not be renounced, and new negotiations undermining these rights must not be held. This is our right and we will not waive it.” He said the joint Palestinian delegation he headed, which held indirect negotiations on a truce in the Gaza Strip with Israel brokered by Egypt after the war on Gaza in 2014, refused to include the seaport and airport on the agenda of the negotiations since they are rights that are not supposed to be subject to negotiations. In an official statement March 1, Hamas denounced the position of the PA and Fatah and their refusal to set up a floating harbor in the Gaza Strip. Ziad al-Zaza, a member of Hamas’ political bureau and an adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, former prime minister of the PA, told Al-Monitor, “The PA’s position is not a patriotic position, since the port of Gaza would be for all of Palestine and not for Gaza only. It aims to break the siege on the Gaza Strip. Whoever refuses Gaza’s port or airport would be further consecrating the siege.” He added, "We do not have the details on the negotiations. When the negotiations are done and a deal is reached, we will peruse and discuss the details since we are not a negotiating party. We call upon the world to help lift the siege on Gaza and we reproach anyone who acts to the contrary.” Egypt also rejects the idea of ​​creating a floating harbor in the Gaza Strip, and its stance represents a pressure card that could foil the project. Writer and political analyst Mustafa Sawaf told Al-Monitor, “The Egyptian refusal of the floating harbor project stems from Egypt's desire to keep its hands on the Palestinian issue and to keep any other party from interfering, especially Turkey, in light of the feud between them.” The PLO factions expressed their concerns over the project. Kayed al-Ghoul, a member of the political bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told Al-Monitor, “This project entrenches the separation between the West Bank and Gaza and encourages Israel to propose the idea of turning the Gaza Strip into an independent Palestinian entity as part of a regional solution, away from the West Bank.” On Turkey's role, Ghoul said, “Turkey wants to justify the normalization of relations with Israel by easing the blockade on Gaza, which will enhance its influence over Palestinian affairs. Turkey is well aware of the central importance of the [Palestinian cause] for the Arab peoples. This may be part of its conflict with Egypt, which accords a significant importance to the Gaza Strip.” Walid al-Awad, member of the Political Bureau of the Palestinian People's Party, told Al-Monitor, “Turkey and Israel are negotiating on replacing previous agreements and achievements, such as the Gaza International Airport, with less-favorable agreements that may turn Gaza into a Turkish-governed region, since the floating harbor would be linked to Turkish Cyprus and would be under the protection of NATO and Israel’s control.” Awad added that Turkey’s negotiations with Israel without Palestinian input suggest that Turkish leaders — who believe the Palestinian people have no representative — are revisiting the idea of Ottoman tutelage and are negotiating on behalf of the PA without any prior consultations. Palestinians fear that as long as they remain unable to end their divisions, form a national unity government ruling over the West Bank and Gaza Strip and hold elections, Palestine will remain a magnet for political and economic projects for all countries aspiring to increase their influence in the region.

March 15, 2016 RAMALLAH, West Bank — Hamas leaders on Feb. 25 announced significant progress on Israeli-Turkish reconciliation negotiations, especially on a proposed floating harbor off the Gaza Strip. The negotiations have inspired optimism in the Hamas movement, but the harbor proposal evokes quite a different reaction from the Palestinian Authority (PA). On Feb. 29, the Israeli Hebrew newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said a joint Turkish-Israeli statement would be issued about the offshore harbor within days. The news angered the Fatah-controlled PA, which governs the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank. However, a statement has yet to be issued as negotiations continue. The PA rejects the negotiations between Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s representative Joseph Ciechanover and acting Israeli National Security adviser Jacob Nagel. The negotiations are designed to finalize a reconciliation agreement between the two countries, whose relationship deteriorated when the Israeli army attacked the Turkish Mavi Marmara ship off the coast of the Gaza Strip in 2010.

Will Saturday’s devastating terror attack in Istanbul lead to an improvement in bilateral ties between Ankara and Jerusalem? Those looking for a silver lining to the tragic event in which three Israeli civilians (and an Iranian) were killed can point to the smooth cooperation and the sympathetic messages exchanged by officials from both countries. But while several signals indicate that some sort of detente is in the offing, experts on Israel-Turkey ties warn that a full-fledged reconciliation might still not be around the corner. The coordination between Israeli and Turkish officials dealing with the immediate aftermath of the attack on Istanbul’s pedestrian Istiklal avenue was excellent, according to people on the ground. “The Health Ministry, Prime Minister’s Office, the hospitals — even the funeral homes were amazing,” said diplomat Shira Ben Tzion, who was in charge of Israel’s Istanbul consulate at the time of the attack. “We are used to hostility on the streets,” she told Yedioth Ahronoth, “but in this case, from the moment we said we’re from the Israeli Consulate, they embraced us straight away and treated us nicely.” Even on a much higher level, Saturday’s attack seemed to bring the two sides closer together. On Saturday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received a letter of condolence from his Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoğlu, a man not usually know for his high regard for Israel’s current political leadership. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “Today’s attack in Istanbul has shown us once again that the international community as a whole should act in a resolute manner against the ignoble objectives of terrorist organizations,” Davutoğlu wrote. “I would like to convey my condolences to the families of the Israeli citizens who lost their lives in the heinous attack which happened in Istanbul and to the people of Israel, and wish a speedy recovery to the wounded.” Davutoğlu’s missive came less than one week after Netanyahu condemned a large-scale terror attack in Ankara, expressing “solidarity with the Turkish people in the war against terrorism.” That statement was newsworthy because Netanyahu had refrained from speaking out on previous attacks rocking Turkish cities, reportedly due to his anger at Ankara’s refusal to condemn the wave of terror currently rocking Israel. On Saturday night, in another gesture unprecedented in recent years, Foreign Ministry director-general Dore Gold aborted a trip to Washington (where he was supposed to participate in the annual conference of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC) and instead made his way to Istanbul. In Turkey, he was set to meet with local politicians and members of the city’s Jewish community and is rumored to be slated to powwow with his current counterpart and former foreign minister Feridun Sinirlioğlu. Advertisement Gold’s arrival, on Sunday afternoon, marked the highest-level visit to Turkey from an Israeli official since the 2010 Mavi Marmara incident, which had sent bilateral ties into the abyss. When İrem Aktaş, a member of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s ruling AK Party, tweeted on Saturday that she wished for the death of the Israelis wounded in the attack, the party quickly initiated disciplinary proceedings against her. “These are all things that we haven’t seen before in bilateral relations,” said Nimrod Goren, a Turkey expert at Hebrew University. “Look for example at Davutoğlu’s letter to Netanyahu. It represents some sort of direct communication, if not verbal, between the two leaders, and that is something we haven’t seen in a long time.” This, together with Gold’s visit and the efficient cooperation by the authorities on the ground, are clear signs that “the diplomatic mechanism is working,” said Goren, who also heads Mitvim — The Israeli Institute Regional Foreign Policies. “The level of cooperation, on a working level but also on a diplomatic level, is more intense that it had been in the past. And apparently it’s going quite well; so far we’ve heard no complaints from one side about the other.” That fact that Aktaş’ hateful tweet was quickly and forcefully rejected by higher-ups in Erdoğan’s party indicates that verbal attacks against Israel are being delegitimized in today’s Turkey, Goren added. “All of these developments together form a picture showing open lines of communication and that Turkey is trying to project a better atmosphere,” he said. Advertisement And yet, this cautious rapprochement by no means guarantees that Jerusalem and Ankara will soon finalize a reconciliation agreement and fully normalize diplomatic ties, he believes. “There are concrete disagreements before it can be signed, and they are not removed by the most recent events. But what this development does achieve is creating a more relaxed atmosphere to conduct these negotiations in.” Addressing reporters in the Foreign Ministry’s situation room Saturday night, Netanyahu reiterated that Israel is constantly trying to reach an agreement that will lead to normalization of ties with the Turks. “This matter is being delayed not because of frivolous reasons,” he said, “but because of fundamental issues about which we are trying to reach an understanding with them. There was a certain progress, and I hope that it will continue.” Netanyahu is referring to Gaza — Ankara requests Israel lift its naval blockade of the Strip, which Israel opposes adamantly — as well as Jerusalem’s concern over senior Hamas leaders based in Turkey. Israel demands Turkey prevent any Hamas activity from its territory as a precondition to normalization. In addition, some important players in the region — Egypt, Cyprus, Greece, Russia — are skeptical over an Israeli detente with Ankara. Indeed, an overly hurried reconciliation might not necessarily be in Israel’s best interest, argued Efrat Aviv, a Turkey expert at Bar-Ilan University. It is true that the events of the last few days testify to an increased closeness between Ankara and Jerusalem, she said. “But,” she added, “I wonder if we really need this right now, a final reconciliation agreement.” ‘The way things are today, it is not in Israel’s strategic interest to rush to fix ties with Turkey’ During a recent visit to Turkey, Israeli diplomats told her that the status quo is actually not so bad. Trade relations are good, she explained, tourism is up, and Israel is participating in cultural festivals in Turkey and generally has little to complain about. “Why do we need to pay the price and give in to Turkey’s demands to improve ties, given the country’s current volatile state?” Israel did well to apologize for the Marmara incident, when IDF troops boarded a Gaza-bound aid ship and, when attacked, killed nine Turkish citizens, and to pledge to pay reparations to the families of the deceased, she said. Advertisement “We needed to do that because we’re a moral country. But I suggest not rushing into signing a reconciliation agreement. Maybe it’s not nice to take advantage of another country’s weak situation, but we need to look out for our national interests. Turkey is struggling with terrorism and we could help them. Turkey thus needs us more than we need them. The way things are today, it is not in Israel’s strategic interest to rush to fix ties with Turkey.” While Erdoğan is keenly interested in restoring ties with Israel, Aviv continued, he is giving Israel few reasons to believe he is sincere about true reconciliation. “If tomorrow there’s another war with Hamas, will he again say that we’re worse than Hitler? Why do we rush to normalize relations with a country that supports Hamas, promotes anti-Semitism and terrorism?” Even if Jerusalem and Ankara were to sign an agreement in the near future, “there won’t be a honeymoon” as long as an unreformed Erdoğan is in power, Aviv ventured. “There is a lack of trust here, and that is not going away so fast.” Eventually, she allowed, restoring full diplomatic ties is desirable. “But let us take some time. Let’s build up bilateral relations slowly. Let them prove that they are really interested in reconciliation. Let’s first see a real change in their behavior.”

Advertisement Gold’s arrival, on Sunday afternoon, marked the highest-level visit to Turkey from an Israeli official since the 2010 Mavi Marmara incident, which had sent bilateral ties into the abyss. When İrem Aktaş, a member of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s ruling AK Party, tweeted on Saturday that she wished for the death of the Israelis wounded in the attack, the party quickly initiated disciplinary proceedings against her. “These are all things that we haven’t seen before in bilateral relations,” said Nimrod Goren, a Turkey expert at Hebrew University. “Look for example at Davutoğlu’s letter to Netanyahu. It represents some sort of direct communication, if not verbal, between the two leaders, and that is something we haven’t seen in a long time.” This, together with Gold’s visit and the efficient cooperation by the authorities on the ground, are clear signs that “the diplomatic mechanism is working,” said Goren, who also heads Mitvim — The Israeli Institute Regional Foreign Policies. “The level of cooperation, on a working level but also on a diplomatic level, is more intense that it had been in the past. And apparently it’s going quite well; so far we’ve heard no complaints from one side about the other.” That fact that Aktaş’ hateful tweet was quickly and forcefully rejected by higher-ups in Erdoğan’s party indicates that verbal attacks against Israel are being delegitimized in today’s Turkey, Goren added. “All of these developments together form a picture showing open lines of communication and that Turkey is trying to project a better atmosphere,” he said. Advertisement And yet, this cautious rapprochement by no means guarantees that Jerusalem and Ankara will soon finalize a reconciliation agreement and fully normalize diplomatic ties, he believes. “There are concrete disagreements before it can be signed, and they are not removed by the most recent events. But what this development does achieve is creating a more relaxed atmosphere to conduct these negotiations in.” Addressing reporters in the Foreign Ministry’s situation room Saturday night, Netanyahu reiterated that Israel is constantly trying to reach an agreement that will lead to normalization of ties with the Turks. “This matter is being delayed not because of frivolous reasons,” he said, “but because of fundamental issues about which we are trying to reach an understanding with them. There was a certain progress, and I hope that it will continue.” Netanyahu is referring to Gaza — Ankara requests Israel lift its naval blockade of the Strip, which Israel opposes adamantly — as well as Jerusalem’s concern over senior Hamas leaders based in Turkey. Israel demands Turkey prevent any Hamas activity from its territory as a precondition to normalization. In addition, some important players in the region — Egypt, Cyprus, Greece, Russia — are skeptical over an Israeli detente with Ankara. Indeed, an overly hurried reconciliation might not necessarily be in Israel’s best interest, argued Efrat Aviv, a Turkey expert at Bar-Ilan University. It is true that the events of the last few days testify to an increased closeness between Ankara and Jerusalem, she said. “But,” she added, “I wonder if we really need this right now, a final reconciliation agreement.” ‘The way things are today, it is not in Israel’s strategic interest to rush to fix ties with Turkey’ During a recent visit to Turkey, Israeli diplomats told her that the status quo is actually not so bad. Trade relations are good, she explained, tourism is up, and Israel is participating in cultural festivals in Turkey and generally has little to complain about. “Why do we need to pay the price and give in to Turkey’s demands to improve ties, given the country’s current volatile state?” Israel did well to apologize for the Marmara incident, when IDF troops boarded a Gaza-bound aid ship and, when attacked, killed nine Turkish citizens, and to pledge to pay reparations to the families of the deceased, she said. Advertisement “We needed to do that because we’re a moral country. But I suggest not rushing into signing a reconciliation agreement. Maybe it’s not nice to take advantage of another country’s weak situation, but we need to look out for our national interests. Turkey is struggling with terrorism and we could help them. Turkey thus needs us more than we need them. The way things are today, it is not in Israel’s strategic interest to rush to fix ties with Turkey.” While Erdoğan is keenly interested in restoring ties with Israel, Aviv continued, he is giving Israel few reasons to believe he is sincere about true reconciliation. “If tomorrow there’s another war with Hamas, will he again say that we’re worse than Hitler? Why do we rush to normalize relations with a country that supports Hamas, promotes anti-Semitism and terrorism?” Even if Jerusalem and Ankara were to sign an agreement in the near future, “there won’t be a honeymoon” as long as an unreformed Erdoğan is in power, Aviv ventured. “There is a lack of trust here, and that is not going away so fast.” Eventually, she allowed, restoring full diplomatic ties is desirable. “But let us take some time. Let’s build up bilateral relations slowly. Let them prove that they are really interested in reconciliation. Let’s first see a real change in their behavior.”

Will Saturday’s devastating terror attack in Istanbul lead to an improvement in bilateral ties between Ankara and Jerusalem? Those looking for a silver lining to the tragic event in which three Israeli civilians (and an Iranian) were killed can point to the smooth cooperation and the sympathetic messages exchanged by officials from both countries. But while several signals indicate that some sort of detente is in the offing, experts on Israel-Turkey ties warn that a full-fledged reconciliation might still not be around the corner. The coordination between Israeli and Turkish officials dealing with the immediate aftermath of the attack on Istanbul’s pedestrian Istiklal avenue was excellent, according to people on the ground. “The Health Ministry, Prime Minister’s Office, the hospitals — even the funeral homes were amazing,” said diplomat Shira Ben Tzion, who was in charge of Israel’s Istanbul consulate at the time of the attack. “We are used to hostility on the streets,” she told Yedioth Ahronoth, “but in this case, from the moment we said we’re from the Israeli Consulate, they embraced us straight away and treated us nicely.” Even on a much higher level, Saturday’s attack seemed to bring the two sides closer together. On Saturday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received a letter of condolence from his Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoğlu, a man not usually know for his high regard for Israel’s current political leadership.

(MENAFN- The Journal Of Turkish Weekly) Israel hailed the sincere and very helpful cooperation it has received from Turkish officials in the immediate aftermath of deadly Istanbul attack in which its three citizens have been killed and envisaged this good as a way to help talks for the normalization of relations strained after the Mavi Marmara crisis of 2010. Dore Gold general-director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry has arrived in Istanbul during the late afternoon and was scheduled to meet with Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirliolu and Istanbul Governor Vasip ahin. “The cooperation we have received from the Turkish officials was very sincere and very helpful” an Israeli diplomatic source toldHürriyet Daily Newson March 20. “It was more than 100 percent” added the source. Three Israeli citizens identified as 60-year-old Simha Simon Demri 40 year-old Yonathan Suher and 70-year-old Avaham Godman along with an Iranian a 31-year-old Ali Rza Khalman were killed in a suicide bomb attack on March 19 in Istanbul’s busy stiklal Street. Turkish police said identified the perpetrator as Mehmet 24-year-old Öztürk who had links with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The Israeli diplomat’s meeting with the Istanbul governor overwhelmingly focused on the details of the attack. Gold’s meeting with Sinirliolu has particular significance as the two diplomats have long been crafting a deal that would reconcile bilateral relations between the two countries. They negotiated an agreement in two meetings last year in Rome and in Geneva that would let the Israeli state pay compensation to the families of the Mavi Marmara victims and to allow unrestricted Turkish humanitarian access to Gaza. Gold and Sinirliolu negotiated these issues for a first time at a meeting in Turkey and diplomatic sources said the aforementioned negotiations would be on the two men’s agenda. “What we saw from the Turkish officials was the good will [in the aftermath of attack]. It was very clear. We can use this for widening the volume of our relations” the diplomatic source said. Not only the level of cooperation but the way Turkey expressed its sorrow over the killing of Israeli citizens have also been appreciated by Israeli officials. Prime MinisterAhmet Davutoluhas sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing his condolences to the people ofIsraelon behalf of the Turkish people.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke to his Israeli counterpart Reuven Rivlin by telephone on Wednesday, expressing his condolences for the deaths of three Israelis in the March 19 Istanbul terrorist bombing. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Terror is terror, life is life, and blood is blood, whether it is in Istanbul, Brussels, Paris or Jerusalem, Rivlin said; we must all stand together in the fight against this terrible evil. Erdoğan responded, telling Rivlin that Israel and Turkey need to stand together in the face of terrorism, along with the international community, and take a firm stance. Presidents Erdogan and Rivlin. A warm conversation. (Photo: AP, AFP, Emil Salman) This rare conversation, another indication of warming relations between Turkey and Israel following the attack in Istanbul, comes after Erdoğan sent a condolence letter to Rivlin. The last conversation between Erdoğan and an Israeli leader was three years ago, when PM Netanyahu and President Erdoğan spoke on the phone during US President Obama's visit to Israel. Rivlin thanked Erdoğan for sending the condolence letter, and the Turkish president responded by further emphasizing his sorrow for the fate of the Israeli victims. Rivlin thanked Erdoğan once more, and expressed his condolences for the Turkish people, saying that he'd like to thank President Erdoğan for all the care he expressed towards the Israeli citizens, and for his help in bringing the victims back to Israel with dignity. Foreign Ministry Director General in Istanbul Foreign Ministry Director General Dr. Dore Gold visited Istanbul on Sunday, arriving at the scene of the attack that killed three Israelis: Avraham Goldman, Simcha Damari and Yonatan Shor. This is the first visit by the Foreign Ministry Director in Turkey in the past five years. Gold stated that bilateral relations are taking a step forward, as Israel and Turkey find themselves on the same side in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism. He expressed his hope that with good will and understanding, the two sides can reach an agreement, citing similar statements from Turkish officials as a positive indication of success. Gold toured the Istikalal Street area, where the attack occurred, alongside Gilad Cohen, Deputy Director of Coordination in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The two met with members of the Jewish community, including the chief rabbi of Turkey, Ishak Haleva. They also met with Israeli emissaries in Turkey and comforted them in these hard times.

Gold expressed his appreciation for the Turkish authorities' work in helping Israeli victims of the attack, removing bureaucratic obstacles and expediting processes. When asked if he believed the terrorists targeted the Israeli tourists, Gold said the investigation will take time, and that Turkish authorities were working intensively on finding answers for questions such as that one.

Turkish security officials say that since the attack caused 40 casualties, and a third of them Israelis, it is difficult to assess whether the terrorist intended to specifically target the Israeli tourists. It seems that he sought to harm a large crowd of people. Security officials believe that if he wanted to harm Israelis in particular, he would have entered the restaurant where they were dining earlier and blown himself up inside it. Turkey informed Israel of progress in investigating the attack and also gave Israel information about the terrorist, who is known as an ISIS operative.

News article:
Turkey and Israel are currently in negotiations to normalize their diplomatic relations, which have been frozen since the 2010 Mavi Marmara raid when Israeli special forces killed 10 Turkish nationals on a ship carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Although reciprocal talks were reportedly kept behind the scenes since the diplomatic tensions began, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's statement openly giving a green light to such efforts for the first time since the Mavi Marmara raid hit the headlines. Considering Israel's isolation and plans to transfer Israeli natural gas to Europe, the situation is ripe for normalizing ties with Turkey, which sees this move as a step to contribute to the Palestinian cause and to gain a fresh ally in the troubled region. Turkey's being hit with two recent terror attacks in its capital and at the heart its economy within a week has become an opportunity for the two countries to establish closer contacts with each other. While Israel has for the first time condemned the March 13 Ankara bombing at the prime ministerial level after a long wait, Erdoğan conveyed his condolences to his Israeli President Reuven Rivlin for the three Israeli citizens killed in the DAESH suicide attack on Istanbul's İstiklal Avenue last week. With Rivlin's calling Erdoğan in the first high-ranking official contact for some time, the incidents have paved the way for the two countries to re-establish closer ties.As the latest attack showed, neither country is safe even for their citizens outside their borders, as terror attacks can strike at any time in any place. This development also left questions regarding whether the two countries can accelerate their reconciliation talks within the framework of cooperation in security and intelligence while entering the 67th year of diplomatic ties.As Turkey is confronting multiple terror campaigns by the PKK and its affiliated groups in addition to Bashar Assad and DAESH with the five-year civil war in its southern neighbor Syria, Israel also recognizes the growing and deepening threat from DAESH for the country and the region as a whole, as DAESH has already become established in Syria to Israel's north.Against the escalated surge of terror, Ankara reiterates that it is determined in the fight against any terror without any "our terrorist, your terrorist" understanding, and with this perspective, the country wants to play a role in facilitating peace in the region."Turkey still has good communication channels with important actors in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, but it has to rebuild its connections with Israel and Egypt if it wants to completely fulfil its potential as a regional power," Gallia Lindenstrauss, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said.Regarding Turkey's position in the region, she also said that "such communication channels have only become more significant following the Arab upheavals and not less significant."Nimrod Goren, chairman of Mitvim, the Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, pointed to the unification process on Cyprus and the necessity to restore constructive political dialogue between Turkey and Egypt."For Israel, it will be good to have Turkey get closer to the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean, some of which are currently concerned with Israel-Turkey reconciliation due to their differences with Turkey. The Eastern Mediterranean can and should become a zone of cooperation and win-win policies rather than a zone of conflict and zero-sum diplomacy," he said.The 67-year history of bilateral ties started in 1949 when the two countries encountered rising threats to their national security in the region and a development in relations was sought. The same scenario might be witnessed now in a time in which both countries suffer from terror as well. Historical experience has proven the two countries have struggled together against different threats in the region or, at least, have broken the ice following several tense periods.Turkey's relations with Israel have never been independent from its ties with Western countries under the scope of NATO and Arab states. Although among the 13 countries that voted against the U.N. Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947, Turkey later recognized Israel on March 3, 1949, 10 months after the country was established. Concerning these initial contacts, the Turkish president at the time, İsmet İnönü, is described in the Israel State Archives of Prime Minister's Office as the " father of the relations ."The first major crisis in bilateral relations rose with the threat from pan-Arabism led by Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, especially after Israel's Sinai campaign backed by Britain and France. Nasser's constant threats to Turkey and its pro-Western partner Iraq in the Baghdad Pact caused Turkey to downgrade its relations with Israel from minister to charge d'affaires.Only 45 days later, however, following a pro-Nasser coup in Iraq in 1958, a secret meeting between then Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion together with top-diplomat Golda Meir, became the precursor to a new era in bilateral relations. To keep the meeting a secret, two Israeli officials were even delivered to a plane to land at Ankara in an ambulance for security reasons after arriving at Istanbul's Atatürk International Airport.In the meeting, Israel took the first step to form a peripheral pact in the region together with Iran and Ethiopia. According to the agreement, which would remain undisclosed for many years, the two sides initiated security and intelligence cooperation alongside other areas of collaboration in unity against Nasser's pan-Arabist policies. Photos archived in Israel's Government Press Office Israel's first President Haim Weizman (L) and Seyfullah Esin, the first Turkish envoy to Israel after the accredition ceremony in Rehovot on July 3, 1950. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy (L) shaking hands with his Turkish counterpart Tansu Çiller after signing an agreement during his visit to Ankara on April 9, 1997. During Turgut Özal's time as prime minister between 1983 and 1991, Turkey managed to juggle ties with the Palestinians and Israel. Despite condemning the Sabra and Shatilla Massacres that occurred in 1982 and establishing good relations with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the growing threat from the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) and the PKK starting a conflict that would continue for more than three decades led to a turning point in security and intelligence cooperation with Israel. Even with right-wing Likud as the ruling party of Israel, none would be worse off for keeping this level of cooperation. Furthermore, Israel starting a peace process with the Arabs in the 1991 Madrid and 1993 Oslo Accords was welcomed by Turkey and encouraged Ankara to take more solid steps to develop relations. Following the two countries' presidents' reciprocal visits, both the Military Training and Cooperation Agreement and the Defense Industrial Cooperation Agreement were signed in 1996, paving the way for annual meetings between the two countries' intelligence officials, especially regarding handling the PKK. As a symbolic figure of the army at the time, Deputy Chief of Staff Çevik Bir with Israel Defense Ministry Director-General Major General David Ivri, who were the pioneers of these bolstered ties. This cooperation reached a peak with the capture of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in 1999 thanks to help from Israel's Mossad. The close ties inherited from the previous decades were protected as the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) came to power in 2002, although several crises and bilateral rows were also experienced. Contrary to stereotypical comments labeling the AK Party as Islamist, Ankara continued to bolster ties with Israel and it began to play a mediatory role in peace talks between Israel and Syria.Yet, the Cast Lead Operation to Gaza in 2008, which started a couple of days after then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's visit to Turkey and meeting with then Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, became the first spark in the downfall of relations.With the "one-minute" incident in Davos, in which Erdoğan walked off the stage after a heated exchange with then Israeli President Shimon Peres after a panel discussion on Gaza, together with the January 2010 incident when Danny Ayalon, the Israeli deputy foreign minister, publicly humiliated Turkish ambassador Oğuz Çelikkol during a press conference at the Knesset, relations rapidly deteriorated.With the Mavi Marmara raid in 2010, which left 10 people dead and 55 wounded after a flotilla organized by the international Free Gaza Movement and the İHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation İHH was raided by Israeli forces in international waters, relations were downgraded to charge d'affaires.Arab uprisings in the following year and the dramatic changes shaping the region's future took a negative turn when the civil war erupted in Syria. As the war-torn country continues to see many global powers and regional actors conduct proxy wars, DAESH still remains the most serious threat to all parties.Ankara continues to highlight the threat from the PKK and its Syrian affiliate Democratic Union Party (PYD). The PYD plans to expand its territory throughout northern Syria, leading Ankara to regard its efforts as a threat to its national security.In such an atmosphere, Ankara might try into re-establishing cooperation in terms of intelligence and security, and the tragic event in Istanbul last week could be the point for seeking further rapprochement with Israel.Although Lindenstrauss pointed out that reciprocal mistrust still exists and can burden future cooperation, she said that the DAESH attack in Istanbul required collaboration between both sides, and Israeli representatives gave the matter considerable attention."The further inquiry into the circumstances of this event, for example, whether Israelis were specifically targeted in the attack or just unlucky bystanders, can perhaps serve as a micro test of the potential for better cooperation between the two states."Speaking to Daily Sabah, Turkey's ambassador in Tel Aviv before the Mavi Marmara raid, Çelikkol, said that such cooperation has always existed and that it is difficult to imagine it being terminated completely."This [cooperation] can continue; there is no problem in it. However, we have to mention that there is a normalization process of relations and it is greatly desired. There were several conditions from Turkey and some of them have been met."Ankara insists that all of its conditions must be met, including ending the Gaza blockade and compensation for the Turkish activists killed in the Mavi Marmara raid. The only condition that Israel has satisfied so far came when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for the raid in 2013.Çelikkol, who is also the author of the book "One Minute'ten Mavi Marmara'ya: Türkiye-İsrail Çatışması" (From One Minute to Mavi Marmara: The Turkey-Israel Conflict), stressed that balances in the Middle East are changing with Russia's military presence in Syria, something that really greatly Turkey and Israel, with a normalization of relations being crucial considering the circumstances."The first step of this would be appointing ambassadors and maintaining relations from this level. This is an obligation."Regarding relations, Lindenstrauss also said: "Normalization in relations between Israel and Turkey can also mean a return to greater NATO-Israel collaboration, and this can have an indirect and positive effect also on Turkey's security."Goren thinks that cooperation should extend further than it has done so before. He said: "The cooperation between the two countries should go beyond the security realm. It should also include economic cooperation – especially in regards to the Eastern Mediterranean natural gas – more extensive interactions between civil society, journalists and academics as well as increased Turkish involvement in efforts to promote Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Arab conflict resolution."

News article:
Turkey and Israel are currently in negotiations to normalize their diplomatic relations, which have been frozen since the 2010 Mavi Marmara raid when Israeli special forces killed 10 Turkish nationals on a ship carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Although reciprocal talks were reportedly kept behind the scenes since the diplomatic tensions began, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's statement openly giving a green light to such efforts for the first time since the Mavi Marmara raid hit the headlines. Considering Israel's isolation and plans to transfer Israeli natural gas to Europe, the situation is ripe for normalizing ties with Turkey, which sees this move as a step to contribute to the Palestinian cause and to gain a fresh ally in the troubled region. Turkey's being hit with two recent terror attacks in its capital and at the heart its economy within a week has become an opportunity for the two countries to establish closer contacts with each other. While Israel has for the first time condemned the March 13 Ankara bombing at the prime ministerial level after a long wait, Erdoğan conveyed his condolences to his Israeli President Reuven Rivlin for the three Israeli citizens killed in the DAESH suicide attack on Istanbul's İstiklal Avenue last week. With Rivlin's calling Erdoğan in the first high-ranking official contact for some time, the incidents have paved the way for the two countries to re-establish closer ties.As the latest attack showed, neither country is safe even for their citizens outside their borders, as terror attacks can strike at any time in any place. This development also left questions regarding whether the two countries can accelerate their reconciliation talks within the framework of cooperation in security and intelligence while entering the 67th year of diplomatic ties.As Turkey is confronting multiple terror campaigns by the PKK and its affiliated groups in addition to Bashar Assad and DAESH with the five-year civil war in its southern neighbor Syria, Israel also recognizes the growing and deepening threat from DAESH for the country and the region as a whole, as DAESH has already become established in Syria to Israel's north.Against the escalated surge of terror, Ankara reiterates that it is determined in the fight against any terror without any "our terrorist, your terrorist" understanding, and with this perspective, the country wants to play a role in facilitating peace in the region."Turkey still has good communication channels with important actors in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, but it has to rebuild its connections with Israel and Egypt if it wants to completely fulfil its potential as a regional power," Gallia Lindenstrauss, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said.Regarding Turkey's position in the region, she also said that "such communication channels have only become more significant following the Arab upheavals and not less significant."Nimrod Goren, chairman of Mitvim, the Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, pointed to the unification process on Cyprus and the necessity to restore constructive political dialogue between Turkey and Egypt."For Israel, it will be good to have Turkey get closer to the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean, some of which are currently concerned with Israel-Turkey reconciliation due to their differences with Turkey. The Eastern Mediterranean can and should become a zone of cooperation and win-win policies rather than a zone of conflict and zero-sum diplomacy," he said.The 67-year history of bilateral ties started in 1949 when the two countries encountered rising threats to their national security in the region and a development in relations was sought. The same scenario might be witnessed now in a time in which both countries suffer from terror as well. Historical experience has proven the two countries have struggled together against different threats in the region or, at least, have broken the ice following several tense periods.Turkey's relations with Israel have never been independent from its ties with Western countries under the scope of NATO and Arab states. Although among the 13 countries that voted against the U.N. Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947, Turkey later recognized Israel on March 3, 1949, 10 months after the country was established. Concerning these initial contacts, the Turkish president at the time, İsmet İnönü, is described in the Israel State Archives of Prime Minister's Office as the " father of the relations ."The first major crisis in bilateral relations rose with the threat from pan-Arabism led by Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, especially after Israel's Sinai campaign backed by Britain and France. Nasser's constant threats to Turkey and its pro-Western partner Iraq in the Baghdad Pact caused Turkey to downgrade its relations with Israel from minister to charge d'affaires.Only 45 days later, however, following a pro-Nasser coup in Iraq in 1958, a secret meeting between then Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion together with top-diplomat Golda Meir, became the precursor to a new era in bilateral relations. To keep the meeting a secret, two Israeli officials were even delivered to a plane to land at Ankara in an ambulance for security reasons after arriving at Istanbul's Atatürk International Airport.In the meeting, Israel took the first step to form a peripheral pact in the region together with Iran and Ethiopia. According to the agreement, which would remain undisclosed for many years, the two sides initiated security and intelligence cooperation alongside other areas of collaboration in unity against Nasser's pan-Arabist policies.

Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy (L) shaking hands with his Turkish counterpart Tansu Çiller after signing an agreement during his visit to Ankara on April 9, 1997. During Turgut Özal's time as prime minister between 1983 and 1991, Turkey managed to juggle ties with the Palestinians and Israel. Despite condemning the Sabra and Shatilla Massacres that occurred in 1982 and establishing good relations with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the growing threat from the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) and the PKK starting a conflict that would continue for more than three decades led to a turning point in security and intelligence cooperation with Israel. Even with right-wing Likud as the ruling party of Israel, none would be worse off for keeping this level of cooperation. Furthermore, Israel starting a peace process with the Arabs in the 1991 Madrid and 1993 Oslo Accords was welcomed by Turkey and encouraged Ankara to take more solid steps to develop relations. Following the two countries' presidents' reciprocal visits, both the Military Training and Cooperation Agreement and the Defense Industrial Cooperation Agreement were signed in 1996, paving the way for annual meetings between the two countries' intelligence officials, especially regarding handling the PKK. As a symbolic figure of the army at the time, Deputy Chief of Staff Çevik Bir with Israel Defense Ministry Director-General Major General David Ivri, who were the pioneers of these bolstered ties. This cooperation reached a peak with the capture of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in 1999 thanks to help from Israel's Mossad.

News article:
Turkey and Israel started talks to normalize diplomatic relations during a meeting in Switzerland in early February, and delegations from the two countries will continue the efforts to successfully finalize it on Tuesday. According to Israeli sources, there have been several draft statements regarding provisions of the normalization agreement exchanged between Turkish and Israeli officials since the latest meeting. While President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in previous statements stressed the significance of the meetings that are to be held in April, Ankara's priority for the meeting is easing the blockade on Gaza. It is expected that due to the positive attitude from both sides that all complications will be addressed. Speaking to Daily Sabah on Tuesday, Dr. Gallia Lindenstrauss from the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Israel drew attention to the positive attitudes from both the Turkish and Israeli sides and Dr. Fahrettin Altun, the Istanbul coordinator for the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA), said that although it is an ongoing process, normalization between the two countries is necessary. Additionally, Şalom newspaper columnist Karel Valansi similarly touched on the positive attitude in the meetings, saying: "A deal is possible with the good will of both sides." According to reports in the Israeli Haaretz daily, the Wednesday meeting is considered a first in diplomatic traffic due to a meeting being signaled by the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rather than being announced through media outlets. Although the location of the meeting is expected to be in Geneva, like the previous meetings, it is still undecided. Prior to today's meeting, Turkish and Israeli officials first met in December 2015 and reached a preliminary agreement to normalize relations, including the return of ambassadors to both countries, after Israel agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the relatives of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. During the meeting held in early February 2016, Turkish and Israeli officials discussed easing rather than lifting Israel's blockade of Gaza, which Ankara aims to begin rebuilding. Lindenstrauss said: "Both the Turkish president and Israeli prime minister have voiced their positive attitude toward the emerging agreement, and it is quite clear that the March 19 Istanbul terror attack in which three Israeli citizens were killed had in some respects brought the countries to better recognize some of their shared interests. "I believe the meeting will be productive in the sense that there will be certain advancement toward concluding the deal, though I'm not positive that there will not be a need for further negotiations." Altun said that the process is coming to an end and that it is not clear that Wednesday's meeting would be the final one. He added: "Turkey had always kept a positive attitude from the very beginning of the normalization process. The normalization is evidently needed for the Israeli side." Explaining that it is an ongoing process, Altun said that the normalization was expected by all and that it is a positive and productive process. Additionally, Shalom columnist Valansi said: "The situation in Gaza is always a deal breaker. There is no big conflict in Gaza and there is also the recent decision by Israel to expand permitted areas south of Wadi Gaza. We know each side's demands. A deal is possible with the good will of both sides. I think they may manage to reconcile." Valansi also said that there are many positive messages as well as a will to leave the Mavi Marmara incident behind. During his visit to Africa in early January, Erdoğan said that an improvement of ties would benefit both countries and that Turkey aims to repair the electricity infrastructure in Gaza and send aid material to Gaza through Turkey. With the meeting in February held shortly after Erdoğan's meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, which was considered the latest sign of a thaw in bilateral relations, the meeting today will once again be held after Erdoğan received a delegation of members from Jewish associations in the United States last week. shortlink copied KEYWORDS homepage

News article:
Turkey and Israel held a fresh round of talks Thursday in an effort to normalize ties after relations were partially frozen five years ago, said Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. NATO member Turkey was a key regional ally of Israel until the two countries fell out in 2010 over the deadly storming by Israeli commandos of a Turkish aid ship, the Mavi Marmara, bound for Gaza. After several years of acrimonious accusations, two sides met in December in secret talks to seek a rapprochement, with another round of high-level talks taking place in February in Geneva. "Meetings with Israel have been taking place for a while and they are continuing today," Davutoglu said in Ankara. "If our demands are received favorably, then the next steps will be clear and the necessary announcements will be made to the public." An Israeli official confirmed the meeting was taking place, but its location was not made public. Previous meetings are believed to have been conducted in Geneva. In February, Turkey said the two former allies were "close to concluding a deal". But the two sides have yet to agree on all of Turkey's conditions, with the main hurdle appearing to be the lifting of Israel's blockade on the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Turkey already got an apology for the Mavi Marmara incident, which left 10 Turkish aid activists dead, and talks have advanced on the subject of compensation for the victims. Analysts have suggested that Turkey's desire for a rapprochement has been accelerated by the drastic worsening in ties with Moscow since the shooting down of a Russian warplane wrecked several joint projects. Ankara relies on Russia for more than half its natural gas imports and Turkey now has its eyes on Israeli gas reserves. Batu Aksoy, the CEO of Turkish energy firm Turcas Petrol, told local media that at least 15 energy companies wanted to be part of a planned consortium to carry Israel gas to Europe, and that the first Israeli gas may reach Turkey in the next five years. Aside from the Mavi Marmara incident, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had raised hackles in Israel with his sometimes inflammatory rhetoric towards the Jewish state. But in a highly symbolic encounter, Erdogan last week met representatives of Jewish organizations in the U.S. to discuss the fight against terrorism and racism. Another sign of a thaw came when Israeli President Reuven Rivlin phoned Erdogan to thank him for his compassion after a suicide bombing in Istanbul last month left three Israelis dead.

Diplomatic officials told Arutz Sheva that the meeting between Israeli officials Yosef Ciechanover and Yaakov Nagel and officials in Ankara dealt with issues still in dispute between the sides, but no consensus was reached on those issues. At present, it is unclear when and if talks will resume, but Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in recent days that the Turks believe that the talks will culminate in an agreement. Earlier on Thursday, senior sources in the Israeli security establishment said Turkey was playing a "double game" in rapprochement talks with Israel. "There isn't really anyone to talk with in Turkey. At this point they're using us to pressure the Russians," the sources said as cited by Walla. The sources noted that the normalization talks were largely motivated by Turkey's desire to buy gas from Israel, and even at the start of the talks last December sources revealed there were plans to discuss a pipeline from Israel to Turkey later on. In recent months there were repeated reports about breakthroughs in talks between the parties, but Israel continues to insist that Turkey prevent Hamas personnel from entering its territory as part of an agreement. In recent weeks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been conveying a series of messages to Jerusalem both publicly and through diplomatic channels regarding his desire to come to a reconciliation agreement. Last week, the Turkish president met in Washington with the leaders of major American Jewish organizations, telling them that he hoped to come to an agreement with Israel as soon as possible. In another development, following last month's terrorist attack in Istanbul in which three Israelis were among the dead, Erdogan sent a condolence letter to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. Several days later, the two presidents spoke by phone at Rivlin's initiative.

News article:
Turkish and Israeli negotiators are having talks at an undisclosed location in pursuit of a reconciliation agreement to resume normalized relations. Both countries have a lot to gain from détente, and any step toward easing tensions in the Middle East should be cause for celebration. As a former member of Turkish Parliament, who has vocally supported closer Turkish-Israeli ties and a “peace pipeline” carrying Israeli gas to Turkey via Cyprus, it is encouraging to see that the talks that started in June 2015 have come this far. However, I have serious concerns about the shaky foundations of Turkish-Israeli rapprochement, and remain unconvinced about its sustainability. Turkey’s government mouthpieces – notorious for their anti-Semitic and anti-Israel vitriol – seem to be in a celebratory mood about the apparently impending reconciliation. A pro-government daily, for example, published not only a front-page endorsement of normalization but accompanied it with news of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s plans to serve as a witness at a wedding in an Istanbul synagogue. Last week, the media ran similar praise for Erdoğan’s meeting with Jewish-American leaders during his Washington visit. Such positive coverage is an extraordinary development in a country that, according to the Anti-Defamation League, harbors higher levels of anti-Semitism than Iran. The U-turn of the pro-government media, which only a year ago aired a documentary alleging a millennia-long Jewish conspiracy to dominate the world, is curious, to say the least. Also curious are the new public-diplomacy efforts at the Foreign Ministry. Ankara’s consulate and congregants of a Modern-Orthodox synagogue in New York will co-organize a conference this Sunday on the “Inclusion and Prosperity of Ottoman Turkish Sephardi Jews.” The conference marketing proudly features a photo of the recently restored Grand Synagogue in the city of Edirne, which is being billed as a monumental testimony to the Turkish state’s embrace of its Jewish citizens. Somehow, the conference organizers neglected to recall the Edirne governor’s appalling pledge that he would not allow Jews to worship in the synagogue, let alone the 1934 pogroms that cleansed the area from Jews in the first place. Erdoğan’s Islamist-rooted Justice and Democracy Party (AKP), which has ruled Turkey since 2002, is attempting to paper over some ugly truths. The AKP is desperate to overhaul its failed foreign policy – including an ongoing crisis with Russia, fear of Iran’s rising regional hegemony, and the collapse of Turkey’s vision for Muslim Brotherhood rule in Egypt and Syria. With its list of regional enemies mounting, the AKP hopes to steer Turkey back to its traditional allies: the European Union, NATO, and Israel. This is why Erdoğan recently toned down his anti-Western rhetoric and miraculously come to appreciate the transactional relationships he can establish with pragmatic counterparts, rather than the Islamists he was courting just months ago. Turkey’s government, however, still offers frequent reminders of its hypocrisy on Jews and Israel. Following last month’s suicide bombing in Istanbul, a board member of the AKP’s women’s branch in the city tweeted her wish for the wounded Israeli tourists to have been killed. A few weeks before, a chief advisor to the president appeared in pro-government media to attack political rivals as “raising soldiers for the Jews.” The board member had to leave her post but the chief advisor is still serving. For those of us committed to combating prejudice against Turkey’s minorities, the current state of affairs poses a particular challenge. In the run-up to the Turkish-Israeli rapprochement, Turkish analysts are expected to turn a blind eye to years of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli propaganda disseminated by Turkey’s top officials and their mouthpieces. But it would be a mistake to do so. A Sephardic friend of mine once told me her parents raised her in accordance with kayades, a Judeo-Spanish word for Turkish Jews’ code of silence in the face of discrimination. Today, those seeking to point out the disingenuous premises of Erdoğan’s reconciliation attempts are forced to wrestle with kayades once again. Thankfully, some Turkish citizens have already made the right choice. On this year’s International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a handful of Turkish Jews and their non-Jewish friends launched Avlaremoz, a news site dedicated to combating anti-Semitism in Turkey. Avlaremoz means “Let’s talk” in Judeo-Spanish, and is a direct challenge to kayades. As expected, Avlaremoz was one of the few news outlets that covered the Erdoğan advisor’s remarks. Advertisement Turkish-Israeli rapprochement is important for regional stability. A sustainable relationship, however, cannot be built on hypocrisy and silence. Turkish society needs to recognize and confront the pervasive anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment that has taken hold of wide segments of the population, due in large part to the influence of the AKP. A future built on dialogue must start with genuine conversation about the wrongs of the past, but also about the dangerous politics that have led us to this perilous present. — Aykan Erdemir is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former member of the Turkish parliament.

News article:
Ankara: Turkey and Israel are on the brink of restoring their ties after a bitter falling out five years ago, the Turkish foreign ministry announced early Friday after talks in London. Nato member Turkey was a key regional ally of Israel until the two countries cut ties in 2010 over the deadly storming by Israeli commandos of a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza, which left 10 Turkish aid activists dead. After years of bitter accusations and inflammatory rhetoric, the two sides held secret talks in December to seek a rapprochement, with another round taking place in February in Geneva. “The teams made progress towards finalising the agreement and closing the gaps, and agreed that the deal will be finalised in the next meeting which will be convened very soon,” the Turkish ministry said in a statement after the fresh round of talks Thursday. Israel’s foreign ministry, contacted by AFP, declined to comment. Ankara said the latest talks in London brought together powerful Turkish foreign ministry official Feridun Sinirlioglu, Joseph Ciechanover, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israeli National Security Adviser Jacob Nagel. In an interview with Turkish newspaper Vatan on Friday, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said “significant progress has been made”, adding that the two sides were hoping to reach “a final stage” in the talks soon. Turkey had already said in February that the former allies were “close to concluding a deal”. But they had yet to agree on all of Turkey’s conditions, with the main hurdle appearing to be the lifting of Israel’s blockade on the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Israel apologised to Turkey in 2013, in what many thought would trigger a warming in ties, but tensions soared again the following year when Israel launched a massive military offensive in Gaza. Turkey’s other condition is that victims of the Mavi Marmara be compensated, and has said that talks have advanced in this regard. The Mavi Marmara was one of six ships which headed to Gaza in May 2010 carrying humanitarian supplies in a bid to break the blockade of the Strip which has been in place since 2007, shortly after Hamas won elections there. The blockade has been branded cruel and inhumane by rights groups, although Israel argues it is necessary to stop weapons smuggling. Analysts have suggested that Turkey’s desire for a rapprochement has been accelerated by the drastic worsening in ties with Moscow since the shooting down of a Russian warplane wrecked several joint projects. Ankara relies on Russia for more than half its natural gas imports and Turkey now has its eyes on Israeli gas reserves. In a highly symbolic encounter, Erdogan last week met representatives of Jewish organisations in the US to discuss the fight against terrorism and racism. “Unfortunately, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, xenophobic movements have been shifting from the periphery to the centre of politics. We have to struggle against them together,” he said. Another sign of a thaw in relations came when Israeli President Reuven Rivlin phoned Erdogan to thank him for his compassion after a suicide bombing in Istanbul last month left three Israelis dead.

Turkey, Israel make progress on deal to restore ties - Turkish ministry ISTANBUL, April 8 (Reuters) - Turkish and Israeli teams made progress towards finalising an agreement to mend ties between the two countries in talks and agreed a deal will be finalised in the next meeting to be convened very soon, the Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday. Turkey was once Israel's closest regional ally but ties collapsed in 2010 over the killing by Israeli marines of 10 Turkish pro-Palestinian activists who tried to breach the Gaza blockade. Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu, the Israeli prime minister's special envoy, Joseph Ciechanover, and acting chairman of Israel's National Security Council, General Jacob Nagel, met in London on Thursday, the Turkish ministry said in a statement. "The teams made progress towards finalising the agreement and closing the gaps, and agreed that the deal will be finalised in the next meeting which will be convened very soon," the ministry said. It did not say what form a deal might take but Ankara has always insisted there can be no normalisation in ties with Israel unless its conditions for ending the Gaza blockade and compensation for the deaths of the activists are met. Israel allows commercial goods into Gaza daily but limits the transfer of certain items such as cement and building materials as it fears militants will use them to build fortifications.

News article:
Since the end of the Cold War the most frequently discussed relations in the Middle East have been the ties between Turkey and Israel. Relations between the two countries developed quickly after the Madrid Peace Conference when relations were upgraded to the ambassadorial level. Throughout the 1990s, Turkey and Israel engaged in multiple bilateral security and military engagements. Some even considered these bilateral relations as a formula for stability in the Middle East. These relations, however, proved to be short lived when the peace process broke down and Ankara launched a more multidimensional foreign policy. Although Turkey continued to play a critical role in an attempt to relaunch peace talks between Israel and Syria in 2009, later, with the Operation Cast Lead and the Gaza flotilla crisis, relations were downgraded back to their pre-1991 level. After an apology from Israel in 2013 and the ensuing negotiations that took place between Israeli and Turkish foreign policy makers, it appears as though ties will be mended and relations will be upgraded to the ambassadorial level once again in the coming weeks. In a statement after the last meeting of the diplomats in London, the Turkish Foreign Ministry made a press statement emphasizing: "The teams made progress toward finalizing the agreement and closing the gaps, and agreed that the deal will be finalized in the next meeting, which will be convened very soon." The question is what the future of relations will look like after mending ties. Firstly, any comparison of relations with those during the 1990s will bring too many expectations for relations and pressure on foreign policy makers. The conditions that made the rapprochement possible between the two countries in the 1990s are not similar. There is no active peace process to provide significant public approval of relations in Turkey. In the 1990s, the Oslo Peace Process and the possibility of an agreement between Israel and Palestine based on a two-state solution provided important support for relations between Turkey and Israel. In the coming period, the absence of such a process will be the highest hurdle in the future of relations between the two countries. Due to the numerous current conflicts in the region, however, public opinion in Turkey seems distracted, and there is still high sensitivity to the issue. The recent, nervous voices being heard in talks of the future of bilateral ties show the presence of this sensitivity. Secondly, the geopolitical positioning of the countries is very different than that of the 1990s. Yes, in the 1990s the crises between these two countries concerning their relations with Syria played an important role in generating a common denominator and common threat perception, but today both countries have issues with the situation in Syria and their policy preferences and interests are different. Turkey's relations with the different actors in the Middle East are quite different than in the 1990s. Thirdly, the tri-lateralism that existed between Turkey, Israel and the United States is nearly nonexistent now. The normalization of Turkish-Israeli relations will definitely play a role in the relations of these two countries with the United States - the role of U.S. President Barack Obama in the apology process for the Mavi Marmara raid was very significant; however, the nature of tri-lateralism will not be on the same level that it was in the 1990s. Turkey and Israel's relations with the United States are very different compared to the aforementioned decade. It will be more bilateral than trilateral now. Of course, the two countries may find some other areas in which to work together in the changing region and could generate new areas of cooperation. There are already many speculations about the possible positioning of this normalization in the changing balance of power in the Middle East and shifting alliances. However, these are all speculations at this point and this will not change the fact that bilateral ties and the nature of relations will be very different than those in the 1990s. The absence of an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, as well as the common threat perception may make relations less stable compared to the 1990s. The public sensitivity in Turkey about the recent negotiations between Turkey and Israel demonstrate that normalization needs to be handled with care.

Turkey will not drop its demand for an end to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip in order to normalize relations with Israel, presidential spokesman İbrahim Kalın said Monday. "What happens in Gaza is unacceptable, the occupation by Israel must end," Kalın said, adding that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza must be addressed. He said that no final agreement on a text for mending ties with Israel had yet been reached and that talks would continue in the coming weeks. He also indicated that the two sides have reached a certain point on the issue of compensation for the families of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid in which 10 people were killed and 55 were wounded by Israeli forces. The Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Turkish and Israeli delegations had made progress toward finalizing a deal in talks last week. According to a statement released by the ministry, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Special Envoy Joseph Ciechanover and Israel's National Security Council acting Chairman General Jacob Nagel attended the meeting on April 7. Sinirlioğlu had previously met Israeli Foreign Ministry General-Director Dore Gold in Rome in June 2015 in efforts to normalize diplomatic relations. The Haaretz newspaper in Israel also reported that the talks in London lasted well into the night, ending just before midnight. There has been concrete progress over the last couple of months in restoring bilateral relations, long-stalled since the Mavi Marmara raid. Turkish and Israeli officials first met in December 2015 and reached a preliminary agreement to normalize relations, including the return of ambassadors to both countries, after Israel agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the relatives of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. During the meeting held in early February 2016, Turkish and Israeli officials discussed easing rather than lifting the blockade of Gaza, which Ankara aims to begin rebuilding. Ankara underscored that relations with Israel cannot be normalized unless its conditions for ending the Gaza blockade and compensation for the deaths of civilians on Mavi Marmara vessel are fulfilled. The diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Israel dates to May 2010 when Israeli commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara, a civilian vessel carrying humanitarian aid trying to break the Israeli blockade on Gaza, in international waters. The Israeli government took the first step toward reconciliation on March 24, 2013, when Netanyahu apologized for the mishandling of the raid during a conference call with then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and U.S. President Barack Obama. Since then, closed-door reconciliation talks have continued, but the agreement has been delayed due to perpetual local, general, presidential and early elections in Turkey and Israel's attack on Gaza in 2014. Russian hypocrisy in Aleppo operation Touching on the Russia-backed Syrian regime operation in Aleppo, Kalın said it is a stark example of both Bashar Assad and Russia's insincerity about peace: "We are witnessing violations [of the cease-fire] by the regime. Our concerns about the possible new flow of refugees coming from Aleppo are still continuing. "On the one hand, you reach an agreement with the contributions and support of the entire international community to stop the conflict and, on the other, you maintain those operations in Aleppo, Idlib and other places with the pretext of fighting DAESH. This is, of course, unacceptable." Regarding Ankara's position on the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its People's Protection Units (YPG) militia's role in the field in northern Syria and in the Geneva peace talks, Kalın said that Ankara's position has not changed on the issue and the PYD and YPG are not welcome at the Geneva peace talks as they continue to cooperate with PKK terrorists and the Assad regime. Ankara perceives the PYD and YPG as the Syrian offshoot of the PKK, and it has long asserted that if the PYD controls the entire area in northern Syria along the Turkish border it would constitute a threat to Turkey's national security. Following President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's visit to the U.S. two weeks ago, media outlets reported that the U.S. has persuaded Turkey for PYD to take control in the area between northern Syrian towns of Azaz and Jarablous, including the town of Manbij, which is currently under the ncontrol of Daesh terror organization. Prefacing that intense diplomacy traffic is ahead in the upcoming period, Kalın said that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will visit Turkey this week. Saudi King Salman will also be in the country starting Monday. Salman will hold bilateral talks and later participate in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit in Istanbul as well as Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Erdoğan will also pay visits to the three countries next week, Kalın said. Kalın said that as Turkish authorities, they will closely follow the case of German satirist Jan Boehmermann, who is under investigation by German prosecutors for his defamation and insults directed against Erdoğan on public broadcaster ZDF. He noted that these insults have nothing to do with the freedom of expression and press.

News article:
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he will continue to insist that the blockade of Gaza be lifted, regardless of what this stance means for Turkey-Israel relations. The two countries have been working on agreements to improve relations in recent months, in a bid to improve ties that have been strained for several years. There are still points in the final agreement that require ironing out, and work will continue in the coming weeks to mend ties, Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said following the latest round of talks between the two nations, according to Reuters. Reports of an impending breakthrough in negotiations have been circulating for months. “Meetings with Israel have been taking place for a while and they are continuing today,” Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in Ankara on Thursday, the day of the last talks. “If our demands are received favorably, then the next steps will be clear and the necessary announcements will be made to the public,” he said, according to the Times of Israel. Israel, for its part, wants Turkey to give up on the idea of letting Hamas have a command center in Istanbul. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the onus is on Turkey to mend ties. “We always wanted proper ties with Turkey, and we are not the ones who changed that direction. If it is possible, we will normalize ties. There are contacts, they are taking place, they are even making progress. There will certainly be another meeting soon. I hope that it will lead to the positive result of a reestablishment of full ties,” he was cited as saying by the Jerusalem Post. In May of 2010 Israeli special forces took over a humanitarian ship - the Mavi Marmara, en route from Turkey to the blockaded Gaza Strip. Ankara and Tel Aviv were strongly at odds as a result, and the majority of diplomatic ties was severed. Turkey promptly issued a list of demands to Israel that would work toward normalizing ties that are still at a low.

News article:
During Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu's most recent visit to the Finnish capital Helsinki, he sat down with a group of journalists, including myself, covering his trip. Most reporters were primarily interested in domestic politics and, more specifically, whether or not Davutoğlu and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had differences of opinion regarding renewed dialogue with the PKK leadership and the broader topic of counterterrorism. "There is not an inch between where myself and the president stand on fighting terrorism," he said. Others were interested in the ongoing negotiations between Turkey and Israel. When Mehmet Çelik, a correspondent for Daily Sabah, brought up reports in the Israeli media about an upcoming meeting between Turkish and Israeli officials, Davutoğlu said the two countries were making progress and an additional meeting would take place soon. Upon returning to Turkey, we discovered that the highly anticipated meeting between Turkey and Israel had already happened. The Foreign Ministry issued a written statement to confirm that Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu had met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Special Envoy Joseph Ciechanover and Israeli National Security advisor Jacob Nagel in London. The ministry said that "the parties have made progress toward finalizing the agreement and addressing their differences and have resolved to conclude the agreement in their next meeting." The announcement was quite important because the Turkish government had been quite secretive about the negotiations in recent months. In a way, the Foreign Ministry's statement made it clear that Turkey and Israel had reached a point of no return in the talks. But I still had some questions: - Had Turkish and Israeli diplomats actually finalized the agreement but decided to hold an additional meeting to get the green light from their respective governments? - Had Israel met Turkey's three conditions? - Do certain disagreements still persist? - When will the next meeting take place? - Is it still possible for the next meeting to not yield results? A senior government official with extensive knowledge of the negotiations provided the following answers: Turkey and Israel do not agree 100 percent. There are still certain hurdles we must overcome. During the final meeting, representatives from both governments will get together and try to find a middle ground. But both governments have agreed to strike a deal at the final meeting. Israel agreed to Turkey's conditions. In 2013, Netanyahu had offered a formal apology to then Prime Minister Erdoğan. Turkey and Israel have also agreed on the financial settlement that Israel is to offer to the families of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. The tentative number is around $20 million. Finally, Israel is not willing to entirely lift the Gaza blockade due to national security concerns. However, they came up with an arrangement that Turkey finds satisfactory, which would involve Israel easing the restrictions by allowing Turkey to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza. The final hurdle in the negotiations relates to the Gaza blockade. Building on Israel's proposal, Erdoğan has specifically asked the energy crisis in Gaza be addressed as part of the negotiations. There is a crippling energy crisis going on right now that creates a number of challenges for ordinary people, including restricted access to clean water. Electricity is a basic need in the 21st century, and Turkey asked for this issue to be addressed, for which it offered to dispatch power ships – vessels capable of generating power – to the area. Our sense is that the Israel is not completely opposed to the idea, but they needed some time to think. Their concern seems to be that it will set a precedent. But they will have to respond to Turkey's request in the final meeting. The final meeting between Turkey and Israel will take place within the next two weeks, which means that the two governments might strike a deal soon and enter a new period in their bilateral relations. It is extremely unlikely for the final meeting to not produce any results. Neither side wants this to continue for much longer. If Israel agrees to Turkey sending a power ship to the Eastern Mediterranean, respective ambassadors will start serving in Ankara and Tel Aviv in no time. shortlink copied Last Update: Apr 11, 2016 10:37 am

Israel agreed to Turkey's conditions. In 2013, Netanyahu had offered a formal apology to then Prime Minister Erdoğan. Turkey and Israel have also agreed on the financial settlement that Israel is to offer to the families of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. The tentative number is around $20 million. Finally, Israel is not willing to entirely lift the Gaza blockade due to national security concerns. However, they came up with an arrangement that Turkey finds satisfactory, which would involve Israel easing the restrictions by allowing Turkey to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza. The final hurdle in the negotiations relates to the Gaza blockade. Building on Israel's proposal, Erdoğan has specifically asked the energy crisis in Gaza be addressed as part of the negotiations. There is a crippling energy crisis going on right now that creates a number of challenges for ordinary people, including restricted access to clean water. Electricity is a basic need in the 21st century, and Turkey asked for this issue to be addressed, for which it offered to dispatch power ships – vessels capable of generating power – to the area. Our sense is that the Israel is not completely opposed to the idea, but they needed some time to think. Their concern seems to be that it will set a precedent. But they will have to respond to Turkey's request in the final meeting. The final meeting between Turkey and Israel will take place within the next two weeks, which means that the two governments might strike a deal soon and enter a new period in their bilateral relations. It is extremely unlikely for the final meeting to not produce any results. Neither side wants this to continue for much longer. If Israel agrees to Turkey sending a power ship to the Eastern Mediterranean, respective ambassadors will start serving in Ankara and Tel Aviv in no time. shortlink copied Last Update: Apr 11, 2016 10:37 am

Normalization of ties between Israel and Turkey hinges on reaching an agreement over humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, a senior official in Ankara said Monday.

A spokesperson for the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday said Turkey will not normalize relations with Israel until the Jewish state lifts the maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip. The spokesperson was responding to earlier claims by the Turkish Foreign Ministry, on Friday, that Turkish and Israeli negotiating teams have been finalizing a rapprochement deal. “Meetings with Israel have been taking place for a while and they are continuing today,” Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in Ankara on Thursday, Reuters reported. “If our demands are received favorably, then the next steps will be clear and the necessary announcements will be made to the public.” Israel and Turkey have been mired in a longstanding feud that originated with the 2010 Gaza flotilla incident, in which nine Turks were killed in clashes after Turkish militants attacked Israeli commandos who had boarded the flotilla. Israel takes issue with the fact that the Palestinian terror group Hamas, which controls Gaza, has its diplomatic and military headquarters in Istanbul. “It is extremely unlikely for the final meeting to not produce any results,” an anonymous Turkish official said, according to Haaretz. “Neither side wants this to continue for much longer. If Israel agrees to Turkey sending a power ship to the eastern Mediterranean, respective ambassadors will start serving in Ankara and Tel Aviv in no time.” On Sunday, the Israeli government warned its citizens visiting Turkey to leave the country as soon as they can due to serious terror threats in the wake of March’s terrorist bombing in Istanbul, in which three Israeli tourists were killed. Israeli tourists in Turkey should “avoid crowded tourist areas, follow instructions of local authorities, and get out as soon as possible,” the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Bureau said, adding that it has raised the risk of terror attacks against Israelis in Turkey to the highest level. “Real and immediate terror threats remain throughout the country,” the bureau said in a statement.

News article:
A senior adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that Israel has agreed to fully lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip, as part of a reconciliation agreement between Jerusalem and Ankara reportedly set to be finalized in the coming weeks. The adviser, Arshad Hormuz, told a Hamas-run media outlet in Gaza that Israel has also agreed to the opening of a naval route between Turkish Cyprus and Gaza. Hamas, which is internationally recognized as a terrorist organization, has had control of Gaza since a bloody 2007 coup. Hormuz added that only “technical details” remained to be settled as part of the upcoming agreement, according to Israel’s Ynet news website. There was no confirmation of the report from Israel. Israel maintains a security blockade of Gaza to prevent Hamas, which avowedly seeks to destroy the Jewish state, from importing weaponry for use against Israel. Earlier this week, Erdogan’s spokesman said the normalization of ties between Israel and Turkey hinges on reaching an agreement over humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.

The accord would come almost six years after a deadly 2010 raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish ship attempting to breach the blockade, in which 10 Turkish citizens were killed during a melee aboard the vessel. The incident led to a nosedive in already tense relations between the two countries. Turkey demanded an immediate apology, compensation for the victims’ families and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza before normal relations could resume. Advertisement Israel refused and only issued an official apology some three years later. Talks on compensation have reached advanced stages, according to reports, but one of the main hurdles has been the lifting of the Israeli blockade. Talks have also reportedly gotten hung up over Israeli demands for a commitment from Turkey to end tacit support for Hamas. After several years of chilly ties and acrimonious accusations from both sides, officials met in December in secret talks to seek a rapprochement, with another round of high-level talks taking place in February in Geneva. A bombing last month in Istanbul that left three Israelis dead also led to cooperation between the countries and high-level contacts between leaders in Ankara and Jerusalem for the first time in years.

By Dov Benoavadia YERUSHALAYIM — As talks continue between Israel and Turkey to normalize relations, the United States is considering making its own contribution to the effort – the establishment of a QIZ (Qualified Industrial Zone) in southern Turkey, in which Israel and Turkey would jointly manufacture goods and send them on to the United States, duty free. Reports Thursday said that Israeli and Turkish teams had in recent weeks conducted intensive talks about overcoming the last issues to restore diplomatic relations. Relations between the two countries were cut off in 2010 in the wake of the Marmara flotilla incident, in which IDF soldiers opened fire on Turks who had attacked them as they sought to break the naval blockade of Gaza. Nine Turks were killed in that incident. On Thursday, Israel Radio reported that talks were also under way for the QIZ. Israel already has QIZ deals with Egypt and Jordan. In both cases, products manufactured in the zones that contain at least 35 percent Israeli components, input or ownership, with the balance being that of the country that hosts the QIZ, can be imported into the U.S. tax free. Both Jordan and Egypt have repeatedly expressed their satisfaction with the arrangement, as has Israel.

The murder of the three Israelis by ISIS in Istanbul gave Israelis hope that there would be a thaw in the relations between Turkey and Israel. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter In addition, exactly three years have passed since Netanyahu—under pressure by the Obama administration—apologized for the "loss of life" during the takeover of the Marmara flotilla. "Relations will return to normal, and the embassies will return," Netanyahu promised. Erdoğan said, "Friendship between the two nations is important." Grueling negotiations then took place to bring the relationship back to its former level, which should lead to an agreement soon. Throughout this period, however, Erdoğan has slandered and attacked Israel and the Jews over and over to further his political career. Anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic incitement have proven to be great methods of recruiting a critical mass of support, even in light of the growing disgust within large segments of Turkish society with Erdoğan's autocratic rule and his Islamist party. The Turkish attitude towards Israel is very complicated. There's a segment of Turks who view Israel as a successful example of the importation of democracy and westernization into the Middle East. There are also Turks who have an historical aversion to Arabs—stemming from a sense of superiority historically and culturally—which brings them closer to Israel. Yet, most of the Turkish public is deeply anti-Semitic. This can be seen in the way they believe that Israel wants to take control of Turkey to erase and destroy its Muslim identity. Israeli President Rivlin and Turkish President Erdogan (Photo: Amil Salman, AP, AFP) It's impossible to negate the importance of conspiracy theories in Turkish society, particularly the conspiracy regarding the "Dunma"—the descendents of the Sabbateans (followers of the false prophet Sabbatai Tzvi) who converted to Islam—who are allegedly secretly working in the name of "world Jewry" to make Turkey modern, secular, and pro-Israel. During Erdoğan's first days in office, after he returned from a visit to Israel to remove his party's reputation of being "extremist Islamists," his rivals accused him of having Jewish origins. Many in the Turkish elite loathe Israel. In fact, this elite was key in protests against the decades-long cooperation between the Israeli government and Turkish military. Israel is thought of by them as a partner that suppresses human rights, suppresses Muslims, and suppresses other minorities. Geo-strategic constraints generally don't allow Israel to choose its partners based on moral values. However, does Israel want to have a real reconciliation with Turkey and have good relations with the country while it's still under the control of the "Sultan in Ankara?" With the current repression of human rights, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and suppression of the Kurdish and Christian minorities under Erdoğan's "dictatorship," Israel can hold off on racing to warm its relationship with Turkey. In fact, reconciliation will only make Israel look worse in the eyes of the Turkish moderates who do wish for better relations with Israel. In any case, there's no guarantee that if Israel agrees to Erdoğan's demands that he will be any warmer to Israel. In fact, he may even be harsher. If there is a "normalization agreement," it's in Israel's interest to downplay it. Any expression of undue importance will only harm Israel's reputation.

However, does Israel want to have a real reconciliation with Turkey and have good relations with the country while it's still under the control of the "Sultan in Ankara?" With the current repression of human rights, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and suppression of the Kurdish and Christian minorities under Erdoğan's "dictatorship," Israel can hold off on racing to warm its relationship with Turkey. In fact, reconciliation will only make Israel look worse in the eyes of the Turkish moderates who do wish for better relations with Israel. In any case, there's no guarantee that if Israel agrees to Erdoğan's demands that he will be any warmer to Israel. In fact, he may even be harsher. If there is a "normalization agreement," it's in Israel's interest to downplay it. Any expression of undue importance will only harm Israel's reputation.

News article:
Turkey has not given up its condition to lift the Gaza siege in return for normalising relations with Israel, Turkish Presidency Spokesman Ibrahim Kalın said Monday, adding that the two sides have not reached a final agreement yet and that talks would continue over the coming weeks. Al- Araby al- Jadeed news agency cited a source familiar with the Turkish foreign ministry as saying that Israel has accepted two out of three of Turkey’s conditions, including to publicly apologise for what happened in the Mavi Marmara incident and to pay $20 million in compensation for the activists' families. Israel has also agreed to facilitate the access of Turkish ships to the Gaza Strip to deliver aid. Ankara also demanded that the electricity situation in Gaza improve by sending a power generating ship. According to the source, the Israeli delegation did not object to the Turkish demand but asked for more time to consult with the government in this regard. The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday that the negotiating teams from both sides have agreed to rapidly reach a deal on normalising ties after talks in London. "The teams made progress towards finalising the agreement and closing the gaps and agreed that the deal will be finalised in the next meeting which will be convened very soon," the ministry said in a statement.

Most of the issues in a reconciliation agreement between Israel and Turkey have been agreed upon, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said Saturday, expressing the hope that a deal would be finalized soon. Speaking at a cultural event in Holon, Steinitz, who is seen as close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he did not want to get into the specifics of the agreement but that both sides “have a considerable interest” in reaching agreed terms. Asked about the question of a seaport for the Gaza Strip, Steinitz said the issue had not been discussed in the talks. (A Channel 10 report which said this issue, too, had been resolved was inaccurate, his office said.) Steinitz’s comments came two days after a senior adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that Israel has agreed to the opening of a naval route between Turkish Cyprus and Gaza. The adviser, Arshad Hormuz, also told a Hamas-run media outlet in Gaza that Israel has agreed to fully lift the blockade on Gaza as part of the agreement between Jerusalem and Ankara, which is reportedly set to be finalized in the coming weeks. Hamas, which is internationally recognized as a terrorist organization, has had control of Gaza since a bloody 2007 coup. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hormuz added that only “technical details” remained to be settled as part of the upcoming agreement, according to Israel’s Ynet news website. There was no confirmation of the report from Israel. Israel maintains a security blockade of Gaza to prevent Hamas, which avowedly seeks to destroy the Jewish state, from importing weaponry for use against Israel. Earlier this week, Erdogan’s spokesman said the normalization of ties between Israel and Turkey hinges on reaching an agreement over humanitarian aid to Gaza. Advertisement Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey insists on the “re-establishment of conditions for humanitarian aid to Gaza” and supports an independent state of Palestine “whose capital is East Jerusalem.” The accord would come almost six years after a deadly 2010 raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish ship attempting to breach the blockade, in which 10 Turkish citizens were killed during a melee aboard the vessel. The incident led to a nosedive in bilateral relations that were already tense over Israel’s military policy in Gaza. Turkey demanded an immediate apology for the 2010 raid, compensation for the victims’ families and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza before normal relations could resume. Israel refused and only issued an official apology some three years later. Talks on compensation have reached advanced stages, according to reports, but one of the main hurdles has been the lifting of the Israeli blockade. Talks have also reportedly gotten hung up over Israeli demands for a commitment from Turkey to end tacit support for Hamas. After several years of chilly ties and acrimonious accusations from both sides, officials met in December in secret talks to seek a rapprochement, with another round of high-level talks taking place in February in Geneva. A bombing last month in Istanbul that killed three Israelis also led to cooperation between the countries and high-level contacts between leaders in Ankara and Jerusalem for the first time in years.

News article:
Turkish sources assert that Turkish-Israeli governmental relations are about to come out of the deep freeze. But this is a reflection of Turkey’s regional unpopularity and glides over Turkish demands for Israel to end the blockade of Gaza. To meet Turkey’s condition, Israel would have to abandon the security arrangement it shares with Egypt — which has increased Israel’s security and has begun to pay regional dividends. To restore full relations between Israel and Turkey would irritate Russia, with which Israel has good trade and political relations, and a respectful series of understandings regarding Syria. Israel’s relations with the Kurds are also at issue here. After the 2010 Mavi Marmara flotilla — in which Turkey supported the Hamas-related Turkish organization, the IHH, in its effort to break the blockade of Gaza — Turkey made three demands of Israel: an Israeli apology for the deaths of Turkish activists; a financial settlement; and lifting the Gaza blockade, which Turkey claimed was illegal. The last would provide IHH with the victory it was unable to achieve with the flotilla. The Turkish-owned ship Mavi Marmara, which took part in the 2010 “Gaza flotilla” that attempted to break Israel’s naval blockade of Gaza. (Image source: “Free Gaza movement”/Flickr) In 2011, however, the UN Palmer Commission Report found the blockade of Gaza — jointly administered with Egypt — to be legal, and said Israel owed Turkey neither an apology nor compensation. In 2013, at the urging of President Obama and to move the conversation off the impasse, Prime Minister Netanyahu did apologize for the loss of life and agree to discuss compensation. While President Obama was pleased, Prime Minister Erdogan repaid the gesture by denigrating Israel on Turkish television and announcing he would force the end of the blockade. Israel’s condition — that the office of Hamas in Ankara be closed — was ignored. Nevertheless, in February 2014, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told Turkish television that Israel and Turkey were “closer than ever” to normalizing relations.” In December 2015, it was more of the same. And in February 2016, there was yet another announcement of imminent restoration of government-to-government ties. In March, Kurdish sources said Turkey was demanding weapons from Israel, but that Israel wanted to ensure that Turkey would not use them against Kurdish forces. Israel finds itself in an odd position — choosing among those who want its cooperation. Israel and Egypt have come to a deep understanding of the sources of instability and insecurity in Sinai, and the relationship between Hamas in Gaza and its primary sponsor, Iran, as well as ISIS. Former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz told inFOCUS magazine recently: Coordination between us is very high and very important because we have identical interests. Period. The way to achieve them might look different, but Egypt is a very important country. It is crucial to the world to ensure its stability – progress in the fight against ISIS that is present in Sinai, and protecting the Suez Canal, and other things… They are all good reasons for Egypt to take these responsibilities seriously and do something about the threats. I’m very happy to see what they’re doing. It is a good track. This month, Egypt and Saudi Arabia upgraded relations with Egypt, ceding back to the Saudis two islands that Saudi Arabia had given Egypt in 1950 to help Egypt fight Israel in the Red Sea. According to a report in the Egyptian daily al-Ahram, as reported by the Jerusalem Post, the Egyptian government informed Israel of the parameters of the deal, noting that Riyadh would be obligated to honor all of Egypt’s commitments in the peace treaty with Israel, including the presence of international peacekeepers on the islands and freedom of maritime movement in the Gulf of Aqaba. Israel approved the deal “on condition that the Saudis fill in the Egyptians’ shoes in the military appendix of the peace agreement,” according to Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon. This makes Saudi Arabia an active partner in the Camp David Accords. And it follows on the heels of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) labeling Hezbollah “a terror organization” without the weasel words the Europeans used to condemn only the “military wing” of the organization. In the face of these developments, it is hard to imagine a benefit that would accrue to Israel by negating the Israel-Egypt blockade of Gaza on behalf of Turkey. Russia presents a similar series of circumstances. Relations between Russia and Turkey have taken a nosedive over the Syrian civil war, particularly after Turkey shot down a Russian plane. But even before that, Turkey’s support of Sunni jihadist organizations was a thorn in the side of Russia, which still fears Sunni jihad inside southern Russia. Russia has goals in Syria and Israel also has requirements. In his inFOCUS interview, former Chief of Staff Gantz noted: The [Israeli] Prime Minister and Chief of Staff [Gantz’s successor] flew to Russia and had some important of discussions of intentions, deconfliction, and we expressed our interests… stability, preventing terrorist activity… preventing armament that will go from Iran through Syria to Hezbollah, or from Russia to Syria and then to Hezbollah…. People can see what it is that Israel does once in a while when it has to protect itself. Add to this Israel’s generally good economic and political relations with Russia and, again, it is hard to see the benefit that would accrue to Israel by forging closer relations with Turkey while Russia and Turkey are doing a slow burn. Turkey is doing a faster burn on the Kurds. Having waged a fierce war against Kurdish separatists in southern Turkey, the Turkish government has taken military action against the Kurds of Iraq and Syria to prevent Kurdish forces from connecting two enclaves — one in Iraq and one in Syria — that could form the geographic beginning of an independent Kurdistan. Even at the peak of Israeli-Turkish relations, Israel’s support of the Kurds has been a relatively open political secret. Although the Israeli government consistently denies providing weapons, reputable sources suggest, at a minimum, training for Kurdish forces. Most recently, Israel acknowledged buying oil from Kurdish sources in Northern Iraq, and IsraAid, an Israeli humanitarian organization, provided assistance to Kurdish refugees fleeing ISIS. Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly supported the establishment of a Kurdish state. For Israel to trade its increasingly important relations with Russia, with Egypt — and thereby with Saudi Arabia — and with the Kurds for Turkish political approval and a promise to buy Israeli natural gas would seem to be a bad deal. For Israel to accompany that with the lifting of the Israel/Egypt embargo on Gaza that would empower Hamas — and thereby the Muslim Brotherhood, Iran and ISIS — would seem an enormous risk for no gain.

News article:
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with a senior Israeli minister on the sidelines of the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, DC, held between March 31 and April 1, according to a report on Tuesday from the Israel-based i24news TV channel. According to i24news, Erdoğan met with Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz for about 20 minutes, marking the first time that the Turkish president has personally met with an Israeli official since the 2010 Mavi Marmara incident. Diplomatic sources described the meeting as "more than a handshake." The Israeli minister's office did not comment on the meeting, reported i24news Senior Diplomatic Correspondent Tal Shalev. Israeli energy minister Steinitz has promoted reconciliation talks between Turkey and Israel in recent months, as there are energy issues which concern both countries. According to a report in the Jerusalem Post, Steinitz said on Saturday that Turkey and Israel have reached an agreement on 90 percent of issues during diplomatic negotiations in recent months which aim toward a reconciliation between the two countries. On April 7, Turkish presidential spokesperson İbrahim Kalın said that Turkey will not drop its demand for an end to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip in order to normalize relations with Israel. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on April 7 that Turkish and Israeli delegations had made progress toward finalizing a deal. The ministry said Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Special Envoy Joseph Ciechanover and Acting Chairman-General Jacob Nagel of Israel's National Security Council met on April 7. Sinirlioğlu met Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Dore Gold in Rome in June 2015 in efforts to normalize diplomatic relations. There has been concrete progress over the last couple of months towards restoring bilateral relations long-stalled since the Mavi Marmara raid in 2010. A DAESH-linked bombing on March 19 in Istanbul that killed three Israelis led to cooperation between the countries, with high-level contacts between leaders in Ankara and Jerusalem for the first time in years. Turkish and Israeli officials first met openly in December 2015 and reached a preliminary agreement to normalize relations, including the mutual return of ambassadors, after Israel agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the relatives of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. During a meeting held in early February 2016, Turkish and Israeli officials discussed easing rather than lifting the blockade of Gaza, which Ankara aims to begin rebuilding. The latest diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Israel dates back to May 2010 when Israeli commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara, a civilian vessel carrying humanitarian aid which was trying to break the Israeli blockade on Gaza, while it was in international waters. The Israeli government took a step toward reconciliation on March 24, 2013, when Netanyahu, under the encouragement of U.S. President Barack Obama, apologized for the mishandling of the raid during a conference call with then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Since then, closed-door reconciliation talks have continued, but the agreement has been delayed due to local, general, presidential and early elections in Turkey, as well as Israel's attack on Gaza in 2014.

News article:
The ongoing talks on the normalisation of relations between Turkey and Israel have reached the final stage, the spokesman for the Turkish presidency revealed yesterday. Speaking at a press conference in the Turkish capital Ankara, Ibrahim Kalin said an agreement would be signed to normalise relations after a final settlement is reached on the two final conditions set by Turkey: lifting the siege on Gaza and the compensation being paid to the families of those killed on the Mavi Marmara. Turkish-Israeli relations were strained in 2010 when Israeli military forces assaulted international activists, including Turks, who were on board the Mavi Marmara ship. The activists were attempting to lift the Israeli siege on Gaza. A number of Turkish activists were killed during the Israeli forces' attack. Turkey has set a number of conditions on the return of relations with Israel, including receiving an apology for the killing of Turkish activists, paying compensation to the victims' families, in addition to lifting the siege on the Gaza Strip. The Turkish Foreign Ministry announced last month that talks are ongoing with the Israeli side on the restoration relations, but the pending point that still hinders reaching a settlement is the Turkish condition to lift the blockade on Gaza, which Israel rejects. Israeli newspapers have said that Egypt is putting pressure on Tel Aviv to prevent any Turkish role in the Gaza Strip. Egypt refuses to open the Rafah border crossing to Palestinians.

News article:
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that Israel and Turkey's negotiating teams will meet again in mid-May to try to reach a reconciliation deal. Erdogan told a press briefing in Zagreb, Croatia that the two countries are discussing the establishment of a series of humanitarian projects in Gaza relating to electricity and water, as part of the negotiations surrounding Turkish demands toward "lifting the embargo" on Gaza. Erdogan said that Turkey offered during negotiations to send a ship, anchored in Israel's Ashdod port, to provide electricity for Gaza to help cope with the Strip's severe energy crisis. He said Israel was reluctant, and offered the establishment of a power plant within Gaza, carried out between Turkey and Germany, as an alternative project. "We said that could be possible," said Erdogan. "We still haven't given up on the ship. Israel is also positive toward our proposal to address Gaza's water problem through water desalination plants or wells. There is also a need for schools and hospitals. We are seeking donors. Some have promised to contribute." A senior official in Jerusalem said that the date of the next round of Israel-Turkey talks, considered to be crucial, has not yet been determined but will presumably take place in mid-May. According to the senior official, Turkey has brought up the matter of sending a ship in the past but is no longer on the agenda. Instead, Israel has suggested other humanitarian projects Turkey can perform in Gaza. The official noted that Turkey's status in Gaza concerning Israel will not be different from any other country. The Israeli and Turkish negotiating teams met three weeks ago in London, attended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's envoy, Joseph Ciechanover and Israel's deputy National Security Adviser Jacob Nagel and Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu. The Foreign Ministry in Ankara announced after that round that progress had been made in closing the gap toward reaching a reconciliation agreement. According to the announcement, the teams agreed that the deal would be reached in the next round of talks. One of the main issues, however, is the lack of consensus on Israel's demand to stop military command from Hamas' headquarters in Istanbul.

A unanimous resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) last week obligates its commissioner to assemble a database of business entities directly or indirectly involved in Israeli settlements in disputed territories, and to present it at the UNHRC's next meeting. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The resolution does not include an enforcement mechanism, so it is toothless in that respect. However, it is not without impact.To the contrary: Unlike the hundreds of other anti-Israeli resolutions that the UNHRC has passed which didn't change a thing, in Israel or in the wider world, this one is likely to cause serious trouble. The frequent use of the geographical term "Judea and Samaria" encourages the Israeli public to forget that the international legal system considers all settlements illegal and in violation of international conventions established after World War II. It's reasonable to assume that no company will want to find itself on a blacklist of lawbreakers, regardless of the political motives of assembling such a list. The UNHRC. (Photo:AP) Even less so will they want to be on a list carrying the UN logo that's expected to be published as an official document. Being included in such a "database" would expose any company to calls for a boycott, to other companies quietly severing their business connections, and to various kinds of legal action. The conclusion: If business connections to Israeli settlements in the territories will indeed be interpreted by any corporation's legal advisers as a likely legal violation, its board of directors will vote to sever them — without hesitation and regardless of their degree of sympathy towards Israel. Labeling imported settlement products (as an EU requirement) has hit an impasse in political bureaucracy. The practical implications of this requirement in Europe are insignificant. However, the risk of being placed on a list of companies directly or indirectly involved with Israeli settlements, thus violating international law, is not trivial from any company's perspective. Business owners and managers cannot ignore this. This is not merely intimidation for intimidation's sake. As opposed to capitulating to the economic boycott of Israel led by the BDS movement — a boycott that is forbidden by law in several western countries — obeying UNHRC resolutions is legal and permitted. It may even be included in the criteria for receiving a "social business" label, along the lines of environmental friendliness or avoiding child labor. The list of Israeli companies working in the settlements is long and includes most of the business sector, from the Israel Electric Corporation to individual contractors, from banks to supermarket chains. Human Rights Watch published a report in January entitled "Occupation, Inc.: How Settlement Businesses Contribute to Israel's Violation of Palestinian Rights." The report called on business leaders to stop working in, funding, granting services to, and doing business with settlements. This is the same spirit as the UNHRC's resolution, even if its practical implementation is not expected before the blacklist's compilation. Palestinian workers at an Israeli West Bank factory. (Photo: Reuters) The UNHRC has a long history of one-sided and anti-Semitic acts against Israel. Its resolutions against us are hypocritical, immoral and disproportionate. However, the fact that not one head of government of a state friendly to us has instructed their representatives to vote against the recent resolution is a resounding failure of Israel's foreign policy, which attempts to erase the legal and political peculiarities of the settlements. This erasure will not be successful, and the more we insist on it, the greater grow the internal economic risks for Israel. The current government finds it particularly difficult to understand the view that the settlements are illegal. It's difficult for them politically because of the electorate in West Bank settlements. It's difficult for them morally because of the ministers' belief that this is the historical-religious homeland. It's difficult for them tactically because of the justified fight against BDS and its proxies. Nevertheless, under great pressure and with no alternative, Israel is coming to terms with a practical separation. Recently, in an agreement with the EU funding a multi-year university research and development project, a condition was agreed upon: That the project not cross the Green Line. Last week's UN resolution, creating a comprehensive list of companies with business connections to the settlements, increases the need for a separation such as this to the level of a national test.

Nevertheless, under great pressure and with no alternative, Israel is coming to terms with a practical separation. Recently, in an agreement with the EU funding a multi-year university research and development project, a condition was agreed upon: That the project not cross the Green Line. Last week's UN resolution, creating a comprehensive list of companies with business connections to the settlements, increases the need for a separation such as this to the level of a national test.

News article:
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday he was working to stop Palestinian knife attacks and other street violence against Israel and had offered to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to rekindle peace efforts. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas gestures as he delivers a speech in the West Bank city of Bethlehem January 6, 2016. REUTERS/Ammar Awad The remarks appeared to be an effort by the Western-backed Abbas to turn the tables on Israel, which has cast him as responsible for the diplomatic deadlock and the surge of bloodshed. Speaking to Israel’s Channel 2 TV, Abbas gave rare details on his domestic security drives, a touchy matter as many Palestinians deem such moves collaboration with their enemy. “Our security forces go into the schools to search pupils’ bags and see if they have knives. You don’t know this,” he said. “In one school, we found 70 boys and girls who were carrying knives. We took the knives and spoke to them and said: ‘This is a mistake. We do not want you to kill and be killed. We want you to live, and for the other side to live as well.’” Abbas’s administration and Israel coordinate security in the occupied West Bank despite the stalling two years ago of U.S.-sponsored negotiations on Palestinian statehood. Netanyahu says he is open to renewing talks and that Abbas has been avoiding these while inciting violence with his rhetoric against Israel. But Abbas told Channel 2 that the onus was on Netanyahu. “I will meet with him, at any time. And I suggested, by the way, for him to meet,” the Palestinian leader said in English. Asked what became of that overture, Abbas said: “No, no - it’s a secret. He can tell you about it.” Netanyahu’s office had no immediate response. Since October, Palestinian stabbings, car-rammings and gun ambushes have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens. At least 190 Palestinians, 129 of whom Israel says were assailants, have been killed by its forces. Many others were shot in clashes. Abbas’ Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under 1993 interim peace deals. Israeli forces now freely operate in PA areas, something Abbas described as sapping his credibility at home. He said he was willing to take action against Palestinians that Israeli intelligence deems a threat. “If he (Netanyahu) gives me responsibility and tells me that he believes in (the) two-state solution and we sit around the table to talk about (the) two-state solution, this will give my people hope, and nobody dares to go and stab or shoot or do anything here or there,” Abbas said. Netanyahu has said he would favor the creation of a Palestinian state as long as Israel’s terms are met such as its security needs. Whether Abbas could vouchsafe the Gaza Strip is in doubt, as it is under the de facto control of armed Hamas Islamists who oppose permanent coexistence with Israel. For his part, Netanyahu has been hazy about whether he would remove Jewish settlements in the West Bank to make way for the Palestinians. He heads a pro-settlement coalition the includes one ultra-nationalist party opposed to Palestinian statehood.

New Zealand’s former prime minister Helen Clark on Monday announced her candidacy to be the next UN secretary-general, aiming to become the first woman to lead the world body, over a decade after leading a diplomatic spat with Israel. “I am putting myself forward based on proven leadership experience over close to three decades, both in my own country and here at the United Nations,” Clark told AFP in an interview, ending months of speculation. “I do think I have the experience and the attributes to do this job.” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key formally put forward Clark as the country’s candidate at a press conference in Wellington on Monday. “Having served as the prime minister of New Zealand for nine years and held one of the top jobs in the United Nations for the past seven, Helen Clark has the right mix of skills and experience for the job,” Key said.

In 2004, Clark imposed diplomatic sanctions on Israel after New Zealand convicted two Israelis of attempting to illegally obtain New Zealand passports through ties with organized criminal gangs. Clark said she had evidence tying the two Israelis to the Mossad, and called the attempt a violation of New Zealand sovereignty by the Israeli government.

In her visit, she stated she was “just blown away” by what she saw, saying that she was “really inspired by what the young innovators had to say.” The search for a successor to Ban Ki-moon, whose tenure finishes at the end of 2016, comes at a time of high anxiety in global affairs as the United Nations grapples with the biggest refugee crisis since World War II and raging conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. Other than Clark, seven candidates including three women are vying for the top job. The candidates include UNESCO chief Irina Bokova of Bulgaria and the former High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, of Portugal.

News article:
When the League of Nations (founded in 1920 after WWI) was replaced by the United Nations in 1945, the world was hopeful that the new organization would succeed in averting another world war–a feat that the League of Nations clearly failed at. The UN prides itself in promoting international cooperation and world peace. It even won the Nobel peace prize in 2001 (but so did Yasir Arafat in 1994.) The UN current Secretary is Ban Ki-moon (since 2007.) In the first article of the UN charter, we can read their purpose for existing: 1. To maintain international peace and security, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace; 2. To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace; 3. To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and 4. To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends. There is no doubt in my mind that the original crafting of the UN charter took a lot of careful efforts from its founding members to assure that the world organization would be equipped to function properly. As a result, we have seen many decisions made by the UN that definitely helped make the world a better place. One of these decisions was the 1947 vote for the partitioning of British Mandate Palestine, that led to May 14, 1948 and the re-birth of Israel as a modern nation (33 for, 10 against, 10 abstentions.) But 1948 is nearly 70 years ago and since then, the United Nations have been less than friendly to Israel. As a matter of fact, for many years, there have been more resolutions passed against the Jewish state than the rest of the world combined (and here). For instance, in 2015, the UN adopted 23 resolutions, three against Iran, Syria and Korea and twenty against Israel. There are no indication that it will slow down in 2016. It is also very hard to forget the 16 years that it took the United Nations to revoke their 1975 resolution claiming that “Zionism is Racism.” And even if they did revoke it, the organizing of the Durban I (2001), II (2009) and III (2011) conferences against racism have shown that the target was once again almost exclusively Israel. The United Nations’ obsession with demonizing Israel is obvious to any unbiased observer. Just days ago, the unbelievable claim was made by the UN that Israel was the number one country violating women’s human rights. The UN ignored Hamas, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, ISIS, Syria to name just a few of the countries were animals are treated better than women. Yet it found Israel guilty of human rights violation against Palestinian women. Is it me or whatever comes out of the UN is officially believed as fact by a world population that certainly doesn’t care to check for accuracy as much as it cares for stigmatizing and ostracizing Israel? To add insult to injury, the UN decides to praise and promote violence, lies and murders. How do you explain the UN funded tree planting by Palestinians to honor the memory of terrorists? How sick is it to promote death and make murderers into martyrs while accusing the victims of human rights violation? This makes it very difficult for anyone who is seeking truth and fairness to not accuse the UN of antisemitism. It is a fact that a large number of UN members are Arab/Muslim nations who are against Israel and are weighing in at every chance they have to vote against the only Middle East democracy. In the meantime, Israel treats Palestinians in their hospitals, gives jobs to Palestinians and even has two Arab parties as a part of the Knesset. This is looking more and more like there is nothing Israel can do to be in good standing with the world in general and the United Nations in particular. Even if all Jews would die today and Israel as a whole would become Palestine, antisemitism would continue to exist in the hearts of men. You read me right, no Israel and no Jews do not guarantee no antisemitism, it only guarantees no Israel and no Jews, something that God will never allow (Jeremiah 31:35-37). But if the UN could continue trying to play god…well, that’s a different story! Those nations are united indeed, but they are united against Israel and as a result, against God (Psalm 83:5.)

Is it me or whatever comes out of the UN is officially believed as fact by a world population that certainly doesn’t care to check for accuracy as much as it cares for stigmatizing and ostracizing Israel? To add insult to injury, the UN decides to praise and promote violence, lies and murders. How do you explain the UN funded tree planting by Palestinians to honor the memory of terrorists? How sick is it to promote death and make murderers into martyrs while accusing the victims of human rights violation? This makes it very difficult for anyone who is seeking truth and fairness to not accuse the UN of antisemitism. It is a fact that a large number of UN members are Arab/Muslim nations who are against Israel and are weighing in at every chance they have to vote against the only Middle East democracy. In the meantime, Israel treats Palestinians in their hospitals, gives jobs to Palestinians and even has two Arab parties as a part of the Knesset. This is looking more and more like there is nothing Israel can do to be in good standing with the world in general and the United Nations in particular. Even if all Jews would die today and Israel as a whole would become Palestine, antisemitism would continue to exist in the hearts of men. You read me right, no Israel and no Jews do not guarantee no antisemitism, it only guarantees no Israel and no Jews, something that God will never allow (Jeremiah 31:35-37). But if the UN could continue trying to play god…well, that’s a different story! Those nations are united indeed, but they are united against Israel and as a result, against God (Psalm 83:5.)

News article:
When the League of Nations (founded in 1920 after WWI) was replaced by the United Nations in 1945, the world was hopeful that the new organization would succeed in averting another world war–a feat that the League of Nations clearly failed at. The UN prides itself in promoting international cooperation and world peace. It even won the Nobel peace prize in 2001 (but so did Yasir Arafat in 1994.) The UN current Secretary is Ban Ki-moon (since 2007.) In the first article of the UN charter, we can read their purpose for existing: 1. To maintain international peace and security, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace; 2. To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace; 3. To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and 4. To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends. There is no doubt in my mind that the original crafting of the UN charter took a lot of careful efforts from its founding members to assure that the world organization would be equipped to function properly. As a result, we have seen many decisions made by the UN that definitely helped make the world a better place. One of these decisions was the 1947 vote for the partitioning of British Mandate Palestine, that led to May 14, 1948 and the re-birth of Israel as a modern nation (33 for, 10 against, 10 abstentions.) But 1948 is nearly 70 years ago and since then, the United Nations have been less than friendly to Israel. As a matter of fact, for many years, there have been more resolutions passed against the Jewish state than the rest of the world combined (and here). For instance, in 2015, the UN adopted 23 resolutions, three against Iran, Syria and Korea and twenty against Israel. There are no indication that it will slow down in 2016. It is also very hard to forget the 16 years that it took the United Nations to revoke their 1975 resolution claiming that “Zionism is Racism.” And even if they did revoke it, the organizing of the Durban I (2001), II (2009) and III (2011) conferences against racism have shown that the target was once again almost exclusively Israel. The United Nations’ obsession with demonizing Israel is obvious to any unbiased observer. Just days ago, the unbelievable claim was made by the UN that Israel was the number one country violating women’s human rights. The UN ignored Hamas, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, ISIS, Syria to name just a few of the countries were animals are treated better than women. Yet it found Israel guilty of human rights violation against Palestinian women.

News article:
(JTA) — The Palestinian Authority is circulating to U.N. Security Council members a draft resolution condemning Israeli building in the West Bank and Jerusalem. The resolution, which P.A. President Mahmoud Abbas reportedly is hoping to bring to a vote in two weeks, was reported Thursday by Haaretz, which cited Western diplomats and senior Palestinian officials. In a statement issued in response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Abbas “is taking a step that will push negotiations further away.” “The only way to advance peace is by direct negotiations and Abu Mazen is avoiding this,” the Israeli leader said, using Abbas’ nom de guerre. “The Palestinians educate their children on a daily basis that the settlements are Tel Aviv, Haifa and Acre.” According to Haaretz, the move to condemn the settlements has been in the works since the beginning of the year. A senior Palestinian official told the Israeli daily that Abbas will be arriving in New York on April 22, Passover eve, to attend the planned vote. Abbas is also expected over the next two weeks to make diplomatic visits to Paris, Berlin and Moscow to build support for the resolution. The Security Council last voted on such a resolution in February 2011. It was approved but vetoed by the United States. According to Haaretz, the draft states that the settlements are an obstacle to peace and Israel must stop construction. The resolution also condemns settler violence against Palestinians.

Palestinian officials have begun circulating a draft resolution among members of the the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).

In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that "(Mahmoud Abbas) is taking steps that will push negotiations farther away." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The resolution says, "All Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, are illegal and constitute a major obstacle to the achievement of peace on the basis of the two-State solution." The Palestinians are planning to test the outgoing Obama administration with this draft, After the US vetoed a similarly-worded resolution in 2011. This draft resolution is moderate in comparison to the resolution put forth by the Palestinians five years ago, as it doesn't call for the establishment of a Palestinian state or for international protection. The UN Security Council. (Photo: AP) It is believed that this was done in order to make it harder for the US to use its veto power against this resolution. Adding to this is the fact that Washington has already intensified its rhetoric opposing construction in the West Bank recently. Despite this, a Palestinian political official noted that the final decision of whether or not to put the resolution to a vote at the UN Security Council hasn't been decided yet, although he said that as of now, it is very likely to happen. Abbas is expected to arrive in New York in two weeks for a three-day visit, in order to sign a climate change treaty According to this same Palestinian official, the feeling within the Palestinian Authority is that Abbas will in fact take advantage of his visit to New York in order to put forth the resolution at the Security Council and be present during the vote – if it happens. Political officials say that the Palestinians are looking for ways to embarrass Israel, and jumped at this opportunity to do it while Abbas is in New York. The Israeli UN delegation were unaware that the Palestinians were planning on putting forward this draft, but did notice that in the past few days there has been a lot of activity coming from the Palestinian delegation, and that the Israeli delegation alerted both the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister's office.

(Photo: UN Photo/Cia Pak) Netanyahu's office itself published a strong response to the draft resolution, saying "(Mahmoud Abbas) is taking steps that will push negotiations farther away.

Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said of the matter, "The Palestinians need to understand that there are no shortcuts.

United Nations – The Palestinian U.N. Mission says it has circulated a proposed Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements to Arab nations. The draft was condemned Thursday by Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas “is taking a step that will push negotiations further away” to end the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians refused to provide any details of the resolution, but recalled the 14-1 vote on a Security Council resolution on settlements in February 2011. It was defeated by a U.S. veto. It would have condemned “illegal” Israeli settlements and demanded an immediate halt to all settlement building. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and built settlements there. The Palestinians claim those areas as parts of a future state.

News article:
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said there is an “urgent” need for a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements, in an interview with AFP ahead of a multi-country diplomatic tour. “The Security Council is a very important subject because it has now become urgent due to settlement activities and because Israel has not stopped these activities,” Abbas said, with the Palestinians currently discussing a new draft resolution at the UN Security Council on the subject. The draft resolution, which was submitted last week, defines Israeli settlements as illegal and calls for a one-year timetable to reach a final status agreement, according to a copy of the text posted online.

News article:
Unlike last time Israel faced a hostile resolution at the United Nations Security Council, in December 2014, this time there is virtually no chance that it will fail to garner the required majority. That means that the key to fending off the latest Palestinian attempt to get Israel condemned at the UN’s most important body lies with US President Barack Obama. He will be in the awkward position of having to either veto a resolution despite agreeing with its content, or to abstain or support it, thus further alienating America’s staunchest ally in the Middle East and allowing political opponents at home to portray his party as anti-Israel. The plan to bring another anti-settlement resolution to the Security Council is thus slated to become a veritable litmus test of US-Israel relations, nearly half a year before America elects a new president. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is expected to use his trip later this month to the UN in New York — where is slated to attend a signing ceremony for the historic climate agreement reached in Paris in December — to launch yet another attempt to get the UN to condemn Israel’s actions in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. “The Security Council is a very important subject because it has now become urgent due to settlement activities and because Israel has not stopped these activities,” Abbas told AFP on Tuesday. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms A leaked draft of the proposed resolution expresses “grave concern” over dwindling prospects of a two-state solution and calls on Israel to “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem.” The draft further urges the “intensification and acceleration of international and regional diplomatic efforts and support aimed at achieving, without delay, an end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967.” The draft does not explicitly set a 12-month deadline for negotiations on a final peace deal with Israel and an imposed full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and East Jerusalem within three years, as a resolution proposed in late December 2014 did. That resolution got eight yes votes, two no votes and five abstentions, and thus failed to pass. Advertisement For a resolution to pass it needs nine votes from the council’s 15 members. If that were to occur, one of its five permanent members — the US, the UK, China, France and Russia — could veto the resolution. Only a US veto can stop the resolution Since 2014, the makeup of the Security Council has changed in the Palestinians’ favor, and there is virtually no chance for Israel to stave off a resolution critical of settlements. China, Russia, Egypt, Malaysia, Senegal, Venezuela and France are certain to support the draft. Given that the universally accepted view among the international community is that Israeli settlements are illegal, it is also safe to assume the remaining members of the council — Britain, Angola, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, Ukraine and Uruguay — would support the Palestinian proposal. The US thus remains the only wildcard in the upcoming diplomatic showdown at Turtle Bay. In February 2011, a resolution condemning Israel’s settlements — without establishing deadlines for an Israel withdrawal — got 14 yes votes but stumbled over Washington’s veto. And even then, the Americans made it clear that they do not disagree with the resolution’s content but merely take issue with using the Security Council as a tool to advance the stalled peace process. “Our opposition to the resolution before this council today should therefore not be misunderstood to mean we support settlement activity,” Susan Rice, then the US’s ambassador to the UN and today Obama’s national security adviser, declared at the time. “On the contrary, we reject in the strongest terms the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity.” Advertisement The Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be solved by even the best-intentioned outsiders, Rice said. “Therefore every potential action must be measured against one overriding standard: Will it move the parties closer to negotiations and an agreement? Unfortunately, this draft resolution risks hardening the positions of both sides. It could encourage the parties to stay out of negotiations and, if and when they did resume, to return to the Security Council whenever they reach an impasse.” And while she ultimately stood alone in voting against the Palestinian resolution, she concluded her remarks by making plain that Washington agrees with the world about the “folly and illegitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity.” ‘Our preference is that any kind of an agreement on final status negotiations take place by the parties’ Nothing has changed since 2011 when it comes to the principle she described — that even if settlements are bad, unilateral moves at the UN are futile and potentially even counterproductive — but these days the administration adamantly refuses to assure Israel of another veto. “I’m not going to get into hypotheticals,” State Department spokesperson Mark Toner said Monday, arguing that he has seen only “very early drafts” of the resolution. While the US deems settlements “illegitimate” and “counterproductive to the cause of peace,” the American position regarding unilateral moves at the UN has not changed, he added. “Our preference is that any kind of an agreement on final status negotiations… take place by the parties.” Which way will the US go? It is difficult to gauge whether the US will once again take an isolated stance and veto a resolution. On the one hand, there are several reasons to assume that the Obama administration could abstain and allow it to pass. For one, the US needs regional Arab allies in its fight against the Islamic State group and may not want to antagonize them over the Palestinian question. Furthermore, Obama — who, during his last months in office is keen on leaving a tangible legacy in the region — might still be bitter over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s blatant effort to thwart the nuclear deal with Iran by addressing the US Congress and trying to get American Jews to oppose their government. Obama would not be the first president to support Security Council resolutions critical of Israel. In fact, he is the only president since the 1967 Six Day War to have blocked all such efforts, Lara Friedman, of Americans for Peace Now, noted this week in The New York Times. Advertisement On the other hand, failure to block the resolution would give ample ammunition to domestic political opponents trying to portray the Democrats as anti-Israel, and threatens to erode Jewish support for the party ahead of the November presidential elections. Israeli officials this week refused to comment on the Palestinians’ demarche, but Netanyahu on Thursday called it a “step that will push negotiations further away,” arguing that peace can only be advanced through direct bilateral negotiations. Last month, responding to a question posed by The Times of Israel on whether he was concerned that Washington could support, or at least refrain from opposing, a Palestine-related resolution at the UN, Netanyahu said that it has been the “traditional policies of US governments to oppose” unilateral efforts to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. All US presidents, including Obama, support this view, the prime minister added. He then quoted verbatim from a speech Obama delivered in 2011 at the UN General Assembly: “Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the United Nations… Ultimately, it is the Israelis and the Palestinians — not us — who must reach agreement on the issues that divide them. “That is to say that peace won’t come from dictates at the UN or the Security Council,” Netanyahu said, looking up from his notes. “I agree entirely with this position.” Still, the fact that he had to look up a speech delivered by Obama five years ago shows he is worried the US position might have changed.

News article:
The Palestinian issue is experiencing paralysis due a number of international, regional, local and personal reasons, all of which have pushed it into a negative status quo. It is no longer moved or activated by major events, such as the Jerusalem Intifada, and no longer has any historical figures, like Yasser Arafat, who can break the mould dramatically, one way or the other. The US has basically frozen the peace process led by Secretary of State John Kerry, who toured the region seeking an acceptable agreement. Kerry declared his inability to do so in the face of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s stubbornness and inflexibility. America’s abandonment of the peace process has been intensified by the run-up to the presidential election, which cannot tolerate any political lapses or setbacks from anywhere. It also seems as if Russia is challenging the Obama administration, which does not dare to engage it on the field of battle. This emboldened the Russians to enter Syria, joining the geopolitical action directly in the region for the first time. A number of other international forces have also emerged, with different perspectives and influences. As such, the US is no longer the only major international player in regional affairs. The situation in Palestine has been influenced by events which are redrawing the maps across the Middle East. With the Syrian conflict appearing to have a solution on the horizon, everyone wants their share of the spoils as they wait for the dust to settle and things to become clearer. The most dangerous aspect for the Palestinians is the pressure from the Egyptian government and its allies. Cairo is, for example, trying to influence the talks between Turkey and Israel, urging the latter not to agree to lift the siege of the Gaza Strip. This is a critical matter for the Egyptian government, as it does not want Gaza – which it views as a stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood in its own backyard – to be open to anyone, or even to be comfortable. The closures and restrictions at the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing are worse than those at the Erez crossing into Israel. Locally, the causes of the paralysis are manifested in the failure of the peace process and security coordination with the occupation authorities, which has been a thorn in the side of the Palestinian people, especially since the beginning of the intifada in October.

Added to this is the failure of the reconciliation negotiations that were activated with Hamas a month ago on the back of a proposal to form a national unity government and resolve the PA employee issue in Gaza. This local deadlock is caused by the ongoing wait for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to step down and introduce the post-Abbas phase. This has become an obsession, which is distracting the PA’s institutions, the PLO and Fatah, and is influenced by regional and international events. The Palestinian cause has been put on hold awaiting action to solve regional crises. Although another Israeli war against Gaza could stir things up, there is little real interest in this being shown by either side. The current phase requires a rejection of the impasse and for the main forces to take the lead in Palestinian affairs. This requires Fatah to reunite and steer clear of internal factionalism centred on the succession to Abbas, because any weaknesses and strengths shown by Fatah have a direct influence on the Palestinian cause. Furthermore, unity must lead to serious and strategic national reconciliation that is not linked to any regional or international developments and rises above the internal conflicts and balance of power. To achieve this, all of the Palestinian factions must participate in the reconciliation process.

News article:
The Palestinian issue is experiencing paralysis due a number of international, regional, local and personal reasons, all of which have pushed it into a negative status quo. It is no longer moved or activated by major events, such as the Jerusalem Intifada, and no longer has any historical figures, like Yasser Arafat, who can break the mould dramatically, one way or the other. The US has basically frozen the peace process led by Secretary of State John Kerry, who toured the region seeking an acceptable agreement. Kerry declared his inability to do so in the face of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s stubbornness and inflexibility. America’s abandonment of the peace process has been intensified by the run-up to the presidential election, which cannot tolerate any political lapses or setbacks from anywhere. It also seems as if Russia is challenging the Obama administration, which does not dare to engage it on the field of battle. This emboldened the Russians to enter Syria, joining the geopolitical action directly in the region for the first time. A number of other international forces have also emerged, with different perspectives and influences. As such, the US is no longer the only major international player in regional affairs. The situation in Palestine has been influenced by events which are redrawing the maps across the Middle East. With the Syrian conflict appearing to have a solution on the horizon, everyone wants their share of the spoils as they wait for the dust to settle and things to become clearer. The most dangerous aspect for the Palestinians is the pressure from the Egyptian government and its allies. Cairo is, for example, trying to influence the talks between Turkey and Israel, urging the latter not to agree to lift the siege of the Gaza Strip. This is a critical matter for the Egyptian government, as it does not want Gaza – which it views as a stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood in its own backyard – to be open to anyone, or even to be comfortable. The closures and restrictions at the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing are worse than those at the Erez crossing into Israel. Locally, the causes of the paralysis are manifested in the failure of the peace process and security coordination with the occupation authorities, which has been a thorn in the side of the Palestinian people, especially since the beginning of the intifada in October.

News article:
Two-state solution in Middle East 'tragically more distant' than ever, Ban tells Security Council 18 April 2016 – United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned today that a two-state solution, which envisages peaceful co-existence of Palestine and Israel, seems more distant than it has for many decades, citing the ongoing violence, Israel's settlement activity and demolitions of Palestinian homes, and the absence of Palestinian unity. "For over six months, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory have been gripped by a surge in violence, triggered by individual terrorist attacks by Palestinians," he told the Security Council in a regular briefing, noting that more than two dozen Israelis and two hundred Palestinians have been killed. While welcoming the joint Palestinian-Israeli efforts that have contributed to a reduction of tensions in recent weeks, the latest killings have only deepened the legacy of divisiveness, hatred and grief, he said. Mr. Ban urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to elevate public discourse above mutual accusations, and to engage in a constructive dialogue that can rebuild the trust that has all but evaporated. The diplomatic Middle East Quartet, comprising the UN, the European Union, the United States and Russia, which mediates the peace process, is moving forward on a report that will review the situation on the ground, the threats to a two-state solution, and provide recommendations on how to advance peace, he said. "Tragically, this solution seems more distant than it has for many decades," he said. "A 20-year-old Palestinian living under occupation has seen no political progress at all during his or her lifetime," he noted. Israel continues to demolish Palestinian structures in the West Bank at an alarming rate. The total number of demolitions in 2015 was exceeded in the first three months of this year. More than 700 people have been displaced. He said he was also concerned by the continued punitive demolitions of homes belonging to families of alleged Palestinian perpetrators of attacks against Israelis. Punitive demolitions are a form of collective punishment, which is prohibited under international law. This, together with last month's declaration of "state land," signal that Israel's strategic settlement enterprise continues to expand on land intended for a future Palestinian state. "I once again reiterate that settlements are illegal under international law and undermine the two-state solution," Mr. Ban said. "The creation of new facts on the ground through demolitions and settlement building raises questions about whether Israel's ultimate goal is in fact to drive Palestinians out of certain parts of the West Bank, thereby undermining any prospect of transition to a viable Palestinian state," he said. On the Palestinian political front, Mr. Ban expressed regret that the continued failure of intra-Palestinian discussions to achieve genuine unity on the basis of non-violence, democracy and the PLO principles, calling again on Palestinian factions to demonstrate their commitment to reconciliation, which is integral to reaching the goal of Palestinian statehood. In Gaza, the security situation has calmed in recent weeks; however on 14 April, three rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel. No injuries were reported, but he condemned all attacks and called on all parties to avoid further escalation that jeopardize the lives of Israeli and Palestinian civilians. The Palestinian Government has laid out an ambitious $3.8 billion agenda for stabilizing Gaza, repairing damage from the 2014 conflict, and getting recovery underway. Economic development and rebuilding critical electricity and water infrastructure are essential. He welcomed that on 3 April, Israel expanded the Gaza fishing zone from six miles to nine nautical miles. "The path out of the current political deadlock requires commitment, compromise, mutual respect and leadership on both sides. It also requires the acceptance – demonstrated by deeds as well as words – that the two-state solution is the only road to peace that meets the national aspirations of both peoples," he said. Turning to Lebanon, he said he addressed political and security issues with Lebanese leaders during his visit to Beirut on 24 and 25 March, consistent with the concerns of the Security Council. These included: the importance of preserving Lebanon's model of pluralism and coexistence from regional tensions; the urgency of electing a President without further delay; and the need for all parties to work with Prime Minister Tammam Salam to enable the Government to function effectively and to continue to engage in political dialogue. They also discussed the importance of sustained international support for the Lebanese Armed Forces, and the expectation that both Lebanon and Israel work to consolidate stability along the Blue Line and advance the implementation of resolution 1701 – which imposed a ceasefire in the Israeli-Hizbollah conflict of 2006 . At the outset, he gave a brief report on his trip to Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Tunisia three weeks ago, noting that the trip sought to highlight the need to increase development assistance through innovative financing mechanisms for countries like Lebanon and Jordan that are disproportionately impacted by the conflict in Syria. He said that last Friday, he, together with the Presidents of the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank, co-chaired a ministerial-level conference to garner the financial support for this initiative. Eight countries and the European Union generously pledged $1 billion for a concessional loan facility, $141 million in grants, and $500 million for a guarantee facility, and many other countries expressed support for this innovative initiative, he noted.

News article:
Ramallah: The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) plans to adopt the Jordanian or US currencies instead of the Israeli shekel in the Palestinian commerce and daily transactions as part of the PNA’s strategy to gradually decrease coordination with Israel reaching a point of cutting off relations with the occupier. According to Dr Nabeel Sha’ath, a key aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Monetary Authority and Ministry of Finance and Economy are quietly considering and studying abandoning the Israeli shekel in the Palestinian territories. Dr Sha’ath who is also Fatah Central Committee member and Fatah Commissioner of International Relations told the Palestinian Radio on Wednesday that the Palestinians, as per the agreements signed with Israel, could use the US dollar or the Jordanian dinar in their commerce and transactions, but the Palestinians with the passage of time mainly used the Israeli shekel. He stressed that the Israelis insist on using only the shekel in their commerce with the Palestinians and categorically refuse to do any business with the use of the US currency. Therefore, he said, it was time to abandon the Israeli shekel in Palestine. Over the past decades, the Palestinians have mainly used the Israeli shekel for commerce, but had considered reissuing the defunct Palestine pound as a key aspect of statehood. The Palestinians had found that this was unrealistic as they could not function independently of Israel. “We fully support abandoning the Israeli shekel from the daily life of Palestinians,” said Dr Nasr Abdul Kareem, an expert economist in the West Bank. “Adopting another currency in Palestine is just a right position but that should be done gradually, quietly and realistically.” He stressed that adopting a new currency in Palestine should be carefully considered and implemented where the Palestinian economy must be restructured giving the residents the chance to settle their shekel transactions. “Four billion shekels in salary income of the Palestinian workers in Israel in addition to four more billion shekels trade volume between Israel and the Palestinians should be carefully tackled,” he told Gulf News. “The Israeli reaction to the suspension of the shekel and adoption of another currency must also be carefully reviewed and evaluated in advance. Israel can easily impose collective economic punitive measures against the Palestinians.” Dr Abdul Kareem, who is sceptical that the Palestinians can instantly abandon the shekel as this can further increase the instability of the Palestinian economy, said the Palestinian banks are closely tied to their Israeli counterparts which constitute the only window to the world, given the fact that most of the Palestinian banks do not have branches abroad. “Abandoning the Israeli shekel and adopting another currency will and should take a long time — three to four years — and should be implemented gradually,” he said. Politically, abandoning the shekel is a fundamental move in the process of cutting relations with Israel and Palestinian politicians believe that the damage caused by the way the Israeli ruling coalition treats the Palestinians is more severe than the dangers from currency. The Palestinians are optimistic to manage the currency shift successfully and with no relative implications.

Ramallah: The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) plans to adopt the Jordanian or US currencies instead of the Israeli shekel in the Palestinian commerce and daily transactions as part of the PNA’s strategy to gradually decrease coordination with Israel reaching a point of cutting off relations with the occupier. According to Dr Nabeel Sha’ath, a key aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Monetary Authority and Ministry of Finance and Economy are quietly considering and studying abandoning the Israeli shekel in the Palestinian territories. Dr Sha’ath who is also Fatah Central Committee member and Fatah Commissioner of International Relations told the Palestinian Radio on Wednesday that the Palestinians, as per the agreements signed with Israel, could use the US dollar or the Jordanian dinar in their commerce and transactions, but the Palestinians with the passage of time mainly used the Israeli shekel. He stressed that the Israelis insist on using only the shekel in their commerce with the Palestinians and categorically refuse to do any business with the use of the US currency. Therefore, he said, it was time to abandon the Israeli shekel in Palestine. Over the past decades, the Palestinians have mainly used the Israeli shekel for commerce, but had considered reissuing the defunct Palestine pound as a key aspect of statehood. The Palestinians had found that this was unrealistic as they could not function independently of Israel. “We fully support abandoning the Israeli shekel from the daily life of Palestinians,” said Dr Nasr Abdul Kareem, an expert economist in the West Bank. “Adopting another currency in Palestine is just a right position but that should be done gradually, quietly and realistically.” He stressed that adopting a new currency in Palestine should be carefully considered and implemented where the Palestinian economy must be restructured giving the residents the chance to settle their shekel transactions. “Four billion shekels in salary income of the Palestinian workers in Israel in addition to four more billion shekels trade volume between Israel and the Palestinians should be carefully tackled,” he told Gulf News. “The Israeli reaction to the suspension of the shekel and adoption of another currency must also be carefully reviewed and evaluated in advance.

News article:
By Louis Charbonneau UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Reuters) - The Palestinian president and Israel's ambassador to the United Nations traded barbs on Friday during a signing ceremony for the Paris climate accord, in the latest example of continuing Israeli-Palestinian tensions. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who signed the agreement on behalf of the Palestinians, took advantage of the presence of some 60 world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly to criticize Israel. "The Israeli occupation is destroying the climate in Palestine, and the Israeli settlements are destroying the environment in Palestine," Abbas told the 193-nation assembly. "Please help us in putting an end to the occupation and to settlements." Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded sharply when he addressed the ceremony, in which 175 states signed and 15 ratified the Paris accord. "Instead of spreading hatred here at the U.N., President Abbas should act to stop Palestinian terror," he said after signing the treaty. "This climate summit is supposed to be a demonstration of global unity for the sake of the future of our planet," he added. "Unfortunately, President Abbas chose to exploit this international stage to mislead the international community." Earlier this week, Danon and Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour yelled "shame on you" at each other during a regular U.N. Security Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East. That meeting turned into a rare shouting match. U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been in tatters since 2014. Abbas' presence at the signing ceremony had symbolic importance in the wake of Palestine's de facto recognition of statehood by the United Nations, which since 2012 has considered Palestine a non-member observer state. It was the first time a Palestinian president sat in the General Assembly hall as a state party to a treaty at a signing ceremony. Palestine's accession to the treaty could lead to complications for the United States, which has a law barring U.S. funding for "any organization or group that does not have the internationally recognized attributes of statehood." U.S. senators sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry saying that Palestine's participation in the U.N. climate change secretariat and the Paris agreement would prohibit the United States from paying money into a global climate fund. The letter, signed by 21 Republican Senators, was the latest attempt by Congressional Republicans to block U.S. participation in global climate initiatives. The U.S. State Department said it received the letter and was preparing a response. Five years ago the United States stopped funding UNESCO, the U.N. cultural agency, after it granted the Palestinians full membership.

News article:
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A renewed Palestinian drive to persuade the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements is aimed at removing the biggest obstacle to peace and boosting French efforts to broker an agreement, the Palestinian U.N. envoy said on Tuesday. Riyad Mansour, permanent Palestinian observer to the United Nations, told a small group of reporters that Arab delegations have received the draft resolution. He said the point of putting the draft about Israeli settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank forward was “to keep the hope alive, to remove this obstacle from the path of peace, to open doors for peace, (and) to try to help the French initiative to stand on its feet.” With U.S. efforts to broker a two-state solution in tatters since 2014 and Washington focused on this year’s election, France has been lobbying countries to commit to a conference that would get Israelis and Palestinians back to negotiations about ending their conflict. Mansour said Washington vetoed a similar resolution about Israel’s settlements five years ago because of fears it would undermine peace talks. But now, he noted, there are no peace talks. In February 2011, the United States voted against a draft resolution condemning Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, though it said at the time its opposition should not be misunderstood as support for settlement activity. The United States considers Israeli settlements on land the Palestinians want for a future state to be illegitimate. Washington has not offered substantive comment on the new Palestinian draft, which has fueled speculation in Israeli media the United States is undecided about whether to use its veto this time. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will be in New York next week to sign the Paris climate agreement. He is expected to meet with French President Francois Hollande on the sidelines, diplomats say, and will likely discuss the Palestinian draft resolution. So far Egypt, the sole Arab council member, has not formally introduced the text. Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon last week reacted sharply to Israeli media reports about a possible Palestinian draft resolution on settlements. “The Palestinians must understand that there are no shortcuts,” he said in a statement. “The only way to promote negotiations starts by them condemning terrorism and stopping the incitement, and ends with direct negotiations between the two sides.”

News article:
The West’s refusal to challenge the growing corruption and autocratic rule of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas “could have a devastating effect on the long- prospects for a viable Palestinian state,” Grant Rumley, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, wrote Monday in Newsweek. As long as Abbas continues security cooperation with Israel and “pay[s] lip service to the moribund peace process,” Western leaders will not pressure him to change, Rumley observed. He added Abbas “has tested the limits of Western leniency” since the end of the American-sponsored talks two years ago, which Abbas himself torpedoed. Rumley raised concerns that Abbas, who is in the 11th year of a four-year term, is becoming increasingly dictatorial. Last month, Abbas established a new constitutional court, all of whose members are picked by Abbas, “that would, naturally, confirm his own presidential decrees,” Rumley wrote. When a Palestinian legislator accused an Abbas ally of corruption in March, Abbas issued a warrant for her arrest. When teachers launched an unprecedented strike over the PA’s broken promises to raise their wages, the PA set up roadblocks to prevent the teachers from marching on Ramallah, arrested the leaders of the teachers’ union, and threatened legal action unless they returned to work. The crackdown prompted one Palestinian journalist to write that the PA “really should not continue to exist.” And a recent report from a Palestinian NGO found that in 2015, 60 percent of the nearly 200 violations of press freedom in Palestinian territories occurred in the PA-governed West Bank, with only 40 percent occurring in Hamas-ruled Gaza. With Abbas sensing little interest from the White House in pursuing bilateral talks, Abbas is using the final year of President Barack Obama’s term in office as an opportunity for the “consolidation of power at home” and to “further isolate Israel,” Rumley wrote. But the indulgence Abbas has been given to grow increasingly autocratic comes at a price—”a devastating effect on the long-term prospects for a viable Palestinian state.” Rumley concluded: As one former Bush administration officialremarked in 2013, Palestinian self-governance—with free and fair elections—were “a powerful argument that it was time for Israel to stop governing Palestinians.” In other words, Abbas’s increasingly tyrannical government in the West Bank does not only handicap political expression—it also sets back the very legitimacy of the Palestinian national project. Other experts have raised concerns about the PA’s corruption and its effect on the viability of a future Palestinian state. In We Really Need to Talk About Corruption, which was published in the December 2013 issue of The Tower Magazine, Jonathan Schanzer observed: It seems clear that, despite being rejected by both the ballot and the gun, Abbas has failed to learn his lesson. He has failed to reform the dysfunctional Palestinian Authority, and does not show any signs of attempting to do so in the near future. And the West, addicted to top-down peacemaking, shows little interest in genuinely helping the Palestinian people attain a government dedicated to coexistence with Israel, nor one built on the open, fair and transparent civil society and legal system required to build a successful state. Similarly, in Terrorists and Kleptocrats: How Corruption is Eating the Palestinians Alive, which was published in the June 2014 issue of The Tower Magazine, Aaron Menenberg wrote: Through the PA, a small group of elites has concentrated power and wealth, estranging the Palestinian people from its government and insulating the government from the people. Sadly, foreign attempts to aid the Palestinians are subject to the same regime, with devastating consequences. The attempt to use foreign aid to the PA as both a carrot and a stick has not closed the gap between the Palestinian people and their government. Rather, it has helped widen it. American and European support for the Palestinian Authority now totals hundreds of billions of dollars—possibly trillions if non-governmental activities are included. With that money, we have helped build an elite-run system that bludgeons the entrepreneurial Sammys and marginalizes the pragmatic Izzats. Not a lot of Westerners get to see this dynamic from the inside, and that is a shame. Much of the foreign support for the Palestinians is given with the best of intentions. This makes those who question it susceptible to all manner of criticism. That this questioning is often warranted, however, escapes many supporters and financiers of the Palestinian Authority, because it contradicts the comfortable mainstream narrative that reinforces their motivation. Meanwhile, the PA is as corrupt as ever, and uses our foreign aid to literally sell its people short. The gap between the Palestinian people and their leadership is nothing less than catastrophic, and it will not be closed unless donors change the way they support the Palestinian Authority. A good first step would be to tie aid to greater PA transparency and responsibility to the Palestinian people. Donors should also insist on fiscal and legal reforms, as well as the establishment of robust and independent institutions—judiciary and education included. These are all necessary ingredients for economic growth and nation-building. Unfortunately, so long as we and other donors refuse to take these steps, we will remain part of the problem, not part of the solution. [Photo: Flash90 ]

JERUSALEM: A senior UN official Saturday brushed aside an invitation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a lecture on Jewish history, amid a row over a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site. Netanyahu said Friday he would host the lecture in response to a recent resolution of the UN’s cultural body condemning Israeli “aggression” against Muslims at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, while failing to mention the site’s Jewish name Temple Mount. The UNESCO executive board resolution, submitted by several Arab countries, was described by Netanyahu as “denying any Jewish connection to the Temple Mount, our holiest site.” The UN’s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov, bristled at the suggestion that UN staff in Jerusalem were insufficiently educated. “If someone wants to issue invitations they should be for Paris and addressed to the ambassadors of the member-states of UNESCO there,” he said in a statement. “UN staff in Jerusalem know the history of the region, its people and religions all too well.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s offer to teach history to UN personnel was rejected by the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process on Saturday, Nickolay Mladenov. On Friday, Netanyahu stated that he was shocked that UNESCO would adopt “a decision denying any Jewish connection to the Temple Mount, our holiest site.” “That is why today I am announcing a seminar on Jewish history for all UN personnel in Israel,” he said in a statement. “I will personally host the lecture at the Prime Minister’s Office,” said Netanyahu, noting that it would be delivered by a “leading scholar of Jewish history.” He also invited to the lecture diplomats “of countries which voted for this outrageous decision”. Mladenov responded by declining the offer. “If someone wants to issue invitations they should be for Paris and addressed to the ambassadors of the member-states of UNESCO there,” he said in a statement. “UN staff in Jerusalem know the history of the region, its people and religions all too well.” The Prime Minister’s offer comes in response to recent UNESCO resolutions referring to Israel as an “occupying power”. The UNESCO resolutions also claim several sites holy to Judaism as Muslim sites. The resolutions refer to the Temple Mount as Al-Haram al-Sharif and Al-Aqsa Mosque. It refers to Al-Buraq Plaza, with ‘Western Wall’ in parentheses. The resolution was approved by 33 states, including France, Russia, Spain and Sweden. Seventeen countries abstained while six voted against including the United States, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

The UNESCO resolutions also claim several sites holy to Judaism as Muslim sites. The resolutions refer to the Temple Mount as Al-Haram al-Sharif and Al-Aqsa Mosque. It refers to Al-Buraq Plaza, with ‘Western Wall’ in parentheses. The resolution was approved by 33 states, including France, Russia, Spain and Sweden. Seventeen countries abstained while six voted against including the United States, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

(JTA) – The interior minister of France criticized his country’s recent vote at a U.N. agency for a resolution that critics said ignored Jewish historical ties to Jerusalem and its holy sites. Bernard Cazeneuve spoke of his objection to France’s April 16 vote at UNESCO, the Paris-based U.N. organization dealing with education, culture and heritage, at an event Monday in Paris organized by CRIF, the umbrella group of French Jewish communities. Cazeneuve said he does “not take a supportive view of the text” that France voted to approve, adding it “should not have been adopted” and that the resolution passed “was not written as it should have been,” the Le Figaro daily reported. The text refers to the Temple Mount area solely as the Al-Aqsa Mosque/Al-Haram Al Sharif, except for two references to the Western Wall Plaza that were put in parentheses. The broad-ranging resolution condemns Israeli actions in eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but focuses in large part on Israeli actions with regard to the Temple Mount and Western Wall Plaza. In an unusual commentary on his country’s foreign policy statement, French Chief Rabbi Haim Korsia on April 21 expressed his “strong disapproval” of the French vote. Reaffirming “the indestructible ties that unite the Jewish people and Jerusalem,” Korsia wrote that he “urges the UNESCO executive council to reconsider their position as soon as possible.” On Monday, Cazeneuve said his position on the matter “is the same as Haim Korsia’s.”

News article:
By Reuters April 10, 2016 A half-year-long surge in Palestinian street attacks against Israelis is waning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, while Hamas accused the U.S.-backed Palestinian leadership of treachery for helping Israel stem the violence. Since October, Palestinians have killed 28 Israelis and two U.S. citizens in knife, car-ramming and gun assaults. In recent weeks, these have slowed from near-daily occurrences to more sporadic incidents. The last fatal attack took place on March 9. During this wave of violence, Israeli forces killed at least 190 Palestinians, 129 of whom Israel says were assailants. Many others were shot dead during clashes and protests. Palestinians and foreign critics have accused Israel of excessive force. Drivers behind the bloodshed include Palestinian bitterness over long-stalled statehood negotiations, greater Jewish access to a disputed Jerusalem shrine, and Islamist-led calls for Israel’s destruction. In public remarks to his cabinet, Netanyahu said Israeli security forces’ “very firm action against incitement” and their foiling of assaults had led to “a significant drop-off in the scale of terror attacks.” But he told the forum: “I say this with great caution, because the trend can be reversed.” Netanyahu made no mention of Israel’s security cooperation with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s U.S.-backed administration in the occupied West Bank, where much of the violence has occurred. Israeli and Palestinian officials on several occasions cited a degree of security cooperation without going into details. Israeli media has reported close monitoring by both sides of social media in a bid to identify would-be assailants. Many Palestinians regard security cooperation with Israel as collaborating with the enemy. Palestinian experts say many of the young and often leaderless assailants have lashed out in solidarity with others who were killed carrying out attacks, with social media and cellphone footage of the incidents amplifying popular outrage. Hamas, the powerful Islamist group that exercises de facto control of the Gaza Strip, on Sunday condemned as “very grave” what it described as the arrest of three West Bank Palestinians by Abbas’s forces on suspicion of planning to attack Israel. “Such cooperation aims to abort the Palestinian uprising and targets the resistance,” Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said. But Palestinian authorities in the West Bank played down the case, saying the three were tracked down at the request of their families after their went missing. The last instance of a Palestinian carrying out a fatal attack in Israel occurred on March 9, when an American tourist was stabbed to death in Tel Aviv. The assailant was killed.

Hamas is amassing fighters and materiel at a “surprisingly” quick pace in the Gaza Strip, a senior IDF officer told reporters on Thursday, but the terror group does not appear to be prepared for renewed direct conflict with Israel in the near future. He stressed the terrorist organization would not again drag Israel into a war, and that any future conflict will be one undertaken at the initiative of the Jewish state. Since the 2014 Operation Protective Edge in the beleaguered Strip, Hamas has been working tirelessly to replace its diminished ranks and rocket arsenal — and with some success, the high-ranking Southern Command officer told reporters. “Hamas is a highly intelligent enemy. They surprise me and learn their lessons very quickly,” he said. In the nearly two years since summer 2014, the terror organization has replenished some of its ranks, principally in its special forces and commando naval units, the officer said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hamas now has some 5,000 fighters in its special forces and has also filled out its middle and upper ranks, with 25 battalion and brigade commanders, the official said. Its short-range rocket and mortar programs have become a focus for the organization as well, in order to replace the thousands of missiles fired at Israel during Operation Protective Edge. Some of these new rockets have warheads that contain of hundreds of pounds of explosive material, which Israel has not seen up until now, the officer said. Some medium- and long-range rockets have also been developed, as evident by test-fires into the sea off the Gaza coast, the officer said. However, these efforts have been hindered somewhat by Hamas’s inability to acquire the necessary materials for their construction, due to Israel’s careful guarding of the borders. Advertisement “Hamas is not yet mass producing mortars because of its difficulties in obtaining raw materials,” he said. The group has, however, made strides in the production of drones and other advanced technologies, under the direction of Iran, the officer added. Unprepared for a full campaign against Israel, the terror organization, which has ruled the Gaza Strip for nearly a decade, now fears the IDF will initiate an attack against it, instead of only responding to Hamas acts of aggression, according to the officer. “Hamas fears a surprise attack,” he said. As such, the organization has worked to prevent instigators from giving Israel any reason to carry out operations in the Strip. “Hamas has created a defensive force that preserves the ceasefire and prevents terror attacks against Israel,” the officer said. “In places where there has been rocket fire, Hamas has rushed to stop those firing [them].” Advertisement ‘Hamas has been mindful to send us messages that it’s working against the terror attacks against us [in the Gaza Strip]’ In the year and a half since the 2014 war, several dozen rockets have been fired at Israel, almost entirely by terror organizations besides Hamas. “Even the recent improvised explosive device incidents — the latest one involved an old IED — were carried out by rogue groups,” he said. In that latest incident, which took place early Friday morning of last week, an IED detonated next to an Israeli D9 bulldozer, causing no injury or damage. “Hamas has been mindful to send us messages that it’s working against the terror attacks against us [in the Gaza Strip],” the officer said. However, the group has also encouraged and applauded the six-month wave of terror attacks taking place in the West Bank and Israel, he added. “This is the assessment of both the IDF and the other security bodies,” the officer said. Israeli plans for war The IDF will not be dragged into conflict with Hamas, but will initiate any conflict with the terrorist group, the officer said. Advertisement “We won’t follow in the enemy’s footsteps,” he added. The IDF has therefore drawn up an extensive battle plan for its troops, including “details and defining characteristics” of the enemy battalions. “We have a plan to overwhelm the military branch of Hamas. Every one of our battalions will fight on its way to a destination, will kill as many Hamas operatives as possible and will harm the organization’s infrastructure as much as possible,” he said. “This plan rests on the defense of the area surrounding the Gaza Strip — under the authority of the Gaza Division — while moving the areas [where troops] gather away from the threat of mortars,” the officer said. This is presumably a lesson learned from 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, in which some of the military casualties came from direct hits of mortar shells on IDF camps set up outside the border. “We need to be surprising and forceful. Our air power will be more meaningful and effective. Not just casual firepower. The plan will allow us different options, from a deterring strike to a full occupation of the Strip,” the Southern Command officer said. Don’t forget the Islamic State Across Israel’s southwestern border, a small, but vicious ally of the Islamic State has been waging a bloody war with Egyptian forces since 2011. Advertisement While the fighting has overwhelmingly remained inside Sinai and against Egypt, the understanding within Israel is that the Jewish state is next. “We have an interest in the Egyptian army defeating the Islamic State and not losing its control over the northern Sinai,” the officer said. Some 1,000 IS fighters are currently in the peninsula, according to the officers, and they are outfitted with some advanced anti-aircraft weaponry and assistance from Hamas, the officer said. “We have allowed [the Egyptians] most of their requests to temporarily bring their troops into the air and land of Sinai,” he said, referring to the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, which limits the number of soldiers that can enter the peninsula. “However, the entrance of artillery into the area, we have refused,” he added.

News article:
Hamas is amassing fighters and materiel at a “surprisingly” quick pace in the Gaza Strip, a senior IDF officer told reporters on Thursday, but the terror group does not appear to be prepared for renewed direct conflict with Israel in the near future. He stressed the terrorist organization would not again drag Israel into a war, and that any future conflict will be one undertaken at the initiative of the Jewish state. Since the 2014 Operation Protective Edge in the beleaguered Strip, Hamas has been working tirelessly to replace its diminished ranks and rocket arsenal — and with some success, the high-ranking Southern Command officer told reporters. “Hamas is a highly intelligent enemy. They surprise me and learn their lessons very quickly,” he said. In the nearly two years since summer 2014, the terror organization has replenished some of its ranks, principally in its special forces and commando naval units, the officer said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hamas now has some 5,000 fighters in its special forces and has also filled out its middle and upper ranks, with 25 battalion and brigade commanders, the official said. Its short-range rocket and mortar programs have become a focus for the organization as well, in order to replace the thousands of missiles fired at Israel during Operation Protective Edge. Some of these new rockets have warheads that contain of hundreds of pounds of explosive material, which Israel has not seen up until now, the officer said. Some medium- and long-range rockets have also been developed, as evident by test-fires into the sea off the Gaza coast, the officer said. However, these efforts have been hindered somewhat by Hamas’s inability to acquire the necessary materials for their construction, due to Israel’s careful guarding of the borders. Advertisement “Hamas is not yet mass producing mortars because of its difficulties in obtaining raw materials,” he said. The group has, however, made strides in the production of drones and other advanced technologies, under the direction of Iran, the officer added. Unprepared for a full campaign against Israel, the terror organization, which has ruled the Gaza Strip for nearly a decade, now fears the IDF will initiate an attack against it, instead of only responding to Hamas acts of aggression, according to the officer. “Hamas fears a surprise attack,” he said. As such, the organization has worked to prevent instigators from giving Israel any reason to carry out operations in the Strip. “Hamas has created a defensive force that preserves the ceasefire and prevents terror attacks against Israel,” the officer said. “In places where there has been rocket fire, Hamas has rushed to stop those firing [them].” Advertisement ‘Hamas has been mindful to send us messages that it’s working against the terror attacks against us [in the Gaza Strip]’ In the year and a half since the 2014 war, several dozen rockets have been fired at Israel, almost entirely by terror organizations besides Hamas. “Even the recent improvised explosive device incidents — the latest one involved an old IED — were carried out by rogue groups,” he said. In that latest incident, which took place early Friday morning of last week, an IED detonated next to an Israeli D9 bulldozer, causing no injury or damage. “Hamas has been mindful to send us messages that it’s working against the terror attacks against us [in the Gaza Strip],” the officer said. However, the group has also encouraged and applauded the six-month wave of terror attacks taking place in the West Bank and Israel, he added. “This is the assessment of both the IDF and the other security bodies,” the officer said. Israeli plans for war The IDF will not be dragged into conflict with Hamas, but will initiate any conflict with the terrorist group, the officer said. Advertisement “We won’t follow in the enemy’s footsteps,” he added. The IDF has therefore drawn up an extensive battle plan for its troops, including “details and defining characteristics” of the enemy battalions. “We have a plan to overwhelm the military branch of Hamas. Every one of our battalions will fight on its way to a destination, will kill as many Hamas operatives as possible and will harm the organization’s infrastructure as much as possible,” he said. “This plan rests on the defense of the area surrounding the Gaza Strip — under the authority of the Gaza Division — while moving the areas [where troops] gather away from the threat of mortars,” the officer said. This is presumably a lesson learned from 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, in which some of the military casualties came from direct hits of mortar shells on IDF camps set up outside the border. “We need to be surprising and forceful. Our air power will be more meaningful and effective. Not just casual firepower. The plan will allow us different options, from a deterring strike to a full occupation of the Strip,” the Southern Command officer said. Don’t forget the Islamic State Across Israel’s southwestern border, a small, but vicious ally of the Islamic State has been waging a bloody war with Egyptian forces since 2011. Advertisement While the fighting has overwhelmingly remained inside Sinai and against Egypt, the understanding within Israel is that the Jewish state is next. “We have an interest in the Egyptian army defeating the Islamic State and not losing its control over the northern Sinai,” the officer said. Some 1,000 IS fighters are currently in the peninsula, according to the officers, and they are outfitted with some advanced anti-aircraft weaponry and assistance from Hamas, the officer said. “We have allowed [the Egyptians] most of their requests to temporarily bring their troops into the air and land of Sinai,” he said, referring to the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, which limits the number of soldiers that can enter the peninsula. “However, the entrance of artillery into the area, we have refused,” he added.

Maj.-Gen. (res.) Amos Gilad, the director of policy and political-military affairs at the Defense Ministry, warned on Wednesday that Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, "doesn't care about the political bureau's policies, and does whatever he wants." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Deif, who commands the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, has survived several Israeli assassination attempts, the latest of which was during Operation Protective Edge in the summer of 2014. However, Gilad said that Israel's deterrence works on both the military and political wings of Hamas. "Our deterrence is still very effective and Hamas won't attack us as it is worried about its own skin," he said. Fighters from Hamas's Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (Photo: AFP) Hamas, he said, has been unsuccessful in its efforts to further escalate the violence between Israel and the Palestinians. "We have the upper hand in this secret war thanks to our security services, but this won't stop them from trying, and they won't stop until they're successful," Gilad noted. The real risk that Hamas poses, he said, "is their central ideology according to which there is no place for agreements with Israel. Contrary to delusions by some, Hamas had never changed its policies and remains true to its path. They're also patient, and they're willing to wait. Hamas won't adopt any principle that recognizes true coexistence." Gilad also warned that the electricity Israel provides the Gaza Strip "is being used for the production of rockets that are later aimed at Israel. This is absurd. No other country would allow this, but we do." Destruction in Gaza following Operation Protective Edge (Photo: AFP) Despite this, he said, Israel will continue aiding the Palestinians. "I'm hoping to have a water desalination project, and over 3 million construction aggregate were allowed into the Strip to rebuild houses," Gilad noted. "The situation in Gaza is hard, but Israel will aid with a series of economic measures that share a common policy - not to allow Gaza to collapse. I hope Hamas will not be there for long, so the Palestinians could have some sort of a future. Under Hamas's rule, they won't."

News article:
Hamas has quickly learned the lessons of the 2014 Operation Protective Edge and has been hard at work recovering its strength, a high-ranked IDF officer said Thursday. However, the Gaza terror organization has yet to restore its rockets arsenal to the same quantity and quality as before the war, it is hindered by a shortage in supply of arms and raw materials, and suffers from increasing tensions between its military and political branches. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter During a briefing to the media, a the senior IDF officer revealed some of the military's plans for a future conflict in Gaza. He also described a situation very similar to the period before the outbreak of Operation Protective Edge: Hamas in Gaza is pushing for an escalation of violence and trying to execute terror bombings in the West Bank - but is not interested in a confrontation with Israel in the Strip itself. At the same time, Hamas is dedicating most of its time and resources to restoring its military strength and further bolstering its forces. "Hamas is suspicious of Israel, fearing that it will initiate a surprise attack on the Gaza Strip, which is why we're concerned that Hamas will miscalculate the situation," the officer said. "They're highly-sensitive about any statements made on our side." Palestinian terrorists firing rockets at Israel (Photo: AFP/File) Thirty-five rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel since the end of Operation Protective Edge by other factions in the Strip. Most of these rockets either fell in open areas or were intercepted. Hamas, the official said, was quick to arrest those who violated the ceasefire. "Hamas has established a border-protecting unit that enforces the ceasefire ad prevents terror attacks against Israel," he said. "Even when roadside bombs went off - the last of which on Friday was an old IED - they were planted by other factions," he said. "Hamas sends us messages that it is working to stop attacks against us, that it remains restrained and that it is not interested in escalating the situation in the area because it is busy rehabilitating itself and the Strip. This view is shared by the IDF and other security forces, but we're not confused by it." Hamas's military leadership is more dominant now, challenging the political leadership at every turn and turning them into mere figureheads. A good demonstration of that was in recent weeks when the military wing - commanded by Mohammed Deif, his deputy Marwan Issa, who is responsible for communications with the political leadership, and Yahya Sanwar, who was released as part of the Shalit deal and is largely seen as Hamas's "defense minister" - executed one of the organization's battalion commanders without seeking the approval of the political leadership - raising the ire of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal. Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif challenges the organization's political leadership (Photo: EPA) "The lessons the military wing learned from Operation Protective Edge is that they should not have listened to the political leadership as much as they did, because the political bureau failed to reach any achievements in the war," the official explained. "They also claim Hamas's political leadership limited them when it came to surprise attacks against Israel." "You can't ignore the strength of the military wing in the Strip, which is supporting ISIS in the Sinai and making a series of appointments that are not to the liking of the political leadership," he added. Investing in drones The Military Intelligence Directorate has reported that the Hamas was investing a lot of time and resources in training its Nukhba force - the elite unit that will be sent to execute "quality operations" against Israel, like strategic bombings. The Nukhba unit has grown since the summer of 2014 and now numbers 5,000 fighters - out of Hamas's overall 20,000. Hamas is also investing in the training of its naval commando unit as part of the lessons learned from Operation Protective Edge, when that unit tried to infiltrated the Zikim beach, was spotted by IDF lookouts, and gunned down. Now, the commando unit has far more divers than it had before. Furthermore, Hamas is investing in the development of drones - with funds and knowhow from Iran. When it comes to its production of rockets, Hamas has been hindered by a shortage of raw materials, mostly because the Egyptian military destroyed most of the smuggling tunnels connecting the Gaza Strip to the Sinai Peninsula. This has been making it harder on the terror group to restock its arsenal. Still, Hamas continues testing and developing rockets by firing middle- and long-range rockets into the sea in an effort to bypass the Iron Dome missile-defense system. Hamas trying to challenge the Iron Dome missile-defense system (Photo: Herzl Yosef) At the same time, Hamas is developing mortar shells and short-range rockets with very big payloads that could reach 150-200 kilograms per warhead - the kind of which they did not have before. Hamas chose to direct its resources thus as most of the Israelis killed by rocket fire during Operation Protective Edge were hit by the short-range fire to the border communities. In addition, Israel is limited when it comes to providing sufficient warning of short-range rockets, and limited in their interception. However, "Hamas is not yet mass producing these mortar shells because of its difficulties in getting raw materials," the senior officer said. In addition, the IDF has cautioned about continued attempts by Hamas to establish cells to attack Israel during war time from different fronts - including Lebanon and the Sinai, aided by ISIS militants in the peninsula. Israel, the IDF officer noted, "has an interest in the Egyptian army defeating ISIS and not losing its control over northern Sinai. They're already operating against the smuggling to the Gaza Strip. We've approved most of their requests to bring land and air forces into the Sinai, temporarily, but some requests - like bringing artillery into the peninsula - were denied." According to the IDF officer, there are three factors that could lead to the renewal of fighting in the south: One of the sides wrongly reading the situation because of a specific incident or declaration, escalation in light of incidents in the West Bank, and the Palestinians tiring of the Israeli military blockade and rising up against it. 'Aerial attacks will be more significant' In order to prepare for a possible renewal of fighting, the IDF's top echelons have recently approved an operative plan to fighting in the Gaza Strip, formulated by the Southern Command. "We have a plan to defeat Hamas's military wing based on different parameters that have been determined," the officer said. "Each of our battalions fighting on its way to its target will kill as many Hamas militants and damage as much of the organization's infrastructure as possible. The aim is to end the next campaign with Hamas's abilities set back by years. The plan is based on strong protection of the Gaza border communities, which will be done by the Gaza Division, while the IDF's gathering areas will be located far from the mortar shell threat." The senior IDF officer further stated that "defeating Hamas will be achieved by offense, not defense, so we can initiate and not get dragged into it, not react to the enemy's moves. We need to surprise the enemy, and do so with great force. In addition, the aerial attacks will be much more significant and effective. Not just bombing for the sake of bombing. The plan will allow for different options - from a deterring strike to the full capture of the Gaza Strip. The plan could develop to the most extreme directions, and will enable us to deliver a very hard blow to the organization’s military wing." Members of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (Photo: AP) However, it's important to mention, the IDF currently sees no alternative ruler for the Gaza Strip as Hamas still enjoys the support of the Palestinian street. The senior officer said battalion commanders in the Southern Command have undergone a series of courses in different topics, including on how to defeat a Hamas battalion. "Each of our battalion commanders maneuvering in the Strip has a whole book about the battalion he'll fight against, including all of its details and characteristics," he said. The senior officer said the plan also takes into consideration the possibility of having to evacuate communities close to the Gaza border. This will be done in coordination with the regional councils, while some personnel will remain in the communities to do vital work and defend the empty homes. The plan includes allocating communities to take in the residents of the evacuated towns. In addition, pending financing promised by the government, the protection measures on the border fence will be increased in order to defend the nearby communities from mass protests on the fence of Palestinians trying to infiltrate Israel. With all of that in mind, the Southern Command stressed that "there are no tensions in the south at the moment. We evaluate our preparedness in the Gaza border area as strong. The assessment right now is that there is not going to be an escalation of hostilities on the southern border in the near future and that the current situation will continue. The IDF will continue assessing the situation. There has been an improvement in the intelligence gathering and in the troops' preparedness."

The senior IDF officer further stated that "defeating Hamas will be achieved by offense, not defense, so we can initiate and not get dragged into it, not react to the enemy's moves. We need to surprise the enemy, and do so with great force. In addition, the aerial attacks will be much more significant and effective. Not just bombing for the sake of bombing. The plan will allow for different options - from a deterring strike to the full capture of the Gaza Strip. The plan could develop to the most extreme directions, and will enable us to deliver a very hard blow to the organization’s military wing." Members of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (Photo: AP) However, it's important to mention, the IDF currently sees no alternative ruler for the Gaza Strip as Hamas still enjoys the support of the Palestinian street. The senior officer said battalion commanders in the Southern Command have undergone a series of courses in different topics, including on how to defeat a Hamas battalion. "Each of our battalion commanders maneuvering in the Strip has a whole book about the battalion he'll fight against, including all of its details and characteristics," he said. The senior officer said the plan also takes into consideration the possibility of having to evacuate communities close to the Gaza border. This will be done in coordination with the regional councils, while some personnel will remain in the communities to do vital work and defend the empty homes. The plan includes allocating communities to take in the residents of the evacuated towns. In addition, pending financing promised by the government, the protection measures on the border fence will be increased in order to defend the nearby communities from mass protests on the fence of Palestinians trying to infiltrate Israel. With all of that in mind, the Southern Command stressed that "there are no tensions in the south at the moment. We evaluate our preparedness in the Gaza border area as strong. The assessment right now is that there is not going to be an escalation of hostilities on the southern border in the near future and that the current situation will continue. The IDF will continue assessing the situation. There has been an improvement in the intelligence gathering and in the troops' preparedness."

News article:
Amid fast-rising tensions along the Gaza Strip border, Israel on Thursday carried out its largest civilian drill near the Palestinian enclave since 2014’s war between Israel and Hamas, Channel 2 reported Friday. Soldiers and emergency response teams simulated a Hamas incursion into Israeli territory, including an attack on an Israeli kibbutz near the border and the taking of hostages by terrorists. The exercise, which was held at Kibbutz Erez, included troops overpowering the terrorists in the community’s dining hall. Participants in the drill included the army, the police, Magen David Adom medics, the fire department, civilian response teams and others. The report also said that although Israel believes Hamas does not want a new war now, the IDF has in recent days completed preparations for any outbreak of conflict. It added that the army has boosted its deployment adjacent to the Gaza border in preparation for such an eventuality.

The Ma’an News Agency, citing eyewitnesses, reported that four bulldozers moved several meters into the southern Gaza Strip in an area east of the city of Rafah and began leveling ground near the border. Drones were seen flying overhead as the IDF earth-movers worked. According to Ma’an, it was the latest in over half a dozen similar incursions over the past ten days. Advertisement A senior IDF officer told reporters Thursday that Hamas is amassing fighters and materiel at a “surprisingly” quick pace in Gaza but that the terror group does not appear to be prepared for renewed direct conflict with Israel in the near future. He stressed the terrorist organization would not again drag Israel into a war, and that any future conflict would be one undertaken at the initiative of the Jewish state. His comments came a day after a senior Defense Ministry official indicated there is no expectation of an increase in violence with Hamas. “The good news is that our deterrence is still working,” said Amos Gilad, director of the ministry’s Political-Military Affairs Bureau, at a conference on the beleaguered coastal strip’s financial woes. “They say that there will be a ‘hot’ summer. That’ll only be because of the high temperatures,” he continued, alluding to the tendency for regional conflicts to take place in warmer summer months. “Economics alone can’t solve [Gaza’s problems]. Economics are not the fundamental solution,” Gilad said in his address. Advertisement So long as Hamas rules the Gaza Strip, he added, there will not be peace there.

News article:
Eyeing a fresh round of violence with Israel, the Hamas terrorist organization is sparing no effort to enhance its arsenal and train its operatives, especially from the Gaza-ruling group’s elite “Nukhbah” terror unit, a senior officer with the Israel Defense Forces Southern Command told reporters Thursday. In a briefing with military correspondents, the officer said that Hamas’s special forces currently include some 20,000 operatives. Hamas also strives to develop its drone and naval capabilities, including terrorist divers, he said, adding that the terror group was actively pursuing improved rocket-launching capabilities. But Hamas has yet to rehabilitate its pre-2014 firing abilities, which were significantly crippled during Israel’s Operation Protective Edge. Hamas is currently focusing on developing its short-range projectile fire apparatus, which proved more effective during the summer 2014 war with Israel, as it challenged the Iron Dome missile defense system’s interceptors. The officer said the Islamist group was trying to increase the amount of explosives its arsenal of short-range projectiles can carry, as well as to develop mid-range rockets that could “escape” the Iron Dome. One of the innovations said to be in development are “barrel bombs” capable of packing up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds) of explosives. “There is concern of miscalculation on Gaza’s part, meaning Hamas suspects we are planning some sort of operation, therefore they’re on very high alert and they lend great importance to any statement by the IDF. They’re concerned we might strike Gaza to affect the situation in Judea and Samaria,” said the officer, adding, “Hamas saw the [months-long terror wave] in Judea and Samaria as a strategic opportunity it hoped to seize. It is very disappointed by the fact the situation in Judea and Samaria has stabilized.”

News article:
So now, finally, parts of the story can be told. The context to the IDF’s drill late last week, which simulated an attack on a kibbutz near the Gaza border by Hamas forces, becomes clearer. The oblique references by senior Israeli officials to Hamas’s ongoing tunnel digging, made in television interviews and at public forums, resonate more seriously. The assertions that Israel will fight the next war with Hamas on its terms, issued by IDF officers who cannot be named in briefings to local military correspondents, take on a more immediate significance. Why? Because Hamas, the IDF finally confirmed for publication on Monday, has been tunneling under the border again. The nightmare of 2014, when troops discovered and destroyed some three dozen cross-border attack tunnels in the midst of a bitter war, is far from over. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms As with those 100,000-plus rockets and missiles deployed by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon with only one address, the question of the next round of conflict with Hamas in Gaza — it must unavoidably be concluded — is not one of “if,” but rather, simply, of “when.” And while it would be comforting to believe that “senior IDF officer” who last week assured Israel’s military reporters that Hamas is not prepared for a new round of conflict, that Hamas will not again drag Israel into a war, and that any future conflict will be one undertaken at the initiative of the Jewish state, there are compelling reasons, unfortunately, to doubt his confidence. For one thing, Israel has three times found itself dragged into conflict with Hamas in the less than a decade since the Islamist terror group seized control of the Strip. And in none of those wars and mini-wars has Israel been able to achieve a decisive victory or even a prolonged period of subsequent calm. To state this is not by definition a savage criticism, by the way, or a recommendation for the use of greater force. A more destructive confrontation would have cost more lives on both sides and exposed Israel to greater international criticism and damage — no matter how unjustified — without necessarily yielding any more auspicious result. But it is true, nonetheless: Despite the best efforts of Israel’s best military minds, Hamas still rules Gaza; Hamas is still sustained by international support or indifference; Hamas is constantly improving its rocket capabilities; and Hamas, the Israeli public has now finally and formally been told, is again digging sophisticated attack tunnels under the border. Advertisement For another thing, prepared or not, Hamas may now believe it has an urgent incentive to attack Israel again in the near future. It was widely and quite credibly argued, during and in the aftermath of 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, that Israel had narrowly avoided a devastating Hamas onslaught through the network of tunnels the terror group had set up at the time. It was suggested that Hamas had been planning to send hundreds of gunmen through those tunnels, to attack military and civilian targets, to massacre Israelis, to seize hostages — to radically remake the balance of power. It remains unclear to this day why Hamas chose not to attempt such an attack; some have argued that there was a dispute within the organization between its so-called political and military leaderships. Whatever the case, on July 22, 2014, while the war was in full swing, Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog spoke of the “unimaginable” mega-terror attack Hamas was believed to have been planning — sending hundreds of terrorists swarming through those tunnels to massacre Israelis in the Gaza-adjacent kibbutzim and moshavim. Days earlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said intended Hamas attacks on kibbutz kindergartens, homes and dining halls would have been “catastrophic.” With the cessation of hostilities, even as Israel was grappling and continues to grapple with the international community’s failure to understand what we face from the Gaza terror state — step forward Bernie Sanders, BDS et al — Hamas went back to concerted tunneling and rocket manufacture. It has been gaining strength at a “surprising” pace, that same unnameable senior IDF officer acknowledged in last week’s briefing. And it has been utilizing some 1,000 tunnelers, working round-the-clock six days a week. Inevitably, perhaps, it has suffered setbacks, notably including a series of tunnel collapses, and the exposure of the tunnel revealed by the IDF on Monday. Or, then again, perhaps to say “inevitably” is to miss the mark. Perhaps, Hamas may be asking itself, Israel has been making gains of its own in this relentless battle of wills. Perhaps it has found technologies to combat even Hamas’s well-constructed, deep and reinforced subterranean attack routes. (Israeli security sources were indeed quoted Monday talking about new “technologies” being utilized to find the tunnels.) And if that is the case, one can only ask, can Israel really be confident that it will determine the timing and nature of the next round of conflict with the brutal Islamists? Hamas, which insists on continuing its efforts to destroy Israel, and which demonstrates such supreme indifference to the well-being of the people of Gaza (and doubtless much cynical amusement at the naivete of the international community), may feel that, fully ready or not, now is the time to attack. That now, heaven forbid, is the time to do what it did not do prior to the 2014 war. Because otherwise, it may be gauging, Israel could be on the point of exposing and destroying more, perhaps all, of that painstakingly constructed network of attack tunnels.

Whatever the case, on July 22, 2014, while the war was in full swing, Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog spoke of the “unimaginable” mega-terror attack Hamas was believed to have been planning — sending hundreds of terrorists swarming through those tunnels to massacre Israelis in the Gaza-adjacent kibbutzim and moshavim. Days earlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said intended Hamas attacks on kibbutz kindergartens, homes and dining halls would have been “catastrophic.” With the cessation of hostilities, even as Israel was grappling and continues to grapple with the international community’s failure to understand what we face from the Gaza terror state — step forward Bernie Sanders, BDS et al — Hamas went back to concerted tunneling and rocket manufacture. It has been gaining strength at a “surprising” pace, that same unnameable senior IDF officer acknowledged in last week’s briefing. And it has been utilizing some 1,000 tunnelers, working round-the-clock six days a week. Inevitably, perhaps, it has suffered setbacks, notably including a series of tunnel collapses, and the exposure of the tunnel revealed by the IDF on Monday. Or, then again, perhaps to say “inevitably” is to miss the mark. Perhaps, Hamas may be asking itself, Israel has been making gains of its own in this relentless battle of wills. Perhaps it has found technologies to combat even Hamas’s well-constructed, deep and reinforced subterranean attack routes. (Israeli security sources were indeed quoted Monday talking about new “technologies” being utilized to find the tunnels.) And if that is the case, one can only ask, can Israel really be confident that it will determine the timing and nature of the next round of conflict with the brutal Islamists? Hamas, which insists on continuing its efforts to destroy Israel, and which demonstrates such supreme indifference to the well-being of the people of Gaza (and doubtless much cynical amusement at the naivete of the international community), may feel that, fully ready or not, now is the time to attack. That now, heaven forbid, is the time to do what it did not do prior to the 2014 war. Because otherwise, it may be gauging, Israel could be on the point of exposing and destroying more, perhaps all, of that painstakingly constructed network of attack tunnels.

News article:
Israeli Education Minister and Jewish Home party leader Naftali Bennett has applauded the IDF's success in locating and destroying a massive terrorist attack tunnel from Gaza into Israel, and warned of Hamas's continued motivation to launch a major attack. Bennett, who is also a member of the Security Cabinet, said Hamas's top priority was to carry out a multi-pronged, mass-casualty infiltration attack from Gaza into southern Israeli communities. The Jewish Home leader has been credited for pushing the government to initiate an IDF operation during 2014's Operation Protective Edge, defying strong opposition from other cabinet members - including Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon - who had insisted on restricting the operation to dismantling terrorist groups' rocket-firing capabilities. Bennett has since clashed with Ya'alon and Prime Minister Netanyahu on security issues, criticizing them for not taking a hard enough stance. In his statement following the IDF's latest discovery, he appeared to repeat that criticism. "In the two years since (Operation) Protective Edge, Hamas was not deterred from re-intensifying its efforts, as we warned," he said. Despite the IDF destroying its entire attack tunnel capabilities - and foiling a massive planned attack against Israeli civilians - Bennett warned that Hamas had turned tunnel construction into a "national priority," and was investing massively in plans to launch an even greater attack. "The time has come to internalize" the threat, he said. "Hamas's objective is to surprise us with a multi-front infiltration attack, (including) killings and kidnappings," he said, describing it as a "terrorist Yom Kippur (War)-type scenario." During the 1973 war, Israeli forces sustained serious casualties when Arab armies launched a surprise attack, capitalizing on the Israeli government's sense of complacency following its spectacular 1967 victory, before the IDF eventually recovered and pushed back to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Israel needs to prevent such a scenario recurring "at any price, and not to rely on Hamas being 'deterred'," he said. The government is obligated to provide security to the residents of the south."

News article:
Residents of Gaza border towns, journalists and political opponents took Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud government to task Wednesday, accusing it of failing to address the threat of Hamas-dug attack tunnels from the Strip. The “The Threat of the Tunnels” conference, held in the southern town of Sderot, took on additional weight in light of the recent discovery of a tunnel that reached deep into Israeli territory from the southern Gaza Strip. On the issue of the tunnels, IDF Southern Command head Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir attempted to reassure the crowd that the army had things under control. “The period since Operation Protective Edge has been the most quiet period in a decade,” Zamir said, using the Israeli name for the war in Gaza in 2014. “The tunnels Hamas tries to build have become death traps for its operatives.” He was referring to a series of tunnel collapses throughout the Strip in recent weeks that have killed scores of Hamas men. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “We have detailed plans on how to respond to any Hamas aggression, and are operating constantly along the border,” he added. “In addition to preserving the quiet and preventing terror, we must prepare for war, with the understanding that the realities of the world can change,” Zamir said. Various high-ranking IDF officers and defense officials have stressed over the past week that though Hamas is rearming itself, there is no expectation of conflict in the near future. “As part of our preparations, an organized plan was created by the relevant bodies — the Defense Ministry, the IDF and local councils — to temporarily move residents away from the range of mortars and out of harm’s way,” Zamir also said. During the 2014 war, communities close to the border were evacuated for this exact reason, and a similar plan also exists for northern Israeli towns at risk of Hezbollah rocket attacks. Zamir’s comments — which echoed many statements expressed in the past week — were overshadowed by the political attacks on the government and Netanyahu’s Likud party, as well as the anger of the Sderot residents in attendance. Advertisement The heads of opposition parties — the Zionist Union’s Isaac Herzog, Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid, Yisrael Beytenu’s Avigdor Liberman and Meretz’s Zehava Galon — spoke at the conference, offering their parties’ answers to the threat of attack tunnels. Likud, however, could only muster Miki Zohar, a freshman MK who is 22nd on the party’s list and is best known for proposing stricter legislation against businesses that remain open on Shabbat. Zohar’s appearance started poorly, with the event’s emcee, Channel 2 anchor Dany Cushmaro, lamenting that only an alternate member of the Knesset’s Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee came to the event from Likud. “We wanted someone who’s really a part of the coalition cabinet,” Cushmaro said during Zohar’s introduction. Things did not get better from there. Zohar’s speech was interrupted multiple times, first by audience members who demanded the government do more to protect them from Hamas, and then by Cushmaro himself, who derided the MK’s speech as light on content. The crowd is actively arguing with Micky Zohar. pic.twitter.com/8EGxCPNkot Advertisement — Judah Ari Gross (@JudahAriGross) April 20, 2016 “Every generation has its challenges,” Zohar said, and the only thing stopping the “challenge” of tunnels is Israel’s new detection technology. “That’s all you have to say?” Cushmaro asked. “I’ll give you my speech, and you can read it twice,” Zohar responded. The freshman MK trumpeted the new tunnel detection technology as a panacea for the threat of the tunnels and a feather in the cap of the government. “How was the tunnel found? Due to information? No, due to technology,” he said, stretching out his pronunciation of the last word. The army, meanwhile, has stressed that the still-secret tunnel detection system was only one part of the effort to discover the tunnel, with intelligence and “boots on the ground” playing an important role. “The left doesn’t like it when problems get solved,” Zohar added. Advertisement Col. (res.) Yossi Langotzky, who previously served as adviser to the IDF chief of staff on the threat of tunnels, called Zohar “an idiot” for his comments on tunnel detection technology. “Have a little responsibility, a little professionalism, a little citizenship,” Langotzky said on the sidelines of the conference. “Any physical barrier can be overcome.” The attacks on the government came not only in the form of direct challenges from audience members, who accused the party of holding back funds for the creation of a new superior barrier system, but also from other speakers, including former political allies of Netanyahu. Liberman, a staunch right-winger who once considered urging that Israel reconquer the Gaza Strip, chose a surprising avenue of attack. Advocating a lessening of some of the restrictions on imports and exports for the coastal enclave, the Yisrael Beytenu leader emphasized the importance of easing the economic crisis in Gaza, which he claimed has been fueling the conflict. “A better life for Gaza residents makes them less likely to join a terrorist organization like Hamas, and Hamas knows it,” Liberman said. The terrorist organization diverts funds and materials designated for the reconstruction of Gaza and uses it for its own nefarious means, he charged. Advertisement “What would I do if I had responsibility for this issue?” he asked rhetorically. “Open a TV station, radio station and website in the Strip to tell the [Gaza] population the truth about Hamas.” Galon, from the left-wing Meretz party, advocated a dramatic change in policy, one that puts more emphasis on the need for negotiations in place of violent conflict to resolve the issues coming from Gaza. For a decade Israel has had “the same policy and the same results,” Galon said. “This might sound ‘sensitive,’ but security isn’t just about military power, it’s about diplomacy,” she said. “Deterrence doesn’t last forever.” Lapid and Herzog dealt less with what should be done to resolve the threat of tunnels on the Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, and more with how the government has failed to do so. “If I were prime minister, the person initiating these tunnels wouldn’t stay alive,” Herzog said. He blasted the government and security cabinet as being short on action and long on word, as part of his recent bid to appear tough on terror. “I don’t think Hamas is deterred enough. They keep digging tunnels, which shows they’re not deterred,” Herzog said. A recording of the opposition leader telling Labor party members the party had to stop giving the impression “that we are always ‘Arab-lovers’” leaked Tuesday evening, prompting outrage and ridicule in the Israeli public. In response to the brewing scandal, Herzog told audience members at the Sderot conference the quote was out of context, that he was discussing how the party is seen by others.

Hamas deploys forces on Egypt-Gaza border over IS concerns GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The militant Hamas group deployed forces on Thursday along the Egypt-Gaza border to counter Cairo's concerns that it is aiding Islamic State extremists in Egypt's lawless Sinai Peninsula. Egypt accuses Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, of providing a safe haven for the IS affiliate in Sinai through a network of smuggling tunnels. Hamas denies the charge. Hamas and a high-ranking Egyptian security official said the deployment is part of an agreement reached with Egyptian officials last month. Palestinian Hamas security forces deploy on the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, Thursday, April 21, 2016.

(AP Photo/ Khalil Hamra) "This emphasizes the Palestinian stand to tighten security on the border and nothing that harms Egypt will come out of Gaza," said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri. The Egyptian security official said the deployment is part of the new deal with Egypt that sees Hamas halt tunnel construction in return for opening the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's main gateway to the outside world. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. On Thursday, armed Hamas men took up positions along the 13-kilometer (8-mile) border, with fighters in pick-up trucks patrolling back and forth. Relations between Hamas and Egypt soured after the 2013 military ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Hamas is an offshoot of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood movement. Egypt has been battling IS militants and in 2014 launched a fierce campaign on the underground tunnels with Gaza, destroying many of them. It has also kept the Rafah crossing largely sealed. Abu Zuhri said he hopes that the deal will lead to the crossing's reopening. ___ Associated Press Writer Maggie Michael contributed to this report from Cairo.

News article:
April 26, 2016 Israel and Hamas have been escalating their war of words, which observers on both sides fear could turn into violence. Gaza has yet to recover from the destruction of the last war with Israel in the summer of 2014, when more than 178,000 houses were destroyed or damaged, which makes any upcoming war between Israel and the Palestinians seem too early and premature. After a flurry of contentious statements in February, the situation calmed in March as both Hamas and Israel stopped talking about a possible fourth Israeli-Gaza war, and both showed a desire to quiet their people and reassure them that no confrontation would break out anytime soon. But on April 14, an anonymous senior Israeli officer made an unprecedented statement about Israel Defense Forces (IDF) plans for the next potential military confrontation with Hamas in Gaza. Israeli media reported that the official was a prominent source from the IDF leadership in the southern area. The Israeli plan for a potential war against Hamas in Gaza received wide media coverage in the Palestinian and Israeli press. It calls for each Israeli battalion to kill as many Hamas members as possible and thwart the movement’s moves and goals. The IDF has developed a strong defense and attack system capable of protecting the Gaza envelope and minimizing the threat of mortar shells, while the Israeli air force would launch an extraordinary and efficient offensive. Abu Mujahid, a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, told Al-Monitor, “The resistance in Gaza is preparing itself for the worst in its upcoming confrontation with the Israeli army. We take the IDF threats to launch a new war against Gaza very seriously. We have growing speculations that the Israeli enemy has begun the countdown for a new aggression against Gaza, and the resistance is getting prepared around the clock in order not to give the Israeli army a chance to launch a sudden attack.” Israel announced April 18 that it had discovered a new tunnel east of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, noting that the tunnel is 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) long, 30 meters (almost 100 feet) deep and extends inside Israel. On the same day, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, issued a statement saying Israel’s supposed "discovery" was designed to distract the public's attention away from criticism targeting Israeli leaders for stalling the process of eliminating the Gaza tunnels and as a way to reassure the Israeli settlers in the Gaza envelope. Then Hamas noted that it has more in store for Israel than a tunnel. On the same day as well, al-Qassam Brigades revealed for the first time its “R 160” missile, which has a range of 160 kilometers (100 miles), meaning it could reach Haifa. Yousef Rizqa, former Hamas minister of information and a political adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, the deputy head of Hamas’ political bureau, told Al-Monitor, “Israel’s announcement of discovering the tunnel aims at reassuring the Israeli population that the government is making great efforts to maintain the security of the settlers, confront Hamas and gain international support for Israel, by illustrating the offensive cross-border tunnels as a threat posed by Hamas. "The more Israel increases its calls to seek out support, the more the expectations for a future war against Gaza increase. Although the resistance in Gaza does not call for a new war and does not want to carry out attacks to break the truce, it has the right to prepare itself on the field, despite the lack of military balance between the resistance and Israel.” In conjunction with all these security developments, both sides carried out field maneuvers. On April 18, the Israeli army launched large-scale military maneuvers in the Golan Heights and the Jordan Valley that included field forces and aircraft. Even before that, on April 10, the Israeli army had its largest military training since the 2014 war in Gaza, with the participation of thousands of soldiers, near the Gaza border to simulate the incursion of Hamas inside Israeli settlements and the detention of Israeli hostages. On April 19, the Ministry of Interior and National Security in Gaza ended the fifth maneuver of its security services, which it had started in Gaza during recent weeks. The maneuver included evacuating all headquarters and increasing security apparatuses, while explosions and weapons firing were heard. Ambulances, civil defense vehicles and the police practiced their movements in a drill that resembled the outbreak of a new war with Israel. Meanwhile, retired Palestinian Maj. Gen. Wassef Erekat told Al-Monitor, “Decision-makers within the resistance leadership in Gaza must be alert of the possibility of Israel launching a [surprise] attack, as it did in the three previous wars in 2008, 2012 and 2014, since the Israeli government is known for being extreme and risk-taking. Perhaps [the Israeli army] is being pressured by the Israeli public to carry out a bloody military operation against Gaza, despite the misleading statements about not wanting this war.” Remarkably enough, Israeli Housing Minister Yoav Galant called April 18 for the Israeli army to prepare for a wide-scale confrontation with Hamas in Gaza by the beginning of summer. Perhaps this call seems dangerous because Galant is a former IDF commander and military general who led the war on Gaza in 2014 and is also a member of Israel’s political-security Cabinet. A Palestinian security official in Gaza told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, "Hamas’ and Israel’s declaration of their unwillingness to go into a military confrontation anytime soon might face three factors that may eventually lead to an outbreak of this confrontation. The first is the misunderstanding from both parties due to their field efforts on the Gaza-Israel borders; the second is the increased escalation in the West Bank, most recently the operation in Jerusalem on April 18, which wounded 20 Israelis; and the third is the resistance in Gaza feeling that the blockade is tightening with no alleviation initiatives in sight.” Meanwhile on April 23, Hamas warned about the continued tightening of the Israeli blockade on Gaza and called regional and international parties to shoulder their responsibilities in the deteriorating situation. Despite the growing mutual warnings between Hamas and Israel about an imminent confrontation, a number of factors might prevent its outbreak, at least for now. The Israeli army is preoccupied with the growing unrest in the West Bank that began in October. Also, Israelis seem to doubt how much the IDF could actually achieve in Gaza — in terms of completely eliminating the Palestinian factions’ missiles and toppling Hamas — except for killing and wounding thousands of Palestinians. The Israelis must wonder whether it is worth getting pulled back into the Gaza quagmire.

News article:
In a surprising move, Israel, Egypt and Hamas appear to be cooperating to keep the Islamic State (ISIS) under control in Sinai, The Washington Post reported. While Egypt and Israel have a peace treaty, the increased activity of ISIS affiliate Wilayat Sinai has prompted greater coordination than the two countries have had in the decades since it was signed. Additionally, Israel has tightened its security along the Egyptian border, building a new barrier to keep out militants rumored to be planning attacks in Israel. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, without the changes, by now “we would have been overflowed by thousands of ISIS fighters from Sinai.” Wilayat Sinai has grown bolder since taking responsibility for downing a Russian charter plane in October, an act which killed all 244 people on board. The terror group has carried out ongoing attacks against Egyptian soldiers, overrunning military outposts and planting roadside bombs. Experts acknowledge the group’s efficacy. “They have genius strategists,” said Mohannad Sabry, an Egyptian journalist and author of a book on the Islamist insurgency in the Sinai. “If you study the map of their attacks, they obviously know what they are doing exactly, and it shows that they have a great deal of freedom of mobility.” Despite this, Egypt claims it is winning the war against ISIS in Sinai, a claim Egypt’s allies fear is suspect.

Yaron Malka, the deputy commander of Israel’s Saqi Brigade that defends Israel’s border with Sinai. In fact, in a recent tweet, the ISIS affiliate took responsibility for destroying an American-made Egyptian M60 tank near Gora airport, used by peacekeepers as a base. Meanwhile, both Israel and Egypt have been wary of Hamas involvement in the conflict, suspecting militants from Sinai have been using Hamas smuggling tunnels to find refuge from Egypt in the Gaza Strip. Hamas denies the allegations, saying it has no sympathy for ISIS, which branded the ruling party in Gaza “infidels” in a video two years ago. Pressure from Egypt has prompted Hamas, also considered a terrorist organization, to bring its own border under control, keeping ISIS militants out. According to one Hamas official, there are now more than 300 Hamas fighters deployed in three areas along the sea and two land border crossings with the Sinai. “The national security forces redeployed along the borders with Egypt, and it is part of the security plan to fully control the borders and the stability of it, as well as the security of our Egyptian brothers,” Eyad al-Bozom, a Hamas Interior Ministry spokesman, said in a statement. While dangerous times make for strange bedfellows, it is important to recall that at the end of the day, the Bible assures us it is all in God’s hands.

In a surprising move, Israel, Egypt and Hamas appear to be cooperating to keep the Islamic State (ISIS) under control in Sinai, The Washington Post reported. While Egypt and Israel have a peace treaty, the increased activity of ISIS affiliate Wilayat Sinai has prompted greater coordination than the two countries have had in the decades since it was signed. Additionally, Israel has tightened its security along the Egyptian border, building a new barrier to keep out militants rumored to be planning attacks in Israel. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, without the changes, by now “we would have been overflowed by thousands of ISIS fighters from Sinai.” Wilayat Sinai has grown bolder since taking responsibility for downing a Russian charter plane in October, an act which killed all 244 people on board. The terror group has carried out ongoing attacks against Egyptian soldiers, overrunning military outposts and planting roadside bombs. Experts acknowledge the group’s efficacy. “They have genius strategists,” said Mohannad Sabry, an Egyptian journalist and author of a book on the Islamist insurgency in the Sinai. “If you study the map of their attacks, they obviously know what they are doing exactly, and it shows that they have a great deal of freedom of mobility.” Despite this, Egypt claims it is winning the war against ISIS in Sinai, a claim Egypt’s allies fear is suspect.

Israeli Army Coordinator of Government Activities in the Occupied Territories, Major Maj. -Gen. Yoav ‘Poli’ Mordechai, said the Israeli army will continue its activities in border areas in the Gaza Strip, and denied any knowledge of an agreement on the issue. Mordechai stated the army intends to continue its operations “against Hamas,” adding that the Hamas movement is “digging tunnels in areas that are under full Israeli control.” He also said that the military will act against the tunnels in the “Buffer Zone,” across the border fence, and that “such tunnels and activities by Hamas target Israel’s sovereignty, and pose a threat to its security.” Meanwhile, member of the Political Bureau of Hamas, Mousa Abu Marzook, thanked the Qatari ambassador in Gaza in what he described as “his role in repelling the latest Israeli escalation against Rafah and Sheja’eyya.” “The people of Gaza appreciate the role of Qatar, the Qatari ambassador, and his relentless efforts in preventing Israel from destroying what Qatar built in the Gaza Strip,” according to Abu Marzook. On the ground, the Israeli army bombarded several areas in the besieged Gaza Strip, causing serious property damage, in addition to wounding an elderly man and three children. The Israeli army also invaded, and bulldozed, Palestinian lands, after advancing approximately 150 meters, northeast of Rafah, in the southern part of the Gaza Strip.

News article:
Hamas says not seeking war but will fight Israeli incursions Hamas's leader in Gaza said Friday his Islamist movement did not seek war with Israel but would resist incursions into the Palestinian enclave, following the worst cross-border violence since 2014. Three days of mortar and tank fire between Israel and Palestinian militants, as well as Israeli air strikes, have raised concerns of a new war in the Hamas-run territory. Ismail Haniya accused Israeli forces of intruding nearly 200 metres (yards) into Gazan territory. Palestinian Hamas militants take part in a 2015 anti-Israeli protest in the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis ©Said Khatib (AFP/File) "We are not calling for a new war, but we will not under any circumstances accept these incursions," he said in a Friday prayer sermon in the Gaza Strip. Earlier, Israeli aircraft carried out their fourth air raid on the enclave since Wednesday, attacking sites at Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza and near Khan Yunis in the south, witnesses said. There were no reports of any casualties. The Israeli army confirmed just one strike, saying aircraft targeted "a Hamas terror infrastructure" in response to cross-border mortar fire. Since Wednesday, Hamas and other militant groups have fired at least 12 mortar rounds across the frontier, and Israeli tanks have fired repeatedly at what the army said were Hamas targets. The Palestinian fire targeted Israeli forces searching along the border, and short distances inside Gaza, for infiltration tunnels leading into southern Israel -- among the most feared weapons of Hamas fighters during the 2014 summer war. On Thursday, Zeina Al-Amour, a 54-year-old Palestinian woman, became the first fatality of the flare-up after Israeli tank fire hit her home, medics said. The violence has raised concerns for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza, that has held since the 50-day war in 2014 left 2,251 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. - Living in fear - On both sides of the border, residents said they were living in fear of a wider conflict. "In the night there is the sound of mortars, bombs, planes," said Jehan Berman, a resident of kibbutz Kerem Shalom which is just 40 metres from the border. "We're tired. We're still recovering from the last war and the next one is already at our door," he told AFP. Kerem Shalom is close to where the army has uncovered two Hamas tunnels, reportedly stretching into Israeli territory, in recent weeks, with the most recent discovery on Thursday. Destruction of such tunnels became one of Israel's primary goals during the 2014 war, with more than 30 eliminated, according to the army. Since the conflict, Hamas has continued to build what it calls "resistance tunnels". Citing Hamas activities, Israel maintains a tight blockade on Gaza in what human rights groups say is collective punishment against its more than 1.8 million residents. Ali al-Moghrabi, 40, a tailor from Gaza City's Al-Hanan Zeitun neighbourhood which was bombed on Thursday, said he still had not recovered from the last conflict. "We do not want war, but the occupier (Israel) never stops," he said. Hamas has accused Israeli soldiers of incursions into Gazan territory in recent days, saying that this constitutes a violation of the 2014 truce. The Israeli army admits it has operated inside Palestinian territory but said it was within 100 metres of the border, where it says it has operated since the 2014 war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his security cabinet on Friday to discuss the latest developments, with his spokesman saying ministers were updated by security officials on the "activities of the past few days and the exposure of the tunnel". Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Friday that Israeli forces withdrew from positions inside the border east of Khan Yunis. A senior Israeli official told AFP he was not aware of any understandings with Hamas regarding ending the exchanges of fire.

Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's deputy leader, spoke publicly on Friday for the first time since the recent escalation in and around the Gaza Strip. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Speaking at a mosque Friday before prayers, Haniyeh said, "We are not calling for a new war, but we will not allow incursions or imposing facts on the ground by Israel in Gaza." Haniyeh explained that the Palestinians objected the Israeli prohibition on Palestinian traffic in the "perimeter," a 300-meter buffer zone inside the Strip and bordering the frontier. "We say no to the perimeter inside of Gaza's borders, and Israel must understand this," he stated. "We are in contact with Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and also with the UN's (Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process) Nickolay Mladenov to bring an end to the Israeli escalation, and these efforts are continuing." Ismail Haniyeh leaving the mosque after his speech Friday (Photo: AFP) leak of a draft of the state comptroller's report on the failures in Operation Protective Edge was not brought up during the meeting.

The IDF is continuing its operation to locate tunnels used in other locations along the Strip's border. Overnight, Palestinians fired a mortar shell at an area before Beit Lahia, but it exploded in Palestinian territory. On Friday morning, Palestinians fired at least two mortars at IDF forces; there were no injuries. The Israeli Air Force attacked targets in Gaza in response.

This was an observation post located east of Sajaya, in north-central Gaza. Following the Israeli shelling, the Education Ministry evacuated two schools in Sajaya. Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza blamed Israeli entirely for the recent escalation in the Gaza Strip. One of the Hamas spokesmen the Strip, Mushir Al Masri, warned Israel not to try the patience of Hamas and the other Palestinian factions. He warned that Israel's escalation is a new development, and the factions are in contact between themselves to decide how to handle it. Al Masri called on all the international parties that had supported the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to take responsibility following "Israel's violation of the ceasefire." Islamic Jihad reported that Israel was continuing its incursions into Gazan territory.

Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's deputy leader, spoke publicly on Friday for the first time since the recent escalation in and around the Gaza Strip. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Speaking at a mosque Friday before prayers, Haniyeh said, "We are not calling for a new war, but we will not allow incursions or imposing facts on the ground by Israel in Gaza." Haniyeh explained that the Palestinians objected the Israeli prohibition on Palestinian traffic in the "perimeter," a 300-meter buffer zone inside the Strip and bordering the frontier. "We say no to the perimeter inside of Gaza's borders, and Israel must understand this," he stated. "We are in contact with Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and also with the UN's (Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process) Nickolay Mladenov to bring an end to the Israeli escalation, and these efforts are continuing." Ismail Haniyeh leaving the mosque after his speech Friday (Photo: AFP) leak of a draft of the state comptroller's report on the failures in Operation Protective Edge was not brought up during the meeting.

The IDF is continuing its operation to locate tunnels used in other locations along the Strip's border. Overnight, Palestinians fired a mortar shell at an area before Beit Lahia, but it exploded in Palestinian territory. On Friday morning, Palestinians fired at least two mortars at IDF forces; there were no injuries. The Israeli Air Force attacked targets in Gaza in response. Last month, tunnels were discovered that went under the fence into Israel. After that, mortars from Gaza were fired towards engineering vehicles that were working in the field. In the days that followed, the mortar fired continued, targeting IDF forces. Israeli tanks responded by firing at Hamas positions in Sajaya. IAF attack on Thursday in Gaza (Photo: AFP) The IDF confirmed this shelling. The Palestinians reported that the Israelis targeted Hamas's military wing. This was an observation post located east of Sajaya, in north-central Gaza. Following the Israeli shelling, the Education Ministry evacuated two schools in Sajaya. Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza blamed Israeli entirely for the recent escalation in the Gaza Strip. One of the Hamas spokesmen the Strip, Mushir Al Masri, warned Israel not to try the patience of Hamas and the other Palestinian factions. He warned that Israel's escalation is a new development, and the factions are in contact between themselves to decide how to handle it. Al Masri called on all the international parties that had supported the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to take responsibility following "Israel's violation of the ceasefire." Islamic Jihad reported that Israel was continuing its incursions into Gazan territory.

News article:
May 5, 2016 Another violent clash between Israel and Gaza was averted at the last minute on May 4. A statement issued by senior Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk said understandings were reached between the sides through Egyptian mediation about a cease-fire on the Israel-Gaza border. According to the statement, Hamas pledged to prevent all rocket launches at Israel by various Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip, whereas Israel promised to stop its airstrikes on the Strip and withdraw the military forces that had begun operating inside Gaza. As of the morning of May 5, Israel had not responded to Abu Marzouk’s statement. All of Israel’s past military operations in Gaza started out this way: a limited exchange of blows, a smattering of mortar shells from Gaza and Israeli air strikes on Gaza — all snowballing into another round of vicious violence with thousands of dead and wounded. The latest escalation, including several mortars fired from Gaza to Israel over the past few weeks, was foreseeable. Israeli defense officials have been telling me for weeks that Hamas was unlikely to put up with new Israeli limitations on the transfer of goods and raw materials through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza. As it is, the situation in Gaza is desperate and even the slightest change can result in total collapse. Last week Al-Monitor reported this Israeli thinking, including concerns about another military clash with Hamas. It all started when Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz ordered restrictions on the number of trucks allowed through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza, under pressure from residents of the Gaza border communities troubled by the heavy truck traffic on the narrow, potholed 232 route leading to the sole access point for food and goods into the Strip. As if this were not enough, Israel also announced that it would no longer allow cement into Gaza because Hamas was using it to build tunnels instead of rebuilding homes and infrastructure destroyed in Operation Protective Edge in 2014. Hamas officials who spoke with Al-Monitor dismissed Israel’s claims. The entry of cement into the Strip is under close supervision, they said, and Hamas has been adhering to the agreement struck at the end of Operation Protective Edge. Hamas thinks Israel decided on a cement embargo after a tunnel was uncovered next to the Kerem Shalom crossing on April 18, much to the chagrin and embarrassment of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). An examination of the newly exposed cross-border tunnel proved that it had been dug in the past — before the summer of 2014 — and was not new, but Israel had failed to locate it during Operation Protective Edge. Since then, the armed forces of Hamas, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, continued to maintain and reinforce that tunnel. After the tunnel was uncovered, Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said Israel was not deluding itself that Hamas would stop digging tunnels, adding that Israel is not seeking a confrontation, "but if Hamas tries to challenge the State of Israel or disrupt the lives of Gaza border residents, it will be hit very hard.” It is therefore not clear what prompted senior defense officials to act at this time. The IDF and Shin Bet security agency are closely monitoring the tunnel construction push on the northern and southern edges of Gaza, which is being carried out in broad daylight. Open-source material and intelligence information point to the fact that for the past year Hamas has been energetically rehabilitating its tunnel network destroyed during Operation Protective Edge. Almost every Gaza resident knows that the many bulldozers and sand-bearing trucks moving about northern Gaza are being diverted to the national Hamas tunnel-digging project. Back in March 2015 I wrote here that eyewitnesses were reporting from Gaza that the armed wing of Hamas was openly building tunnels. Everything was indeed known and clear at the time, but it appears that stopping the passage of cement at this time is actually designed to calm Israelis upset by recent discovery of the tunnel. This is the essence of the great dilemma with which Israel is dealing. The ongoing transfer of building material to Gaza enables Hamas to intensify its tunnel project. On the other hand, halting the passage of raw material will result in a flare-up of hostilities. What, then, is the solution? It would appear there is none. More than 1.8 million Palestinians live in Gaza. Entire neighborhoods were destroyed during Operation Protective Edge and have not been rebuilt since. The Gaza rehabilitation plan has been bogged down for a long time and the economic situation is deteriorating daily. Young couples cannot get married because they can’t afford to build a home or rent a roof over their heads in order to begin their lives together. The cement and building material issue troubles Gaza residents even more than the shortage of electric power. Does anyone in Israel really believe that it can limit the transfer of raw materials on the one hand and on the other expect life in Gaza to be dictated by the amount of food it allows residents? How long can Israel maintain its embargo, which has not contributed to Israel’s security? How much longer can residents of the Strip sustain themselves through a feeding tube from the narrow and restricted Kerem Shalom crossing? Since the siege on Gaza was imposed in June 2007, Hamas has dedicated all its energies to its removal. The Qassam rockets and mortar shells were always the means used by Hamas to bring Israel to the negotiating table and force it to discuss the easing of the blockade or its removal. This was also the case this week. The mortars fired at Israel were the Hamas way of signaling Israel that additional economic pressure would lead to another major clash. The siege on Gaza has been in place for nine years already. So far Hamas has proven that it is willing to sacrifice a great deal in order to bring it to an end. Israel must now accept the Turkish reconciliation proposal that includes a lifting of the Gaza blockade. This would enable the creation of an international supervisory mechanism for Gaza and rid Israel of the onus of caring for 1.8 million hungry Palestinians. Otherwise, the next major military operation is only a matter of time, and it will be far more lethal and bitter than the previous round.

News article:
GAZA: The leader of Hamas in Gaza said on Friday the Islamist group was "not calling for war" with Israel, and that Egypt and other parties were working behind the scenes to defuse the worst flare-up in violence since a 2014 conflict. Israel’s military has traded blows with Hamas over the past few days. The Palestinians have fired mortars at Israeli troops and Israeli aircraft and artillery have struck inside Gaza. "We are not calling for war but we will not allow incursions at all," said Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s deputy chief, speaking at a mosque before Friday prayers. "The resistance will not allow the establishment of a so-called buffer zone inside the borders of the Gaza Strip." Haniyeh said mediators from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Nations had been working to restore calm along Gaza’s border and that in the meantime Israeli forces had pulled back. Israel’s military said it would not comment on its manoeuvres. But a spokeswoman said no Palestinian mortars had been fired since this morning, after two days of more frequent barrages. Israeli forces say they have been conducting operations against tunnels under the border of Gaza used by militants, and on Thursday discovered a tunnel built by Hamas. Gaza hospital officials said a 54-year-old woman had been killed and a man wounded by fragments of an Israeli tank shell fired during the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met senior ministers on Friday to discuss the situation. More than 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed during the 2014 Gaza conflict. Sixty-seven Israeli soldiers and six civilians in Israel were killed by rockets and attacks by Hamas and other militant groups.

News article:
GAZA: The leader of Hamas in Gaza said on Friday the Islamist group was "not calling for war" with Israel, and that Egypt and other parties were working behind the scenes to defuse the worst flare-up in violence since a 2014 conflict. Israel’s military has traded blows with Hamas over the past few days. The Palestinians have fired mortars at Israeli troops and Israeli aircraft and artillery have struck inside Gaza. "We are not calling for war but we will not allow incursions at all," said Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s deputy chief, speaking at a mosque before Friday prayers. "The resistance will not allow the establishment of a so-called buffer zone inside the borders of the Gaza Strip." Haniyeh said mediators from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Nations had been working to restore calm along Gaza’s border and that in the meantime Israeli forces had pulled back. Israel’s military said it would not comment on its manoeuvres. But a spokeswoman said no Palestinian mortars had been fired since this morning, after two days of more frequent barrages. Israeli forces say they have been conducting operations against tunnels under the border of Gaza used by militants, and on Thursday discovered a tunnel built by Hamas. Gaza hospital officials said a 54-year-old woman had been killed and a man wounded by fragments of an Israeli tank shell fired during the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met senior ministers on Friday to discuss the situation. More than 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed during the 2014 Gaza conflict. Sixty-seven Israeli soldiers and six civilians in Israel were killed by rockets and attacks by Hamas and other militant groups.

News article:
A former director of the Shin Bet security service urged Israel on Saturday to take steps to alleviate the economic problems in the Gaza Strip, alongside military measures to counter efforts by the Hamas terror group that rules the coastal enclave to build attack tunnels into Israel. “Israel would do well if, in addition to the operational activities against the tunnels, it worked to alleviate the economic situation and show the residents of Gaza the prospect of an easier and more comfortable future,” said Yaakov Peri, an MK for Yesh Atid and member of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, the Walla news website reported. Israel and Hamas have been exchanging fire across the border since for days, as the terror group tries to thwart IDF troops from seeking out the tunnels it has dug from Gaza into Israeli territory. “Hamas, for its own reasons, is not interested in entering into another confrontation with Israel at this stage,” Peri said, hours after Israeli warplanes struck Hamas targets in southern Gaza following rocket fire on Israeli communities bordering the Strip. “The dire economic situation in the Gaza Strip also makes it difficult for Hamas to initiate another conflict,” the former security chief added. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Peri’s message appears to contradict that of senior Defense Ministry official Amos Gilad, who last month argued that Gaza’s economic woes are ultimately irrelevant to the current security situation. Speaking at an April conference on the financial state in the beleaguered coastal Strip, the director of the ministry’s Political-Military Affairs Bureau dismissed an assertion that economic development could be the solution to Gaza’s problems and mitigate the security threats to Israel that emanate from the territory. Hamas leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh said Friday that the group is not interested in an escalation of tensions, but warned that it will not tolerate Israeli troops entering the Palestinian territory. Advertisement His comments came a day after Jerusalem announced that IDF troops had located a cross-border tunnel built by Hamas into Israeli territory, the second such discovery in recent weeks. Israel and Hamas last went to war in the summer of 2014, in a devastating 50-day conflict that saw the IDF lay waste to large swathes of the Gaza Strip and Hamas fire hundreds of rockets at Israeli population centers.

News article:
http://www.nationalreview.com/node/435107/print Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has at least four different problems. First, an upcoming State Comptroller report seems set to accuse Mr. Netanyahu of keeping critical information from his cabinet in the buildup to Israel’s summer 2014 military action in Gaza, and of failing to adequately respond to tunnels Hamas used in launching attacks on Israeli soil. Second, Mr. Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from coalition partners in his cabinet. As I noted last November, the Israeli government is defined by significant internal tensions. Leading the charge for tougher action against the Palestinians is Education Minister Naftali Bennett. A young, charismatic hawk and proponent of expanded West Bank settlement construction, Mr. Bennett wants to bend Mr. Netanyahu to his hard-line agenda. Third, the likelihood of renewed conflict with Hamas is growing by the day. Recent weeks have seen Hamas escalate the pace of rocket, mortar, knife, and bomb attacks on Israelis. In response, the Israeli military is launching operations against Hamas facilitation nodes. Fourth and finally, tensions are growing with Iranian proxies in the Golan region on Israel’s border. Let’s take the third and fourth issues first. Israel’s strategic goal in dealing with Hamas is to constrain the group’s military capabilities. Partly motivated by the aforementioned domestic controversy over Hamas’s infiltration tunnels in 2014, Netanyahu also wants to ensure that they cannot launch a surprise attack on Israeli civilians. Such an attack would cost innocent lives, and, more important, it would embolden Israeli adversaries at a time of growing regional instability. And that leads us to Iran. With President Bashar al-Assad of Syria now buoyed by Russia, Lebanese Hezbollah (LH) and Iran sense an opportunity to re-commit their energies toward Israel’s northern border. The Syrian Civil War has imposed a heavy military and political toll on Iran and LH, but their existential fetish for Jewish blood is unrelenting. As the Middle East sinks into unrestrained violence, the Obama administration has sat idly by, dancing to Vladimir Putin’s tune at every turn. And without any confidence that Obama would come to its aid in a time of need, Israel is now aligning with the Sunni-Arab monarchies against Iran. Netanyahu’s recent assurance of Israel’s continued claim to the Golan Heights was a physical metaphor for Israel’s evolving security strategy: Israel wants Iran to know that it will not replicate America’s strategy of acquiescence and will role the military dice to preserve its deterrent posture if it must. Domestically, Netanyahu must also now decide how to deal with Naftali Bennett, and big changes may be coming on that front. As columnist Mazal Mualem outlined yesterday, the prime minister may soon form an alliance with Isaac Herzog, the leader of Israel’s liberal Zionist Union coalition. Mr. Herzog’s desire for engagement with the international community would give Israel a stronger diplomatic hand in challenging racist agendas such as the Boycott and Divestment movement. It would also allow Netanyahu to neutralize Bennett, and thus move forward on tentative efforts to build trust with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in hopes of a possible resumption of peace talks. That’s important, because absent progress toward peace, Mr. Abbas will face an increasing challenge from extreme elements in Fatah’s leadership. And if he’s outmaneuvered, Israel may find itself facing a concerted union of enemies in both Gaza and the West Bank. These are very tough times for Netanyahu. Whatever happens next will have grave consequences for Israel’s security and its relations with the international community. Here’s hoping that the prime minister succeeds, and that the next American president takes our traditional alliances more seriously than Obama. — Tom Rogan writes for National Review Online and Opportunity Lives.

News article:
The Islamic Jihad terrorist organization on Sunday denied reports that it reached an "understanding" with Israel following the escalation in clashes last week, according to which IDF soldiers could operate on the Gazan side of the security border. Gazan terrorists repeatedly fired mortars at IDF soldiers last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and fired a rocket on Saturday in numerous breaches of the ceasefire that ended 2014 Operation Protective Edge. The terrorists evidently opened fire because the troops were unearthing their terror tunnels meant to facilitate attacks into sovereign Israel. The IDF responded with tank fire and airstrikes. But reports that an agreement ending the clashes was reached were "completely untrue" according to Islamic Jihad leader Khalid al-Batsh, as reported by the Palestinian Ma'an News Agency. He said "the Palestinian team has unequivocally rejected this request" to let the IDF function in the buffer zone region just on the Gazan side of the security barrier, where it has acted to prevent terrorist incursions. In a confirmation that the upsurge in attacks by the terrorists came as a desperate attempt to prevent the terror tunnels from being discovered, he emphasized that the issue at stake was the IDF operation in the buffer zone. Al-Batsh said the refusal to allow the IDF to function over the border was a cause for "continued Israeli aggression in Gaza." "We reiterate our total rejection of this proposal, and we do not accept the concept of a buffer zone in the eastern (Gaza) Strip," al-Batsh said, calling for more attacks targeting IDF activity at the border. Ironically, Gazan terrorists have remained largely quiet on the massive Egyptian buffer zone in southern Gaza since late 2014, which likewise is a counter-terror tool. Last Friday Hamas said it isn't looking for war now, changing its tune after warning Israel on Wednesday not to "test its patience" after the first mortar shells were fired.

Netanyahu vows to press hunt for Gaza tunnels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday criticised the deputy head of Israel's armed forces for remarks appearing to compare contemporary Israeli society to Nazi Germany. "The comparison drawn in the words of the deputy chief of staff regarding events which characterised Nazi Germany 80 years ago is outrageous," said Netanyahu. "They do injustice to Israeli society and cause a belittling of the Holocaust," the Israeli leader added. Israel accuses Hamas militants of using tunnels to launch deadly attacks from the Gaza Strip ©Mahmud Hams (AFP/File) "The deputy chief of staff is an outstanding officer, but his remarks on this issue were utterly mistaken and unacceptable to me." In an address delivered Wednesday on the eve of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day, Major General Yair Golan said the commemoration "must bring us to reflect deeply on the nature of man, even when that man is ourselves". "If there is something that frightens me with the memory of the Holocaust, it is identifying horrifying processes that happened in Europe, and specifically in Germany, 70, 80 and 90 years ago, and finding testimony to them amongst us, today, in 2016," he said. "There is, after all, nothing easier and simpler than hating the foreigner... arousing fears and terrifying," he said. The chief-of-staff, Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, angered politicians in February with remarks warning young soldiers not to use excessive force in subduing suspected Palestinian assailants. A wave of unrest that erupted in October has so far killed 203 Palestinians and 28 Israelis. Most of the Palestinians killed were carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks, Israeli authorities say. Rights groups have called on Israel to stop using "lethal force" against attackers, and Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom has accused the Jewish state of carrying out "extrajudicial executions". In March an Israeli soldier was caught on video shooting to death a wounded Palestinian assailant, an incident condemned by a senior United Nations official as "gruesome, immoral and unjust." The soldier, an infantry sergeant, has been charged with manslaughter. And there have been concerns about civilian mobs attacking people they deem suspicious. Notable was a case in October, when an Eritrean immigrant was shot by a security guard at a bus station after being mistaken for an Arab assailant in an attack that killed an Israeli soldier. Footage of the man bleeding as an irate crowd rained blows on his head and body prompted soul searching among some Israelis over their response to a wave of attacks as well as their treatment of African migrants.

News article:
Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon on Monday blamed recent Palestinian mortar and rocket attacks and rising tensions on Israel’s border with Gaza on successful IDF steps to locate tunnels that the Hamas terror group has dug into Israeli territory. He also cautioned that Israel would not ignore ongoing attacks. “In the last few days, we’ve seen various attempts from Gaza to disturb our lives and threaten us,” he said at a memorial ceremony in Tel Aviv to honor Defense Ministry personnel killed in the line of duty. The attacks are “a result of Israel having developed the ability to detect tunnels, an advanced technology that the Defense Ministry and its workers have been involved in developing and using in recent days,” he added, according to a Defense Ministry transcript. Ya’alon warned that if the shooting does not stop, Israel would respond forcefully against Hamas. “Against this terror stands the IDF and various security agencies who are responding decisively to the shooting from the Strip — shooting that, if it continues, will lead to a more severe response for Hamas and other terror organizations in the Strip, until they understand it’s not wise to test us.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hamas has intermittently exchanged fire with Israeli troops as they worked to destroy tunnels inside Gaza in the past week, but the group has also conveyed to Israel through Egypt that it does not seek an escalation, Israeli officials said. At least 20 mortar shells were fired at Israeli territory from Gaza, while Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck Hamas targets multiple times last week and over the weekend. One rocket fired from Gaza landed in an open area in the Eshkol regional council late Friday. A second fell close to the border fence. Neither caused any injuries or damage, but sent residents dashing to their air-raid shelters as missile defense sirens sounded. Advertisement Hamas security sources said an IAF raid hit two brickworks in the southern city of Khan Younis, causing damage but no casualties. But witnesses said two missiles hit a base belonging to Hamas’s military wing east of the city, causing significant damage. On Saturday, Israeli officials told Channel 10 News that operations to uncover and destroy cross-border attack tunnels in Gaza would continue despite the violence. They added that Hamas’s tunnel infrastructure was far from the robust network the group possessed before the 2014 Gaza war, and included only a small number of tunnels. Two rockets fired from the Palestinian enclave early Saturday morning were not thought to have been launched by Hamas, but by a smaller terror group seeking to destabilize the region. Hamas, Israel said, was not seeking to widen the conflict to attacks on civilians, and limiting its fire to troops operating inside Gaza. Israeli farmers who were barred last week from their fields that lie within a kilometer from the Strip, for fear of Gazan sniper fire, were allowed to return Sunday to work in the fields. Palestinian media reports on Friday afternoon said Israel and Hamas reached a truce agreement, brokered by Egypt, which would go into effect immediately. But the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, stressed that no such agreement had been reached. “The army intends to maintain its activities against Hamas as [the group] continues to breach Israeli sovereignty and build tunnels,” he said. Despite the increased tension along the border with Gaza in recent weeks, the years since the 2014 conflict, known as Operation Protective Edge, have been the quietest in over a decade in terms of rocket fire and attacks coming from the coastal enclave.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that the Israeli army will continue to make "every effort" to monitor tunnels coming from the Gaza Strip. He stressed that Israel "is not interested in escalating the situation in the south," but it will not hesitate to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of its citizens. A state of relative calm has prevailed in the Gaza Strip since Saturday morning, after days of tension that witnessed the launch of Israeli army raids on the Gaza Strip, as well as the firing of rockets from within the sector at the troops.

News article:
In Gaza, the calm is like a cloud that could disappear in an instant. The situation is tense and the constant threats to end the siege or even for the current situation to "explode" are ongoing; there is real fear that the violence and aggression may escalate. On Thursday, the Israelis announced that they had discovered a tunnel in the south of the Gaza Strip. This is the second tunnel discovered by the army in the past two months. Israel is racing against time to strip the Palestinian resistance of its most important weapons. It has invested more than 600 million shekels in some of the most sophisticated intelligence and technology to detect the location of tunnels constructed by the Palestinian resistance groups. It has tried to keep these secret while launching an intense media campaign and effort on the ground to find and destroy the Gaza tunnels. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border area recently and encouraged settlers to do the same in an effort to showcase the government's anti-tunnel efforts. Netanyahu also claimed that the army has waged a psychological war against the Palestinian resistance and has gone so far as to say that it has succeeded in this. It is clear that Israel is making progress and the government has claimed that it expects to destroy all tunnels in the Gaza Strip within two years; any future confrontation with Hamas will see the Palestinian resistance group severely weakened because it will have lost its most important means of defence, which poses a great threat to Israel. Hamas is aware of this and it fears that more of its tunnels will be discovered, although it is confident that it is virtually impossible for Israel to discover all of the tunnels, wherever they might be. The Israeli army enters Gaza frequently, but it is the first time in two years that the Palestinian resistance groups, mainly Hamas, have worked in a public and visible way to prevent such incursions. Gaza's date with another Israeli offensive has been deferred, although much of the rhetoric and action on the ground remains the same as that in Israel's three previous attacks over the past eight years. The Palestinian resistance is not interested in a sudden escalation of violence and the destruction of homes, with the inevitable casualties it will bring. Nor is it interested in worsening the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza or endangering the livelihood of people without anything in return, or any immediate political benefits such as lifting the siege. Israel is putting a great deal of effort into finding and destroying the tunnels and will put off any offensive until it believes that the job is done. It is always prepared for aggression as long as it is on its own terms, and it will not be swayed by the appeal of a long-term truce. The government is not prepared to lift the siege on Gaza despite the disastrous implications that another offensive would have on Israel's security. It will only work to improve the situation in Gaza in a way that benefits its interests. Resistance is the right of the Palestinian people and Hamas says that it is not interested in an escalation of violence and that it is merely working to prevent Israel's cross-border interference within Gaza. The Islamic Resistance Movement, however, also knows that the next Israeli offensive is imminent and it has been working to postpone it as long as possible because the Arabs and the Iranians are all currently preoccupied in matters that they believe are more important than Palestine. Nobody can deny that another offensive is coming, though.

News article:
May 10, 2016 The latest skirmish between Israel and the Gaza Strip earlier this month proved once again that Hamas sends its “subcontractors,” as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) likes to call them, into the field. Israel has suspected for years that the armed wing of Hamas uses the Al-Quds Brigades of Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees whenever it wants to escalate tensions with Israel without engaging in an all-out clash. Such indirect action would provide the organization deniability for the attacks on Israel. On May 5, for example, Islamic Jihad’s Al-Quds Brigades and armed members of the Popular Resistance Committees joined together in shelling IDF forces engaged in exposing an additional tunnel in Gaza along the border with Israel. The timing of the shelling, as the tunnel was being unearthed and just as Israel had stopped supplying cement to Gaza, was a signal to Israel that it was about to cross a red line that would force Hamas to react. This time, an escalation was averted only through Egyptian mediation efforts. Israel formally blamed Hamas for the shelling because it had given the orders to fire, but it is also closely monitoring the growing military cooperation within the Gaza Strip. Hamas, for its part, got what it wanted: drawing attention to Israel’s economic pressure on Gaza. The way it chose to do so illustrates the close cooperation among the various organizations operating in Gaza. A Palestinian security source told Al-Monitor that the cooperation among the Gaza organizations, about which Israel and the Palestinian Authority have known for quite some time, has been greatly strengthened in recent months. During Israel’s 2014 Operation Protective Edge, Hamas had already established a joint headquarters for all the Gaza organizations to exert control over the firepower against Israel. Now, “subcontractors” are an integral part of the alignment in the Gaza Strip. Whereas in the past, Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades had turned to subcontractors only during escalations with Israel, the cooperation has now become a strategic asset for Hamas given its changing standing in the Arab world. Al-Monitor has learned that senior officials of al-Qassam Brigades have reached an understanding with the heads of Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees to hold joint training exercises leading to the formation of a unified military force, while maintaining the individual nature of each organization. An Israeli defense source told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, “Indeed, we have identified a unification and preservation of uniqueness.” This cooperation is based on personal contacts between the organizations' leaders. Some have known each other since they were children, growing up in the same neighborhood and moving up within their respective organizations in parallel. The Palestinian security source surmised that Hamas has a vested interest in cooperation among the organizations. Whereas Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees enjoy Iranian financial and even military support, including training under the auspices of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran has been treating Hamas like an outcast ever since the head of Hamas' political bureau, Khaled Meshaal, took an adversarial position against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Over the past two years Hamas leaders have sought ways to ease tensions with Iran and even tried to arrange a visit to Tehran by Meshaal and another one of its top leaders, Mousa Abu Marzouk, but all their reconciliation efforts failed. The relationship between Iran and Hamas reached a new low in July 2015 after a Hamas delegation visited Saudi Arabia. What little support the military wing was able to get from Iran through the connections of Hamas co-founder Mahmoud al-Zahar dried up. The increasing closeness between Hamas and Saudi Arabia has not replaced Iran's generous past support. The cutoff seriously hurt Hamas and led to its decision to cooperate with Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees. The union has two goals. A long-term one is to bring these two organizations as close as possible to the military wing of Hamas and allow them the operational freedom of which they were deprived in the past, in the hopes that eventually ties with Iran can be improved. In the shorter term, they hope to enjoy in one way or another the advanced military support the two organizations still get from Iran. For Islamic Jihad and the Resistance Committees, this arrangement is the best of all worlds. The IDF is well aware of this mutually beneficial rapprochement among the large Gaza organizations and the nurturing of Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees by Hamas. Although Israel reacts to every shell or Qassam rocket fired from Gaza as though Hamas had fired it itself, it seems that gradually and systematically the differences between the organizations are being blurred. If Hamas used to claim that rogue organizations operating under its nose were the ones that fired at Israel, this argument now appears spurious. Now the question is whether the joining of military forces in the Gaza Strip will make of Hamas' political wing a burden for the military, which might decide one of these days to get rid of it.

News article:
Standing beside a Humvee with a rifle slung over her shoulder, 20-year-old Staff Sergeant Rotem Manzur shields her eyes from the merciless desert sun, and peers out over the 165-mile-long, 16-foot-high border fence separating Israel from Egypt. About 300 meters from where she stands is an Egyptian soldier standing at his lookout post on the Egyptian side, doing the same thing Manzur is doing: keeping an eye out for ISIS-affiliated militants who have taken over a small part of the northern Sinai Peninsula. “Look how close they are,” says Manzur, pointing to the Egyptian border post and then to the Israeli road that runs along this side of the fence. “It would be so easy for ISIS to fire on this road,” she says, as she ponders what would happen if gunmen ambushed the Egyptian soldiers, something that has been happening almost daily elsewhere in northern Sinai. The Egyptian soldier waves at Manzur, who gets back in her Humvee to continue her patrol. She is one of approximately 120 female combat soldiers from the Caracal battalion—Israel’s first co-ed combat unit—who stand as Israel’s first line of defense against Islamist militants in Sinai. The Egyptian army were once Israel’s adversaries, but the rise and growth of ISIS has brought these Middle Eastern neighbors, whose peace treaty is often seen as a fragile one, much closer. According to Israeli security officials, Egypt and Israel are now engaged in an unprecedented collaborative mission to prevent the Sinai Peninsula from becoming the next stronghold of ISIS. “This definitely represents the closest Israel and Egypt have ever cooperated on an intelligence level,” says Avi Melamed, the Fellow of Intelligence and Middle East Affairs at the Eisenhower Institute in Washington D.C. “Israeli intelligence services do not rush to share their information with other intelligence agencies, even if it’s considered a friendly one, and especially not when it’s not friendly.” Story continues Egyptian military activity in the Sinai was until recently prohibited by the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which transferred control of the Sinai from Israel to Egypt. This prohibition allowed outlaws of all kinds to operate more easily in the northern Sinai. About three years ago, Israel began permitting Egypt to deploy additional armed forces and carry out air strikes against Islamist rebels, says Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official. Israel and Egypt are now sharing intelligence, to warn each other of militant activity near the Israeli and Gazan borders. Prior to the bombing of the Russian jet that exploded over the Sinai desert in October 2015, killing all 224 people aboard, Western security officials paid little attention to the Sinai branch of ISIS. But Egypt and Israel have watched closely as a group of Salafist militants in the Sinai established themselves as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem) following the 2011 fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and proceeded to attack Egyptian and Israeli soldiers, civilians, and foreign tourists. In 2011, 13 Israelis and Egyptians were killed in a series of attacks that emanated from northern Sinai. In 2014, three South Korean tourists and an Egyptian driver were killed by a suicide bomber as they waited to cross the Taba border post between Egypt and Israel. Ansar Beit al-Maqdis claimed responsibility. A few months later, in November 2014, the group gave its allegiance to ISIS, declaring itself the Sinai Province of the Islamic State. Since then, Israeli officials say it has became larger, more organized, better armed, and better trained. According to an Israeli army intelligence official, ISIS in Sinai has anti-tank missiles, explosive belts, rocket-propelled grenades and IEDs, and its fighters live among the local population and travel through Sinai in armored trucks. ISIS in Sinai are still in the early stages of development, and haven’t gained control of any major population centers, as they have in Syria, Iraq and Libya, but that could change. According to the intelligence official, there is evidence of ISIS trying to establish Sharia law in some areas. Estimates of their numbers range wildly, he said, from 500 fighters to 5,000. “It’s tough to identify someone as a member of ISIS,” says the official, because many Bedouin civilians in northern Sinai support the group, providing it with shelter, manpower, and safe passage through their territory. Most of the militants, he adds, are from local Bedouin communities, while some are from other parts of Egypt, and a smaller number may be from Gaza, Sudan and Libya. While Bedouins are not typically religious, says Shlomo Brom, senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), they have long felt alienated by the Egyptian government, which they believe has treated them as second class citizens. That resentment was leveraged by extremists when the Mubarak regime and its prison system collapsed. “When the Islamic radicals that were imprisoned by Mubarak escaped, many of them escaped to Sinai and brought their ideology with them,” says Brom. Similar to ISIS in Syria and Iraq, the Sinai Province is focused first and foremost on destabilizing the domestic government, so the vast majority of its attacks are aimed at Egyptian forces. “Their agenda is fighting the Egyptian state and particularly this Egyptian regime, which is considered anti-Islamic because it replaced the Muslim Brotherhood,” Brom says, referring to the military ouster of Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Northern Sinai has been in a state of emergency since October 2014, when militants ambushed and killed 33 Egyptian security personnel. An attack by ISIS on an Egyptian checkpoint in March killed 13 policemen, and in April, the group killed 15 soldiers and two Egyptian civilians in a single day. Last week, after an Egyptian soldier was killed by a bomb, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi extended the state of emergency. In recent months, Israeli security experts say that ISIS has signaled that it’s planning a sophisticated attack on Israel from the Sinai. Threatening messages to that effect have come directly from ISIS headquarters. In a video message released on Dec. 26, 2015, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses Israel, saying, “We are getting closer to you day by day. Do not think that we have forgotten about you.” While Israeli security experts say the danger posed by Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon remains far larger than the challenge from ISIS, the warning is taken very seriously. “This is a much larger threat than it was a year ago,” says the intelligence official. “We, of course, are not intimidated by ISIS or the Sinai Province, but we take those statements as clues to the timing of the next terror attack.” Israel and Egypt aren’t the only ones taking precautions. The U.S. is reportedly considering reducing the number of U.S. troops participating in the Multinational Force and Observers, which monitors compliance with the 1979 peace treaty. Defense officials are contemplating ways to automate aspects of the peacekeeping mission in order to decrease the number of soldiers deployed in an increasingly dangerous area. Until now, it was just intelligence, “but now ISIS is saying it themselves for the first time,” said Captain Ksusha Levin, a 25-year-old company commander who has served in Caracal on the Sinai border for seven years. “We know something will happen,” she says. “ISIS said they will hit Israel on the border. We don’t know what will happen, but we are preparing for when it will.”

Last week, after an Egyptian soldier was killed by a bomb, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi extended the state of emergency. In recent months, Israeli security experts say that ISIS has signaled that it’s planning a sophisticated attack on Israel from the Sinai. Threatening messages to that effect have come directly from ISIS headquarters. In a video message released on Dec. 26, 2015, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses Israel, saying, “We are getting closer to you day by day. Do not think that we have forgotten about you.” While Israeli security experts say the danger posed by Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon remains far larger than the challenge from ISIS, the warning is taken very seriously. “This is a much larger threat than it was a year ago,” says the intelligence official. “We, of course, are not intimidated by ISIS or the Sinai Province, but we take those statements as clues to the timing of the next terror attack.” Israel and Egypt aren’t the only ones taking precautions. The U.S. is reportedly considering reducing the number of U.S. troops participating in the Multinational Force and Observers, which monitors compliance with the 1979 peace treaty. Defense officials are contemplating ways to automate aspects of the peacekeeping mission in order to decrease the number of soldiers deployed in an increasingly dangerous area. Until now, it was just intelligence, “but now ISIS is saying it themselves for the first time,” said Captain Ksusha Levin, a 25-year-old company commander who has served in Caracal on the Sinai border for seven years. “We know something will happen,” she says. “ISIS said they will hit Israel on the border. We don’t know what will happen, but we are preparing for when it will.”

News article:
Standing beside a Humvee with a rifle slung over her shoulder, 20-year-old Staff Sergeant Rotem Manzur shields her eyes from the merciless desert sun, and peers out over the 165-mile-long, 16-foot-high border fence separating Israel from Egypt. About 300 meters from where she stands is an Egyptian soldier standing at his lookout post on the Egyptian side, doing the same thing Manzur is doing: keeping an eye out for ISIS-affiliated militants who have taken over a small part of the northern Sinai Peninsula. “Look how close they are,” says Manzur, pointing to the Egyptian border post and then to the Israeli road that runs along this side of the fence. “It would be so easy for ISIS to fire on this road,” she says, as she ponders what would happen if gunmen ambushed the Egyptian soldiers, something that has been happening almost daily elsewhere in northern Sinai. The Egyptian soldier waves at Manzur, who gets back in her Humvee to continue her patrol. She is one of approximately 120 female combat soldiers from the Caracal battalion—Israel’s first co-ed combat unit—who stand as Israel’s first line of defense against Islamist militants in Sinai. The Egyptian army were once Israel’s adversaries, but the rise and growth of ISIS has brought these Middle Eastern neighbors, whose peace treaty is often seen as a fragile one, much closer. According to Israeli security officials, Egypt and Israel are now engaged in an unprecedented collaborative mission to prevent the Sinai Peninsula from becoming the next stronghold of ISIS. “This definitely represents the closest Israel and Egypt have ever cooperated on an intelligence level,” says Avi Melamed, the Fellow of Intelligence and Middle East Affairs at the Eisenhower Institute in Washington D.C. “Israeli intelligence services do not rush to share their information with other intelligence agencies, even if it’s considered a friendly one, and especially not when it’s not friendly.” Story continues Egyptian military activity in the Sinai was until recently prohibited by the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which transferred control of the Sinai from Israel to Egypt. This prohibition allowed outlaws of all kinds to operate more easily in the northern Sinai. About three years ago, Israel began permitting Egypt to deploy additional armed forces and carry out air strikes against Islamist rebels, says Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official. Israel and Egypt are now sharing intelligence, to warn each other of militant activity near the Israeli and Gazan borders. Prior to the bombing of the Russian jet that exploded over the Sinai desert in October 2015, killing all 224 people aboard, Western security officials paid little attention to the Sinai branch of ISIS. But Egypt and Israel have watched closely as a group of Salafist militants in the Sinai established themselves as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem) following the 2011 fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and proceeded to attack Egyptian and Israeli soldiers, civilians, and foreign tourists. In 2011, 13 Israelis and Egyptians were killed in a series of attacks that emanated from northern Sinai. In 2014, three South Korean tourists and an Egyptian driver were killed by a suicide bomber as they waited to cross the Taba border post between Egypt and Israel. Ansar Beit al-Maqdis claimed responsibility. A few months later, in November 2014, the group gave its allegiance to ISIS, declaring itself the Sinai Province of the Islamic State. Since then, Israeli officials say it has became larger, more organized, better armed, and better trained. According to an Israeli army intelligence official, ISIS in Sinai has anti-tank missiles, explosive belts, rocket-propelled grenades and IEDs, and its fighters live among the local population and travel through Sinai in armored trucks. ISIS in Sinai are still in the early stages of development, and haven’t gained control of any major population centers, as they have in Syria, Iraq and Libya, but that could change. According to the intelligence official, there is evidence of ISIS trying to establish Sharia law in some areas. Estimates of their numbers range wildly, he said, from 500 fighters to 5,000. “It’s tough to identify someone as a member of ISIS,” says the official, because many Bedouin civilians in northern Sinai support the group, providing it with shelter, manpower, and safe passage through their territory. Most of the militants, he adds, are from local Bedouin communities, while some are from other parts of Egypt, and a smaller number may be from Gaza, Sudan and Libya. While Bedouins are not typically religious, says Shlomo Brom, senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), they have long felt alienated by the Egyptian government, which they believe has treated them as second class citizens. That resentment was leveraged by extremists when the Mubarak regime and its prison system collapsed. “When the Islamic radicals that were imprisoned by Mubarak escaped, many of them escaped to Sinai and brought their ideology with them,” says Brom. Similar to ISIS in Syria and Iraq, the Sinai Province is focused first and foremost on destabilizing the domestic government, so the vast majority of its attacks are aimed at Egyptian forces. “Their agenda is fighting the Egyptian state and particularly this Egyptian regime, which is considered anti-Islamic because it replaced the Muslim Brotherhood,” Brom says, referring to the military ouster of Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Northern Sinai has been in a state of emergency since October 2014, when militants ambushed and killed 33 Egyptian security personnel. An attack by ISIS on an Egyptian checkpoint in March killed 13 policemen, and in April, the group killed 15 soldiers and two Egyptian civilians in a single day.

News article:
As of Saturday morning, there had been several days of virtual dueling. There is no better way for describing the mortars that have been fired toward Israel or soldiers patrolling near the Gaza border, and responses from Israeli tanks and aircraft. There have also been fierce words of threat from both sides. So far we’ve heard of one death in Gaza, but no injuries or property damage in Israel. The duel is dangerous, if it gets out of hand, and escalates to casualties in Israel, then a repeat of what Israel has done in Gaza. The toll of the last tit for tat that got out of hand in 2014 was the deaths of 71 Israeli soldiers and civilians, perhaps 2200 Gazan deaths, and a great deal of property damage in Gaza that–together with damage from previous encounters–has seen very little repair. The duel to date, in the context of what has gotten out of hand in previous duels, along with the spurt in West Bank violence that began in September of last year and now may have petered out, says a great deal about the Israel-Palestinian conflict. People speaking for both sides say that they do not want or intend an escalation, but tension continues. Both sides are familiar with tension, and usually manage it without significant damage.. There are two likely explanations of why actions on the Gaza front began. One is that Gazan fringe groups wanting to excite action by firing mortars, with measured Israeli responses, then Hamas being unable to restrain its fighters from making their own responses. Another explanation begins with Israeli activity against Gazan tunnels, viewed as threatening border settlements with the sudden attack by terrorists coming out of the ground. Two tunnels have been discovered and sealed in recent weeks, and several have collapsed on the Gazans digging them. Israel may have developed technology capable of locating and responding to the tunnels, and a Gazan captured by Israel, who may have intended to be captured, has provided details of tunnel construction and location. In connection with this, Israeli forces have entered Gaza to a depth of 100-200 meters, in search of tunnels and/or to clear areas to facilitate subsequent efforts against the tunnels or snipers. Gaza’s entire tunnel operation is a microcosm of Palestinian failure. The investment has been considerable, with no tangible military payoff. Damage to Gazan infrastructure has been more palpable than anything done to Israel, in the form of diverting construction resources to tunnel construction that had been allowed into Gaza for the reconstruction of civilian facilities. Now Israel has tightened its control over what goes into Gaza. It’s as difficult to guess what Donald Trump would do about Israel and Palestine as anything else in his campaign. One comment–move the Palestinians to Puerto Rico–scores about as wise as that of the British Muslim Socialist, anti-Semite, proposing to move Israelis to the United States. I’ve heard from American Jews saying that Trump could deal with the issue as he has dealt with business opportunities. One suggests that an appropriate first step would be for Israelis to put Vote Trump signs on their front lawns. The best indication of that person’s lack of familiarity with Israel or the Middle East is the virtual absence of front lawns in this part of the world. One can doubt that either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump can do better than the long list of worthies who have tried since the British effort in the 1930s. The problem didn’t succumb to one of the world’s most experienced governments in colonial management, or to American figures up to and including Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Kerry. Until there is a Palestinian leadership willing to accept an Israeli presence pretty much where it is now, there hardly seems reason to try for a political accord. It’s helpful to recognize that the history of Israel with the West Bank has included a number of detailed arrangements–below the level of political accord–that have worked for both sides. The failure of such accommodations with Gaza, and the periodic upticks in violence with respect to the West Bank reveals the fragility of where we are. Not only are there no guarantees of being able to avoid full scale warfare between Palestinians and Israelis. Also unsettling are the points of crisis just over the borders, involving open warfare and mass exodus from Syria, overloaded refugee facilities in Jordan, and significant conflict between Egyptian forces and Islamic extremists. What’s in it for Israel is continued efforts to manage tits for tat with Gaza, individual attacks from the West Bank and joint Israel-Palestinian efforts to deal with recruitment and planning attacks from the West Bank by radical movements. It ain’t easy. It depends on security professionalism and political restraint, along with an Israeli willingness to escalate when appropriate. American blather about a peace process has been less than useless, insofar as it adds to the dig-in-our heels rhetoric of Palestinians convinced that they have a monopoly of justice. What has been helpful, however, is American aid, along with Jordan personnel, to train cadres of Palestinian security personnel, including instilling in them a pragmatic concern for what can be achieved short of a political agreement. Some of those security professionals have gone bad, and contributed to incidents of violence against Israelis. For the most part, however, personnel have operated professionally, and in coordination with their Israeli counterparts. It ain’t the Middle West, or stuff for outsiders with more ideology than knowledge about the workings of the Middle East. We should also remind ourselves that the idealized Middle West isn’t the real thing. For some years now it’s been the rust belt, with levels of education and violence in Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, St Louis, Chicago, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Buffalo, Toledo, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, and some of their less desirable suburbs making parts of the Middle East seem pastoral, enlightened, and orderly in comparison. It’s now Monday. There’s been a couple of days without mortar shells landing in the south. The message delivered via tit for tat seems to have worked, this time.

News article:
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon stated on Monday that any continued aggression from terror groups like Hamas, such as the digging of tunnels and firing of mortar shells into Israeli territory, will be responded to with force. “Against this terror stands the IDF and various security agencies who are responding decisively to the shooting from the Strip – shooting that, if it continues, will lead to a more severe response for Hamas and other terrorist organizations in the Strip, until they understand it’s not wise to test us,” Ya’alon said. Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, said on Saturday that the IDF would continue its anti-tunnel operations along the Gaza border. “The army intends to maintain its activities against Hamas as it continues to breach Israeli sovereignty and build tunnels,” he said. The IDF has discovered two terror tunnels reaching into Israeli territory in the past month. In an apparent effort to deter the IDF from detecting tunnels, Hamas last week shelled Israeli positions for four days, prompting return fire from Israel. Just before Passover, Israeli security forces seized four tons of ammonium chloride, a chemical that can be used as a rocket propellant for long-range rockets, in a truck crossing into the Gaza Strip. Gen. Yossi Kuperwasser, formerly the head of the research division of Israeli military intelligence and later the director-general of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs, told reporters last week that the discovery of the tunnels was a sign that Hamas was preparing for another war against Israel. He said the the tunnel digging means that “they definitely invest a lot in making the necessary preparations so that in the next round, when they decide to start it, they will be able to inflict the heaviest damage on Israel, including through those tunnels.” Israel went to war with Hamas in the summer of 2014 in order to prevent Hamas from firing rockets at Israeli civilians and eliminate the threat to Israeli civilians from the terror tunnels. Israel completely withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and Hamas took over the territory in 2007 after a civil war with Fatah. According to the IDF, Palestinian terror groups have launched over 11,000 rockets at Israel since it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, with over five million Israeli civilians living under threat of rocket fire.

He said the the tunnel digging means that “they definitely invest a lot in making the necessary preparations so that in the next round, when they decide to start it, they will be able to inflict the heaviest damage on Israel, including through those tunnels.” Israel went to war with Hamas in the summer of 2014 in order to prevent Hamas from firing rockets at Israeli civilians and eliminate the threat to Israeli civilians from the terror tunnels. Israel completely withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and Hamas took over the territory in 2007 after a civil war with Fatah. According to the IDF, Palestinian terror groups have launched over 11,000 rockets at Israel since it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, with over five million Israeli civilians living under threat of rocket fire.

News article:
May 11, 2016 The report by State Comptroller Joseph Shapira on Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip has not yet been published, but the initial draft, received by some 40 top defense and political figures, has already stirred up a storm. Reactions by associates of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who pounced on the report and on the comptroller with sharp and irrelevant comments, only reinforced the troubling feelings about the summer 2014 military campaign, which the Israeli public never perceived as a great military success to begin with. Now comes the draft report, which lambasts the political and military echelons for alleged negligence and infuriating irresponsibility. In a May 9 Al-Monitor article, Ben Caspit described the “war of generals” expected to erupt after the release of the final report. The most significant point in the comptroller’s report is his assessment that putting aside the flawed conduct of the operation and attendant decision-making, the war in Gaza could have been avoided. If the Israeli political echelon had not been shackled by outdated conceptions and basic lack of understanding regarding the significance of the Gaza blockade and its inherent dangers, many lives would have probably been spared. Senior Israeli officials who received the draft — which they described as more severe than the findings of the Winograd Commission that investigated the shortcomings of Israel’s 2006 Lebanon War — said that one of the report’s chapters deals with what Israel could have done to avert the clash. In the days before the military campaign, there was obvious satisfaction in Jerusalem over Egypt having joined in imposing a hermetic seal on Gaza and the new regime of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi conducting an all-out war against the tunnels dug by Hamas in Rafah on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. The military and political leaderships failed, however, to understand one simple fact: that additional pressure on the Gaza pressure cooker would result in an explosion, as indeed it did. Although Operation Protective Edge was the peak of an escalation that began with the June 2014 kidnapping and murder of three Israeli youths in the West Bank Etziyon settlement bloc, the root of the problem that led Hamas toward the conflict was the Gaza blockade and the desire to get rid of it at whatever the cost. When Hamas says “whatever the cost,” that includes the total destruction of extensive areas of the Gaza Strip and the lives of Gaza residents. This is the first time since former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert imposed the closure on Gaza in June 2007 that an Israeli official will do the obvious and directly link the blockade and rocket firings at Israel. Anyone who assumes that the pressure on Gaza can be sustained relentlessly, without consequence, is either delusional or ignorant about human nature. Hamas developed the Qassam rocket before the blockade as a deterrent against Israel and a way to attack without clashing with Israeli ground forces, but the blockade created a threat to its continued rule and forced it to launch an arms race that turned Gaza into a powder keg. Israel did not understand at the time that an extended blockade would mean subjecting Israeli residents in the south to a life in the shadow of Hamas rockets. When the comptroller issues his final report, senior defense and government officials will probably try to blame each other for the shortcomings exposed. After the public exchange of blows, however, officials must study the thick report and take seriously the rethinking it suggests in regard to Israel’s mistaken security concept, according to which one can imprison the residents of Gaza, control the supply of food and raw materials entering Gaza, cause the deterioration of Gaza's economy and at the same time enjoy calm along the border. This security concept was Olmert’s basic assumption when he imposed the blockade. He assumed that economic pressure would unseat Hamas and restore the Palestinian Authority and its leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, after their violent overthrow in June 2007. Nine years have since elapsed, the blockade is still in force and Hamas has only gotten stronger. During Operation Protective Edge, Hamas fighters managed to hold their own for some 50 days in the face of a skilled and far better equipped Israel Defense Forces (IDF) army. That summer, Hamas disrupted the daily routines of millions of Israelis, from the communities on the Gaza border to the edge of Haifa in the north, threatening their lives with long-range rockets. The Israeli economy sustained serious damage. Many small businesses collapsed, and it took others months to recover. In addition to considering the warning bells sounded by the report regarding the military's preparedness for the operation and its conduct by the army brass and the government, Israel must answer the following questions: Has the blockade of Gaza improved Israel's security or eroded it? What are the blockade's implications in terms of Israel’s international standing? Can one assume that significant economic improvements for the residents of Gaza could have saved many lives on both sides of the border fence and spared the IDF deep embarrassment? Shapira, according to those who have read the report, does not provide direct answers to these questions, but the fact that he raises them in such a clear and sharp manner hints at the direction in which he is pointing. Publication of the full report is unlikely to force senior military or political officials to accept responsibility for their failures and resign. Former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, who comes in for the biggest share of criticism in the report, is no longer in office, while the second-most criticized figure, Prime Minister Netanyahu, is already hard at work denigrating and discrediting the document. Although Israel appears to reject the link between the hardship and despair in Gaza and the resulting security threat to Israelis, the top leadership must take this report seriously in an effort to avoid the next war in Gaza. Hamas, in its despair and that of Gaza residents brought to their knees by the deprivation-inducing blockade, has directed its resources to fighting Israel by all means to end the blockade. Netanyahu, Gantz and the top military and political brass did not understand this — or if they did, they preferred to ignore it — but the state comptroller understands, and he has no intention of ignoring it. On the eve of Israel’s Memorial Day, May 11, to honor its war dead, Judge Shapira has handed decision-makers an important guide that could save many lives in the future. Siege, poverty, pressure and despair are a dangerous cocktail for Israel’s security. Israel’s leadership would do well to adopt the comptroller's findings rather than fight them.

News article:
Salafists in Gaza claim to have 3,000 fighters in their ranks, according to a report published today by Agence France-Presse. Salafists, who adhere to a strict form of Islam based on literal interpretation of the Koran, have clashed with Gaza's ruling Islamist power, Hamas, in recent years. Now that much of the Sinai Peninsula has fallen to Daesh-inspired militants, Hamas and Israel are worried about jihadis entering the Gaza Strip from the Sinai and what effect that could have on the balance of power. Gaza, which is home to 1.8 million people, borders the Sinai Peninsula, where the Egyptian government is engaged in a civil war with radical Islamic insurgents. Abu al-Ansari al-Ina, a leader of the "Young Salafist Fighters," one of the major jihadist groups in Gaza told AFP that the priority of Salafists in Gaza is the "fight against the Jews in Palestine," while the strategic goal "is the introduction of Islamic law in the [rest of the] world." "We do not want confrontation with Hamas," but "we will not hesitate to fight the infidels or anyone who stands in the way of our fighters," said another Gaza Salafist, Abu Sayyaf, who is a military commander of a Salafi movement in the coastal enclave. In July, Hamas arrested at least a dozen Salafists after a series of bombs blew up infrastructure owned by Hamas and Hamas rival Islamic Jihad, who have been around longer but have had less success politically. At the time, Salafist groups in Gaza threatened to shoot rockets at Israel in order to retaliate against Hamas. In May 2015, the Gazan-Salafist group Salafist Trend accused Hamas of torturing its followers. Some Salafist groups in Gaza have sworn allegiance to Daesh, like the group Ansar al-Dawla al-Islamiyya, with whom Hamas has clashed in the past. --HS

News article:
Gaza City (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) - Militants inspired by the Islamic State group's ideology are seeking to benefit from the desperation of young Palestinians to strengthen their foothold in the Gaza Strip. But the Salafists in the enclave tread a fine line to avoid conflict with Hamas, the Islamist movement which has ruled the strip for a decade but does not share IS's world view. Leaders of the Salafists, who are adherents of a strict Sunni interpretation of Islam, claim to have 3,000 fighters in Gaza. While the figure is impossible to verify, experts see an increasing use of IS-style rhetoric to attract support. "Some groups use the Islamic State label and claim to have adopted jihadist ideology to attract teenagers who have lost all hope," said Assaad Abu Charakh, a professor at Al-Azhar University in Gaza. Last week saw the heaviest cross-border clashes between Israeli forces and Hamas and other militant groups since 2014, raising fears of a return to hostilities, though calm has since returned. Israel has maintained a blockade on Gaza since 2006 aimed at containing Hamas, the Jewish state's arch enemy. At almost 45 percent, the unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is among the world's highest. Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, but Israel and the international community refused to accept the results, demanding Hamas renounce violence, recognise Israel and respect agreements signed between Palestinian and Israeli leaders. The party imposed its rule on Gaza a year later after a quasi-civil war. - Qassam Brigades defectors - But some members of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing, argued elections were un-Islamic and defected to form Salafist groups.

Gaza City (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) - Militants inspired by the Islamic State group's ideology are seeking to benefit from the desperation of young Palestinians to strengthen their foothold in the Gaza Strip. But the Salafists in the enclave tread a fine line to avoid conflict with Hamas, the Islamist movement which has ruled the strip for a decade but does not share IS's world view. Leaders of the Salafists, who are adherents of a strict Sunni interpretation of Islam, claim to have 3,000 fighters in Gaza. While the figure is impossible to verify, experts see an increasing use of IS-style rhetoric to attract support. "Some groups use the Islamic State label and claim to have adopted jihadist ideology to attract teenagers who have lost all hope," said Assaad Abu Charakh, a professor at Al-Azhar University in Gaza. Last week saw the heaviest cross-border clashes between Israeli forces and Hamas and other militant groups since 2014, raising fears of a return to hostilities, though calm has since returned. Israel has maintained a blockade on Gaza since 2006 aimed at containing Hamas, the Jewish state's arch enemy. At almost 45 percent, the unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is among the world's highest. Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, but Israel and the international community refused to accept the results, demanding Hamas renounce violence, recognise Israel and respect agreements signed between Palestinian and Israeli leaders. The party imposed its rule on Gaza a year later after a quasi-civil war. - Qassam Brigades defectors - But some members of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing, argued elections were un-Islamic and defected to form Salafist groups.

Islamic State fighters have recently arrived in the Gaza Strip to train with their Hamas counterparts, a senior IDF official said in an Arabic interview published Friday. The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai told the Saudi news website Elaph that IS members entered the Gaza Strip from the Sinai Peninsula through smuggling tunnels maintained and controlled by Hamas. The fighters entered the Hamas-controlled territory in coordination with Sa’id Abed al-A’al, a resident of the Gaza Strip city of Rafah connected to Hamas, he said. Mordechai, the head of the Defense Ministry body responsible for the Israeli border crossings with the Gaza Strip and Civil Administration in the West Bank, said the military cooperation between the Islamic State and Hamas is unfolding with the full knowledge and consent of Hamas’s leaders. According to the report, Hamas members have also treated wounded IS terrorists who entered the Strip from the Sinai Peninsula. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms An Islamic State-affiliate has waged a guerrilla war against the Egyptian military in the Sinai for several years, carrying out dozens of attacks targeting soldiers and police in the northern part of the restive peninsula. In an effort to help combat the Islamic State in Egypt, the US Embassy in Cairo said Friday that Egypt has received its first shipment of armored vehicles designed to protect soldiers from roadside bombs. The embassy said in a statement that the first batch of 762 MRAP (Mine Resistance Ambush Protected) vehicles was delivered Thursday, and is aimed at helping to “combat terrorism and promote stability in the region.” Advertisement While Hamas “tries to draw closer to Egypt, it’s connecting with the Islamic State and with the Muslim Brotherhood,” Mordechai said, referring to the outlawed Islamic party whose president Mohammed Morsi briefly ruled Egypt before being deposed in 2013. Hamas has apparently tried to distance itself from the Islamic State and Iran with the hope that Cairo would loosen its blockade on the Gaza Strip. But according to Haaretz, reports pointing to ties between Hamas leaders and terrorist groups operating against Egypt in the Sinai are causing the group embarrassment. Palestinian sources quoted by the paper say that while Hamas leaders have adopted a policy of increasing ties with Egypt, there are still senior officials who are unwilling to break free of Iran and Salafi groups that can also serve as a source of income. Hamas is also under pressure from the Saudi royal family to cut all ties with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s enemy. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Islamic State fighters have recently arrived in the Gaza Strip to train with their Hamas counterparts, a senior IDF official said in an Arabic interview published Friday. The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai told the Saudi news website Elaph that IS members entered the Gaza Strip from the Sinai Peninsula through smuggling tunnels maintained and controlled by Hamas. The fighters entered the Hamas-controlled territory in coordination with Sa’id Abed al-A’al, a resident of the Gaza Strip city of Rafah connected to Hamas, he said. Mordechai, the head of the Defense Ministry body responsible for the Israeli border crossings with the Gaza Strip and Civil Administration in the West Bank, said the military cooperation between the Islamic State and Hamas is unfolding with the full knowledge and consent of Hamas’s leaders. According to the report, Hamas members have also treated wounded IS terrorists who entered the Strip from the Sinai Peninsula.

News article:
Palestinian resistance movement Hamas on Saturday denied recent claims by an Israeli army official that members of the Daesh terrorist group had recently entered the Hamas-run Gaza Strip from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. "These allegations are promoted by the Israeli occupation; they are mere fabrications that have no basis in fact," leading Hamas member Ismail Radwan told Anadolu Agency. The claims, he added, "seek to justify Israel's decade-long blockade of the Gaza Strip". On Friday, Israeli army Major-General Yoav Mordechai alleged that Daesh members had entered the Hamas-run coastal enclave to undergo military training via cross-border tunnels from Egypt's Sinai. In April, Hamas announced that it was stepping up security along the Gaza Strip's borders with Egypt. The announcement came after a Hamas delegation visited Cairo in March to meet with Egyptian officials. The visit was the first of its kind since Hamas-Egypt relations nosedived in the wake of a 2013 military coup that ousted Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president and a Muslim Brotherhood leader.

Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Mordechai was speaking with the Saudi online newspaper Elaph. He stated that the members of ISIS entered the Gaza Strip a few days ago from Egypt via the tunnels. The purpose of their visit was to carry out military exercises in the strip, the major general relayed, which they coordinated with a source close to Hamas, Said Abed Al-Aal. Yoav Mordechai (Photo: Chaim Tsach, GPO) In the interview, the coordinator explained that Hamas is aiding ISIS by providing medical treatment for its people in Gazan hospitals in exchange for money and weaponry. According to Mordechai, there is mutual coordination between the military echelons of Hamas and ISIS, which is known to Hamas's senior political leaders, as well. Elaph also reported that wounded have been recently transferred from the Sinai Peninsula, where ISIS is active, to Gaza. This report is expected to embarrass Hamas before Egypt, with whom the terrorist organization is attempting to rehabilitate its relationship. One of Hamas's goals with Egypt is to persuade the government to open the Rafah Crossing with Gaza.

News article:
By Nathan Hersh May 16, 2016 Israel celebrates its independence the day after it mourns the citizens killed in its conflicts. The festivities are a welcome liberation from the grief those deaths caused. This pattern is built into the Israeli conception of the wars, too: Once the violence ends, it’s time to celebrate, not focus on the causes of the violence. This year, the week before all the mourning and celebrating was the most violent week between Israel and the Gaza Strip since the ceasefire of 2014 ended Operation Protective Edge. This should serve as a wake-up call. In the nearly two years since the last war began, the current government has done the bare minimum to disrupt the eventuality of violence, and Hamas has begun to rearm and build new tunnels. Without action now, the next war could come very soon. We need negotiations toward a durable ceasefire immediately, not after the next war begins. I’ve witnessed the past three wars between Israel and Hamas from three different angles: as an Israeli civilian, as a reservist in the Israel Defense Forces and as the director of a pro-peace not-for-profit organization. During every war, I thought about the problems that led to each one, and lamented the impossibility of solving those problems while the wars raged. In December 2008, I immigrated to Israel at the beginning of Operation Cast Lead. For me as a new citizen, that war was a personal introduction to the potential for violence in the region. It also introduced me to the nauseating feeling of victory I experience as an Israeli, because victory tends to mean hundreds of Palestinian civilians killed. Those deaths do not relieve the grief I feel over the Israeli victims. In November 2012, I trained to fight in the Gaza Strip along with roughly 50,000 other IDF reservists during Operation Pillar of Defense. My unit was to be part of the first division to invade. We prepared to enter three different times, and each time negotiations toward a ceasefire had progressed enough to hold the army back. On November 21, 2012 a ceasefire ended the violence, keeping us from invading. One and a half years later, no such ceasefire succeeded in preventing the deadliest chapter in the already deadly history of Israel and Gaza: Operation Protective Edge. The 2012 ceasefire had failed to address the core of the conflict, and the calm it produced was bound to unravel without follow-up. Eventually the status quo led to another war. I was the managing director of Partners for Progressive Israel when the 2014 war started, and our organization came out strongly against every escalation of violence, especially the ground invasion that would kill over 2,000 people. We had always supported changes to Israel’s treatment of Gaza, and even during the fighting we opposed Israel’s retaliation against Hamas’s acts of war. But as the fighting continued, our regular policies, such as restarting the peace process and ending the siege, became increasingly less relevant or practical. These were good long-term goals, but they were not serious recommendations for the cessation of hostilities. That’s because, during wartime, negotiations must be directed toward an immediate end to violence and aggression. Medium-term ceasefires and long-term peace processes are of secondary importance while the sides are actively killing each other. Unfortunately, the types of ceasefires that Israel and Hamas agree to in order to end the fighting do not address the issues that propel them toward war every few years; Gaza is still under siege and Hamas is still devoted to the total destruction of Israel. Long-term solutions are most practical and likely to succeed during times of calm, and if the recent violence is indeed just a temporary and limited flare-up, then the ideal time for those solutions is right now because the calm is never permanent; as Hamas rebuilds its war infrastructure, the status quo is again building toward war. Solutions must come from regional negotiations and include Israel, Hamas and Egypt, and only the United States can demand participation from all of those parties. Whatever the implications are of Israel, Hamas and Egypt negotiating — some will argue that negotiations would legitimize Hamas at the expense of the more moderate Palestinian Authority — negotiations are still preferable to doing nothing, and not only for Palestinians in Gaza. These wars harm Israelis, too. When I was a reservist in Operation Pillar of Defense, time moved tortuously slowly while we waited to fight. But that period of quiet also felt fleeting, as if the stillness before we started fighting should be cherished, not suffered. At our base, close enough to rocket launching sites in Gaza to allow us less than 15 seconds to find shelter from incoming rockets, air raid sirens provoked in us anger and fear, feelings that coexisted without respite for the duration of our time there. When the ceasefire was announced, and later when we were released, the fear and anger quickly gave way to euphoria and relief. With calm restored, thoughts about the unsustainable situation that would bring my fellow soldiers back to Gaza for a much longer and bloodier round of fighting were far off. It is therefore hard to avoid some responsibility when, one and a half years later, my former commander, Lt. Col. Dolev Keidar, was killed in an ambush after Hamas militants emerged from a tunnel and shot his patrol with an anti-tank missile. He left behind a wife and two small children. I’d known that the ceasefire was temporary and that the situation was untenable, but I’d celebrated the quiet — until it suddenly imploded. The recent violence should remind us of what’s coming. And while a long-term truce may not yet be possible, more durable ceasefires certainly are. There are mutual interests that have gone unexploited, such as preventing ISIS in Sinai from gaining influence in Gaza or preventing the type of absolute desperation among Gazans that can lead to radicalization. Isolated agreements, however small, can build a framework to prevent the next outbreak of violence — and we owe it to the dead to work toward that goal.

Medium-term ceasefires and long-term peace processes are of secondary importance while the sides are actively killing each other. Unfortunately, the types of ceasefires that Israel and Hamas agree to in order to end the fighting do not address the issues that propel them toward war every few years; Gaza is still under siege and Hamas is still devoted to the total destruction of Israel. Long-term solutions are most practical and likely to succeed during times of calm, and if the recent violence is indeed just a temporary and limited flare-up, then the ideal time for those solutions is right now because the calm is never permanent; as Hamas rebuilds its war infrastructure, the status quo is again building toward war. Solutions must come from regional negotiations and include Israel, Hamas and Egypt, and only the United States can demand participation from all of those parties. Whatever the implications are of Israel, Hamas and Egypt negotiating — some will argue that negotiations would legitimize Hamas at the expense of the more moderate Palestinian Authority — negotiations are still preferable to doing nothing, and not only for Palestinians in Gaza. These wars harm Israelis, too. When I was a reservist in Operation Pillar of Defense, time moved tortuously slowly while we waited to fight. But that period of quiet also felt fleeting, as if the stillness before we started fighting should be cherished, not suffered. At our base, close enough to rocket launching sites in Gaza to allow us less than 15 seconds to find shelter from incoming rockets, air raid sirens provoked in us anger and fear, feelings that coexisted without respite for the duration of our time there. When the ceasefire was announced, and later when we were released, the fear and anger quickly gave way to euphoria and relief. With calm restored, thoughts about the unsustainable situation that would bring my fellow soldiers back to Gaza for a much longer and bloodier round of fighting were far off. It is therefore hard to avoid some responsibility when, one and a half years later, my former commander, Lt. Col. Dolev Keidar, was killed in an ambush after Hamas militants emerged from a tunnel and shot his patrol with an anti-tank missile. He left behind a wife and two small children. I’d known that the ceasefire was temporary and that the situation was untenable, but I’d celebrated the quiet — until it suddenly imploded. The recent violence should remind us of what’s coming. And while a long-term truce may not yet be possible, more durable ceasefires certainly are. There are mutual interests that have gone unexploited, such as preventing ISIS in Sinai from gaining influence in Gaza or preventing the type of absolute desperation among Gazans that can lead to radicalization. Isolated agreements, however small, can build a framework to prevent the next outbreak of violence — and we owe it to the dead to work toward that goal.

News article:
Fearing a worst-case scenario following a recent rise in tensions between Israel and Gaza, the Defense Ministry issued a written warning on Tuesday for all residents living near the Gaza border to have packed bags at the ready. “In the event of an emergency, there is a decision to completely evacuate,” the letter stated. Increased efforts by the IDF to uncover and destroy Hamas terror tunnels, such as the one discovered in April, have sparked frustrations along the Gaza strip. Angrily responding to Israel’s operations against the tunnels, IDF soldiers stationed at the northern border came under Hamas fire multiple times just last week. Should tensions reach an absolute peak, residents have been instructed to “lock all doors, close the windows and blinds, take personal weapons and any pets, along with food, and turn off the gas valve,” Channel 2 reported. They are also required to report to relevant security personnel upon departure. As for the means of escape transportation, civilians may only travel via private vehicle or by buses provided by local government councils, The Times of Israel reported. Additionally, they were given explicit instructions on which communities to reach for safety if necessary. Despite the extensive preparations, however, Israeli officials emphasized they did not believe there is a serious threat of renewed conflict on the Gaza border. Hamas, as well, conveyed to Israel through Egypt that it does not seek another war. But the terrorist organization has been caught numerous times enhancing their arsenal by smuggling in weapons, lending serious doubt to their assurances. The latest escalation comes during what some may consider precarious timing. This July will mark two years since Operation Protective Edge, a counter-offensive attack against Gaza in response to ongoing rocket fire by Palestinian terrorists. Following the war, the region saw a long period of relative calm. Recent activities, however, have renewed tensions in the area, provoking the Israeli government to take defensive precautions.

Israel is not pushing for another war in Gaza, but the army is prepared for it, the IDF’s Southern Command chief warned during a ceremony for the incoming head of the Gaza Division. “We are not desirous of war, but we do not fear its coming,” Eyal Zamir said. “The plans are ready, the cannons of the tanks are greased.” At the unit’s headquarters near the southern border, Zamir bade farewell to the outgoing commander Brig. Gen. Itay Virov and welcomed Brig. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs into his new position as head of the Gaza Division, which is responsible for operations inside Gaza as well as the security of Israel’s border with the coastal enclave. “I hope the quiet will be preserved and maintained through strength for as long as possible, by both sides, to improve civil and economic development, as well as for the welfare of the populations on both sides of the border,” Zamir said.

Fuchs, who previously served as chief infantry officer and head of the Nahal infantry brigade, recognized the difficulties of leading the volatile Gaza Division, but said he was up to the task. “I commit to defend the country’s border and to allow a good life for all those who value life,” Fuchs said. “I am receiving a division that is strong, trained, well-exercised and skilled — a prepared division.” Advertisement Though the situation is decidedly tense, the two years since the 2014 war have been the calmest along the Gaza border in over a decade. Earlier this month, the IDF uncovered an attack tunnel dug by Hamas inside Israeli territory. This was the second such tunnel found since the end of the Gaza war, known in Israel as Operation Protective Edge. The discovery of the second tunnel sparked small-scale clashes with Hamas, who fired mortars at the Israeli troops stationed on the southern border with the Gaza Strip. A few IDF engineering vehicles were damaged in the attacks, but no Israeli soldiers were injured. However, a Palestinian woman was killed and a number of others were injured in a retaliatory Israeli tank strike.

News article:
Palestinian Hamas resistance movement has declared that its leaders are not at all fearful of the assassination threats made against them by far-right Israeli politician Avigdor Lieberman, who has now been appointed as the regime’s minister of military affairs. Hamas politburo member Fathi Hammad said during a Friday protest rally in the Gaza Strip that the threats previously made by Lieberman to assassinate the movement’s political and military leaders would not affect the popular resistance group. The rally was being held to mark the 1948 creation of the Israeli regime — known as the Nakba Day or the Day of the Catastrophe. During the rally, thousands of Palestinian residents of the territory burned pictures of high-ranking Israeli officials and demanded an end to the nine-year-old siege of impoverished Gaza. Palestinians burn pictures of Avigdor Lieberman during Nakba Day rallies in the besieged Gaza Strip, May 20, 2016. (Photo by AFP) “We do not call for war, but we would fight if it was imposed upon us,” Hammad said. ‘On the brink of madness’ Lieberman, who leads Israel's far-right Yisrael Beiteinu party, earlier accepted an offer by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to become minister of military affairs. The hawkish politician is notorious for his threats to have Hamas leaders assassinated, notably saying in 2014 that murdering Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal would be the only way to deter future tunnel construction in the densely-populated Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007. He has also called on Israel to treat Hamas the same way as the United States treated “the Japanese in World War II.” Palestinian women walk past a mural on the 68th anniversary of the Nakba Day, in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip, May 15, 2016. (Photo by AFP) With Lieberman becoming minister of military affairs, Netanyahu is now set to lead the most extremist cabinet in the history of the Israeli regime. Opposition politician Isaac Herzog has said that, with the inclusion of Lieberman, the Israeli cabinet is now “on the brink of madness.” The Palestinian Foreign Ministry has also censured Liberman’s appointment, saying in a Thursday statement that the decision “confirms the lack of a peace partner in Israel.” “Whoever follows daily the procedures and violations carried out by the extremist Netanyahu administration against the Palestinian people, [sees] the racist, radical and violent nature of the politics of the cabinet since day one,” the statement added. In his Friday remarks, Hammad also said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of the rival Fatah movement “does not have a place in the leadership of our people and he should step aside.”

News article:
A few days ago, Hamas’s security forces in Gaza arrested a group of Salafi activists — members of Salafiya Jihadiya, a movement made up of Islamist groups that identify mainly with Islamic State. The head of the group is the son of a well-known Salafi preacher from the Shahin family. Hamas officials claimed that the group was planning to cross Gaza’s border into Sinai to join members of Islamic State in their fight against Egypt. News of the arrests created the sense that Hamas was working to stop attempts by these Gazan activists to help Islamic State in its war against the Egyptian army. The arrests were presented as part of an impressive operation by Hamas, fulfilling promises its representatives made to Egypt during a visit to Cairo two months ago. At that time, amid escalating tension between Egypt and Hamas and accusations of close collaboration between Hamas’s military wing and Walayat Sinai (Islamic State’s branch in Sinai), the high-ranking Hamas delegates assured Egyptian officials that Hamas would end its relationship with Islamic State there and then. Hamas has indeed since reinforced its troop deployment along the Gaza-Egypt border, and promised to stop all smuggling done via the tunnels there. The Salafi arrests thus provided further ostensible proof of the new Hamas commitment to Egypt’s well-being. (Those arrests, in turn, prompted rocket fire at Israel two days ago, for which the Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade, a Salafi group, claimed responsibility — a case of Israel being targeted by a Gaza terror group angry with Hamas.) Yet there seems to be a wide gap between what senior Hamas officials are telling the Egyptians and what the heads of its military wing are actually doing on the ground. Despite the promises by Gaza’s rulers to stop the smuggling to and from Sinai and the recent arrests, Hamas continues to maintain a delicate and complicated web of interests and alliances with Islamic State in Sinai. According to an abundance of Arab, Israeli and Palestinian sources, wounded members of Islamic State are still being brought into Gaza for medical treatment at almost the same rate as before the Hamas delegation’s visit to Cairo two months ago. Likewise, arms smuggling from the Gaza Strip to Sinai and vice versa continues, albeit at a reduced rate, supervised by members of Hamas’s military wing. Overall, in short, it is largely business as usual.

But other sources — not Israeli ones, but sources actually living in Gaza — confirm that over the past 10 months, dozens of Islamic State fighters have received medical treatment in the hospital in Khan Yunis, for example. This is astonishing considering Hamas’s delicate relationship with Egypt. The transfer of wounded Islamic State fighters is not the work of some low-ranking activist looking for a quick way to make money. It is a deliberate policy of Hamas that began in mid-2015. The Hamas official in charge of arranging medical treatment for Islamic State members is Mohammed Sutari, a well-known activist from the Khan Yunis refugee camp. This is the same place that produced the hard core of Hamas’s military wing, including notorious terror chief Mohammed Deif and Yahya and Muhammad Sinwar. This week the Elaph website, quoting a Palestinian source, published the name of one Islamic State fighter who is receiving medical treatment in Gaza. Maj. Gen. Mordechai named two more: Ibrahim Matar, who helps Sutari coordinate medical treatment for Islamic State members, and Said Abdelal, a Gazan from Rafah who is responsible for coordinating Islamic State’s military activities (apparently training) in the Gaza Strip.

There’s been a dramatic reduction in the scope, but Hamas still manages to bring quantities of arms into the Gaza Strip and to move arms and ammunition from Gaza to Sinai. Constrained by Egypt’s crackdown on the border tunnels, some of the smuggling has been done recently by sea. In addition, despite those widely reported Salafi arrests, several former Hamas activists (whose ideology leans toward that of those same Salafist groups) have crossed the border in recent weeks to join the fighting in Sinai against the Egyptian army. The best-known case is that of Musa Abdallah el-Mor, a former member of Hamas’s military wing whose family set up a mourning tent in Rafah after he was killed in Sinai while fighting against the Egyptian army there. All of this cross-border activity takes place under the noses of Egyptian officials, who heard the promises of the Hamas senior officials and then watched in dismay over the past two months as Hamas, and especially its military wing, did as they pleased and kept up their relationship of interests with Islamic State. Egypt’s response to this, it must be said, shows a degree of confusion and perhaps a lack of clear strategy. The Egyptians opened the Rafah border crossing briefly, for humanitarian reasons. At the same time, they allowed tons of concrete into the Gaza Strip when concrete and wood were in short supply there. They did this even though they knew that Hamas was using such materials to build tunnels, including tunnels that crossed into Sinai. These might have been interpreted as goodwill gestures by Egypt, but Egyptian intelligence heads quickly realized that the likes of Deif and Yahya Sinwar were unmoved, and have no intention of ordering a complete halt to cooperation with Islamic State anytime soon. It is doubtful, then, that Cairo will again open the Rafah crossing for periods longer than just a day or two, even with Ramadan approaching. Advertisement In other words, almost two years after the 50-day Operation Protective Edge Israel-Hamas war, and despite several statements suggesting that relations between Cairo and Gaza might be about to improve, that’s not happening. Instead, the Gaza Strip is spiraling back to the dangerous routine of tension with Egypt and a humanitarian situation that is slowly but consistently deteriorating. One can only hope that we are not in for a rerun of the summer of 2014.

News article:
A few days ago, Hamas’s security forces in Gaza arrested a group of Salafi activists — members of Salafiya Jihadiya, a movement made up of Islamist groups that identify mainly with Islamic State. The head of the group is the son of a well-known Salafi preacher from the Shahin family. Hamas officials claimed that the group was planning to cross Gaza’s border into Sinai to join members of Islamic State in their fight against Egypt. News of the arrests created the sense that Hamas was working to stop attempts by these Gazan activists to help Islamic State in its war against the Egyptian army. The arrests were presented as part of an impressive operation by Hamas, fulfilling promises its representatives made to Egypt during a visit to Cairo two months ago. At that time, amid escalating tension between Egypt and Hamas and accusations of close collaboration between Hamas’s military wing and Walayat Sinai (Islamic State’s branch in Sinai), the high-ranking Hamas delegates assured Egyptian officials that Hamas would end its relationship with Islamic State there and then. Hamas has indeed since reinforced its troop deployment along the Gaza-Egypt border, and promised to stop all smuggling done via the tunnels there. The Salafi arrests thus provided further ostensible proof of the new Hamas commitment to Egypt’s well-being. (Those arrests, in turn, prompted rocket fire at Israel two days ago, for which the Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade, a Salafi group, claimed responsibility — a case of Israel being targeted by a Gaza terror group angry with Hamas.) Yet there seems to be a wide gap between what senior Hamas officials are telling the Egyptians and what the heads of its military wing are actually doing on the ground. Despite the promises by Gaza’s rulers to stop the smuggling to and from Sinai and the recent arrests, Hamas continues to maintain a delicate and complicated web of interests and alliances with Islamic State in Sinai. According to an abundance of Arab, Israeli and Palestinian sources, wounded members of Islamic State are still being brought into Gaza for medical treatment at almost the same rate as before the Hamas delegation’s visit to Cairo two months ago. Likewise, arms smuggling from the Gaza Strip to Sinai and vice versa continues, albeit at a reduced rate, supervised by members of Hamas’s military wing. Overall, in short, it is largely business as usual.

News article:
A Republican senator is trying to block the Obama administration from buying nuclear materials from Iran. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) this week filed an amendment to an energy and water appropriations bill that would bar the government from using federal funds to buy Iran’s heavy water, which can be used in nuclear reactors. “It seems the president will go to any lengths to protect his nuclear deal,” Cotton said in a statement. “We’ve given the terror-sponsoring Iranian regime enough concessions at the risk of our security; we should not further subsidize its enrichment activity by making repeated purchases of this material.” {mosads}The measure is not scheduled to come up for a vote, and it is unclear whether it will hit the Senate floor before lawmakers take up the underlying appropriations bill on Wednesday. Yet the move by Cotton underscores the lingering anger over the Obama administration’s dealings with Iran following President Obama’s nuclear pact with the country. On Friday, the Energy Department announced it would spend roughly $8.6 million to buy 32 tons of heavy water from Iran, which signaled that other countries should feel free to follow suit. The department has said that the heavy water — which can be used as a coolant for some nuclear activities but also has other applications — will be resold to research and other organizations in the United States. The announced purchase came as Iran was staring down a July deadline to reduce its stockpile of the material under the international nuclear accord, and analysts worried it would not meet its obligation. The nuclear pact, which was implemented earlier this year, lifts sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its ability to build a nuclear weapon. “Part of the prescribed steps that they had to take was to reduce their nuclear stockpile, and that involved reducing their technological nuclear capabilities,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Tuesday. “Iran did have to ship a bunch of its heavy water out of the country and that’s what they have done, and now they’re selling off the stockpile and the United States has purchased some of it.” Earnest appeared to take an extra shot at Cotton, who previously earned the administration’s ire by authoring a letter to Iran trying to undermine the agreement last year. “I would suggest that if he has genuine concerns about this, maybe he can just write another letter to the supreme leader and see how far that gets him,” the spokesman quipped. The administration has claimed the purchase will not be a permanent arrangement. “I know of no intention to keep doing this on a recurring basis,” State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday. –This report was updated at 1:49 p.m.

News article:
Sen. Tom Cotton and the White House are engaged in a testy back-and-forth over the issue of buying heavy water from Iran. "The White House may think it's a laughing matter to subsidize Iran's nuclear program, but I don't," the Arkansas Republican said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Thursday morning. "Heavy water is not radioactive, not dangerous in normal quantities, but it is an essential part of any nuclear program like Iran's." On Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest took aim at Cotton after Senate Democrats said they would continue debating a spending bill because of a Cotton amendment that would have blocked the purchase of heavy water from Iran. "Sen. Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy water. I'm confident that he couldn't differentiate heavy water from sparkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon," Earnest said. Those comments came after the Energy Department said it would buy 32 tons of heavy water from Iran that could be used for nuclear material. Cotton said Thursday that the U.S. is not obligated to buy that heavy water. "We certainly are not obligated to provide taxpayer dollars for Iran's program for that heavy water," Cotton explained. "I offered a simple amendment on the Department of Energy's budget that said the U.S. taxpayer next year would not subsidize any more kinds of bills like this. Unfortunately, the Democrats blocked that amendment and that bill from going forward, even though I have a large majority in favor of my proposal." Co-host Joe Scarborough asked Cotton why he thought Democrats blocked it, to which he replied they don't want to be seen as "opposing their president" or going on the record as having U.S. taxpayer dollars "subsidizing Iran's nuclear majority program." "[O]n Capitol Hill, a poison pill is a term people use when they say this is a popular policy I oppose and I don't have the votes to stop," Cotton said in rejecting the notion that his amendment was a "poison pill" meant to kill the overall bill. "And I didn't do this at the last minute. The administration at the last minute on Friday night dropped the news they were giving $9 million to Iran's nuclear program. I filed this amendment on Monday, the very first day we were back in session after the administration's last-minute news dump on Friday night." Cotton also added that he will put the amendment into a stand-alone bill, for which he has a majority in favor.

News article:
In line with this criticism, the Arkansas Republican added a last-minute amendment to a Department of Energy spending bill that Congress was set to vote on this week, in which he specified that taxpayer money could not be utilized for similar such purchases in the next budget year. As a result, Senate Democrats blocked the bill on Wednesday, in spite of the fact that its other provisions had reportedly had strong bi-partisan support. Those Democrats described Cotton’s amendment as a “poison pill,” but CNN points out that his Republican supporters countered that the Democrats had refused a simple majority vote on the amendment, possibly out of concern that fellow Democrats would side with Cotton on the issue. Indeed, a number of Democrats have joined the Republican Party in opposing or generally criticizing the Iran nuclear deal and the Obama administration’s overall Iran policy. Despite this fact, the Democratic minority succeeded in preventing a vote of disapproval on that deal last year, by utilizing congressional filibuster rules. Similarly, this week’s budget bill was blocked by minority opposition, as it needed 60 “yay” votes to advance but received only 50, as compared to 46 votes of “nay.” Cotton has been a particularly strong voice of opposition to the White House’s Iran policy, having previously drawn stark criticism for convincing 46 of his fellow congressmen to sign a letter to the Iranian government announcing that the US government in the near future might elect to simply not enforce the agreement reached between the Obama administration and its Iranian counterpart. The newer controversy over the purchase of heavy water comes close on the heels of largely Republican accusations that the Obama administration was considering a change in Treasury Department rules which would effectively give the Iranians access to the US dollar and the American financial system. The administration had previously promised Congress that this would not happen as a result of implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The perceived betrayal of that promise was viewed as potentially giving away virtually the last bit of leverage that the US government had over Iran and its nuclear ambitions. The Iranian regime had publicly taken issued with the retention of that leverage in recent weeks, with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei accusing the US of implementing the JCPOA only “on paper,” while still scaring away international banks and some European businesses from reentering the Iranian market. Officials from the administration of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani have echoed these criticisms, apparently prompting two meetings last week between Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and US Secretary of State John Kerry. It is recognizably true that the ongoing separation of the Iranian and American financial systems is a contributing factor in keeping some investors and potential partners out of Iran. But many analysts have also observed that such decisions are also based on the legitimate fear that Iranian behavior will justify or even necessity the re-imposition of US-led economic sanctions at some point in the future. This assessment of the situation was repeated on Thursday by Economy Watch, which reported that the Washington-based World Bank was still noticeably reluctant to reengage with Tehran following the implementation of the nuclear deal. The organization’s president, Jim Young Kim says that the World Bank has no specific plans at the current time, but Economy Watch says that the World Bank is not exploiting the lack of official restrictions yet because it wishes to remain on good terms with its host country, the US. The article adds that the lending institution is no doubt aware of the possibility that relations between the two countries could rapidly deteriorate from the current climate of rapprochement. To be sure, the push-back from Cotton and other critics of the deal is a contributing factor in this, but so too is the anti-Western sentiment that is regularly being expressed by the Iranian regime, which arguably justifies a Republican response. The World Bank and other international businesses may feel even more reticent in the midst of reminders of the possible consequences of falling afoul or lingering or re-imposed economic sanctions. As outstanding issues continue to be resolved and other instances of tension continue to develop between Iran and the West, these are not difficult to come by. The most recent such reminder comes in the form of the arraignment of Reza Zarrab, who was the key-figure in a scandal that emerged three years ago involving Turkish evasion of sanctions on Iran. Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty reminded readers of the details of that scandal on Thursday, noting that the case involves hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions. The fresh memory of such illicit activities no doubt serves to underscore Western critics concerns about Iran’s behavior and the possible danger of providing money to a financial system that remains the State Department continues to regard as being of “primary money laundering concern.”

News article:
President Obama's top foreign policy aide believes Congress is incapable of "reasoned public debate," an assumption that governed how Obama's team sought to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran. "I mean, I'd prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote," Ben Rhodes, the president's deputy national security adviser, told the New York Times. "But that's impossible." That assessment was part of a profile of Rhodes that explained how he crafted an "actively misleading" story about the deal to the American public. Rhodes discussed how he takes advantage of ignorant reporters who have spent most of their careers covering campaigns — "they literally know nothing," he says — in order to ensure that a positive message about the deal was broadcast to the public. While Congress mulled voting down the Iran deal, Rhodes insisted that the agreement would weaken the radicals in Iranian government and empower more moderate voices. "What we saw throughout this negotiation, and what was evident through public statements, was that the hardliners in Iran actually opposed this deal," he said last July. "They've been very comfortable in the status quo, where essentially large chunks of Iranian society were suffering under sanctions." To the New York Times, Rhodes admitted that the nuclear talks were underway long before any election brought "moderate" Iranians to power. "In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this," he told the Times. "We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked."

News article:
Ben Rhodes is Barack Obama’s Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and Speechwriting. Yes, that is his official title and it is a mouthful. Why not just simplify it and call him what he really is? Assistant liar and manipulator. According to the White House website, Rhodes oversees the president’s national security communications, speechwriting and global engagement. It was Rhodes’ task to sell the Iran nuclear deal and according to a May 5 New York Times bio and article about Mr. Rhodes, written by David Samuels, the deputy national security advisor did a pretty good job. Oh, he didn’t involve himself with what was really within the deal, he simply sold it, and he did so with manipulation and lies. Rhodes markets what the president sells, and because liar in chief Obama used Rhodes’ words knowing they were untrue, the president manipulated and lied as well. Those two are perfect for each other. In fact, Samuels says most everyone with whom he spoke said Rhodes has a “mind meld” with Obama. When the nuclear deal was first peddled as a possibility, the narrative was that because there was a more “moderate” Iran, post the crazies who had held office, a reasonable, more malleable element had come into power. On July 14, 2015, Obama said, “Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has [sic] not.” Samuels calls this misleading, “because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran had begun in mid-2012, many months before Rouhani and the “moderate” camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran’s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.” I do not call the president’s words misleading, I call them a lie. Indeed as Samuels reports, in July of 2012, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent her aide Jake Sullivan to Oman to meet with Iranian officials to see if they could negotiate a nuclear agreement. To Rhodes and his boss, withdrawing from the Middle East (and pretty much the world) was so important, that it justified lying, because telling the truth for truth’s sake was simply not possible. Nuclear centrifuges, Iranian hegemony, being able to trust the Iranians down the line? Nah, not interested. Rhodes actually admitted the US did not believe that those with whom the deal was made would moderate, but would likely stay what they were, the largest state sponsor of terrorism. Rhodes said, “Look, with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They’re agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif” — Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister — “are real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.” If Obama and his staff didn’t trust the Iranians to change their criminal terrorist behavior, then why in heaven’s name make an agreement with them about the most destructive weapons ever created? Incredible. Advertisement To Rhodes, spinning and winning the debate is more important than the substance and cost-benefits of the argument. And to Rhodes, it’s easy to fool the liberal press to have them report things as he wishes. He has no respect for them. Samuels again: “Rhodes singled out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. “All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,” he said. “Now they don’t. They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing. ““The easiest way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. “But then there are sort of these force multipliers,” he said, adding, “We have our compadres, I will reach out to a couple people, and you know I wouldn’t want to name them — ” ““We created an echo chamber,” he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. “They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.”” Advertisement So, not only had the administration lied about prevention becoming containment, and not only had they lied about whether there would be “anytime, anywhere” inspections (US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said it was part of the agreement, Rhodes said that was never even sought, as if that makes it better), and more, Obama lied about when the negotiations started and about the Iranians moderating. All for the win, who cares about the danger? But does it matter? Does it make a difference when the negotiations started, and does it matter that the administration never believed the Iranians would change? Of course it does, or why lie about it? Barack Obama and his fellow liars, Ben Rhodes, Hillary Clinton and Secretary of State John Kerry, needed to feed the American people a narrative that would sell. Now what about Hillary? After waffling a bit, no doubt looking to see where the wind blew, last summer, the Democratic candidate for president came out in support of the agreement and even took some credit for it. It is not a surprise that she was in on the deceit. Hillary Clinton is an expert liar. The left liked to shout, “Bush lied, people died” about the Iraq War. One day tragically, it is very possible a nuclear device, perhaps a dirty bomb, will be used somewhere, and the bomb or its components will be traced back to Iran, the same Iran allowed and enabled to continue its nuclear weapons program by liars and manipulators who had more hope than brains, caring more for a win and a legacy, than the lives of those endangered by the worst and most treacherous regime on earth. Will the left shout then? Don’t bet on it.

News article:
Administration critics are slamming Secretary of State John Kerry's globetrotting in recent weeks to drum up investment in Iran with international banking and business leaders, and say Tehran has a responsibility to clean up its financial act in order to attract investment on its own. Kerry was in London Thursday to meet with heads of some of Europe's biggest banks in an attempt to reassure them about doing business in Iran. The meeting is a response to Tehran's complaints that they're not reaping the financial benefits the U.S. and other world powers promised them in negotiations over the nuclear accord. "We want to make it clear that legitimate business, which is clear under the definition of the agreement, is available to banks," Kerry said. "As long as they do their normal due diligence and know who they're dealing with, they're not going to be held to some undefined and inappropriate standard here." Back at home, a bipartisan group of lawmakers spent the day railing about the Kerry's efforts to reassure European banks that Iran is open for business. They said U.S. efforts should instead be focused on helping Iran separate its government financial activity from its money-laundering operations and support for terrorist activities in the region. Lawmakers critical of the nuclear deal said companies will only be comfortable investing in Iran after they're assured those investments won't be used to support Hezbollah or help bolster the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria. While Kerry was trying to drum up business for Iran in London, Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, held a hearing titled "Terrorism, Missiles and Corruption: The Risks of Economic Engagement with Iran." Royce and several others argued that it's impossible for Iran to separate its financial system from its terrorist activities because Tehran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is considered "Iran's most powerful economic actor." "International banks don't want to unwittingly funnel money to Iran's ballistic missile program, but any financial transaction with Iran risks funding Iran's ongoing illicit activities," he said. The Democrats who showed up for the hearing also were strong opponents of the nuclear deal and said Kerry's efforts to help spur investment in Iran is misguided. "We've got to straighten out the difference between being pro-Iran deal and being pro-Iran," said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif. "What we should be talking about is to demand full compliance with the deal and ourselves not over-comply and give the Iranians more than they bargained for." Juan Zarate, the first-ever assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes during the George W. Bush administration and vocal opponent of the nuclear deal, made the point that the U.S. shouldn't be in a position of "rehabilitating Iran." "We shouldn't be sending delegations around the world explaining how to do business in Iran legitimately," he said. "We shouldn't be undercutting our authority by telling European and international businesses that they need not listen to the regulatory policy or other actions of the U.S. Treasury – quite the opposite. We should be reinforcing the effect and the reach and suasion of our authorities around the world." Most major banks in Europe and elsewhere are biding their time to discover what pitfalls investing in Iran carries with it, according to Elizabeth Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. During the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Rosenberg testified that U.S. policy-makers and their European counterparts should publicly identify Iran's "self-imposed banking problems," including its financial system's involvement in funding terrorism. "Doing so will make it clear to Iran and the global community that Iran bears significant responsibility for improving its own economic condition and that the removal of sanctions under the nuclear deal cannot independent deliver a windfall to Iran," she said. Reporters also pressed White House press secretary Josh Earnest about whether the Obama administration should be trying to promote business with Iran. Earnest responded that the administration wants "to fulfill our responsibility to international financial institutions" and provide specific guidance on what U.S. and international sanctions laws allow when it comes to doing business with Iran. The U.S. in recent years has imposed heavy sanctions on international financial institutions that have been forced to pay big fines for trying to circumvent sanctions so European banks are naturally hesitant to engage until they know they are well within current law, he said. Earnest also stressed that administration officials are trying to encourage Iran to do more to provide a "stable business climate" and attract investment on its own. "If you are routinely testing ballistic missiles that violate United Nations sanctions that govern your ballistic missile program, well, that's not going to inspire the confidence of business leaders that this is a safe place to do business," he said. "If you are supporting terrorism around the world, that's not going to be particularly persuasive to business leaders that Iran is a good place to make an investment. So there's more that Iran can do."

"International banks don't want to unwittingly funnel money to Iran's ballistic missile program, but any financial transaction with Iran risks funding Iran's ongoing illicit activities," he said. The Democrats who showed up for the hearing also were strong opponents of the nuclear deal and said Kerry's efforts to help spur investment in Iran is misguided. "We've got to straighten out the difference between being pro-Iran deal and being pro-Iran," said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif. "What we should be talking about is to demand full compliance with the deal and ourselves not over-comply and give the Iranians more than they bargained for." Juan Zarate, the first-ever assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes during the George W. Bush administration and vocal opponent of the nuclear deal, made the point that the U.S. shouldn't be in a position of "rehabilitating Iran." "We shouldn't be sending delegations around the world explaining how to do business in Iran legitimately," he said. "We shouldn't be undercutting our authority by telling European and international businesses that they need not listen to the regulatory policy or other actions of the U.S. Treasury – quite the opposite. We should be reinforcing the effect and the reach and suasion of our authorities around the world." Most major banks in Europe and elsewhere are biding their time to discover what pitfalls investing in Iran carries with it, according to Elizabeth Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. During the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Rosenberg testified that U.S. policy-makers and their European counterparts should publicly identify Iran's "self-imposed banking problems," including its financial system's involvement in funding terrorism. "Doing so will make it clear to Iran and the global community that Iran bears significant responsibility for improving its own economic condition and that the removal of sanctions under the nuclear deal cannot independent deliver a windfall to Iran," she said. Reporters also pressed White House press secretary Josh Earnest about whether the Obama administration should be trying to promote business with Iran. Earnest responded that the administration wants "to fulfill our responsibility to international financial institutions" and provide specific guidance on what U.S. and international sanctions laws allow when it comes to doing business with Iran. The U.S. in recent years has imposed heavy sanctions on international financial institutions that have been forced to pay big fines for trying to circumvent sanctions so European banks are naturally hesitant to engage until they know they are well within current law, he said. Earnest also stressed that administration officials are trying to encourage Iran to do more to provide a "stable business climate" and attract investment on its own. "If you are routinely testing ballistic missiles that violate United Nations sanctions that govern your ballistic missile program, well, that's not going to inspire the confidence of business leaders that this is a safe place to do business," he said. "If you are supporting terrorism around the world, that's not going to be particularly persuasive to business leaders that Iran is a good place to make an investment. So there's more that Iran can do."

News article:
Administration critics are slamming Secretary of State John Kerry's globetrotting in recent weeks to drum up investment in Iran with international banking and business leaders, and say Tehran has a responsibility to clean up its financial act in order to attract investment on its own. Kerry was in London Thursday to meet with heads of some of Europe's biggest banks in an attempt to reassure them about doing business in Iran. The meeting is a response to Tehran's complaints that they're not reaping the financial benefits the U.S. and other world powers promised them in negotiations over the nuclear accord. "We want to make it clear that legitimate business, which is clear under the definition of the agreement, is available to banks," Kerry said. "As long as they do their normal due diligence and know who they're dealing with, they're not going to be held to some undefined and inappropriate standard here." Back at home, a bipartisan group of lawmakers spent the day railing about the Kerry's efforts to reassure European banks that Iran is open for business. They said U.S. efforts should instead be focused on helping Iran separate its government financial activity from its money-laundering operations and support for terrorist activities in the region. Lawmakers critical of the nuclear deal said companies will only be comfortable investing in Iran after they're assured those investments won't be used to support Hezbollah or help bolster the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria. While Kerry was trying to drum up business for Iran in London, Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, held a hearing titled "Terrorism, Missiles and Corruption: The Risks of Economic Engagement with Iran."

News article:
Congressman Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight Committee, is calling for Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes to testify at a hearing about the controversial Iran nuclear deal. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Rhodes admitted to misleading the press and the public with the diplomatic particulars leading up to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran deal. Rep. Chaffetz said on FOX Business Network’s Varney & Co. that he has invited Rhodes, along with Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), to have a “rational discussion” with Congress. “We are going to have a hearing regardless, but he [Rhodes] should show up. He hasn’t indicated that he is not going to show up and we should have this dialogue,” Chaffetz said. Chaffetz, who opposes the Iran deal, says the misinformation used to sell it to the American public and the findings from the Times interview confirm Rhodes has misled the public. “The president has entrusted him [Rhodes] in a very powerful position and this article I think clearly lays out that he used that podium and used that position and the bowels of the White House there to mislead the American people.” The Iran deal is an international agreement that was reached in Vienna on July 14, 2015 between Iran and five members of the United Nations Security Council on the Middle Eastern country’s nuclear program. Rhodes was asked to appear at a hearing on Tuesday, May 17 at 10 a.m. Related Articles

News article:
US Republican senators have demanded that President Barack Obama “dismiss” his top advisor, Ben Rhodes, over attempts to “mislead elected lawmakers and the American public” over a nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers. The deputy national security advisor for strategic communication was accused of creating an “echo chamber” to sell the agreement to the anti-Iran GOPers, according to the letter, citing a New York Times Magazine profile. ‘Sober debate’ In the piece titled “The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama’s Foreign-Policy Guru,” Rhodes “admitted” to reporter David Samuels that the Obama administration “created an echo chamber.” Rhodes argued that he would have opted for “a sober, reasoned public debate (over the nuclear agreement), after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote… But that’s impossible.” The piece, published on May 5, made GOP lawmakers ask Obama to dismiss the top aide. Rhodes was also asked to attend a congressional hearing Tuesday, which he skipped as “the appearance of a senior presidential adviser before Congress threatens the independence and autonomy of the President,” according to a response by White House Counsel W. Neil Eggleston to Chairman Jason Chaffetz’ request. ‘Deeply disturbed’ After arduous talks that spanned 20 months, negotiators reached a landmark deal over Iran's nuclear program in Vienna on July 14, 2015. The GOPers have spared no efforts to disrupt nuclear negotiations with Tehran as well as the JCPOA, reached between Tehran and the P5+1 -- the US, Britain, Russia, China, France, and Germany -- last year. Rhodes’ idea that the Republican-controlled Congress is incapable of a reasonable conversation over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action infuriated the senators. “We call on you to dismiss Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes before he further tarnishes the Office of President,” read the letter by the “deeply disturbed” lawmakers. ‘Wildly misinformed’ Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark) White House press secretary Josh Earnest, however, defended Rhodes, saying it was the time for the Republicans to “have some explaining.” "I think there are some people who have some explaining to do when it comes to the wildly false accusations that they made about the Iran deal. And it's not the administration. It's Republicans who are demonstrably wrong when it comes to the Iran deal," Earnest said, accusing several Republican lawmakers, including Arkansas republican Senator Tom Cotton, of being "wildly misinformed, mistaken or lying." Chaffetz responded to Earnest in a tweet, saying, "Dear @PressSec, @SenTomCotton will testify if @rhodes44 is man enough to show. Let's discuss the truth.” With their long-term links to the Israeli regime, the anti-Tehran Republican lawmakers fear a stronger Iran in the Middle East after the JCPOA.

News article:
Democrats and Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sparred Tuesday over whether the White House, led by national security adviser Ben Rhodes, misled the public about the nuclear agreement with Iran in order to sell the deal to Congress and the public. A panel of Iran experts invited to testify in Rhodes' stead by committee Republicans argued the administration created a false narrative in which America's only options were war or the nuclear deal, a dichotomy they said was misleading. Michael Rubin, a resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, said White House officials also inaccurately characterized Iranian President Hassan Rouhani as a moderate politician upon his election in 2013. Michael Doran, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said Obama aides created a "pleasing story" with little basis in reality about moderates ascending to power alongside Rouhani in Iran. Doran said the administration attempted to draw "moral equivalence" between critics of the nuclear deal and hardliners in Iran who opposed Rouhani. Rhodes' refusal to testify before the committee Tuesday ruffled Republican feathers. Rhodes came under fire after a May 5 story in the New York Times exposed some of the aide's aggressive messaging tactics. Those included providing fictitious talking points to think tanks who then fed the talking points as facts to reporters, creating what he called an "echo chamber" in favor of the Iran Deal. Rep. Trey Gowdy blasted Rhodes for citing executive privilege in order to avoid testifying while speaking freely to reporters. The South Carolina Republican also hit Rhodes for his educational background in creative writing, which was explored in the Times piece that dragged the White House aide into the spotlight. "If you're interested in writing haikus and sonnets, he's probably the right guy," Gowdy said of Rhodes. The hearing came as Republican senators pressed President Obama to remove Rhodes for his "astonishing level of disrespect towards the U.S. Congress." Democrats on the Oversight Committee, however, argued the administration did not misrepresent the nuclear agreement with Iran when pitching it to Congress and lauded the deal as a vital step toward peace in the Middle East.

News article:
J.J. Goldberg May 16, 2016 America’s political polarization affects us all in such strange and profound ways that sometimes we don’t even know it’s there. We’re all familiar with those debates that never go anywhere because the two sides are arguing from different sets of facts. Climate change, for example. Sometimes, though, we’re living in solitudes so utterly separate that one side can be arguing furiously with the other, and the other side won’t even know there’s an argument going on. Related opinion What That Ben Rhodes Profile Really Tells Us About the Iran Deal Case in point: the uproar over that lengthy profile of White House aide Ben Rhodes that appeared in the New York Times Magazine on May 8 (and on the Times website May 5). If you live inside the left’s echo chamber, it’s a scandal that came and went. Rhodes, the president’s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, foolishly shot his mouth off, as liberals see it, to a seemingly friendly journalist about how cleverly he sold the Iran nuclear deal to Congress and the public. The Times, for its part, stupidly published what amounted to a 9,500-word hit piece masquerading as serious journalism (and, incidentally, touting Rhodes’s PR skills without mentioning that he never actually managed to win majority support either in Congress or the public). The liberal commentariat duly weighed in with predictable passion. Replies to the critics were promptly issued by Rhodes and by the profile’s author, freelancer David Samuels. And that was about it. Yesterday’s news. Inside conservative-world, though, the article landed like a bombshell, and the ground hasn’t stopped shaking. Rhodes, who’s depicted as so close to the president that they communicate by “mind meld,” seemed to be confessing to Samuels that the entire hated Iran deal rested on falsehoods. The right finally had its smoking gun, discrediting the Iran deal as a fraud. “The way in which most Americans have heard the story of the Iran deal presented,” Samuels wrote, was that “the Obama administration began seriously engaging with Iranian officials in 2013,” taking advantage of new Iranian elections that “brought moderates to power” under incoming president Hassan Rouhani. In fact, though, Samuels wrote, the administration’s story “was largely manufactured for the purpose for selling the deal. The “particulars may have been true, but the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading or false.” The truth, Samuels wrote, was that Obama and company never genuinely believed Rouhani was a genuine moderate — “we aren’t betting on that,” Rhodes is quoted as saying — but called him that anyway. Besides, the U.S.-Iranian talks actually began secretly a year earlier, in 2012, when Iran’s president was still the unhinged Mahmoud Ahmedinejad. Samuels went on to write that the Obama administration’s ultimate goal in crafting the Iran deal was “to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey.” This has been widely interpreted as something Samuels learned from Rhodes, though in fact it’s a common anti-Obama myth that Samuels inserted in his own words. In fact Obama stated throughout his 2008 presidential campaign that he was committed to preventing the terror-sponsoring regime from acquiring nuclear weapons and hoped to accomplish that through negotiations if possible. The United Nations Security Council had been piling sanctions on Iran since 2006 as punishment for its illegitimate nuclear program, and the regime had been negotiating on and off with a trio of Britain, France and Germany. Toward the end of the Bush administration hey were joined by the other permanent members of the Security Council: Russia, China and, in the twilight of the Bush administration, the United States. Thus was born the P5+1, the five permanent members plus Germany. In 2012 Obama entered a secret back-channel negotiation with Iran, mediated by Oman, to see whether one-on-one talks might succeed where the round-table jawboning hadn’t. Those talks didn’t get serious until Rouhani came into office in August 2013 with his platform of improving ties with the West. Hence the notion that Rouhani’s relative moderation made negotiations possible. But Washington’s goal in the negotiations, under Bush and Obama alike, was to reach an agreement that was verifiable and enforceable regardless of who ruled in Tehran. They weren’t “betting” on moderates. But Samuels wrote what Samuels wrote. The right-wing press eruptedin righteous outrage when Samuels’s article appeared, and hasn’t stopped. Rhodes, it was said, had supplied the evidence that the Iran deal was not just misguided but deliberately so. Congressional Republicans have swung into action with demands that Rhodes be fired or summoned to testify at the hearings that are already in the works. There’s even talk of cutting budgets in order to force the downsizing of the National Security Council, where Rhodes works. This is where our tale enters the Twilight Zone. One of the first congressional panels to schedule an inquiry on the Rhodes affair was the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, chaired by Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, which scheduled a May 17 hearing on “White House narratives on the Iran nuclear deal.” And one of the first witnesses invited to testify was John Hannah, onetime national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, currently senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a neoconservative think tank. Hannah should know a thing or two about fabricating narratives to justify Middle East policy initiatives. In 2002, while serving in Cheney’s office in the Bush White House, he played a key role in assembling the false intelligence that helped build the case for the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. In particular, he was one of the key administration contacts with Ahmed Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress, who fed Washington much of the hyped-up information about Saddam Hussein’s imaginary weapons of mass destruction. Chalabi, a wealthy Shi’ite who died in 2015, had spent a decade cultivating neoconservatives to lobby for an invasion and pushing the case that the Iraqi people were eager to welcome the Americans and ready to establish a peaceful, pro-Western democracy. The Iraq experience could provide a useful lesson to lawmakers about how an administration can build a misguided policy on a foundation of lies, in the unlikely event that they’re interested in learning it. A great deal has been written and said about the weapons of mass destruction that weren’t there and the inability of the Iraqi people to settle into a peaceful, functioning democracy, then or now. The commonly accepted narrative, even by liberals, is that the Bush administration was misled by faulty intelligence indicating that Saddam had a nuclear program hidden away. But the full story is rarely told, even though much of it has been publicly laid out in various places. For starters, George W. Bush’s first Treasury secretary, Paul O’Neill, described in journalist Ron Suskind’s 2004 book “The Price of Loyalty” how the planning for the overthrow of Saddam was launched on Bush’s instructions at the first meeting of the newly elected president’s National Security Council on January 30, 2001, 10 days after he was inaugurated — and seven months before the September 11 attacks. Richard Clarke, NSC counter-terrorism chief in both the Clinton and Bush administrations, described in his own 2004 book, “Against All Enemies,” how Bush approached him on September 12, 2001, and told him to find evidence that Saddam was linked to the previous day’s atrocities, even though Clarke already knew they’d been planned by Al Qaeda and had nothing to do with Saddam — and told Bush so. And Uzi Dayan, director of Israel’s national security council under then-prime minister Ariel Sharon, told me in a 2006 interview that he was told by then-NSC chief Condoleezza Rice at a meeting in early January 2002 that “the president has already decided” to invade Iraq — even though the administration spent another 14 months claiming it was open to other measures, looking for evidence of those weapons, consulting with allies and pretending to hope that Saddam would “come clean” about his non-existent weapons program. The Bush administration was not the first administration in recent history to build a disastrous foreign policy initiative on a foundation of outright lies. The Reagan administration memorably waged a war against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua during the 1980s, even though that war had been specifically outlawed by Congress, and financed the war by illegally selling weapons to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The exposure of the doubly illegal secret program led to the conviction of several top Reagan aides on charges of lying to Congress, but Reagan himself emerged with his reputation intact and his place in history assured, at least in the minds of Republicans, as one of our great presidents. The consequences of Bush’s Iraq invasion were far more profound and long-lasting. As Israel’s Sharon correctly warned Bush in a White House meeting in February 2002, after being alerted to the president’s plans by Dayan, an Iraq invasion would have the effect of fracturing Iraq into warring tribes of Sunnis, Shi’ites and Kurds and drag America into a long-lasting and probably unwinnable quagmire. It would also, in eliminating Saddam Hussein, liberate Iran from its worst enemy and thus free up the Islamic Republic to become a regional superpower. In the bargain it would turn Sunni-led Iraq from Iran’s worst enemy into a Shi’ite-ruled client state, though Sharon apparently didn’t bring that up in the conversation. Sharon couldn’t know or predict a fourth result of the American invasion: drawing a young Jordanian-born terrorist named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi into the chaotic post-invasion Iraq where he launched a Sunni insurgency under the banner of an organization he created — an organization that eventually, shortly after Zarqawi’s 2006 death, took the name Islamic State in Iraq and then changed it again in 2013 to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The Republicans in Congress seem determined to accuse the Obama administration of something that it didn’t do, but the two most recent two-term Republican administrations most assuredly did: pursuing a misguided policy under a cover of lies that greatly benefited Iran. Even more strange, they’re basing their accusation on a misleadingly-written story in a newspaper they usually hate and mistrust, the New York Times. It’s a curious display of historical amnesia. Perhaps it’s a case of psychological projection. Either way, it certainly shows how different are the realities in which different groups of Americans live.

J.J. Goldberg May 16, 2016 America’s political polarization affects us all in such strange and profound ways that sometimes we don’t even know it’s there. We’re all familiar with those debates that never go anywhere because the two sides are arguing from different sets of facts. Climate change, for example. Sometimes, though, we’re living in solitudes so utterly separate that one side can be arguing furiously with the other, and the other side won’t even know there’s an argument going on. Related opinion What That Ben Rhodes Profile Really Tells Us About the Iran Deal Case in point: the uproar over that lengthy profile of White House aide Ben Rhodes that appeared in the New York Times Magazine on May 8 (and on the Times website May 5). If you live inside the left’s echo chamber, it’s a scandal that came and went. Rhodes, the president’s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, foolishly shot his mouth off, as liberals see it, to a seemingly friendly journalist about how cleverly he sold the Iran nuclear deal to Congress and the public. The Times, for its part, stupidly published what amounted to a 9,500-word hit piece masquerading as serious journalism (and, incidentally, touting Rhodes’s PR skills without mentioning that he never actually managed to win majority support either in Congress or the public). The liberal commentariat duly weighed in with predictable passion. Replies to the critics were promptly issued by Rhodes and by the profile’s author, freelancer David Samuels. And that was about it. Yesterday’s news. Inside conservative-world, though, the article landed like a bombshell, and the ground hasn’t stopped shaking. Rhodes, who’s depicted as so close to the president that they communicate by “mind meld,” seemed to be confessing to Samuels that the entire hated Iran deal rested on falsehoods. The right finally had its smoking gun, discrediting the Iran deal as a fraud. “The way in which most Americans have heard the story of the Iran deal presented,” Samuels wrote, was that “the Obama administration began seriously engaging with Iranian officials in 2013,” taking advantage of new Iranian elections that “brought moderates to power” under incoming president Hassan Rouhani. In fact, though, Samuels wrote, the administration’s story “was largely manufactured for the purpose for selling the deal. The “particulars may have been true, but the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading or false.” The truth, Samuels wrote, was that Obama and company never genuinely believed Rouhani was a genuine moderate — “we aren’t betting on that,” Rhodes is quoted as saying — but called him that anyway. Besides, the U.S.-Iranian talks actually began secretly a year earlier, in 2012, when Iran’s president was still the unhinged Mahmoud Ahmedinejad. Samuels went on to write that the Obama administration’s ultimate goal in crafting the Iran deal was “to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey.” This has been widely interpreted as something Samuels learned from Rhodes, though in fact it’s a common anti-Obama myth that Samuels inserted in his own words. In fact Obama stated throughout his 2008 presidential campaign that he was committed to preventing the terror-sponsoring regime from acquiring nuclear weapons and hoped to accomplish that through negotiations if possible. The United Nations Security Council had been piling sanctions on Iran since 2006 as punishment for its illegitimate nuclear program, and the regime had been negotiating on and off with a trio of Britain, France and Germany. Toward the end of the Bush administration hey were joined by the other permanent members of the Security Council: Russia, China and, in the twilight of the Bush administration, the United States. Thus was born the P5+1, the five permanent members plus Germany. In 2012 Obama entered a secret back-channel negotiation with Iran, mediated by Oman, to see whether one-on-one talks might succeed where the round-table jawboning hadn’t. Those talks didn’t get serious until Rouhani came into office in August 2013 with his platform of improving ties with the West. Hence the notion that Rouhani’s relative moderation made negotiations possible. But Washington’s goal in the negotiations, under Bush and Obama alike, was to reach an agreement that was verifiable and enforceable regardless of who ruled in Tehran. They weren’t “betting” on moderates. But Samuels wrote what Samuels wrote. The right-wing press eruptedin righteous outrage when Samuels’s article appeared, and hasn’t stopped. Rhodes, it was said, had supplied the evidence that the Iran deal was not just misguided but deliberately so. Congressional Republicans have swung into action with demands that Rhodes be fired or summoned to testify at the hearings that are already in the works.

News article:
WASHINGTON (AP) — A group the White House recently identified as a key surrogate in selling the Iran nuclear deal gave National Public Radio $100,000 last year to help it report on the pact and related issues, according to the group’s annual report. It also funded reporters and partnerships with other news outlets. The Ploughshares Fund’s mission is to “build a safe, secure world by developing and investing in initiatives to reduce and ultimately eliminate the world’s nuclear stockpiles,” one that dovetails with President Barack Obama’s arms control efforts. But its behind-the-scenes role advocating for the Iran agreement got more attention this month after a candid profile of Ben Rhodes, one of the president’s top foreign policy aides. In The New York Times Magazine article, Rhodes explained how the administration worked with nongovernmental organizations, proliferation experts and even friendly reporters to build support for the seven-nation accord that curtailed Iran’s nuclear activity and softened international financial penalties on Tehran. “We created an echo chamber,” said Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, adding that “outside groups like Ploughshares” helped carry out the administration’s message effectively. The magazine piece revived Republican criticism of the Iran agreement as they suggested it was evidence of a White House spin machine misleading the American people. The administration accused opponents of trying to re-litigate the deal after failing to defeat it in congressional votes last year. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Outside groups of all stripes are increasingly giving money to news organizations for special projects or general news coverage. Most news organizations, including The Associated Press, have strict rules governing whom they can accept money from and how to protect journalistic independence. Ploughshares’ backing is more unusual, given its prominent role in the rancorous, partisan debate over the Iran deal. The Ploughshares grant to NPR supported “national security reporting that emphasizes the themes of US nuclear weapons policy and budgets, Iran’s nuclear program, international nuclear security topics and US policy toward nuclear security,” according to Ploughshares’ 2015 annual report, recently published online. Advertisement “It is common practice for foundations to fund media coverage of underreported stories,” Ploughshares spokeswoman Jennifer Abrahamson said. Funding “does not influence the editorial content of their coverage in any way, nor would we want it to.” Ploughshares has funded NPR’s coverage of national security since 2005, the radio network said. Ploughshares reports show at least $700,000 in funding over that time. All grant descriptions since 2010 specifically mention Iran. “It’s a valued partnership, without any conditions from Ploughshares on our specific reporting, beyond the broad issues of national and nuclear security, nuclear policy, and nonproliferation,” NPR said in an emailed statement. “As with all support received, we have a rigorous editorial firewall process in place to ensure our coverage is independent and is not influenced by funders or special interests.” Republican lawmakers will have concerns nonetheless, especially as Congress supplies NPR with a small portion of its funding. Just this week, the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee tried to summon Rhodes to a hearing entitled “White House Narratives on the Iran Nuclear Deal,” but he refused. Ploughshares’ links to media are “tremendously troubling,” said Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, an Iran-deal critic. Pompeo told the AP he repeatedly asked NPR to be interviewed last year as a counterweight to a Democratic supporter of the agreement, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who he said regularly appeared on the station. But NPR refused to put Pompeo on the air, he said. The station said it had no record of Pompeo’s requests, and listed several prominent Republicans who were featured speaking about the deal or economic sanctions on Iran. Advertisement Another who appeared on NPR is Joseph Cirincione, Ploughshares’ president. He spoke about the negotiations on air at least twice last year. The station identified Ploughshares as an NPR funder one of those times; the other time, it didn’t. Ploughshares boasts of helping to secure the deal. While success was “driven by the fearless leadership of the Obama administration and supporters in Congress,” board chairwoman Mary Lloyd Estrin wrote in the annual report, “less known is the absolutely critical role that civil society played in tipping the scales towards this extraordinary policy victory.” The 33-page document lists the groups that Ploughshares funded last year to advance its nonproliferation agenda.

News article:
WASHINGTON (AP) — A group the White House recently identified as a key surrogate in selling the Iran nuclear deal gave National Public Radio $100,000 last year to help it report on the pact and related issues, according to the group’s annual report. It also funded reporters and partnerships with other news outlets. The Ploughshares Fund’s mission is to “build a safe, secure world by developing and investing in initiatives to reduce and ultimately eliminate the world’s nuclear stockpiles,” one that dovetails with President Barack Obama’s arms control efforts. But its behind-the-scenes role advocating for the Iran agreement got more attention this month after a candid profile of Ben Rhodes, one of the president’s top foreign policy aides. In The New York Times Magazine article, Rhodes explained how the administration worked with nongovernmental organizations, proliferation experts and even friendly reporters to build support for the seven-nation accord that curtailed Iran’s nuclear activity and softened international financial penalties on Tehran. “We created an echo chamber,” said Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, adding that “outside groups like Ploughshares” helped carry out the administration’s message effectively. The magazine piece revived Republican criticism of the Iran agreement as they suggested it was evidence of a White House spin machine misleading the American people. The administration accused opponents of trying to re-litigate the deal after failing to defeat it in congressional votes last year.

Most news organizations, including The Associated Press, have strict rules governing whom they can accept money from and how to protect journalistic independence. Ploughshares’ backing is more unusual, given its prominent role in the rancorous, partisan debate over the Iran deal. The Ploughshares grant to NPR supported “national security reporting that emphasizes the themes of US nuclear weapons policy and budgets, Iran’s nuclear program, international nuclear security topics and US policy toward nuclear security,” according to Ploughshares’ 2015 annual report, recently published online. Advertisement “It is common practice for foundations to fund media coverage of underreported stories,” Ploughshares spokeswoman Jennifer Abrahamson said. Funding “does not influence the editorial content of their coverage in any way, nor would we want it to.” Ploughshares has funded NPR’s coverage of national security since 2005, the radio network said. Ploughshares reports show at least $700,000 in funding over that time. All grant descriptions since 2010 specifically mention Iran. “It’s a valued partnership, without any conditions from Ploughshares on our specific reporting, beyond the broad issues of national and nuclear security, nuclear policy, and nonproliferation,” NPR said in an emailed statement. “As with all support received, we have a rigorous editorial firewall process in place to ensure our coverage is independent and is not influenced by funders or special interests.” Republican lawmakers will have concerns nonetheless, especially as Congress supplies NPR with a small portion of its funding. Just this week, the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee tried to summon Rhodes to a hearing entitled “White House Narratives on the Iran Nuclear Deal,” but he refused. Ploughshares’ links to media are “tremendously troubling,” said Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, an Iran-deal critic. Pompeo told the AP he repeatedly asked NPR to be interviewed last year as a counterweight to a Democratic supporter of the agreement, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who he said regularly appeared on the station. But NPR refused to put Pompeo on the air, he said. The station said it had no record of Pompeo’s requests, and listed several prominent Republicans who were featured speaking about the deal or economic sanctions on Iran. Advertisement Another who appeared on NPR is Joseph Cirincione, Ploughshares’ president. He spoke about the negotiations on air at least twice last year. The station identified Ploughshares as an NPR funder one of those times; the other time, it didn’t. Ploughshares boasts of helping to secure the deal. While success was “driven by the fearless leadership of the Obama administration and supporters in Congress,” board chairwoman Mary Lloyd Estrin wrote in the annual report, “less known is the absolutely critical role that civil society played in tipping the scales towards this extraordinary policy victory.” The 33-page document lists the groups that Ploughshares funded last year to advance its nonproliferation agenda. The Arms Control Association got $282,500; the Brookings Institution, $225,000; and the Atlantic Council, $182,500. They received money for Iran-related analysis, briefings and media outreach, and non-Iran nuclear work.

News article:
May 25, 2016 The Obama administration has spent months suggesting it would support a key Iran sanctions bill when the time is ripe. Not anymore. In back-to-back appearances May 25 in the House and Senate, the State Department's point man on implementation of the nuclear deal flatly declined to endorse renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) before it expires in December. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say the secondary sanctions on Iran's energy sector give the administration international penalties to "snap back" to if Iran reneges on its obligations under the deal, but the administration disagrees. "Having the ISA in place or not is not necessary for snapping back. We have sufficient authority through various executive orders," Stephen Mull told the Senate Banking Committee. "The administration is ready to work with the Congress on [reauthorization]. We would have to see what form it would take. ... There have been various, slightly different variations in how it would be renewed, so we would certainly be willing to have that conversation." The evasive response infuriated Iran deal skeptics on both sides of the aisle after they repeatedly asked Mull about his views on a straight-up extension of the current law. Some accused the administration of a bait-and-switch to help sell the deal to Congress. "You seem very wishy-washy, as you have been in multiple settings. And it's very off-putting," said banking panel member and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. "Either you support the Iran Sanctions Act being extended, or you don't." Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the co-author of pending legislation to extend the current law by 10 years with a few extra reporting requirements, also grilled Mull. Menendez asked if straight-up reauthorization would be a violation of the nuclear deal, prompting Mull to answer, "We would have to look at that at the time that it was submitted." "That contravenes everything that we were told at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee," Menendez replied. "I cannot fathom for the life of me how we don't embrace authorizing it as it is so that at the end of the day the Iranians know that if in the out-years [of the deal] there is any violation, there is immediate snap-back to the most significant sanctions that exist." During and immediately after passage of the nuclear deal, administration officials urged lawmakers not to immediately reauthorize the sanctions law so as to avoid needlessly antagonizing the Iranians. That argument has lost any traction, however, as Congress quickly burns through its few remaining legislating days in this election year. "We absolutely support renewal of the ISA," a senior official told Politico in August 2015. “It’s an important piece of legislation, and we want to discuss renewal with Congress in a thoughtful way at the right time." The administration denies any flat-out change of heart. "We remain committed to working with Congress," State Department official Sam Werberg told Al-Monitor in an emailed statement, "and are willing to discuss how to further foreign policy priorities in a manner that does not jeopardize JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] implementation." Mull had similar exchanges with the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier in the day, when he was also repeatedly pressed on the law's extension. Lawmakers across the ideological spectrum — from nuclear deal cheerleader Gerry Connolly, D-Va., to hard-core opponent Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y. — told Al-Monitor that the May 25 hearing was the closest they'd heard the administration come to opposing the Iran Sanctions Act's reauthorization. "The awful attempts at non-answers just leave everyone wondering what their real motives and plans are," Zeldin said. Mull's job is implementation of the Iran deal, while any larger decisions about whether to support or oppose sanctions legislation lie squarely with the White House. He may have sought to avoid committing to a course of action that's ultimately outside his wheelhouse. In addition, some lawmakers have made no secret of trying to use the Iran Sanctions Act renewal, which will likely be a relatively easy sell in Congress, to tack on extra measures. Still, few seemed to buy Mull's apparent argument that the mere possibility of such an outcome should preclude him from supporting a clean reauthorization. "I don't think that's a valid concern," House Foreign Affairs member and nuclear deal opponent Brad Sherman, D-Calif., told Al-Monitor. "That's like saying you can't be in favor of apples because somebody may turn it into a pumpkin. If you're endorsing apples, you're not endorsing pumpkins." While there's broad agreement in Congress that the Obama administration may be uncomfortable with anti-Iran legislative activity post-deal, the conclusions drawn have a partisan tilt. Zeldin suspects the White House would like nothing more than to see the legislation expire. "The impression that I got was that the White House is playing a game where they want the Iran Sanctions Act to expire at the end of the year and then be able to blame Congress," he told Al-Monitor. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., shared similar concerns. "The continued reluctance to reauthorizing the Iran Sanctions Act is a prime example of how the White House’s Iran policy amounts to walking on eggshells," Royce told Al-Monitor in an emailed statement. "Extending this act is essential to keep the pressure on Iran and ensure that Congress, not the president, has the final say on sanctions relief.” Sherman by contrast believes the Obama administration would perhaps prefer that the bill's sanctions authorities endure, just without a noisy congressional debate that would surely upset Tehran. "If it somehow happened automatically, if there was a bill that said that any law passed on such-and-such a date shall last four more years, I don't know if they'd oppose it," Sherman said. "If it somehow just happened, they might be happy. But the idea of us actually passing it doesn't bring them great joy."

News article:
WASHINGTON (AP) — National Public Radio should consider avoiding grants such as one the Ploughshares Fund provided for coverage of the Iran nuclear agreement and related issues, the radio network’s ombudsman said. The White House recently identified Ploughshares as a group that helped sell the multinational deal to a skeptical public. The ombudsman’s report was published on NPR’s website last week, following an Associated Press story about a $100,000 grant Ploughshares gave the network last year. The money supported “national security reporting that emphasizes the themes of US nuclear weapons policy and budgets, Iran’s nuclear program, international nuclear security topics and US policy toward nuclear security,” according to Ploughshares’ 2015 annual report. Ploughshares also funded reporters and partnerships with other news outlets, according to its website. That raised questions about journalistic independence after Ben Rhodes, President Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser, described how the White House set up an “echo chamber” of organizations, experts and even friendly reporters to advocate for the deal that curtailed Iran’s nuclear activity and US-led economic sanctions on Tehran. Rhodes credited Ploughshares for its help in a New York Times magazine profile about him. NPR ombudsman Elizabeth Jensen said no coverage was skewed. “NPR did not accept money to report favorably on the Iran deal. There was no pay for play,” she wrote on May 27. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms But Jensen said breakdowns in procedures created a perception problem. She pointed to a March 2015 story on a nuclear conference hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, part of the Ploughshares-led coalition backing nuclear diplomacy with Iran. The piece, which did not disclose NPR’s relationship with Ploughshares, quoted two other experts whose organizations “received funding from Ploughshares to advocate for the deal or were working in that coalition.” Ploughshares’ president, Joseph Cirincione, also was interviewed. NPR is reviewing its disclosure safeguards, Jensen’s report said, but she suggested further action. Whereas Gates Foundation money funds an NPR education blog and the MacArthur Foundation supports international and investigative reporting, she called Ploughshares’ grant different. Advertisement “In this case, NPR’s money came from one side of a very partisan debate on a specific issue to fund reporting on a specific topic. And the money was not from a sponsor who in exchange would get on-air credit; in this case the sponsor money was going directly to support the reporting,” Jensen wrote. “In the case of grants such as the one from Ploughshares, which are intended to fund reporting on specific, highly controversial issues, my suggestion is that NPR consider not accepting them in the future if they contain such specific language.” Ploughshares started supporting NPR in 1984. It has done so regularly since 2005. Ploughshares annual reports show $700,000 in grants to NPR over the last decade. Jensen examined 254 on-air newsmagazine stories about the Iran deal since 2015. Almost half were “neutral,” about the negotiations or the agreement’s later implementation. The other stories featured 160 people speaking in favor of the accord and 102 against. NPR spoke twice each to Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a leading opponent, and many congressional critics. One such critic, Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., said he repeatedly asked NPR to be interviewed about the Iran deal last year, but to no avail. The network initially said it had no record of Pompeo’s requests. It later said it canceled a scheduled August interview with Pompeo. Jensen’s report said NPR canceled because it had too many other interviews booked. Later that week, NPR interviewed Sen. Chuck Schumer, the most prominent Democratic lawmaker to oppose the deal. Advertisement “That was by far the more important story, since the vast majority of Democrats supported the president in voting for the deal,” Jensen said. Outside groups of all stripes are increasingly giving money to news organizations for special projects or general news coverage. Most news organizations, including the AP, have strict rules governing whom they can accept money from and how to protect journalistic independence.

News article:
In his profile, Rhodes put the Ploughshares Fund at the center of the echo chamber constructed to sell the Iran deal: “We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else.” The Associated Press followed up with a detailed story, based on Ploughshares’ most recent annual report detailing funding of some 85 organizations and 200 individuals. That network included journalists and media outlets, think tanks, nuclear associations, and pro-Tehran lobbies, including the infamous National Iranian American Council (NIAC). Last year, NIAC was paid $281,211; over the past five years, more than $814,000. According to Trita Parsi, NIAC’s lifetime President: “What Ploughshares Fund has done by bringing these groups together — structuring a campaign and crafting a strategic vision — is unprecedented and that’s part of the reason these battles have been won.” In its annual report, Ploughshares boasted of contributing to “building the narrative across the country,” by “proactive media work by Ploughshares Fund grantees, partners and allies,” who published “nearly 1,400 pro-diplomacy op-eds, letters to the editor and editorials” during critical moments of the Iran campaign (June 2014-September 2015). Ben Rhodes’ “narrative” worked wonders for the Obama administration’s nuclear sales pitch but, like all schemes, it had a dark side yet to come to light. One aspect involves how information exposing the true scope of the Iranian secret nuclear weapons program was filtered. Anyone knowledgeable about human intelligence understands that obtaining such information entails huge risk. This was certainly the case in Iran, where the network of the National Council of Resistance of Iran(NCRI) and its biggest component, the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), provided the lion’s share of sensitive information, acting as the international community’s eyes and ears on the ground. Over the years, MEK operatives put their own lives and those of their families on the line to inform the world about Tehran’s most closely guarded secrets. In 2002, the NCRI revealed the Natanz and Arak secret sites, which triggered the inspections of the Iranian nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for the first time. NCRI disclosed the construction of the underground enrichment facility, Fordow, near Qom in December 2005. On numerous occasions, the U.S. Government conceded the Iranian opposition’s crucial role. On March 16, 2005, for instance, President Bush told reporters that “Iran has concealed its nuclear program that became discovered, not because of their compliance with the IAEA or NPT but because a dissident group pointed it out to the world.” Frank Pabian, a senior adviser on nuclear nonproliferation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, lauded the accuracy of the information provided by the NCRI, in an interview with the New York Times in 2010. “They’re right 90 percent of the time,” he said of the council’s disclosures about Iran’s clandestine sites. “That doesn’t mean they’re perfect, but 90 percent is a pretty good record.” New revelations followed, helping to corner Tehran and compel it to negotiate with the world community. In July 2011, the MEK revealed a new organization, SPND, formed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to consolidate all nuclear weapons activities. SPND and its detailed activities were reflected in the November report of the IAEA, and SPND was designated by the State Department in August 2014. But after mid-2013, when Hassan Rouhani became president of Iran, the theocratic government was ready to relinquish many of its nuclear ambitions, and negotiate in good faith with its traditional enemies in the West. The Rhodes narrative took off, and the administration became dismissive of the NCRI’s non-conforming information. Some cases are telling. 2014, intelligence surfaced about suspicious activities in a military site called Parchin, where high-explosive tests with exploding bridge wire were widely recognized as having potential applications to the detonation of a nuclear device. Those tests were carried out with the help of foreign nuclear experts, in a specially designed explosive chamber that subsequently disappeared. In Nov 2014, in a press conference in its Washington office, the NCRI revealed details about the explosive chambers in the early 2000s, including individuals and IRGC entities involved in their design, construction, set up, and testing. The critical revelation involved details establishing that two such chambers had been manufactured, not one. This revelation should have been vigorously investigated by the Obama administration’s experts; it never happened. On February 24, 2015, in a widely reported press conference, the NCRI revealed details of a site in Tehran where the regime conducted secret research involving advanced nuclear enrichment centrifuges. According to dissident operatives, the entrance to the plant, called Lavizan-3, was a series of tunnels leading from under a building ostensibly used to process passports and identity cards. In response to questions in a daily briefing, a State Department spokeswoman said, “We have seen these claims and we take all such reports seriously.” The next day, Secretary of State Kerry told members of the House of Representatives in a hearing, “I’m not going to go into greater detail. But these things are obviously going to have to be resolved as we go forward.” The next day, less than 48 hours after the revelation, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters, “We don’t have any information at this time to support the conclusion of the report.” No inspector ever visited the site, nor was any request ever made to do so. Instead, many now revealed as components of “the echo chamber” attacked the NCRI’s information on Lavizan-3 as having been fabricated to sabotage the nuclear agreement. Clearly the facts did not fit “the narrative.” And the talks went forward. In May 2015, the NCRI revealed new details on Iranian cooperation with North Korea on ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads. When questioned by reporters, the State Department reacted in standard form: “We have seen these claims and we take all such reports seriously.” Ultimately, despite growing evidence of nefarious conduct, the possible military dimensions of Iranian nuclear activities were glossed over in the final phase of negotiations. The Obama administration discarded non-conforming realities as nuisances. “The narrative” had to be maintained, whether or not the good people who wanted the world to know the truth of the Iranian nuclear program paid the ultimate price. For the ayatollahs, conceding to the nuclear agreement was a major retreat, albeit a temporary one. But if the true scope of their nuclear program had been exposed, and if Tehran had been held accountable for its lies and deceptions, that retreat would have been more profound and lasting. That would have made the world a safer place. So far as “the narrative” is concerned, the appropriate narrative should have been the one that aligns with reality, the one that the American people deserved to hear.

News article:
Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir urged Egypt Wednesday to convince its fellow Arab countries to enter into direct negotiations with Israel. “Egypt, a partner to the Camp David Accords, could play a significant role by encouraging our other neighbors to follow her example and enter into face-to-face talks with us without preconditions,” Shamir said after a meeting and working lunch with President Reagan at the White House. While both Reagan and Shamir, in their statements in front of the White House’s diplomatic entrance, stressed that peace can be achieved only through direct negotiations, the two leaders publicly stated their differences over an international conference. “Our goal now is setting in motion a process acceptable by Israel and its neighbors which can lead to a comprehensive settlement,” Reagan said. He said this requires “bilateral negotiations,” adding that any “reasonable” method of bringing about such negotiations should be explored, “including an international conference.” Shamir, however, said the “only viable cornerstone to peace” is the method used by Israel and Egypt in achieving the Camp David Accords. “We renew the call to our neighbors to join us in direct negotiations for the obtaining of peace between us,” he said. DIFFERENCES ON AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM The Israeli Premier was more direct Tuesday after his meeting at the State Department with Secretary of State George Shultz, when he called the idea of an international forum “a Soviet-inspired notion supported by radical Arab nations.” He said such a conference, demanded by King Hussein of Jordan, “will not bring peace to our area.” Shultz, admitting that the United States and Israel do not see “eye-to-eye” on this issue, said the U.S. believes that “all options” that could bring about direct negotiations should be explored, including an international conference. “Our objective is not an international conference, our objective is direct negotiations,” Shultz stressed. Shamir differs on this issue with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who believes an international conference may be the only way to bring Jordan into talks with Israel. A senior Administration official, briefing reporters Wednesday on Shamir’s talks with Shultz and Reagan, said that the U.S. is not trying to “play one side” in the Israeli government against the other. He said the U.S. deals with the national unity government, headed by Shamir, as it did when Peres was Peres was Premier. ‘REPRESENTATIVE PALESTINIANS’ MUST BE INCLUDED Both Reagan and Shultz stressed that any negotiations must include “representative Palestinians.” Shamir also agreed Tuesday that negotiations should include “representatives of Palestinians living in the area.” This apparently meant Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, rather than from outside. Reagan and Shamir also said they discussed the situation of Soviet Jewry. “We took note of recent releases, but are waiting to see the gates truly opened for Jewish emigration,” Reagan said. Shamir said Israel was “grateful” for Reagan’s efforts on behalf of “our brothers and sisters” in the USSR. He said the Soviet Union must continue to be pressed “to let all our people return to our ancient homeland, the land of Israel.” IRAN ISSUE DISCUSSED Iran was discussed by Shamir with both Reagan and Shultz. Reagan said it was agreed that Iran should be encouraged to end terrorism and the use of force. He added that it was also agreed that it was important to “look to the future instead of dwelling on the past.” Shamir said Tuesday that while Iran was a leading supporter of terrorism, it was an important country in the Mideast and indicated that ways should be found to exert “influence” on it. As for the U.S. sale of arms to Iran, Shultz said this was an American decision. The Administration official briefing reporters Wednesday said that Israel has agreed to cooperate with the various American investigations of the Iranian arms sales. OTHER ISSUES DISCUSSED Both Reagan and Shamir pointed to the U.S. decision to give Israel the status of a “major non-NATO ally,” which allows it to bid on Defense Department research and development contracts. Shamir called this a “new dimension to our relations.” Also discussed Tuesday and Wednesday was the Israeli economy and Israel’s agreement to allow the U.S. to build a relay station for the Voice of America in Israel. Not discussed, according to officials, was the case of Jonathan Pollard who was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to spying for Israel. When Shamir was asked about the Pollard case Tuesday, he called it “a very painful experience” for Israel and said spying on the U.S. was “not a policy of the Israeli government.” Shamir concluded his remarks to Reagan Wednesday by noting that this year was the 200th anniversary of the U.S. constitution and the 90th anniversary of the Zionist movement. “Both events have enriched the quality of our lives,” he said. “They are the roots of our present relationship, joint efforts, our dreams and our confidence in the future.”

News article:
The Cabinet called on Egypt today to continue the Jarring talks “in order to reach a peace agreement between the two states.” Contrary to some expectations, the Cabinet did not attach the condition that such talks be face-to-face, thus leaving Cairo free to continue the indirect procedure applied to date. But the policymakers stated unequivocally that Israel “will not” restore the pre-Six-Day War borders of June 4, 1967. The resolution issued by the Cabinet today followed a debate that had begun at a special meeting last Thursday. In the resolution, the Cabinet declared that “the government of Israel views favorably the expression of the readiness of the government of Egypt to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and expresses its own readiness for meaningful negotiations on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.” It was reported late last week that in its Feb. 15 aide memoire to United Nations negotiator Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, Cairo for the first time indicated a willingness to effect a peace “agreement”–but not a peace “treaty” with Israel. The Cabinet said today that “the government of Israel hopes for a positive response by Egypt and for progress in the negotiations.” The resolution remarked that “the Egyptian note demonstrates the concrete differences between Egypt’s positions and those of Israel, and particularly the substantial gap which exists on the issues of borders and refugees.” it noted in this connection that “Egypt demands total withdrawal to the armistice lines, while the position of Israel is…that it will be ready to discuss the withdrawal of armed forces towards secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in peace agreements.” The negotiations, the Cabinet stressed, “should not be subject to prior commitments on the outstanding issues,” But the key phrase in the Cabinet resolution was that Israel “views favorably…the readiness of…Egypt to enter into a peace agreement with Israel.” The question of what to say in the statement was thrashed out informally over the weekend by Premier Golda Meir, her senior Cabinet colleagues and Yitzhak Rabin, ambassador to the United States. Rabin, who arrived here Friday on urgent summons, reportedly conveyed to Mrs. Meir his distinct impression that if Israel rejected Egypt’s offer she would run the risk of losing American support. (At the airport on his arrival, Rabin told newsmen he was unaware of any special American pressure, but added: “It depends what you regard as pressure.”) ALLON, EBAN, SAPIR FAVOR ACCEPTING SADAT’S PROPOSAL; MRS. MEIR, GALILI OPPOSED It was understood that Mrs. Meir and her confidant, Minister Without-Portfolio Israel Galili, were against accepting Cairo’s offer, whereas Deputy Premier Yigal Allon, Foreign Minister Abba Eban and Finance Minister Pinhas Sapir favored acceptance. The current position of mercurial Defense Minister Moshe Dayan is not known for certain. But despite doubts about Egypt’s sincerity, the Israeli government welcomed its willingness to conclude a peace pact of some kind. A Foreign Ministry spokesman commented to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency today that Israel would never agree to restrict Jewish immigration, even if it meant the foundering of the peace talks. Egypt’s UN ambassador, Dr. Mohammed H. el Zayyat, was quoted in a New York daily last week as endorsing the sovereignty of a Jewish State of Israel if her government stopped the influx of Jews. The alleged remark gave rise to speculation that such a proposal was included in Cairo’s Feb. 15 message to Dr. Jarring. But Dr. Zayyat immediately told the JTA that the published story was “non-sense,” and reliable sources confirmed today that the Egyptian message made no mention of immigrants. Meanwhile, political circles in Jerusalem said Jordan would soon approve Dr. Jarring’s reported suggestion that Amman sign a peace accord with Israel after some territorial adjustments. And in another development, the Interparty Secretariat Against Withdrawal From Administered Territories–composed of Knesset members and professionals of all parties–urged the Meir administration to reject any demand for an unconditional pullback from the areas captured in the Six-Day War.

News article:
It was just before midnight on November 30, 1977, when Yossi Alpher, then a young Mossad officer celebrating his birthday, received an urgent phone call from the office of director Yitzhak Hofi, asking him to come immediately to Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv. “He said, ‘Sit down, I’m going to tell you something that will cause you not to sleep tonight,'” Alpher recalled in a recent conversation with The Times of Israel. “‘We want to send you to Egypt,’ Hofi continued in his typical dry, emotionless tone. ‘Get your affairs in order, by noon tomorrow I’m taking you to Begin.'” Just 11 days earlier, Egyptian president Anwar Sadat had dazzled Israel by landing at Ben Gurion Airport and spending three days meeting with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, visiting Yad Vashem, speaking at the Knesset, and praying at al-Aqsa Mosque. But no mechanism was put into place to sustain bilateral contact with Egypt following Sadat’s departure. At Hofi’s office, Alpher learned that Sadat had requested that an Israeli representative be placed at the American Embassy in Cairo, under cover as a diplomat. According to the plan, only the US ambassador would know that the new arrival was, in fact, working for Israel. “Hofi and I both smiled. We knew that, at that point in time, there were only two people in the Mossad who could pass as Americans, and the other was a bit loony,” recalled the Washington, DC native who emigrated to Israel as a 20-year-old in 1962. “Hofi laughed and said, ‘But you’re really the right guy for the job.'” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms After a sleepless night, Alpher and his wife met with an attorney to draw up a will and a power of attorney in case he never returned from his mission. “I’m headed for the biggest Arab country, still an enemy, and I have absolutely no idea for how long or what sort of contact I can possibly have with my family. I told my wife: ‘I hate to do this to you, but it’s for a good cause, for peace.” At noon, Alpher returned to Hofi’s office, only to hear him say, “Wait.” That word, he said, would characterize every day of the following week. “Finally he said, ‘You’re not going, Carter wouldn’t agree.'” Advertisement Although Alpher was not to travel to Egypt, the wheels of history could not be reversed. A few days later, Israeli TV reporter Ehud Yaari flew from Athens to Cairo on an Israeli passport and was let in, soon broadcasting footage from Egypt to an astounded Israeli public. On December 25, 1977, Begin reciprocated Sadat’s gesture and traveled to Ismailia, Egypt, holding a summit meeting with the Egyptian president. A diplomatic process was set in motion leading to the Camp David summit the following summer, and eventually to the signing of a historic peace treaty with Egypt in March 1979. “I told my wife: ‘I hate to do this to you, but it’s for a good cause. For peace'” “Had I gone, I would have been there for a week or two. There would have been no need for me, because soon you could go back and forth easily. But of course, at that point in time nobody knew,” Alpher said. So why did Carter, who would soon become the patron of the Camp David negotiations, refuse to allow the budding Egyptian-Israeli relations to take form in late 1977? The former US president did not respond to a request for clarification sent by The Times of Israel to the Carter Center in Atlanta. Hofi died last September at the age of 87. Alpher never spoke to Carter subsequently; nor did he discover why or how exactly the Sadat initiative was vetoed. But, soon transferred to the Iran desk at the Mossad, he is confident he knows what stood at the root of Carter’s opposition to the move. “Carter was on a trip of internationalizing the Arab-Israeli conflict, and doing this together with the Soviets, which is what Sadat didn’t want,” Alpher said. “Sadat was finished with the Soviets. He wanted this to be an American peace, because he wanted American money and American arms, which he eventually got.” Advertisement “It took over a month for the Carter administration to give any sort of blessing to the Sadat initiative, which was never coordinated with the Americans,” he added. “The Carter administration was astounded by it.” “The periphery helped usher in the peace with Egypt. Sadat knew we were in Iran; he sent his messages via the shah. He knew we were in Morocco; he sent his messages via the king” Sadat’s willingness to come to Israel did not come out of the blue, however, argues Alpher in his new book, Periphery: Israel’s Search for Middle East Allies (Rowman & Littlefield, 2015). It was facilitated through alliances forged by Israel with Morocco under King Hassan II and with Iran under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi years earlier. A meeting between Mossad director Hofi and King Hassan in the summer of 1976 led to a secret rendezvous between Hassan and prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, disguised in a blond wig to enter Morocco incognito. Rabin left Hassan a series of questions for Sadat regarding Egypt’s willingness to sign a treaty with Israel. Secret meetings followed between Israeli and Egyptian leaders: First Hofi met Sadat’s deputy Hassan Tohami; later Tohami met Moshe Dayan, then foreign minister in the Begin cabinet. Some of the interviewees in Alpher’s book, like former Israeli ambassador to Egypt Shimon Shamir, were skeptical of Israel’s Middle East periphery doctrine. By vying for alliances with distant countries, they argued, Israel was neglecting — or even impeding — realistic prospects of peace with its neighbors. But Alpher said his research found no evidence to that effect. “The periphery helped usher in the peace with Egypt. Sadat knew we were in Iran; he sent his messages via the shah. He knew we were in Morocco; he sent his messages via the king. He knew to turn to the periphery looking for an indirect address [to Israel] in the Middle East.” Ironically, Alpher noted, peace with Egypt also ended Israel’s reliance on the Middle Eastern periphery, which included both states (such as Sudan, Turkey, Ethiopia, Iran and Morocco) and ethnic minorities (such as the Kurds in Iraq or the Christian Maronites in Lebanon). “The minute you have peace with your neighbor, the biggest and most powerful Arab country, you don’t have the same need for the periphery that you had before,” he concluded. “Peace with an Arab country is a thousand times more important for Israel’s overall well-being than peace with a periphery country. Peace with Egypt was the beginning of the end of the periphery doctrine, and for good reason.”

News article:
Israel’s Foreign Minister Abba Eban said last night that there were two concrete issues that could be the starting point for peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt–Sharm el-Sheikh and the establishment of a balance of forces in the Middle East. But he said the responsibility for starting peace talks belonged to Egypt since it was that country that initiated the belligerency of 1967. Eban made his remarks in a 45-minute telephone interview with six senior French journalists which was broadcast by Inter-Paris, the most popular French radio network shortly before the main evening news broadcast. The interview was wide-ranging and included an admission by Eban that there have been unofficial contacts between Israel and the Soviet Union but that there could be no improvement in relations between the two countries as long as Moscow persisted in its anti-Israel policies. Eban also dismissed China as a “decisive factor in the Middle East” and observed that “the really important Nixon talks on the Middle East are not taking place in Peking” but “will be taking place soon in Moscow,” a reference to President Nixon’s summit visit to the Soviet capital this May. As far as the Middle East is concerned “there are only two powers which count, the United States and the Soviet Union,” Eban said. The Interview was the first appearance by a prominent Israeli statesman or public personality on the French radio in recent years. It seemed to indicate a change in form, if not in content, of French policy toward Israel. But the Israeli Foreign Minister was not optimistic about the future of Franco-Israeli relations and listed the serious obstacles in the way of improvement. POWER BALANCE THROUGH DEMILITARIZATION Eban said that peace talks with Egypt hinged on two “crucial” points. The balance of power, he said, could be advanced appreciably through demilitarization of the Sinai peninsula. “A lot depends on the Egyptians. If they show themselves supple and conciliatory an agreement on borders can also be arranged,” he said. He said, however, that Israel must retain permanent control of Sharm el-Sheikh in view of what happened in 1967. “We have told this to Egypt in the past and we shall continue to tell her so frankly,” Eban said. He said that Egypt now commands the necessary prestige to enable it to initiate peace talks and is recognized in this position by both the US and the Soviet Union. He said that Russia’s position is somewhat changed as Moscow now agrees that there can be no Israeli withdrawal without “a real peace being signed.” But the Soviet Union still blocks a solution by opposing “territorial negotiations,” he added. Eban said, “I would much prefer a change of Soviet policy without secret contacts than secret contacts and no change of Russian policy.” He said that China’s presence in the Middle East was mainly in the field of propaganda. OBSTACLES TO ISRAELI-FRANCO AMITY Referring to Israel’s problems with France, Eban said he was a “realist,” and that while the friction point of the Mirage dispute has now been solved, there are still two major obstacles in the way of improved Franco-Israeli relations. One is France’s refusal to agree to Israel’s request to come to an agreement with the European Common Market which would safeguard its exports to Europe. The other is that France is the only West European country that has expressly stated that Israel should “evacuate all the occupied territories.” According to Eban, “Such a prerequisite cuts off the venue to all possible compromise solutions and this actually prevents a start to negotiations.” Asked about the Palestinian problem, Eban said that “had to be settled by the Arabs themselves.” He observed that “as far as Israel is concerned, we would be glad to live alongside a Palestinian state but this is for them to decide, not for us.” Eban claimed that the Soviet Union “has decided to allow Jewish emigration for two reasons: because it has come to realize that it cannot smother by force their Jewishness and because of the intensity of protests throughout the world’s progressive circles about this issue.”

News article:
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan blamed Egypt last night for the current impasse in peace talks with Israel and said his country preferred direct negotiations and practical discussions of mutual proposals with the Egyptians to the present contacts through an American intermediary. Addressing the 29th World Zionist Congress, Dayan claimed there are no direct negotiations with Egypt now because the Egyptians do not want or cannot conduct such negotiations without the participation of Jordan and other Arab countries. He also accused Cairo of toughening its stand and backing away from original positions. He said the current negotiations through American mediation was contrary to the understanding reached by Premier Menachem Begin and President Anwar Sadat at their Christmas Day meeting in Ismailia last year. According to Dayan, the Egyptians promised then to present counter-proposals to Israel’s peace plan for Sinai and the West Bank, but so far they have not done so. “It is hard to tell whether the Egyptians believed at the beginning of negotiations that they would eventually reach a separate agreement with Israel,” Dayan said. At the moment, he told the Congress delegates, negotiations are concentrated on the Palestinian issue and the future of the West Bank and there is no discussion of bilateral matters between the two countries. Dayan said Israel did not object to President Carter’s Jan. 4 Aswan formula that called for Palestinian Arab participation in determining their own future. “Israel is willing to sit with them and to discuss with them their future,” Dayan said. He claimed, however, that “it is quite obvious that when they speak of their future they mean that they will determine our future.” He said Israel would never allow the Palestinian Arabs to determine the future of its settlements in the occupied Arab territories.

News article:
Premier Menachem Begin said today that he would reply early next week to a letter from President Anwar Sadat of Egypt delivered this morning by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alfred L. Atherton. The contents of the four-page letter were not disclosed but it was reportedly written in a friendly tone and concerned the current efforts to draft a joint declaration of principles by Israel and Egypt. The letter was the first personal contact between Sadat and Begin since their Christmas Day meeting at Ismailia and led to speculation that it might lead to another meeting between the two men. But Begin, after conferring with Atherton this morning, said only that there was still a basis for continuing the present negotiations. Atherton, who arrived here unexpectedly from Cairo last night, also met with Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and was to meet with Attorney General Aharon Barak later today. He is scheduled to go to Amman Friday, presumably for another attempt to persuade Jordan to enter the Israeli-Egyptian peace process. Atherton is expected to return to Cairo next Tuesday with Begin’s reply to Sadat. Begin and other Israelis have expressed hope in recent days that direct peace talks would be resumed with Egypt instead of the indirect contacts maintained with Atherton as intermediary. But Egyptian Foreign Minister Ibrahim Kaamel observed yesterday that the next move did not depend on Israel or Egypt but on the Americans.

Premier Menachem Begin has written a personal letter to President Anwar Sadat of Egypt in reply to the letter he received from Sadat last Thursday. It was delivered to a U.S. Embassy official this evening, presumably to be telexed to Assistant Secretary of State Alfred L. Atherton who flew from Amman, Jordan, to Cairo tonight and is due to meet with Sadat tomorrow. The content of the Begin-Sadat exchange has been kept secret. Begin told newsmen, however, that the “spirit” of the letters shows that both sides want to renew direct contacts “within the framework of the political and military committees.” Begin reportedly drafted his letter after consultations with several senior Cabinet ministers. It was discussed at today’s Cabinet meeting where the ministers reportedly reached certain “conclusions” after a political discussion that lasted over two hours. The “conclusions” were not disclosed. Begin told reporter afterwards that he wanted President Carter, with whom he meets in Washington next week, to be the first to hear of these “conclusions.” He said, however, that they did not mean Israel was changing the terms of its original peace proposals for Sinai and the West Bank “for the present.” Cabinet Secretary Arye Naor said no votes were taken at today’s session, indicating that no controversial issues were brought up. Atherton is expected back in Israel on Tuesday. It is expected to be his last visit in the current round of shuttle diplomacy before he returns to Washington for the Carter-Begin meetings.

News article:
An Israeli official has met in Cairo with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, marking the first time the two sides have held talks since the Feb. 25 murders of Palestinian worshipers in Hebron. An official close to Rabin confirmed that the secret talks were held Monday in the Egyptian capital in an effort to salvage the Israeli-PLO negotiations, which the Palestinians broke off abruptly after an Israeli settler killed more than 40 Palestinians at morning prayers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. Jacques Neriah, an adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, presented Arafat with new proposals for security arrangements in the territories in light of the Hebron killings. PLO sources in Tunis told Israel Radio on Monday they expect an Israeli minister to meet with Arafat within a day or two. But Israel Radio also reported that Arafat, following a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amre Moussa, reiterated that the PLO will not resume talks with Israel until the U.N. Security Council issues a condemnation of the Hebron murders. At the United Nations, Israeli sources said the resolution remains stalled over the Palestinian insistence that the resolution be specifically worded to call for an armed international presence in the territories. The sources said the Palestinians are also demanding that Jerusalem be specifically mentioned in reference to the territories. The United States, which has veto power over any Security Council resolution, is supporting Israeli opposition to these two points. Rabin is meanwhile standing firm against the PLO demand for an armed international force in the territories to protect Palestinians living there. Speaking at Hebrew University on Monday, Rabin said he believes an armed presence in the territories would run counter to agreements already negotiated with the PLO and would cast doubt on any agreements reached with them in the future. The self-rule accord signed last September includes a provision for the placement of international observers in the territories, but not for an armed presence. In the wake of the Feb. 25 killings of Palestinians at a Hebron mosque, the PLO has repeatedly called for an armed international presence in the territories. The PLO has also called for the removal of settlements in Hebron and for the disarming of all settlers throughout the territories. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Monday that Israel would agree to the temporary presence of observers in the territories, from nations that have offered financial assistance to the future Palestinian autonomous area. Peres also said time was of the essence to reach agreement with the PLO. He said the biggest contribution to changing the current climate of tension and mistrust would be implementation of the self-rule accord. “Instead of opening the agreement, let’s realize it, and then all of us will see we do not have an agreement about a piece of paper but we do have an agreement about a new reality,” Peres told the Knesset. Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab who is an adviser to Arafat, disagreed that the PLO demands violate the agreement between the two sides. “President Arafat and the PLO leadership (are) committed to the peace process,” Tibi said in remarks Monday at Hebrew University. “We are not talking about opening agreements. We are talking about new circumstances that were created after the massacre,” he said. He argued that the most important issue is the security of the Palestinians and said this should be solved as soon as possible if the two sides are to return to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported that PLO official Nabil Sha’ath announced that Britain and Norway are ready to participate in an international observer force stationed in the territories under U.N. auspices.

News article:
Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Ali ended his three-day visit to Israel today without having settled the differences between Israel and Egypt over the Sinai border. The timing and itinerary of President Hosni Mubarak’s projected visit to Israel also remained undecided. Nevertheless, both countries are determined to resolve their differences through amicable negotiations by the time Israel completes its withdrawal from Sinai on April 25. That was the message conveyed by Hassan Ali and Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon at a joint press conference before the Egyptian delegation left for Cairo at noon today. Hassan Ali and Sharon will meet again within 2-3 weeks in Cairo for another session of the Israel-Egyptian Joint High Commission on normalization of relations. In the interim, the two governments will consider the compromise proposals put forward by each side during Hassan Ali’s meetings with top Israeli officials here this week. Sharon and the Egyptian visitor stressed that the border problems were “technical.” The most serious dispute concerns the location of the boundary line in the Taba region near Eilot. It involves a coastal strip of less than one kilometer on which an Israeli-built resort hotel is located. Sources on both sides predicted that some form of functional arrangement would be worked out whereby the Israelis would be able to continue to operate the hotel while Egypt exercised its soverignty over the area. The other disputed border points involve even less territory, in some cases only a few yards. MUBARAK’S VISIT TO BE DECIDED IN FUTURE TALKS Hassan Ali had little to say about Mubarak’s plans to visit Israel. The Egyptian President has refused to go to Jerusalem and the Israeli government has said in that case he would not be welcome. The Egyptian Foreign Minister said he had conveyed to Premier Menachem Begin an oral message from Mubarak reiterating his desire to visit Israel and that Begin, for his part, had “re-extended” the invitation. Hassan Ali said the timing of the visit and the issue of whether Mubarak would include Jerusalem on his itinerary would be decided in future discussions. The Egyptian official said it was inconceivable that these disputes could lead to “a standstill” after both countries, through courage and perseverance, had overcome many much more serious problems. Sharon agreed that there was no cause for anxiety over the future state of relations between Israel and Egypt.

News article:
Four days before Israeli elections, regional leaders met with US secretary of state John Kerry in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss the Palestinian situation and Israeli-Palestinian peace. King Abdullah II of Jordan, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, and Kerry were all there to attend a major Egyptian investment summit, hosted by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. On the sidelines of the conference, however, the four men considered how to stabilize the Palestinian economy and plotted moving the peace process forward with the next Israeli government. The electoral victory of Likud, and the continuation of Benjamin Netanyahu’s premiership, puts a damper on any peace plans—especially following the Israeli leader’s campaign promise to block the emergence of a Palestinian state. On numerous occasions, the last Israeli government spoke of its quiet cooperation with Egypt and other Arab states on issues of mutual interest: from countering salafi-jihadism to keeping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Israeli leaders pointed out that all this was happening despite a stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and contended that such under-the-table relations can thrive without efforts to solve the Palestinian issue. From the Israeli perspective, the Palestinians are simply no longer a regional priority. A recent visit to Cairo suggests Egyptian officials see things differently. Egypt needs Israel’s next government to move forward on the peace process; and President el-Sisi is open to creative ways to achieve the two-state solution. Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation is closer than it has ever been as the two neighbors grapple with threats from jihadis in the Sinai Peninsula and concerns about the Gaza Strip’s Hamas rulers. Mutual interests on their shared border mean little is likely to change in security ties, but no movement on the peace process will increase tensions on diplomatic fronts and widen disagreements even where interests overlap: such as Gaza. Egypt’s rhetorical demands for Palestinian rights build from its historical, ethnic, and religious ties to the Palestinian people and the disputed land — especially Jerusalem. However, as one Egyptian official noted, peace between Israel and the Palestinians is also in Egypt’s self-interest for internal and regional stability. President el-Sisi previously linked the Palestinian conflict to radicalism in the Middle East. The Egyptian official was more direct: Egypt’s enemies, from Iran to extremist groups, use the Palestinian issue to undermine Egypt by attacking its Peace Treaty and security cooperation with Israel. Advertisement Interesting in the current context is that Egypt’s concern about the next Israeli-Palestinian flare-up centers on the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank and on Jerusalem: not on Gaza, which borders Egypt The humanitarian situation in Gaza is terrible, but Egyptian officials have limited concern about public backlash for its policies toward the Strip. For the most part, this stems from the negative image Egyptians have of Hamas: an outgrowth of the group’s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian government’s insistence on Hamas involvement in attacks in the Sinai Peninsula and Egypt’s mainland. This shows that, as much as Egyptian officials describe the need to consider public opinion in its relations with Israel, public opinion can be shaped by the government and a sympathetic media. If Egypt is serious about needing a peace push, its government has a number of inducements to encourage the next Israeli government to move forward. Advertisement Despite close ties, el-Sisi has not returned Egypt’s ambassador to Tel Aviv. The diplomat was recalled during the 2012 Gaza conflict, and he will continue to work from Cairo until there is progress on the peace process. Because there is value to Israel in the appearance of normal relations with any of its neighbors, the Egyptian government could publicly link its ambassador’s return with the resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinians. At the conclusion of talks, or to get past major hurdles in the process, Egypt also holds a major trump card: Ouda Tarabin. The Bedouin citizen of Israel is nearing the end of a 15-year Egyptian sentence for spying for Israel — a charge Israel and he deny, and one he never had the opportunity to challenge in court. Israel’s efforts to free its citizens imprisoned and captured abroad are well known; and Tarabin’s release is a major priority for Israel in its bilateral relations with Egypt. Deporting Tarabin could induce difficult concessions from Israel; but his value is time-limited, as he completes his sentence later this year. Despite a number of other priorities and pressing matters, it is clear that el-Sisi is interested in a peace push. In October 2014 remarks to a gathering of Gaza donors, the Egyptian president delivered a message meant for the Israeli people: “It is high time to end conflict without delay and to give others their rights to establish justice so that prosperity and security could be achieved.” The vision put forward by el-Sisi is a settlement based on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which is considered a non-starter for many Israelis. El-Sisi speaks of 1967 lines, a shared Jerusalem, and a just settlement to the Palestinian refugee issue. Netanyahu and his prospective coalition partners reject all of the API’s concessions. For Cairo, then, the next Israeli government will not be a “serious partner” in achieving peace. The Egyptian government is likely to focus its efforts on reaching intra-Palestinian reconciliation, strengthening the Palestinian Authority, and keeping the Israeli-Palestinian conflict quiet. From Egypt’s perspective, though, even when the situation is quiet the possibility of an escalation puts it in a delicate position. Above all, Egyptian president el-Sisi wants internal and regional stability. As he sees it, the stability he demands cannot be achieved as long as the Palestinian problem remains.

News article:
Ambassador Abba Eban, addressing the United Nations Security Council today, said that the Israel Government “is prepared to give an assurance that if no hostile act is carried out by Egypt against Israel, then no hostile act of any kind will be carried out by Israel against Egypt.” He spoke at the session called to resume discussion of the Gaza incident and the tension prevailing on the Egyptian-Israel frontier. “Will the Government of Egypt join us in a declaration of fidelity to the provisions of the United Nations Charter calling upon us to settle all disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any state#” Mr. Eban challenged. “The acceptance of such a code of Egyptian-Israel relationships would not take us beyond our existing commitments under the armistice agreement and the Charter of the United Nations,” he said. “These are all things that we have agreed to do already. But under the burden of belligerent doctrines the pacific obligations which we have undertaken have become lost to sight; and the insidious fallacy of a state of war has spread its contagion both in the theory and the practice of our relationships. If the Government of Egypt, through its delegation, is able at any stage to give affirmative answer to these questions, my government would make wholehearted response.” EGYPTIAN VIOLATIONS OF ARMISTICE CITED BY EBAN AT SECURITY COUNCIL Pointing out that “at no time since the signature of the armistice agreement has the pressure of Egyptian hostility been exerted upon Israel with such provocative intensity as during the past six months, “Ambassador Eban drew the attention of the Security Council to the fact that the tensions of the Egyptian-Israel frontier “are revealed with deep gravity” in the reports presented to the Council by Maj. Gen. E. L. M. Burns, United Nations truce chief. Mr. Eban cited a number of Egyptian violations of the armistice agreement in recent months. “If we were to follow up all such cases,” he said, “the preponderance of Egyptian violations would be greater than the 3 to 1 ratio appearing in Egypt’s disfavor in the Mixed Armistice Commission records over recent months. The Mixed Armistice Commission in the period between August 1, 1954 and March 7, 1955 has found Egypt guilty of violating the armistice on no less than forty occasions.” Ambassador Eban pointed out that according to the official transcript of the meeting of the Special Committee of the Egyptian-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission on the Gaza incident, held on March 11, 1955, the chairman addressed the parties as follows: “I think all of us realize that this did not arise out of a blue sky, and certainly no report or evidence before the Security Council by any responsible party would give that impression. The head of the Israel delegation emphasized that “the report to the Security Council by General Burns conveys the astonishing assertion by Egyptian authorities that ‘persons committing murders and sabotage (in Israel) were being inspired, paid and equipped by political elements in Egypt inimical to the government and desirous of aggravating the border situation.’ Whatever the truth of the explanation, the murders and sabotage thus candidly avowed emanated from Gaza headquarters, for whose activities the Egyptian Government is responsible.” Mr. Eban stressed. CALLS EGYPT’S REQUEST FOR NEGEV AN “INSOLENT TERRITORIAL CLAIM” Ambassador Eban revealed that the Governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom have also “considered the problem serious enough to warrant the use of their good offices within recent months.” He said that the Government of Israel received information from each of those two governments, as well as from the Government of Turkey, during the period between October 1954 and February 1955, concerning the representations which they had made in Cairo in support of the appeals of the Mixed Armistice Commission calling for the cessation of assaults and sabotage against Israel from the Gaza strip.” Quoting a number of threats against Israel voiced by Egyptian leaders, Ambassador Eban referred to the “insolent territorial claim” to the Negev put forward this week by Major Salah Salem, Egyptian Minister for National Guidance, who thereby “revealed the underlying purpose of Egyptian harassment in the Negev. The object is to impede the development of the Negev in order to bring about its annexation to Egypt.” “Is there a single precedent in contemporary international life for a state openly to assert a claim to half the territory of its smaller neighbor, to launch dozens of assaults upon it against severe international condemnation, and, on the first occasion when it provokes resistance, to run for protection to the very Security Council whose authority it had repudiated a few weeks before#” Mr. Eban asked. Concluding, Ambassador Eban said: “My delegation feels justified in seeking a condemnation by the Security Council of the Egyptian incursions, murders, demolitions and sabotage activities described in Ceneral Burns’ report as ‘a main cause of present tension’ and in the Mixed Armistice Commission resolutions as ‘repeated aggressive acts by Egypt against Israel.’ “We seek confirmation of the Security Council’s view that the claim or practice of active belligerency by land and sea is inconsistent with the Armistice Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations. We urge a reassertion by the parties of their obligations to each other in terms of non-belligerency, pacific settlement and respect for political independence and territorial integrity; and we await the Egyptian reply to this proposal. “We advocate, after six years of armistice, a serious effort to make a transition towards permanent peace. To any attempt at stabilization and pacification our government will lend its full support.” Before the Council adjourned without setting the date of its next meeting, Egypt’s Omar Loutfi answered Ambassador Eban, but instead of referring to the Israel delegate’s peace challenge accused Israel again of “flagrant, brutal” aggression. Then Dr. Loutfi made what seemed to many observers here a tactical error by shifting his attack to Gen. Burns, alleging that Gen. Burns in his report went “far beyond the framework of urgent considerations concerning the aggression against Gaza.” Both Dr. Loutfi and Mr. Eban addressed a number of questions to Gen. Burns in an effort to strengthen their cases. The Israel delegate elicited the information that Egypt has been gravely condemned by the Mixed Armistice Commission at least twice since the Gaza incident.

News article:
Israel expressed confidence Sunday that the Egyptian government will do everything possible to find and punish the terrorists who fatally shot an Israeli woman and wounded three other Israelis in a car ambush outside the Cairo International Trade Fair last Wednesday night. The victims were Israeli Embassy staff members in Cairo. A statement issued by Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir after Sunday’s Cabinet meeting said he was satisfied with the way the Egyptian authorities are handling the case and the wide coverage it has gotten in the Egyptian media. Israel’s Minister of Tourism, Avraham Sharir, who was on an official visit to Cairo when the attack occurred, returned home Thursday night with a personal message from President Hosni Mubarak pledging to press the investigation into the attack and track down the assailants. The plane that flew Sharir from Cairo also carried the body of Etti Tal-Or, 24, who was killed by the ambushers. She was the wife of an Embassy official. She was buried Friday at a cemetery in Beersheba, her home city, where Shamir delivered a eulogy. Her three companions who were flown to Israel immediately after the attack were reported in stable condition after surgery at Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer. Vascular surgery was performed on Savid Zruya, who was struck by bullets in his chest and left thigh. Esther Yefet, 26, was hit in her jaw, left shoulder and wrist. Uri Ziv, 31, suffered wounds in both hands. Both underwent lengthy surgery. 40,000 CAIRENES VISITED ISRAELI PAVILION The four young Israelis had been staffing the Israel pavilion at the Trade Fair. The pavilion manager, Yossi Peri, reported that in the two weeks it was open prior to the attack, the Israeli exhibits were visited by about 40,000 Cairenes who eagerly picked up pamphlets and brochures promoting Israeli industrial and agricultural technology. Peri said that millions of dollars worth of orders were placed with Israeli firms during the fair. The attack Wednesday night was the third on Israeli Embassy personnel in the Egyptian capital and the second to cause fatalities. Last August, Albert Atrakchi, an administrative attache, was killed in his car in the Maadi quarter of Cairo. In June, 1984, another Embassy official, Zvi kedar, was wounded by gunmen but survived. A group calling itself “Egypt’s Revolution” claimed credit for those shootings and for Wednesday night’s ambush killing. There have also been at least two sabotage attempts, one against the Embassy in Cairo and the other aimed at the Israel Consulate in Alexandria.

News article:
Premier Yitzhak Shamir sent a message of warm greetings today to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty. Shamir expressed his hope for “development” of the relations between the two countries and also expressed his confidence that the treaty would be a “cornerstone” for broader Middle East peace. Shamir’s aides said his message was especially significant because it follows some harsh statements by the Premier accusing Egypt of failure to abide by the spirit of the peace treaty in its cool relations with Israel. Meanwhile, Abba Eban, the Labor Party’s foreign affairs spokesman, is scheduled to visit Egypt next week at the invitation of top government figures there. Eban expects to meet with Mubarak. This would be a relatively rare dialogue between a leading Israeli personality (albeit from the opposition) and the Egyptian leader. Just back from Egypt on a private business visit, Haim Zadok, a Justice minister in the former Labor government, told reporters that the Egyptians are presently occupied with their own elections to be held in May. But, he said, they are clearly interested in promoting ties with Israel’s Labor movement. Zadok met with former Premier Mustafa Khalil and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Butros Ghali.

Premier Menachem Begin informed the Knesset today of the agreements he reached with President Anwar Sadat during his two-day visit to Cairo this week the main points are the exchange of letters of notification between Israel and Egypt which will put their peace treaty formally into effect, the proclamation of open borders and the establishment of civilian air corridors between the two countries, and the installation of a direct telephone line between Begin and Sadat. The latter will become operative as of next Wednesday morning, Begin told the Knesset, “so that we can tell each other what we like whenever we want.” Technicians began work today on the Israeli end of the telephone link in the Prime Minister’s Office. Begin and Sadat are expected to open it with a brief conversation Wednesday. CHANGE OF VENUE FOR DOCUMENTS EXCHANGE With respect to the exchange of ratification documents, Begin said today that it will be done early next week at Umm Khashiba, on American-manned early warning station in Sinai. for This represents a significant change of plans, for Begin had told the press in Cairo yesterday that Egypt’s Acting Foreign Minister Boutros Ghali would fly to Israel next week with a ratified copy of the peace Lrealy while Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan would take the Israeli copy to Cairo. The Egyptians apparently were reluctant to have Ghali go to Jerusalem with the document because It would imply that Egypt recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Begin confirmed that he and Sadat agreed to proclaim open borders and establish air corridors on May 27, a day after FI Arish is returned to Egyptian sovereignty. The two leaders will symbolize the inauguration of free movement between their nations when Begin flies to EI Arish to meet with Sadat and then returns with him to Beersheba. Defense Minister Ezer Weizman will go to Cairo next week, accompanied by senior Israeli military officers, for talks with his Egyptian counterpart, Defense Minister Kamal Has san Ali. The Israeli-Egyptian joint political and military committees will begin their meetings next month, alternating between EI Arish and Beersheba. Begin likened this timetable to the counting of the Omer, the 49 days between Passover and Shavuot. “We have concluded the counting of the Omer in building peace,” he told the Knesset. He warned, however, “There still stands before us very difficult and serious problems…There will be differences of opinion between us and Egypt. They say so and so do we But there is no reason to repeat this fact, “Begin said. He said “My visit to Cairo surpassed all expectations.” The Knesset adjourned after today’s session for the Passover holidays. Begin’s speech was well received except for minor interruptions from Herut hardliner Geula Cohen and Toufik Toubl of the Rakah Communist faction. Some MKs had lavish praise for the Prime Minister. But Yigal Allon, speaking for the opposition Labor Party, said he was suspicious of the autonomy plan for the West Bank and Gaza Strip and reiterated Labor’s view that negotiations over the West Bank must be conducted with Jordan. MINISTERS EXUDE OPTIMISM The Knesset session followed a 20-minute Cabinet meeting this morning at which Begin briefed the ministers on his Cairo visit. No details were disclosed but most of the ministers seemed optimistic as they left the Cabinet room. It was learned that learned each ministry will draft working papers in the next few days affecting various aspects of the normalization of relations with Egypt. Justice Minister Shimuel Tamir said he has already issued instructions for legal measures to change the status of Egypt from that of on enemy state to a friendly neighbor. He said new legislation would be introduced if necessary.

Key Information/Sub-event: The image shows a man, representing Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, riding a camel and smoking a pipe. The camel is walking towards a group of people, representing Arab leaders, who are standing on a hilltop and looking in the opposite direction. The man is holding a branch with a dove perched on it, symbolizing peace. The Arab leaders are wearing traditional Arab headdresses and robes and carrying bags of money, symbolizing their oil wealth. In the background, there is a large sign that says "Arab Baghdad Summit."
News Event Perspective: The image provides a satirical perspective on the Camp David Accords and the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. The cartoonist is suggesting that the Arab leaders are not interested in making peace with Israel and that they are only interested in their own self-interests. The image also suggests that Begin is naive to think that he can achieve peace with the Arab leaders.

News article:
Premier Menachem Begin informed the Knesset today of the agreements he reached with President Anwar Sadat during his two-day visit to Cairo this week the main points are the exchange of letters of notification between Israel and Egypt which will put their peace treaty formally into effect, the proclamation of open borders and the establishment of civilian air corridors between the two countries, and the installation of a direct telephone line between Begin and Sadat. The latter will become operative as of next Wednesday morning, Begin told the Knesset, “so that we can tell each other what we like whenever we want.” Technicians began work today on the Israeli end of the telephone link in the Prime Minister’s Office. Begin and Sadat are expected to open it with a brief conversation Wednesday. CHANGE OF VENUE FOR DOCUMENTS EXCHANGE With respect to the exchange of ratification documents, Begin said today that it will be done early next week at Umm Khashiba, on American-manned early warning station in Sinai. for This represents a significant change of plans, for Begin had told the press in Cairo yesterday that Egypt’s Acting Foreign Minister Boutros Ghali would fly to Israel next week with a ratified copy of the peace Lrealy while Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan would take the Israeli copy to Cairo. The Egyptians apparently were reluctant to have Ghali go to Jerusalem with the document because It would imply that Egypt recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Begin confirmed that he and Sadat agreed to proclaim open borders and establish air corridors on May 27, a day after FI Arish is returned to Egyptian sovereignty. The two leaders will symbolize the inauguration of free movement between their nations when Begin flies to EI Arish to meet with Sadat and then returns with him to Beersheba. Defense Minister Ezer Weizman will go to Cairo next week, accompanied by senior Israeli military officers, for talks with his Egyptian counterpart, Defense Minister Kamal Has san Ali. The Israeli-Egyptian joint political and military committees will begin their meetings next month, alternating between EI Arish and Beersheba. Begin likened this timetable to the counting of the Omer, the 49 days between Passover and Shavuot. “We have concluded the counting of the Omer in building peace,” he told the Knesset. He warned, however, “There still stands before us very difficult and serious problems…There will be differences of opinion between us and Egypt. They say so and so do we But there is no reason to repeat this fact, “Begin said. He said “My visit to Cairo surpassed all expectations.” The Knesset adjourned after today’s session for the Passover holidays. Begin’s speech was well received except for minor interruptions from Herut hardliner Geula Cohen and Toufik Toubl of the Rakah Communist faction. Some MKs had lavish praise for the Prime Minister. But Yigal Allon, speaking for the opposition Labor Party, said he was suspicious of the autonomy plan for the West Bank and Gaza Strip and reiterated Labor’s view that negotiations over the West Bank must be conducted with Jordan. MINISTERS EXUDE OPTIMISM The Knesset session followed a 20-minute Cabinet meeting this morning at which Begin briefed the ministers on his Cairo visit. No details were disclosed but most of the ministers seemed optimistic as they left the Cabinet room. It was learned that learned each ministry will draft working papers in the next few days affecting various aspects of the normalization of relations with Egypt. Justice Minister Shimuel Tamir said he has already issued instructions for legal measures to change the status of Egypt from that of on enemy state to a friendly neighbor. He said new legislation would be introduced if necessary.

News article:
Foreign Ministry officials said today that the forthcoming visit to Israel of Joseph Sisco, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and his visit to Cairo and other Arab capitals, is welcomed by Israel. No American diplomat of Mr. Sisco’s rank has visited Egypt since Cairo severed diplomatic relations with the U.S. during the June, 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Officials here said Mr. Sisco’s visit would enable him to see and compare the stands of Israel and Egypt on Middle East peace and make it clear to him that Israel wants peace while the Arabs do not. Foreign Minister Abba Eban informed the Cabinet today of Mr. Sisco’s impending visit. Foreign Ministry officials said they have not yet been informed of the exact date of Mr. Sisco’s arrival, accompanied by his assistant, Alfred Atherton. Consequently no schedule has been prepared. They said Israel was informed by the U.S. that Mr. Sisco’s visit was an “orientation tour” of the Middle East in connection with meetings to take place later at Teheran, Iran. He will stop over at London and Paris on his way to the Mideast. The U.S. State Department disclosed in Washington last week that Mr. Sisco was going to Teheran for routine consultations with the chief of the U.S. Mission in the Mideast. Department spokesman Robert J. McCloskey said at the time that while there were no definite plans to visit other countries in the region a stop-over in Egypt was emphatically ruled out. (Diplomatic sources in Cairo said over the week-end that Mr. Sisco was due there next Friday for talks with Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad and possibly with President Gamal Abdel Nasser. He is also scheduled to visit Amman and Beirut. According to Washington sources, a Sisco meeting with Egyptian leaders would represent a new departure for the Nixon Administration since the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Cairo.) Mr. Sisco, a career diplomat, visited Israel in the summer of 1968 when he accompanied George Ball, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. In the last few weeks Mr. Sisco has had several meetings with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly E. Dobrynin in what some Washington observers have termed the renewal of bilateral talks but which others have viewed as preparatory talks for the resumption of bilateral negotiations.

News article:
Premier Menachem Begin says that Israel will honor its peace treaty commitment to withdraw from Sinai by the April 25 deadline. But his remarks, in interviews published in Maariv and Yediot Achronot today, appeared to be less than an unqualified assurance that the withdrawal would take place on schedule. According to the interviews, Begin spoke of “certain problems” which have arisen with Egypt. He said “there will be no problem” if they can be resolved satisfactorily by April 25. He added, however, “If we do not achieve full satisfaction, we shall have to consider the situation.” This morning, Begin received a delegation of the “young guard” of his Herut faction who presented him with a petition calling on the government to consider delaying the withdrawal. The petition was signed by about 750 of the 900 delegates to the Herut “young guard” convention yesterday at which Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and Deputy Premier David Levy delivered hard-line speeches hinting at a delay unless alleged Egyptian treaty violations are rectified. A delegation spokesman said later that Begin had promised the group that he would raise the withdrawal issue at next Sunday’s Cabinet meeting. He reminded them, however, that there was a binding Knesset decision approving the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt which requires Israel to be out of Sinai by April 25. He also reportedly told the Herut militants that Israel’s complaints against Egypt, while serious, should not be exaggerated. The Premier’s newspaper interviews were far more moderate than the speeches by Shamir, Sharon and Levy. Begin said he had not read the remarks by those ministers and that “no such decision” (to delay the withdrawal) has been taken by the Cabinet. HARDLINE VIEWS ADVANCED Shamir told the Herut convention yesterday that the Camp David accords must “obligate all sides if they are to retain any validity.” Sharon vowed that Israel would not make the slightest concessions with regard to the peace treaty violations attributed to Egypt. Levy declared, “If the withdrawal has to be postponed, then let it be postponed.” Other Herut MKs took an even harder line. Yosef Rom, a member of the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, who visited the Yamit region of northern Sinai yesterday, told members of the movement to stop the withdrawal that he had “recommended to the government that it delay the withdrawal for a month” because of Egypt’s behavior. He was warmly applauded. MK Yigal Cohen-Orgad, meanwhile, is trying to rally a caucus of Likud MKs who oppose the peace treaty to pressure the government to consider a postponement. But another Likud MK, Ehud Olmert, told reporters today that this caucus represented a small fraction of the Likud Knesset faction. The majority, he said, firmly believed that the political damage Israel would suffer if it delayed its pull-out from Sinai would for outweigh any benefits. Some observers here have expressed anxiety over the anti-withdrawal “momentum” gathering force among rightwing politicians not previously sympathetic to the Gush Emunim militants attempting to block withdrawal. They said intense American diplomatic involvement would be required to settle matters between Egypt and Israel and were fairly confident that it would be forthcoming and would succeed. U.S. CONCERNED OVER DEVELOPMENTS One ranking American diplomat Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs Nicholas Veliotes, arrived here yesterday and has already held meetings with Begin and other top level ministers. Deputy Secretary of State Walter Stoessel, the senior State Department official after Secretary of State Alexander Haig, is due here tomorrow and will meet with Begin on Thursday. The dispatch of both men to the Middle East within a few days of each other indicated the Reagan Administration’s serious concern that the Sinai withdrawal be carried out smoothly and on schedule and that Israel refrain from any military action against Palestinian bases in Lebanon. There have been unconfirmed reports that Haig himself may come to the region next week if necessary to keep the peace process from de-railing. LIST OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST EGYPT Veliotes, who visited Cairo before coming to Jerusalem, was reportedly given a long list of Israel’s complaints against Egypt when he met with Begin. These include: President Hosni Mubarak’s refusal to visit Jerusalem which caused his scheduled trip to Israel last month to be shelved; allegations that Egypt has deployed more troops than allowed under the peace treaty in the areas of Sinai it already controls; and charges that Egypt is drawing closer to the Palestine Liberation Organization and is helping the PLO smuggle arms from Sinai into the Gaza Strip. Israel has also taken offense to the omission of any reference to the Camp David accords and the autonomy negotiations in the speech delivered in Kuwait over the weekend by Ismet Abdel-Meguid, head of the Egyptian delegation to the non-aligned conference there. Israelis concede that most of these complaints are of long standing and have been made before. But officials here say that by “ignoring” Israel’s protests, the Egyptians have created an atmosphere of suspicion and uncertainty which Israel wants dispelled before it quits Sinai on April 25.

Israel has imposed a trade blockage on the Palestinians since 2007 A $5billion island could be constructed by Israel to connect Gaza with the rest of the world. The Israeli government's security cabinet is debating the proposal which is backed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The island would be linked to Gaza by a three mile bridge and could provide an airport and sea port. The island could cost up to $5billion to construct and would connect Gaza with the rest of the world From left finance minister Yair Lapid, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and transportation minister Yisrael Katz during a press conference in 2013 Yisrael Katz, a top deputy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel had no objection to easing the Gaza blockade as long as its security needs are met. Israel would supervise security checks but the island would otherwise be run by Palestinians and the international community. 'I do not think it is right to lock up two million people without any connection to the world,' he said. 'Israel has no interest to make life harder for the population there. But because of security concerns we can't build an airport or seaport in Gaza.' Israel destroyed Gaza's original airport during the second Palestinian uprising and its small seaport is not large enough to handle container ships. The country and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power in 2007. The blockade is still in place because it prevents arms from reaching the Islamic militant group, which has fought three wars against Israel since the takeover. Critics say the closure amounts to collective punishment of Gaza's 1.8 million residents. Israel currently allows about 800 truckloads of goods into Gaza each day through a land crossing, but aid groups and U.N. officials say it's not enough to meet its people's needs. Katz said the island would be in international waters and could provide economic independence to Palestinians. Palestinians protect themselves from the sun at the current small port in Gaza City The U.S, which also considers Hamas to be a terrorist organisation, has been informed of the proposals. Katz said he is hopeful that Israel's security establishment will back the plan, and that it will soon come up for a vote in the cabinet. After that, international bodies would have to get involved in the implementation and funding. Israel, which will not negotiate directly with Hamas, believes the Western-backed Palestinian Authority would welcome such a plan. Palestinian officials have yet to comment on the plans. Mokhamir Abu Sa'da, a professor at Al-Zahar University in Gaza, told the Washington Post: 'Opening a seaport and airport would help Gaza to end the siege, people could travel, goods could be exported and easily imported from abroad.'

Mokhamir Abu Sa'da, a professor at Al-Zahar University in Gaza, told the Washington Post: 'Opening a seaport and airport would help Gaza to end the siege, people could travel, goods could be exported and easily imported from abroad.'

News article:
Israel is actively seeking foreign investors to construct a $5-billion artificial island with a seaport, hotels and an airport just off the coast of the Gaza Strip to ease the blockade it imposed on the Palestinian enclave a decade ago. The island, envisioned to be eight square kilometers, will be linked to Gaza by a five-kilometer bridge, Minister of Transportation and Minister of Intelligence and Atomic Energy Yisrael Katz said on Monday. The project would include the construction of a seaport and even an airport that would be administered by the Palestinians and the international community. Israel, however, under the proposal would supervise security of the island and maintain checkpoints on the bridge. Israel imposed a blockade to prevent the import of weapons to Gaza after Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in 2006. Israel justifies the blockade as a vital measure to prevent weapons smuggling by Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Tel Aviv. Israel allows some 850 truckloads of authorized cargo into Gaza daily. As the conflict between Hamas and Tel Aviv continues, the militant organization has long insisted that one of the preconditions for a long-term truce would be the reopening of the destroyed Yasser Arafat Airport and creation of a seaport to boost the enclave’s economy. Citing national security concerns, Katz said building an artificial island could be a compromise to ease the economic hardship of the Gaza Strip while potentially meeting Hamas’ demands. Gaza offshore island project gaining steam, says intelligence minister https://t.co/FrydW8Sweu#ArabIsraeliConflictpic.twitter.com/WJoSJQ1wcO — The Jerusalem Post (@Jerusalem_Post) June 20, 2016 “I do not think it is right to lock up two million people without any connection to the world,” Katz said at a briefing with foreign reporters. “Israel has no interest to make life harder for the population there. But because of security concerns we can't build an airport or seaport in Gaza.” The proposal for the man-made island is currently being debated in the security cabinet, and is showing a lot of potential, Katz said. The politicians are now devising draft plans on how to maintain security at an offshore port that would be internationally funded. As an option, Israel is considering temporary closures of the bridge, if hostilities heat up between Gaza and Israel. The minister also stressed that the island would not be built or funded by Israel but rather by foreign entities. Saudis, Chinese and private Israeli entities are being considered as possible investors. Katz said Israel would allow foreigners to enter Israeli waters to carry out construction. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “exploring the option but has not yet made a determination,” an Israeli official involved in the talks told the Washington Post. The Palestinian Authority, which has nominal control of the Gaza Strip, despite the Hamas-Fatah rift, called the plan “dubious” and politically motivated. The creation of the man-made island will lead to “the final severing of Gaza from the rest of the occupied territory of the state of Palestine,” Husam Zumlot, an aide to President Mahmoud Abbas, told AP.

Gaza's doors are opening to Turkish companies after Turkey and Israel's agreement on the normalization of ties. Out of a total of $5 billion in international funds for Palestinian development, $3.5 billion has been earmarked for Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 10 years, and the remaining $1.5 billion has been earmarked for Ramallah. Turkish companies are expected to undertake at least $1 billion worth of projects in Gaza. The contract process for the Erez Industrial Zone in Jenin will start in September. The Turkish business world will take the first step with a strategic invigoration plan for Gaza, which has a population of 2 million living in 360 square kilometers. The Israeli government will allow entrance and exit from the industrial zone to be established near the port in Jenin where Israeli, Palestinian and Turkish investors will operate and provide jobs for 10,000 people. Turkey will provide occupational training for Palestinians while Israel will provide electricity and water for the industrial zone. First step for Gaza With the normalization of ties, strained after the Mavi Marmara raid, the two countries have turned a new page both in economic relations and regarding Gaza. Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said bilateral economic and commercial relations will continue to gain strength, adding: "We see no harm in bringing Turkey's interest to the maximum level in commercial and military relations. Palestine's interests are Turkey's interests. It is pleasing that bilateral relations will gain strength." As part of the talks, Turkey will first send humanitarian aid ships to Gaza before Eid al-Fitr. This will be the first time Israel will have let through civilian materials, including humanitarian aid to Gaza, after the offensive on Gaza in 2014. Three important steps to be taken The process of normalization of bilateral relations will be seen from airports to Ramallah, visits to Gaza and in investments. Turkish firms will be prioritized in Gaza's reconstruction, particularly regarding infrastructure, and the embargo will be eased, especially for Turkish firms. Industrial zone operations in Palestine will escalate. About 10,000 people will be employed in the industrial zone in Jenin constructed by Turkish Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges (TOBB). The establishment of the Jenin industrial zone was calculated in recent months, and its master plan was prepared. While the final approval phase for the industrial zone is approaching, the contracting process will start in September. The Israeli government will facilitate the entrance and exit of goods in the Jenin industrial zone next to the port. Israeli, Palestinian and Turkish investors will operate in this region. While Turkey will share its experience in developing industrial zones, young Palestinians will be able to take vocational courses. Israel to provide power, water Israel will meet the region's power and water requirements. An area of 950,000 square meters will be surrounded with fences and administration buildings will be built. After the completion of the construction plans, the administration will set off on an international promotion tour. While an international fund of $3.5 billion was set aside for Gaza, Turkey has prepared its project portfolio eyeing Gaza's revival. Israel will provide steel and cement required for urban transformation operations. Turkey will apply for the construction of the Gaza Port. Regarding the agreement signed between Turkey and Israel, Foreign Economic Relations Board Chairman Ömer Cihad Vardan said the deal will positively contribute to the trade and investment relations between the two countries, as well as supporting the political and economic future of their region. Speaking on behalf of Turkish business communities, Vardan noted that the deal will create new opportunities to ensure the security of energy supply and diversify energy source in the region, adding that new business cooperation will be formed, particularly in the fields of energy, construction, infrastructure and tourism. shortlink copied KEYWORDS business

News article:
Days after Turkey and Israel reached a deal restoring normalized ties, 11,000 tons of humanitarian aid – including rice, flour, and toys -- are being readied to send from Turkey to Gaza this Friday. Relief supplies for the Israeli-blockaded Gaza Strip started being loaded Wednesday onto the Lady Leyla, a Panama-flagged ship, in Turkey's southern port of Mersin. Under the deal, Turkey will be able to send humanitarian aid to Gaza as well as carry out infrastructure projects including residential buildings and a 200-bed Turkish-Palestine Friendship Hospital. The Lady Leyla will carry 10,000 toys and 10,000 packages of food aid to the children of Gaza via the Israeli port of Ashdod. Five tons of flour and 2,000 tons of rice aid from the Turkish Grain Board as well as sugar aid from the Turkish Red Crescent (Turkiye Kizilayi) will also be delivered. Turkey and Israel reached an initial reconciliation agreement late Sunday. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were suspended after Israeli troops stormed a Gaza-bound aid ship in international waters in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. The Mavi Marmara aid ship was among six civilian vessels trying to break Israel's blockade of Gaza when they were boarded by Israeli commandos. In the aftermath of the attack, Turkey demanded a formal apology from Israel, compensation for the families of those killed, and the lifting of Israel’s Gaza blockade. In 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced regret for the attack. On Monday, months of talks between the two countries finally bore fruit, with Turkey announcing that a deal would be signed normalizing relations with Israel. Under the deal, in addition to agreeing to Turkey’s humanitarian presence in Gaza, Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the Mavi Marmara victims. By Sezgin Pancar

News article:
In March 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu called then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to apologize for the Mavi Marmara raid. This was the first time Israel apologized to a foreign state in its history. With this agreement, Israel agreed on Turkey's second stipulation. Accordingly, it will pay compensation to the families of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. The third condition is that Israel eliminates the blockade on Gaza. Turkey succeeded to a large extent in this. According to media reports, as part of the agreement, "Turkey will take materials with civilian purposes, including humanitarian aid, to Gaza and make infrastructure investments there. It will construct houses for Gazan people and put the 200-bed Turkey-Palestine Friendship Hospital into service soon." Moreover, Turkey will build a power plant to meet Gaza's energy requirements. It will also establish a water treatment plant to purify seawater with the objective of resolving the drinking water problem there. Currently, the amount of electricity and water to be provided to Gaza will increase. Additionally, an industrial zone in Jenin and similar comprehensive projects in the West Bank will be realized. As the terms of the agreement offend Israel, which has never reconciled with any country or apologized to any country so far, Zionist media outlets either publish headlines, saying Israel is surrendering, or news reports that insult Turkey in order to relieve the Israeli public. Refuting these reports, it was announced that any article that would restrict the activities of Hamas's authorities in Turkey was not cited in the agreement text. Dr. Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader, in an interview one-and-half years ago said: "Things seem worse than before. It seems the U.N. turns a hand to the matter, but we know that they are in cooperation with Israel. Their projects mostly aim to pressure us. They have not made the slightest contribution. They have not realized any construction or repair work. Construction materials are not let through. Tents they distributed drift in the rain. The U.N. does not do anything in Gaza now. Gaza is completely destroyed. Financial difficulties are at the highest level." The situation in Gaza is no different at the moment. Following Erdoğan's "one minute" response to then Israeli President Shimon Peres and the Mavi Marmara raid, not only were relations between Turkey and Israel broken, but all channels of supporting Gaza were also closed.

News article:
In March 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu called then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to apologize for the Mavi Marmara raid. This was the first time Israel apologized to a foreign state in its history. With this agreement, Israel agreed on Turkey's second stipulation. Accordingly, it will pay compensation to the families of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. The third condition is that Israel eliminates the blockade on Gaza. Turkey succeeded to a large extent in this. According to media reports, as part of the agreement, "Turkey will take materials with civilian purposes, including humanitarian aid, to Gaza and make infrastructure investments there. It will construct houses for Gazan people and put the 200-bed Turkey-Palestine Friendship Hospital into service soon." Moreover, Turkey will build a power plant to meet Gaza's energy requirements. It will also establish a water treatment plant to purify seawater with the objective of resolving the drinking water problem there. Currently, the amount of electricity and water to be provided to Gaza will increase. Additionally, an industrial zone in Jenin and similar comprehensive projects in the West Bank will be realized. As the terms of the agreement offend Israel, which has never reconciled with any country or apologized to any country so far, Zionist media outlets either publish headlines, saying Israel is surrendering, or news reports that insult Turkey in order to relieve the Israeli public. Refuting these reports, it was announced that any article that would restrict the activities of Hamas's authorities in Turkey was not cited in the agreement text. Dr. Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader, in an interview one-and-half years ago said: "Things seem worse than before. It seems the U.N. turns a hand to the matter, but we know that they are in cooperation with Israel. Their projects mostly aim to pressure us. They have not made the slightest contribution. They have not realized any construction or repair work. Construction materials are not let through. Tents they distributed drift in the rain. The U.N. does not do anything in Gaza now. Gaza is completely destroyed. Financial difficulties are at the highest level." The situation in Gaza is no different at the moment. Following Erdoğan's "one minute" response to then Israeli President Shimon Peres and the Mavi Marmara raid, not only were relations between Turkey and Israel broken, but all channels of supporting Gaza were also closed. Support initiatives and projects for Palestine, especially for Gaza, are at the core of the agreement. This is why Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri three days ago said: "We are proud of Turkey's stance on Palestine." Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Khaled Mashal congratulated Turkey's insistence on the removal of the blockade on Gaza and Hamas issued an official statement thanking Turkey for protecting the Gazan public.

News article:
Turkey's humanitarian aid ship carrying 11,000 tons of relief supplies to the Gaza Strip is ready to sail from the country's southern port of Mersin on Friday. The move by the Panama-flagged ship named "Lady Leyla," which has been loaded with relief supplies including rice, flour, and toys since Wednesday, comes in the wake of a reconciliation deal reached between Turkey and Israel after a six-year hiatus. Lady Leyla will also carry 10,000 toys and 10,000 packages of food and aid to children in Gaza via the Israeli port of Ashdod, which it is expected to reach within 30 hours. Five tons of flour and 2,000 tons of rice aid from the Turkish Grain Board, as well as sugar aid from the Turkish Red Crescent, will be delivered. A farewell ceremony will be held at 15:30 p.m. local time on Friday with the participation of Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak, Development Minister Lutfi Elvan and Palestinian Ambassador to Ankara, Faed Mustafa, before the ship departs for the port of Ashdod. Turkey and Israel reached an initial reconciliation agreement late Sunday. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were suspended after Israeli troops stormed a Gaza-bound aid ship called Mavi Marmara in international waters in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. The Mavi Marmara aid ship was among six civilian vessels trying to break Israel's blockade of Gaza when Israeli commandos boarded it. In the aftermath of the attack, Turkey demanded a formal apology from Israel, compensation for the families of those killed, and the lifting of Israel's Gaza blockade. In 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced regret for the attack. On Monday, months of talks between the two countries finally bore fruit, with Turkey announcing that a deal would be signed, normalizing relations with Israel. Under the deal, in addition to agreeing to Turkey's humanitarian presence in Gaza, Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the Mavi Marmara victims. shortlink copied Last Update: Jul 01, 2016 4:50 pm KEYWORDS homepage

News article:
Turkey has sent food, medicine and clothes to Gaza via the Israeli port of Ashdod, as part of its rapprochement with Israel. The move comes six years after a deadly raid by Israeli commandos on another Turkish aid ship. A Turkish cargo ship carrying more than 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip has docked at an Israeli port 40 km (25 miles) to the north. Turkey's state-run Anadolu (news) agency said the vessel, Lady Leyla, arrived at the Israeli port in Ashdod on Sunday, 35 hours after leaving the Turkish port city of Mersin. The ship is carrying food, medicine, clothes and toys, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority. "The ship is docking these very moments," a spokesman for the Ashdod Port, Yigal Ben Zikry, said earlier on Sunday. The aid delivery marks a return to normalized relations between Turkey and Israel, which were ruptured in 2010. Back then Israel had imposed an all-out naval blockade of Gaza, but a Turkish aid ship sought to breach the blockade. The results proved deadly as Israeli forces stormed the vessel, killing nine on board. Eight of those killed were Turkish nationals. The ninth victim was an American with Turkish ancestry. The countries severed diplomatic relations after the incident. Turkey and Israel reconcile Containers are unloaded from an aid ship bound for Gaza Image: Reuters/A. Cohen Aid for the 1.9 million Palestinians in the poverty stricken enclave is part of a reconciliation deal signed between Turkey and Israel last week. Months of negotiations between the two sides led to the agreement, which included compensation for the victims of the Israeli raid. Tel Aviv will contribute $20 million (18 million euros) to a victims' fund for those killed in the so-called Mavi Marmara affair - the name of the ship that Israeli forces raided. In return, Ankara will drop criminal charges against the Israeli soldiers involved in the raid. Israel rejected Turkey's main demand - easy access to the Gaza strip - but Israel has agreed to allow aid shipments to Hamas-run Gaza, as long as they first pass through the Ashdod port for inspection. Turkey will also be allowed to build a hospital, power plant and water desalinization plant in Gaza. A small number of Israelis protested the shipments outside the port. They are supporters of two Israeli soldiers who were killed in the 2014 Gaza war. The Islamist Hamas government has kept the soldiers' remains, and the Israelis want them back. They blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for going ahead with the reconciliation, and allowing the aid shipments without getting the return of the bodies.

(JTA) — A Turkish ship packed with aid for the Gaza Strip arrived in Israel, the first since Turkey and Israel reached a reconciliation deal that allows such transfers. The cargo ship docking at Ashdod, just north of Gaza, on Sunday afternoon was bearing 10,000 tons of humanitarian equipment and food, Haaretz reported. Israel and Turkey last month agreed to fully reestablish ties ruptured by Israel’s raid on a Turkish-flagged aid flotilla in 2010. Israeli commandos killed 10 Turkish nationals in violent encounters during the raid on the Mavi Marmara, one of the ships attempting to breach a blockade on the strip imposed by Israel after the 2009 Gaza war with Hamas. As part of the deal, Israel is keeping the blockade in place but is easing the transfer of Turkish aid to the strip. Israel also will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the Turkish nationals. Turkey will press Hamas to return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers slain during wars with Hamas and two Israeli citizens still being held in the strip. The families of the slain soldiers and their supporters protested the arrival of the ship, Haaretz reported.

News article:
Gaza City (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) - Turkish aid arrived in the Gaza Strip on Monday via Israel, after the two countries restored ties frozen over a deadly Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish ship in 2010. Turkish and Palestinian officials welcomed 10 truckloads of supplies, including food parcels, toys and children's clothing and shoes as they reached the impoverished territory in time for the Muslim Eid celebrations on Wednesday marking the end of Ramadan fasting. "These are the first Turkish aid trucks into Gaza," Mustafa Sarnıc, Turkey's ambassador to the Palestinian Authority, told a press conference near the Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel. "Turkey will continue its efforts to help the residents of the Gaza Strip and to help solve the water and power crisis." The Panama-flagged Lady Leyla container ship docked at southern Israel's Ashdod port on Sunday after sailing from Turkey. Its contents were unloaded, inspected and sent on to the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, hit by three wars with Israel since 2008 and under an Israeli blockade. Youssef Ibrahim, the Hamas deputy minister of social affairs, said the 11,000-tonne shipment would be distributed to those most in need by his ministry along with the Turkish and Palestinian Red Crescent societies. It was due to be the first of many, he added. "These 10 trucks are part of 400 trucks of Turkish aid for Gaza." Turkey had initially pushed for a lifting of Israel's years-long blockade of Gaza as part of the negotiations to normalise ties, but Israel rejected this. A compromise was eventually reached allowing Turkey to send aid through Ashdod rather than directly to the Palestinian enclave. Israel says the blockade is necessary to prevent Islamist movement Hamas from receiving materials that could be used for military purposes. But UN officials have called for it to be lifted, citing deteriorating conditions in the territory. Turkey's ruling Islamic-rooted AKP party has friendly ties with Gaza's Hamas rulers, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause. Story continues Turkey and Israel were formerly close regional allies, but fell out in 2010 when Israeli commandos killed 10 Turkish activists in a raid on a flotilla seeking to run the blockade. Under the reconciliation deal, Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of those killed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promoted the economic benefits of restoring ties, with talk of building a pipeline to Turkey to export Israeli gas, and the need to find allies in the turbulent Middle East.

First Trucks of Turkish Aid Arrive in Gaza by Smita Nordwall July 04, 2016 Trucks carrying about 10,000 tons of aid from Turkey have begun arriving in Gaza via Israel, a week after Turkey and Israel mended ties. The first of about 500 trucks carrying toys, diapers, clothes, medicine and food entered Gaza on Monday after a security check in Israel, with more planned in the coming days. Relations between Israel and Turkey broke down in May 2010 after Israeli marines stormed a Turkish ship challenging Israel's naval blockade of the Gaza Strip and killed 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists during fighting on board. Kerem Kinik, president of the Turkish Red Crescent Society, traveled to Gaza to supervise the distribution of the goods. He said Turkey would provide "continuous, regular humanitarian assistance" for the territory. The delivery comes in time for Wednesday's Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Israel imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip in 2006 after the Palestinian group Hamas, which runs the territory, abducted an Israeli soldier. The measures were tightened in 2007 after Hamas ousted its rival Fatah and forcibly took control in Gaza after winning elections the year before. Israel says the blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas from receiving materials that could be used for military purposes, but the United Nations has long been critical of it. Last week, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it "collective punishment for which there must be accountability." NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
July 5, 2016 GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Controversy has not stopped the Land Authority in the Gaza Strip from proceeding with the second phase of a scheme to hand government-owned lands to Hamas government employees who have not been paid since 2013. Registration for the project's first phase began Dec. 14, and the distribution process took place on June 1-9. In the meantime, registration for phase two began in mid-May, with distribution yet to get underway. This project was developed as Hamas continued to struggle with a crippling financial crisis, and the Palestinian consensus government, formed in 2014, refused to recognize Hamas government employees in Gaza as civil servants and therefore pay them. Hamas' Change and Reform Bloc from the Palestinian Legislative Council introduced the scheme on March 9, 2015. On Nov. 3, the consensus government weighed in, declaring the distribution of government-owned lands to employees illegal. According to the government in Ramallah, any such act is null and void, does not convey any rights and represents a violation of state property and lands. In the first phase of the program, 49 plots across Gaza were given to government employees. The size of the parcel received was determined by how much a worker was owed in back pay and the land price per square meter, which varied depending on location. Jumaa Hassan, a Rafah resident who works in security for the Hamas government, was given a tract of 168 square meters (1,800 square feet) as compensation for the 95,000 shekels ($24,000) owed to him. “I am satisfied with the plot handover as compensation for the salary I thought I would never receive,” Hassan told Al-Monitor. “Today, I can sell it, like some of my colleagues did, and get my past due wages in cash, which I have not received for years.” Mohammed al-Nazli, a resident of Gaza City who works at the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, refused to take part in the project. He told Al-Monitor that the scheme promotes divisiveness and further separates Gaza from the West Bank given the disagreement between Hamas and the consensus government over the land distribution project. “My [unpaid] salary is worth $5,000, which is not enough for me to get a 30-square-meter [323-square-foot] plot,” Nazli said. “I am convinced that we are going through dark times. The distribution of land at this stage, in the absence of Palestinian national unity and in light of the national divide, is contrary to the laws and norms of the state of Palestine.” Nazli said that there is no guarantee that the land will remain the property of the employees in the future. “As an employee, I look forward to receiving my salary and past wages, to be able to pay my debts and have a decent life similar to any government employee,” he said. Ibrahim Radwan, the chairman of the Land Authority and Supreme Committee for Land, told Al-Monitor that the project — which the Land Authority calls the Low-Income Earners Housing Project — is based on laws granting the Supreme Committee for Land the authority to dispose of government property, that is, Law No. 2 of 2015, which is an amendment of Law No. 6 of 1942 on government lands. “It is not the first time that a ruling party in Gaza has disposed of government-owned lands,” Radwan said. “It has always been the case in the Gaza Strip, starting with the British Mandate, Egyptian rule, Israeli occupation and up to the Palestinian Authority.” Radwan said that the amount of land distributed during the first phase of the project amounted to 1,500 dunams (371 acres). Some 40,000 Gaza government employees are expected to be paid with land. Nearly 13,000 have already received allotments, Radwan claimed. He noted that according to the mechanism established for implementing the project, plots slated to be used for housing collectives are registered in the names of multiple employees, with a single plot ranging in size from 500 to 1,000 square meters and owned by 10-20 employees. Lawyer Bakr Turkmani told Al-Monitor that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is the only party with the authority to issue decisions to privatize government-owned lands in the public interest. “According to public property and land laws applicable in Palestine, public lands are state-owned properties and may not be subject to any act whether by takeover or privatization unless by virtue of a law,” Turkmani said. “The president of the state, head of the government or any party authorized by them is the sole competent authority in this regard.” Turkmani added, “We recognize that the Hamas employees in Gaza have the right to be paid their salaries and dues,” but said, “The problem of accumulated unpaid financial dues will re-emerge.” As soon as the affected employees receive land, their unpaid salaries will begin accruing anew. “Moreover,” said Turkmani, “it is possible that a number of land middlemen and traders will try to exploit the situation of these employees and offer to buy their lands at low prices.” Despite the objections and legal questions surrounding the distribution scheme, the process remains ongoing.

News article:
A delegation from Turkey's Energy and Natural Resources Ministry is currently visiting the Gaza Strip to discuss ways to meet the coastal enclave's electricity needs, the Anadolu Agency reported yesterday. The visit comes two weeks after Ankara and Tel-Aviv agreed to normalise relations following a six-year hiatus. According to ministry sources, members of the delegation, which arrived in the Strip on Sunday evening, will meet both Israeli and Palestinian officials to discuss how to resolve Gaza's energy crisis. Gaza continues to suffer from a severe energy crisis that has forced the local authorities to adopt a rotation system, cutting power in certain parts of the Strip in order to supply electricity to other areas. This is due to shortfalls in the amounts of electricity produced by Gaza's sole power plant, coupled with the fact that electricity supplied by Israel and Egypt is insufficient to meet the Strip's energy demand. Following its visit, the Turkish delegation is expected to provide a report on its findings to Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak. Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has been under a strict Israeli and internationally backed siege that has deprived the enclave's roughly 1.9 million inhabitants of their most basic needs, especially food, fuel, medicine and construction supplies.

July 19, 2016 GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — After failing to persuade Israel to lift its siege on the Gaza Strip, Turkey is taking steps to help Gaza resolve its 10-year-old electricity crisis. In exchange for normalizing relations with Israel in June, Turkey pledged to provide an economic projects package to Palestinians that includes establishing a power plant in Gaza. Toward that end, a delegation of eight Turkish energy experts, accompanied by Turkey's ambassador to the Palestinian Authority (PA), Mustafa Sarnic, arrived July 12 in Gaza to be briefed on the electricity crisis by the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority (PENRA) and to study proposed solutions. The delegation had met with different PA officials and others the day before in Israel to address the crisis. Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency revealed that the Turkish delegation suggested during the meeting, as it has before, sending an electricity vessel to Gaza's shores, but Israel has yet to respond. Ahmet Varol, a leader in Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the AKP official in charge of Gaza affairs, told Al-Monitor, "The Turkish project to generate electricity in Gaza has begun to be implemented on the ground. Several Turkish officials and experts have arrived to the Palestinian territories to inspect the problem and study the proposed solutions to be raised to the Turkish leadership." The project will take a year or two to be fully implemented, Varol said. "The responsibility lies now squarely on the shoulders of the Israelis, who might seek to put a spoke in the wheel of implementation, because all the infrastructure and construction materials for the establishment of the power station will enter Gaza through Israel," he added. Varol further stated that successive and clear steps are expected to be taken in Gaza in a bid to alleviate the Israeli blockade, through Turkish projects, mainly a solution to the electricity crisis. He stressed that Turkey has not renounced its demand that Israel lift its Gaza blockade. Varol added that getting the blockade lifted will require the PA, the Arab countries and Turkey to use a firm hand with Israel. The electricity problem in Gaza emerged in 2006 when Israel bombed and destroyed parts of Gaza's only power plant, causing a blackout in the majority of cities and camps and depriving more than 700,000 citizens of electricity for many days. The plant has been operating at less than 50% of its original capacity since it was bombed. Israeli and Egyptian power lines provide some electricity, but all in all, the Gaza Strip receives a total of 212 megawatts per day while it needs 400 megawatts. Electricity is available for only 12 hours a day. "The PA has made several proposals to the Turkish delegation, some of which are instant solutions and other strategic, in a bid to overcome the electricity crisis," Fathi al-Sheikh Khalil, the deputy chairman of PENRA in Gaza, told Al-Monitor. The immediate solutions include supplying the power plant with the necessary fuel to operate at full capacity; it needs 500 tons of fuel per day to run the four generators in the plant. However, the Ministry of Finance in Ramallah imposes taxes of 200% on PENRA in Gaza for the fuel it buys from Israel, making it possible to purchase only 200 tons of fuel per day, enough to run two generators only, Sheikh said. Other quick solutions include increasing the power line supply from Israel and accelerating the setup of the natural gas pipeline from Israel to the Gaza power station, which Qatar offered to finance a year ago. One strategic solution the PA proposes is to become part of the Eight Countries Electric Interconnection Project. This would link the Palestinian electricity grid in the Gaza Strip with the Arab network, Sheikh said. Another strategic solution would be to establish a new power plant capable of producing all the electricity needed in Gaza, which is what Turkey has been working on. Khalil added that the Turkish delegation has been studying the possibility of expanding and repairing the current power plant. Turkey's official news organization, TRT, reported July 12 that the delegation will submit a detailed report to Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak on the production, transmission and distribution of energy, the Gaza infrastructure problems and what could be achieved in the short, medium and long terms. In turn, the minister will present the report to the Turkish government and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A road map will then be put forward for implementing approved proposals. Amjad Shawa is the director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network (PNGO), which was among the mediators when the Palestinian internal parties met about the electricity crisis. Shawa told Al-Monitor, "The electricity bill in the Gaza Strip is the highest in the world, standing at 0.6 kwh per 1 shekel [about 26 cents]. Yet, electricity outages are frequent and widespread in Gaza." He urged a focus on permanent and swift solutions to save time, effort and money to resolve the crisis. Shawa pointed out that any effort undertaken by local or international parties to end the electricity crisis will face several obstacles, most importantly the Israeli blockade, which is at the basis of the dilemmas plaguing the Gaza Strip. He expressed hope that future efforts will focus on alternative energy, to liberate Palestinians from Israeli restrictions on electricity. He also called on the PA in Ramallah to cancel any taxes levied on the supply of alternative energy equipment to Gaza. Gazans, who have become fed up with the electricity problem, are no longer buying any talks about solutions to the crisis until they are effectively implemented. Several promises and proposals have been made before — such as the one to build a gas pipeline from Israel to Gaza with Qatari fundings — but none of them has seen the light of day.

By Gidon Bromberg and Hilik Bar Israelis and Palestinians often play the blame game on the crucial issue of water. Palestinians scream "water apartheid" and Israelis respond with accusations of a "sewage intifada." But recently there has been some important progress in the form of an Israeli-Turkish agreement to normalize diplomatic relations signed last month. It permits Turkey to lead efforts to build a new seawater desalination plant in Gaza, as well as a power station. The desalination plant could supply urgently needed drinking water, while the power station could help run a World Bank-built sewage treatment plant that has so far been unable to open for lack of electricity. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited Gaza's water problems as a key justification for the deal with Turkey. His concerns are well founded. Gaza has no modern sewage treatment plants, and its untreated sewage pollutes the aquifer that it shares with Israel. Advertisement "It is in Israel's clear interest to deal with the water problem in the Gaza Strip," Netanyahu said. "When the aquifers become polluted, this is not limited to the Gaza side of the aquifer but also passes over to the aquifer on our side." Poor sanitation threatens outbreaks of pandemic diseases and, as Netanyahu rightly observed, "outbreaks do not stop at the fences." An estimated 90 million liters of raw sewage from Gaza flow into the Mediterranean Sea every single day, polluting not only the shared coastline, but threatening Israel's desalination plant in Ashkelon. The Ashkelon plant supplies 20 percent of Israel's drinking water. The rationale for urgent action on sewage in Gaza applies equally to the West Bank, whose sanitation problems affect Israelis just as much as Palestinians. Every Palestinian city in the West Bank, from Jenin in the north to Hebron in the south, is emitting sewage into streams that either flow west into Israel or east towards the Jordan River and the Dead Sea. Every year about 50 billion liters of untreated West Bank sewage pollute shared groundwater, including the Mountain and Coastal Aquifers, as well as Israel's Mediterranean beaches. Just as Gaza's effluent threatens Ashkelon, West Bank sewage carried by cross-border streams brings the potential for disease into the heart of major Israeli cities like Tel Aviv, Haifa, Hadera, Netanya, and Be'ersheva. Advertisement Drinking water has run out in Gaza Sewage isn't the only problem. Some 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza have run out of drinking water. The Coastal Aquifer that is virtually the sole source of their water supply is no longer potable. On top of pollution from untreated sewage, over-extraction has caused seawater to be drawn into the aquifer, making it too saline for human consumption. Water shortages in many West Bank Palestinian towns and cities are even worse than in Gaza. In summer, municipal water is supplied to many Palestinian homes as little as once a month. Despite the current impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, allowing Turkey to take the lead in Gaza demonstrates that there are still ways to make progress on water issues. We have an opportunity to build on the momentum of the Gaza deal and expand this breakthrough to the West Bank, especially in light of summer water shortages. Israelis are proud of their ingenuity in solving water problems. Israel is the world leader in wastewater treatment and reuse, and a world leader in desalination. Thanks to these technological achievements, Israel today enjoys a substantial water surplus--meaning we can increase supplies to the Palestinians without cutting water allocations to Israelis. The political cost is low, while both sides stand to gain enormously. More water in every Palestinian home is a chance to strengthen moderate Palestinian leadership. Advertisement Two decades ago, Palestinians and Israelis signed the Oslo accords, which included an interim deal on how to share water resources until a final agreement on all issues could be reached. Oslo linked water with other final status issues such as Jerusalem and borders. This was a mistake. Water and sanitation have been held hostage to a broader political agreement, with potentially disastrous consequences for public health. We urgently need to disentangle these critical issues and forge a new agreement to manage water and sanitation across the West Bank and Gaza, in the interests of both peoples. Such an agreement could stop water from poisoning both the imaginations and the daily lives of Palestinians and Israelis. Instead it could show that the two sides, separated by seemingly unbridgeable animosity, still can make concrete progress on vital issues that affect them both.

News article:
DOHA: Qatar has pledged to pay one-month salaries for public sector employees in Gaza, to help “alleviate the suffering” caused by the Israeli blockade, state media said. The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, has ordered paying a total of 113 million rials ($31 million), which is the total wage bill for one month in the strip ruled by Hamas, QNA state news agency said late Thursday. This is to “alleviate the suffering of the brothers in (the Gaza) Strip and (ease) the severe financial hardship they are facing due to the unjust blockade imposed by the Israeli occupation,” it said. Gaza has been subjected to a stringent Israeli blockade since 2006, with construction materials tightly controlled for fear militants could make use of them to forge arms or build fortifications. Hamas hired more than 40,000 people after it seized Gaza in 2007 following deadly clashes with militants of Fatah, the party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

News article:
On Sunday, it was the turn of Ismail Haniyeh, the former Hamas prime minister, who is likely to ascend to the political leadership of the organization in the coming months, to thank its official sponsor. Reporting for an interview with the Qatari al-Jazeera network, he extended his gratitude to the leader of the emirate, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who will be paying the salaries of Hamas employees in the Strip this month. For three years — since the second Egyptian revolution of June 2013 — those workers have generally been receiving a third of their salaries, half when they were lucky. Now, Qatar has decided to pay them in full. But Haniyeh forgot to thank another important apparent benefactor: the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, which has reportedly waved through the Qatari cash infusion. Liberman, who once threatened to have Haniyeh assassinated within 48 hours of becoming defense minister, is understood to have agreed to the transfer of some 113 Saudi riyal ($31 million) to Hamas. Incongruous as it may seem, after less than two months in Tel Aviv’s Kirya military headquarters, Liberman appears to be a changed man, apparently tolerating an initiative that he opposed vehemently only a few years ago, during his stint as foreign minister. Here’s a refresher: Stalled Hamas salaries were one of the key causes of the frustration in Gaza that in turn led to the 2014 war that claimed the lives of some 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis. Furthermore, during the war, Israel turned down a ceasefire proposal — conveyed, via US Secretary of State John Kerry — by Hamas’s Doha bureau that would have resolved the wage crisis in the Strip. Earlier in 2014, when Hamas agreed to a reconciliation government with the Palestinian Authority, it was motivated largely by its inability to pay its employees. (Israel castigated PA Mahmoud Abbas over what it called the “unity government” deal with the Islamist terrorists, despite the fact that it didn’t feature a single Hamas representative, because Hamas had veto power over its members.) During the previous summer, Egypt had launched a campaign to seal the tunnels from Sinai into Gaza, and a few months later, Hamas found it had been stripped of its main source of income — the taxes on tunnel-smuggled goods. The flow of cash from abroad was also disrupted, physically, by Egypt’s actions along Gaza’s southern border. Devastated by the loss of both its major revenue streams, Hamas agreed to dismantle its government in Gaza and support a prime minister appointed by Abbas, who would also staff and set the policy of a new government, devoid of Hamas representation. In other words, at least symbolically, it was practically an agreement of surrender on the part of Hamas, which had only two demands: that its security forces’ activities in Gaza continue without interruption, and that Abbas pay the salaries of government employees in the Strip, including those of its security forces. In all, that amounted to more than 40,000 Palestinians, many of whom are considered as terrorists by Israeli law. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Abbas went on to assemble the reconciliation government without Hamas representatives, appointing Rami Hamdallah as its prime minister. But he said it would take many months to determine whether all the people Hamas had listed as employees were indeed eligible for PA salaries. Month after month, Hamas’s workers went without pay, and the economic situation in Gaza became increasingly grave. In an attempt to pressure Abbas to pay the salaries, Hamas refused to foot any of the bill. But Abbas was glad for the opportunity to generate a crisis in the Strip, and Hamas, growing yet more desperate, began to weigh a military campaign against Israel. Among those who warned of the increasing volatility of the situation was Robert Serry, the UN’s then envoy to the region. He approached Israeli officials with his concerns, while Qatar and others examined the possibility of paying the salaries of Hamas’s non-combatant workers. But that initiative, to which Serry was merely ancillary, sparked wrath in Liberman’s Foreign Ministry. Liberman considered it a blatant attempt to transfer money to Hamas, and castigated Serry for his role, designating him a persona non grata and threatening to revoke his visa. Several months later, the salary crisis still unresolved, war broke out. But what a difference three years makes. Now, according to the Palestinian daily al-Quds, Israel has assented to Qatar’s request to pay Hamas’s employees. Although the salary transfers will be made via the PA, the bottom line is that the Hamas government will receive in July precisely what Israel for years refused to facilitate. Advertisement To the average Israeli, this decision may seem marginal and temporary, but it has dramatic ramifications. In many ways, Israel is recognizing and perpetuating the Hamas government — and not for the first time; it has already done so in multiple ceasefire agreements. Israel needs Hamas and, in consenting to this Qatar payment agreement, is sending an unequivocal message to the Islamists’ leadership in Gaza and elsewhere that it wants to do business, not war. This should significantly bolster the group both in Gaza and in the West Bank, where it is already on the rise, especially when compounded with Jerusalem’s recent overtures to Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a close friend of Hamas. Meanwhile, the two rival Palestinian parties, Fatah and Hamas, have begun gearing up for municipal elections. Hamas recently announced that it intends to participate in elections in the West Bank, as well as Gaza, slated for the fall. Over the last few days, it has been releasing video ads calling on its supporters to register to vote. Hamas is rallying its supporters, and it has good reason to do so. In light of Fatah’s plummeting popularity in the West Bank, Hamas’s rising star — now that it will be paying its employees there — could mean it will make significant gains. At the end of the day, this Israeli government may be remembered as having boosted Hamas’s cause. That’s why Haniyeh might be thanking Jerusalem along with Qatar. If there’s a positive outcome to be gleaned from this move, it’s that, in the near term, it significantly reduces the chance of war in Gaza. The Times of Israel reached out to Liberman, as well as Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, the coordinator of the Israeli government’s activities in the Palestinian territories. Both refused to comment.

News article:
The Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs on Thursday began the second stage of distributing Turkish humanitarian aid to poor families in the blockaded Gaza Strip. "The aid will be transferred to several Gaza-based NGOs, which will in turn distribute them to more than 30,000 Palestinian families," ministry undersecretary Youssef Ibrahim told Anadolu Agency. The first stage of aid distribution benefited some 11,000 poor families in Gaza, he said, adding that a third stage would be organized in upcoming weeks. Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has groaned under a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade that has deprived the enclave's roughly 1.9 million inhabitants of basic commodities, including food, fuel and medicine. On July 3, a Turkish aid ship docked in Israel's port of Ashdod carrying 11,000 tons of humanitarian aid destined for Gaza. The influx of Turkish aid to Gaza comes within the context of a deal signed last month between Ankara and Tel Aviv in which the two agreed to restore diplomatic relations following a six-year hiatus. According to Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım, Tel Aviv has met all of Ankara's preconditions for normalizing ties, which were severed in 2010 after Israeli commandos stormed a Turkish aid vessel bound for Gaza. The attack led to the death of nine Turkish activists and left another 30 injured, one of whom succumbed to his injuries nearly four years later. At the time, Turkey had demanded that Israel officially apologize for the attack, compensate the families of those killed, and lift its longstanding blockade of the Gaza Strip. In 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his regret to Turkey's then-prime minister (now president) Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over the incident. Under the terms of last month's agreement, the two countries will exchange ambassadors and Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the 2010 flotilla attack victims. Israel has also agreed to Turkey's request to maintain a "humanitarian presence" in the blockaded Gaza Strip.

News article:
Gaza Strip – Earth movers dig into sand dunes on land where once Jewish settlements stood — prime real estate that the Gaza Strip’s ruling Hamas group hopes will ease its worsening financial crisis. Hamas has begun handing out plots of the land to 40,000 civil servants loyal to the Islamic militant group, to make up for millions of dollars in salaries it owes them for the past two years. The land giveaway is the latest sign that Hamas is struggling financially after almost a decade of uncontested power in the coastal strip. Gazans grumble about lack of jobs, constant electricity shortages and a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt that has confined the territory’s 1.8 million people to the tiny strip. The World Bank says unemployment is 38 percent. Since 2014, Hamas’ main problem has been a dire lack of cash amid Egypt’s clampdown on smuggling tunnels underneath Gaza’s border with Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. Before the tunnels closed, Hamas earned millions of dollars from taxes on smuggled consumer goods, including subsidized Egyptian fuel. Later that same year, Hamas and its rival, West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, agreed to form a unity government for both Gaza and the West Bank. Abbas had lost Gaza to a Hamas takeover in 2007, and this was an attempt to heal the split. But the deal stalled, partly because Abbas refused to add the 40,000 employees hired by Hamas since 2007 to the payroll of his Palestinian Authority. In time, Hamas resorted to paying its loyalists 40 percent of their salaries at 50 day intervals. Since March, after Hamas collected additional taxes, these civil servants have been receiving 45 percent of their salaries on a monthly basis. The price of cigarettes went up 35 percent and an additional $30 in taxes was imposed on each ton of fruit entering Gaza from Israel. The land giveaway allows each group of four Hamas employees to share a 500-square-meter plot that they can either build on or sell. Even the sand collected on the land can be sold for about $100 a truckload. About 13,000 civil servants have already signed up for certificates attesting to their ownership of the plots. Bulldozers are working to get three initial projects launched in August. Most of the land once was part of Jewish settlements in southern Gaza, near the towns of Rafah and Khan Younis. The settlements were demolished when Israel pulled settlers and soldiers from the coastal strip in 2005. Earlier this week, earth-moving equipment dug into a high hill near Khan Younis, scooping out sand and loading it into trucks at the site designated for the Al-Isra 2 housing project. Riham Khalil, one of the civil servants, said Hamas owes her 64,000 shekels (about $17,000) in back salaries. Last month, she and three of her colleagues were allocated a 500-square-meter plot in Al-Isra 2. “We had to accept it on a ‘bird in the hand’ basis because there was no cash,” she said. “I wish I could find someone to buy the land and get the money.” Senior Hamas official Salah al-Bardawil said the land giveaway is a temporary fix, “not yet a strategic one” that would solve the group’s financial problems for good. If Abbas had put Hamas employees on his payroll, he would have likely encountered major problems with donor governments, including the United States, suspicious of money ending up in the pockets of Hamas, which much of the West considers a terrorist group. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority opposes the land-for-money program. “No one has the authority to issue decisions to privatize government-owned land in the public interest, except for President Abbas,” said PA spokesman Jamal Dajani. He dismissed Hamas’ claims that Abbas has neglected Gaza. The Palestinian Authority still pays the monthly salaries of some 70,000 civil servants in Gaza who are loyal to Abbas and left their posts after the Hamas takeover. The Gulf Arab state of Qatar has bailed out Hamas in the past and recently announced it was giving about $30 million to help pay a full month’s salary to all Hamas employees in Gaza. In October 2014, Qatar sent cash to half of Hamas’ public employees, excluding the security forces. Hamas has been spending some of its new revenue to fund summer camps, where children are exposed to its militant anti-Israeli ideology, or for large communal evening meals known as iftars during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. It is also looking to its patron Turkey to help resolve Gaza’s growing electricity and water shortages. Gazans live with rolling power cuts of 12 to 18 hours a day and the strip’s water is polluted and undrinkable. After an Israeli-Turkish reconciliation deal in early July, Turkey sent an aid ship to Gaza through an Israeli port and a delegation that met separately with Israeli, Palestinian and Hamas officials to explore Gaza’s energy crisis and outline possible solutions. However, Turkey’s efforts are mere band aids for Gaza’s larger woes and could serve to empower Hamas even further, said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University. “They increase Hamas’ determination to cling to its unilateral governing of Gaza,” Abusada said. “Time will tell if these promises are enough to convince the Palestinian citizen to keep silent over his living conditions.”

News article:
August 1, 2016 JABALIYA, Gaza Strip — In a small town in the northern Gaza Strip, a group of children sat on a circle of small chairs in front of a minibus, listening raptly to a storyteller. The bus had been turned into a mobile library to bring books into areas where there are none. The mobile library’s coordinator, Mahmoud Askalani, told Al-Monitor that Ramallah’s French-German Cultural Center sent the bookmobile to Gaza on May 16. Its route takes it to marginalized areas and towns with no public libraries on a mission to encourage children to read. The bookmobile is expected to return to the West Bank by the end of August after completing its three-month tour. The mobile library, the first of its kind in the Gaza Strip, has already visited 40 neighborhoods across Gaza this year, targeting children under 14. This is the bookmobile's second trip across the Gaza Strip. Its first visit was in the summer of 2015. The cultural center collaborated on the project with the Tamer Institute for Community Education and the Abdel Mohsin al-Qattan Foundation, both of which provided children’s books. Aya al-Ajrami, 11, from Jabaliya, told Al-Monitor she was extremely pleased with the bookmobile’s visit to her hometown, adding that she had never been to a public library before. Aya’s father, Raed al-Ajrami, who accompanied his daughter to the mobile library, said though he has always told her bedtime stories, this was Aya's first chance to actually hold a storybook in her hands and read it herself. After finishing his story, the storyteller allows children to go up to the library and choose a book to read. Since the bookmobile visits each place only once, the children cannot borrow the books and take them home. Aseel Hajjaj decided to take her young son Raed, 5, to read him stories. She told Al-Monitor, “My son has not yet learned how to read, but he likes listening to stories.” Hajjaj expressed sadness at the lack of children’s facilities in Gaza. The story Hajjaj chose for her son held special meaning for the Palestinian situation. The book tells the story of a fox that destroyed the house of a rabbit it was hunting. The rabbit turned to the lion for help, but the lion also tried to devour the small animal. The rabbit was able to escape again and asked for help from the bear, who also tried to feast on the rabbit. The rabbit got the same response from the tiger and the elephant. Finally, the rabbit decided that the only solution was for all the rabbits to unite against the fox and defeat the predator. The moral of this story is that Palestinians need to be united and achieve national reconciliation in order to confront Israel's occupation. As for Mohammad Abu Warda, 13, he wishes there were a permanent library in his town, so he could visit it and borrow books. He told Al-Monitor that no one cares about building libraries there. Askalani told Al-Monitor, “The bookmobile is equipped with tables and seats, and is accompanied by a storyteller whose job is to tell children stories.” He said that the library contains over 200 titles, and children are allowed to go in and choose any they like to enjoy during the minibus' stop. However, each visit lasts only an hour, and then the bookmobile leaves for another place to reach the largest possible number of children across Gaza. The idea, said Askalani, was met with great enthusiasm from both children and parents who ask for more visits. With a population of 2 million in an area of 365 square kilometers (227 miles), the Gaza Strip contains just 15 public libraries, according to the general manager of exhibitions and libraries at the Ministry of Culture, Mohammad al-Sharif. Sharif told Al-Monitor, “The shortage of libraries is due to the lack of space. Ideally, each municipality should have a public library. But there is rarely any space available for a library in municipal buildings. This is why residents of many areas don’t have access to libraries close to their homes.” Religious institutions in Gaza often provide small libraries for visitors, usually at the ground floor of mosques. But most of the books there are religious, and literary and scientific books are scarce. These libraries are not usually inviting places to sit and read, but more often simply book storage areas. The book collection at the Brighter Tomorrow Cultural Center is the only such facility in Jabaliya, which stretches over an area of 18 square kilometers (11 square miles), with 220,000 residents. Asma Hammouda, a librarian there, said that the library was established through the Young Women’s Muslim Association, a civil institution in Gaza, in January. It's very small, with an inventory of approximately 600 books. “At best, only 20 children visit the library per day. Sometimes, we have no visitors because parents and children don’t know about the library,” she added. Visitors to this library will readily notice its focus on religious content. The religion section is piled high with books, but other topics like literature, science and art take up very little space. Only 10 books make up the literature section. Asked about why the library is rich with religious books at the expense of scientific and literature books, Hammouda said, “This is not intentional at all. The presence of a large number of religious books compared to other books is because the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs has sent us a great deal to be included. At present, work is underway to provide more books for the scientific and literature sections.” Faced with a moribund cultural scene in the Gaza Strip and an acute shortage of public libraries, Jabaliya's children will have to wait for next year to revisit Gaza’s mobile library and read the storybooks they like.

The story Hajjaj chose for her son held special meaning for the Palestinian situation. The book tells the story of a fox that destroyed the house of a rabbit it was hunting. The rabbit turned to the lion for help, but the lion also tried to devour the small animal. The rabbit was able to escape again and asked for help from the bear, who also tried to feast on the rabbit. The rabbit got the same response from the tiger and the elephant. Finally, the rabbit decided that the only solution was for all the rabbits to unite against the fox and defeat the predator. The moral of this story is that Palestinians need to be united and achieve national reconciliation in order to confront Israel's occupation. As for Mohammad Abu Warda, 13, he wishes there were a permanent library in his town, so he could visit it and borrow books. He told Al-Monitor that no one cares about building libraries there. Askalani told Al-Monitor, “The bookmobile is equipped with tables and seats, and is accompanied by a storyteller whose job is to tell children stories.” He said that the library contains over 200 titles, and children are allowed to go in and choose any they like to enjoy during the minibus' stop. However, each visit lasts only an hour, and then the bookmobile leaves for another place to reach the largest possible number of children across Gaza. The idea, said Askalani, was met with great enthusiasm from both children and parents who ask for more visits. With a population of 2 million in an area of 365 square kilometers (227 miles), the Gaza Strip contains just 15 public libraries, according to the general manager of exhibitions and libraries at the Ministry of Culture, Mohammad al-Sharif. Sharif told Al-Monitor, “The shortage of libraries is due to the lack of space. Ideally, each municipality should have a public library. But there is rarely any space available for a library in municipal buildings. This is why residents of many areas don’t have access to libraries close to their homes.” Religious institutions in Gaza often provide small libraries for visitors, usually at the ground floor of mosques. But most of the books there are religious, and literary and scientific books are scarce. These libraries are not usually inviting places to sit and read, but more often simply book storage areas. The book collection at the Brighter Tomorrow Cultural Center is the only such facility in Jabaliya, which stretches over an area of 18 square kilometers (11 square miles), with 220,000 residents. Asma Hammouda, a librarian there, said that the library was established through the Young Women’s Muslim Association, a civil institution in Gaza, in January. It's very small, with an inventory of approximately 600 books. “At best, only 20 children visit the library per day. Sometimes, we have no visitors because parents and children don’t know about the library,” she added. Visitors to this library will readily notice its focus on religious content. The religion section is piled high with books, but other topics like literature, science and art take up very little space. Only 10 books make up the literature section. Asked about why the library is rich with religious books at the expense of scientific and literature books, Hammouda said, “This is not intentional at all. The presence of a large number of religious books compared to other books is because the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs has sent us a great deal to be included. At present, work is underway to provide more books for the scientific and literature sections.” Faced with a moribund cultural scene in the Gaza Strip and an acute shortage of public libraries, Jabaliya's children will have to wait for next year to revisit Gaza’s mobile library and read the storybooks they like.

News article:
Senior Hamas leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh said Sunday he is working to ensure money sent to the terror group by Qatar will be used to pay “military personnel” alongside civilian government employees. The Times of Israel reported recently that Qatar agreed to transfer some 113 Saudi riyal ($31 million) to Hamas in order to pay the salaries of the group’s employees in the Strip. Over the past three years, Hamas employees have generally been receiving a third to half of their salaries. According to a statement published on Hamas’s website, Haniyeh is in contact with various “government agencies” in Gaza to support the payment of the group’s “military personnel” with the Qatari money. In the statement, the senior Hamas leader lashed out against “parties” in Gaza who attempt to distinguish between the military and civilian branches of the organization. Haniyeh demanded that both military and civilians are considered “legitimate” employees who are “appointed by the decision of a legitimate government.” Haniyeh did not indicate which “parties” had called for there to be a difference between the two branches of Hamas, or indeed whether those parties were strictly Palestinian or international officials present in the Strip.

The UN, however, has attempted to differentiate between the Islamist group’s political and military wing, known as the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. According to the Palestinian daily al-Quds, the Qatari payment came after Israel agreed to the emirate’s request to pay Hamas employees. This was a drastic shift in policy from 2014, when a similar plan presented by then-UN envoy to the region Robert Serry was struck down. Avi Issacharoff contributed to this report.

News article:
Riyadh has cut oil prices to Asia by $1.60 per barrel, the most in 10 months, signaling mounting competition with fellow OPEC member Iran. Saudi Arabia is ramping up exports to regain market share. State-run Saudi Aramco plans to sell Arab Light crude at $1.10 per barrel below the Asian regional benchmark, starting September. Experts had expected a $1 per barrel drop. Prices for Light and Extra Light crude for US clients was cut by 20 cents and 40 cents respectively with the Medium and Heavy grades left unchanged. The company raised prices on all grades except Extra Light to northwest Europe and the Mediterranean. Tehran has boosted crude output 25 percent in 2016 aiming to reach daily production of four million barrels by the end of the year. According to shipping data, the Asian market makes up the largest share of Iranian sales. Since January when international sanctions restricting its exports were lifted, Iran has managed to become OPEC's third-biggest producer. Saudi Arabia has responded by increasing exports of its oil and refined products. “This is a throw down challenge that I’m sure the Iranians will match,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital as quoted by Bloomberg, adding that the market battle between the two rivals was back on in a big way. Demand for crude in Asia is currently slowing with refineries cutting production due to a slump in margins and constantly rising supply from state-owned corporations. Since the start of the year Brent crude rose 17 percent as a result of supply disruptions in Nigeria and Canada. However crude prices have slipped in the last three months and are still 12 percent lower compared to a year ago. Iran predicts balance will be restored to the oil market. “The oil market is oversupplied now but there are expectations that there will be a balance between demand and supply in the market,” said Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh in an interview with Iranian state television on Monday.

Riyadh said it pumped 10.67 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in July, its biggest monthly output. Saudi oil production usually peaks in the summer, and it’s a sign it won’t curb output despite plummeting prices and will stay focused on market share. Total OPEC daily production was up 46,000 barrels to 33.11 million bpd. Saudi Arabia’s previous production high was 10.56 million (bpd) in June 2015. “It’s not surprising to see Saudi output at a record. The Saudis didn’t want to cut back on exports and they needed to produce more to meet local summer demand. Also, the Saudis are processing more crude this year at refineries as they want to grow in the products market,” analyst Anas al-Hajji told Bloomberg. And there it is: Saudi Arabia reports July crude output at 10.67m b/d - a new all-time high - in latest #Opec report pic.twitter.com/zNOKb6XzD1 — Nader Itayim (@ncitayim) August 10, 2016 Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries across the globe to burn crude oil for electricity. In the two hottest months of the year, July and August, people in the country turn on air conditioners more often, increasing the demand for crude. Global oil prices declined almost 15 percent in July over concerns oversupply of crude and finished products would delay the rebalancing of the market. However, prices didn’t fall because of Saudi production news, trading flat at $45.19 for Brent and $42.89 for US WTI. “Lower-than-predicted demand, high refined product stocks during the peak summer driving season and rising crude supply … have all significantly exerted pressure over the month,” OPEC said in its monthly report. The cartel expects demand for its oil to average 33.01 million bpd next year, which suggests a daily surplus of 100,000 barrels. OPEC will meet in September at a conference in Algiers to continue talks on stabilizing the market, Qatar Energy Minister Mohammed Al Sada said on Monday. In April, the talks on a production freeze between Russia, OPEC and other oil producers collapsed after Saudi Arabia demanded rival Iran to be part of the deal. Tehran ruled out any production cuts at the time, aiming to produce a pre-sanction level of four million bpd. On Tuesday, Iran said its exports have regained 2.5 million bpd, last seen before sanctions were imposed on Tehran over its nuclear program. The country has not expressed a readiness to talk about an output freeze.

News article:
DUBAI (Reuters) - Russia, the world’s top oil producer, is consulting with Saudi Arabia and other producers to achieve oil market stability, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, adding that the door is still open for more discussions on freezing output levels if needed. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak attends a session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2016 (SPIEF 2016) in St. Petersburg, Russia June 16, 2016. REUTERS/Kirill Kukhmar/TASS/Host Photo Agency/Pool In an interview published on Monday Novak also told Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat that a complete return of market stability is only likely in 2017. “With regard to the cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the dialogue between our two countries is developing in a tangible way, whether in the framework of a multi-party structure or on a bilateral level,” Novak was quoted as saying. “We are cooperating in the framework of consultations regarding the oil market with OPEC countries and producers from outside the organization, and are determined to continue dialogue to achieve market stability,” he said. “We are ready to achieve the widest possible level of coordination... and put in place joint measures to achieve oil market stability, with the condition that these measures will not be for a limited period of time.” Novak’s comments come only days after Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would work with OPEC and non-OPEC members to help stabilize oil markets.

News article:
Saudi signals it may hit new oil output record ahead of freeze talks-sources By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Rania El Gamal MOSCOW/DUBAI, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is sending signals that it could boost its crude oil supplies in August to a new record level, overtaking Russia, the world's top oil producer, as it gets ready for tough talks next month for a global output freeze pact. Industry sources say the kingdom, already the world's largest oil exporter, started to raise production from June, after holding it steady for the first half of the year, to meet rising seasonal domestic demand as well as higher exports requirements. Higher production could give it more leverage during talks in September when both OPEC and non-OPEC producers are expected to revive a freeze deal to support oil prices, the sources say. In June, Saudi Arabia pumped 10.55 million barrels of oil per day, and lifted production to 10.67 million bpd in July, the highest in its history. Now the sources expect the OPEC heavyweight to raise its crude supplies to a further record this month as demand inside and outside the kingdom looks healthy. One source from outside OPEC said the Saudis were quietly telling the market output could rise further in August to as high as 10.8-10.9 million bpd. Last week, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih sought to clarify why the kingdom hiked its production in July in an over supplied market. In a statement, Falih explained the rise was due to rising seasonal domestic demand and customers asking for more oil worldwide. "Despite the bearish sentiment engulfing the market, we still see strong demand for our crude in most parts of the world, especially as supply outside OPEC has been declining fast, supply outages increasing, and global demand still showing signs of strength," he told state news agency SPA. The amount of crude supplied to the market in July was 10.75 million bpd, above actual output as Saudi drew down the additional barrels from its huge inventories, SPA reported. Oil prices dropped to $27 per barrel in January from as high as $115 in mid-2014, hitting the budgets of oil exporters worldwide, including Saudi Arabia, and resulting in a record fiscal deficit for Riyadh. A previous attempt to freeze output at January levels to support prices collapsed in April after Saudi Arabia said it wanted all producers, including Iran, to join the initiative. But since the appointment of Falih in April, Saudi Arabia has taken a softer tone towards Iran at OPEC. [ID: nL8N18V24S] OPEC sources say the group will probably revive talks on freezing output when it meets non-OPEC nations next month in Algeria as Riyadh appears to want higher prices, but agreeing a level to freeze supplies is the main obstacle to a deal. In January when the freeze idea first emerged, Saudi Arabia was producing 10.2 million bpd. Russia, which back in April was ready to freeze production in the first coordinated action with OPEC since 2001, also signalled it would continue boosting output. Its output currently hovers near an all time high of 10.85 million bpd and Russian officials expect it to edge up further next year. And Iran, OPEC's third biggest producer, has raised its production to 3.850 million bpd now from 3.37 million bpd in January and said it will not join any freeze initiative until it reaches its pre-sanction output level of 4 million bpd.

News article:
Iran signals more willingness for OPEC action to boost oil price By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler DUBAI/LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Iran is sending positive signals that it may support joint action to prop up the oil market, sources in OPEC and the oil industry said, potentially aiding efforts to revive a global deal on freezing production levels at talks next month. OPEC's third-largest producer has been boosting output after the lifting of Western sanctions in January. Tehran refused to join a previous attempt this year by OPEC plus non-members such as Russia to stabilise production, and talks collapsed in April. Though Iran has not yet decided whether to join a new effort, Tehran appears to be more willing to reach an understanding with other oil producers, the sources said. Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino last week toured oil-producing countries including Saudi Arabia and Iran to rally support for a deal. Despite rising this year, oil at around $49 a barrel is less than half its level of mid-2014. "Iran is reaching its pre-sanctions production level soon and after that it can cooperate with the others," said a source familiar with Iranian thinking after del Pino's visit to Tehran. "In general, Iran prefers more actions from the OPEC side rather than just freezing at the maximum production level of all members. If this freezing issue helps prices to improve, Iran by positive words of support, will help." Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are due to meet informally in Algeria next month on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum. Russia is also expected to attend the IEF. Venezuela, whose economy has been hit hard by the oil price collapse, has for months sought to rally producers towards an agreement to limit production. Del Pino was in Tehran on Aug. 15 before flying to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. Iran confirmed its participation in the OPEC meeting in Algeria, an OPEC source said on Tuesday. 'POSITIVE SIGNS' Russia, which in April was ready to freeze production, now wants to see an internal agreement among OPEC before it commits to rejoining an initiative. "Negotiations are ongoing. I see positive signs coming from OPEC 'majors'," said a senior industry source familiar with the discussions, referring to Riyadh and Tehran. "Russia wants to see an OPEC agreement before committing anything. So (OPEC members) are busy among themselves formulating an agreement." OPEC sources say Iran's participation in a production pact has been the main stumbling block in reaching a deal. The previous attempt to freeze output at January levels collapsed in April after Saudi Arabia said it wanted all producers, including Iran, to join the initiative. Tehran insists it will be ready for joint action only once it regains pre-sanctions output of 4 million barrels per day (bpd). It pumped 3.6 million bpd in July, OPEC figures show. But since the appointment of Khalid al-Falih as Saudi energy minister in April, Riyadh has taken a softer tone towards Iran at OPEC. The group is likely to revive freeze talks in September as Saudi Arabia appears to want higher prices. Besides Iran, output levels in Nigeria and Libya could also complicate reaching a deal. While Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia have reached record production since April, Nigeria's hit its lowest in more than two decades due to attacks on oil sites. Libya is pumping a fraction of its pre-conflict rate. "The difficult question for all will be defining the freeze - at what level of production. Agreeing a number may be a challenge - unless they all agree to allow some form of flexibility?" the senior industry source said. An OPEC source from a main Middle East oil producer agreed.

Iran might delay making a decision until the day before the gathering, a spokesman for the country’s Oil Ministry said, asking not to be identified. Two Opec delegates, who also asked not to be identified discussing a private matter, said Iran has written to fellow members confirming it will participate. The talks, due to take place during an industry conference on September 26 to 28, have fanned speculation the Opec could revive an accord to freeze production with non-members such as Russia. A similar initiative collapsed in April after Saudi Arabia insisted on the participation of Iran, which refused as it was restoring output previously curbed by sanctions. Iran’s position hasn’t changed since the April talks, and while the country supports action to stabilise the market, it won’t participate in a freeze before regaining its pre-sanctions share of Opec output, a delegate for the organisation said last week. Former Opec president Chakib Khelil said earlier this month that Iran’s efforts to ramp up production this year might make it more receptive to an output cap. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh weighed up whether to attend the previous oil-freeze talks in Doha in mid-April, ultimately deciding not to. Opec’s new secretary-general, Mohammad Barkindo, will visit Iran and Qatar early next month, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. Venezuelan Energy Minister Eulogio Del Pino, who helped organise the failed Doha negotiations, also has been touring oil-producing nations as he seeks an accord to stabilise the market. London: Opec’s secretary-general will visit members Iran and Qatar next month, just weeks before the group holds informal talks in Algeria, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Mohammad Barkindo, who became the organisation’s chief diplomat this month, met earlier this week with Venezuelan Energy Minister Eulogio Del Pino, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the discussions were private. Del Pino, who has pushed the group to take action that would revive crude prices, has been touring oil-producing countries. Barkindo’s visits were earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. Oil prices have gained 13 per cent in the past two weeks on speculation the group could revive an agreement to freeze production with non-members such as Russia, after a similar initiative collapsed in April. — Bloomberg

Iran refused to accept a freeze earlier this year, having just emerged from international sanctions and keen to maximise its oil revenues, but rumours this week that it may have changed its position have led to a 10 percent spike in prices, according to Bloomberg. Zanganeh did not comment on whether Iran, OPEC's third-biggest producer, would support a cap on production at the September meeting. He did mention that OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo will be visiting Iran "in the near future," according to the Shana agency. Adding to the difficulties of reaching an agreement, tensions have spiked in recent months with regional rival Saudi Arabia, the dominant member of OPEC. Iran says it has doubled its exports of oil and gas to 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) since signing an accord with world powers in July 2015 that removed sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.

News article:
Oil recovers as Iran confirms it will meet OPEC in Algeria Fuelling speculation of co-ordinated action to prop up prices in the face of persistent oversupply Oil prices reversed their losses on Thursday after Iran confirmed it would attend a meeting of Opec ministers in Algeria next month, according to the country’s state news agency Shana. For several days oil prices had escalated in response to reports that Bijan Zanganeh would attend the gathering on the sidelines of an industry conference in late September. This has fuelled speculation that Iran may take part in any co-ordinated action among producer countries to prop up the oil market. Iran has still not said it will soften its stance for joining in any output limits. Earlier this year, talks for a production freeze between Opec and countries outside the cartel such as Russia ended in failure after Saudi Arabia refused to participate in any deal without Iran. Tehran did not attend the April gathering in Doha and said it would not curb its production until it had reached levels it had before the imposition of Western sanctions on its oil industry. Iran has been boosting output since restrictions were eased in January but production still stands at 3.85m barrels a day, the country’s president Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday. This is short of pre-sanctions levels above 4m b/d, calling into question Iran’s ability to reach this level. In recent weeks Opec producers, including Venezuela, have made renewed attempts for co-operation after oil prices came under pressure again, dropping towards $40 a barrel in July. The new Opec secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo is due to visit Iran and Qatar early next month, a person familiar with the situation said. Iran and Ecuador on Wednesday discussed ways the two countries can strengthen their positions in oil markets, said Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Wednesday. Ecuador, which is among Opec’s smallest producers, has consistently supported Venezuela’s push over the past two years for production limits even as economically stronger members have remained more focused on retaining market share. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al Falih told Reuters on Thursday there are no “discussions of substance” yet on Opec production levels. He said he did not believe any significant intervention in the market was neccessary. Speaking from a business summit in California, he said Saudi production in August has held around last month’s record levels, when it reached 10.7m b/d. Mr Falih said earlier this month the kingdom could participate in co-ordinated action to help balance the oil market if needed. While analysts are still sceptical about any deal next month, they also say a production freeze will do little for market balances as many producer countries are pumping at heightened levels. Iraq’s prime minister said on Tuesday the country had not fully regained its lost market share, signalling his government may not restrain its crude production as part of any possible deal. Brent crude edged higher by 45 cents to $49.48 a barrel in afternoon trading, after falling as low as $48.70 a barrel. The US marker West Texas Intermediate increased 26 cents to $47.03 a barrel following a drop to $46.42. Earlier in the day traders remained focused on US energy department data published on Wednesday which showed high levels of oil stockpiles. Commercial crude oil stocks rose 2.5m barrels to 523.6m barrels, signalling a persistent supply overhang.

News article:
By OilPrice.com By Rakesh Upadhyay It’s possible that OPEC is crying wolf with hints of an output freeze next month in Algiers; but it’s also possible that they are ramping up production to take the sting out of a freeze. This is a delicate balancing act that the Saudis need to play very carefully. The official chatter is that the OPEC meeting in Algeria from September 26 to 28 could conclude with an agreement to freeze production by the member nations, with even Russia joining forces in a freeze that may prevent further oil price erosion. But everyone’s a bit gun-shy after the false hopes of the last round in Doha—even if a freeze at levels that existed then wouldn’t have meant much either—and it’s hard to blame them. The question is, how many times can the Saudis cry wolf without forever losing the ability to leverage this chatter to affect a rise in oil prices? But lets rewind a bit to the nature of the recent chatter. The Saudi Energy Minister has indicated that Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, is willing to proceed with a production freeze. “We are, in Saudi Arabia, watching the market closely, and if there is a need to take any action to help the market rebalance, then we would, of course in cooperation with OPEC and major non-OPEC exporters,” said Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih, reports Reuters. “We are going to have a ministerial meeting of the International Energy Forum in Algeria next month, and there is an opportunity for OPEC and major exporting non-OPEC ministers to meet and discuss the market situation, including any possible action that may be required to stabilize the market.” The hopes of reaching an agreement in Doha were scuttled by Saudi Arabia, because it wanted its arch rival, Iran, to participate in the freeze. Unfortunately for oil prices, Iran had made it clear that it would not join any such discussion until they reached pre-sanction levels of oil production. What has changed from Doha to Algeria? Iran Iran’s oil production is close to its pre-sanction levels, meaning that its first cited prerequisite for any discussion has now been met—a criteria that was not met at the time of the Doha meeting. In addition, increasing oil production further by Iran is a big ask—it would need billions of dollars worth of investments in both upstream and downstream facilities to make this happen. With oil prices languishing below $50 a barrel, major oil companies are reluctant to commit huge sums of money for new oil projects. Iran’s oilfields are mature, and more than half of its wells have an annual decline rate of 9 percent to 11 percent, according to Michael Cohen, an analyst at Barclays in New York. Therefore, at their existing production levels, they need an additional 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day annually to replace the shortfall from their aging wells. Iran needs more money and investment to continue pumping at the current rate, making it more likely for Iran to agree to some kind of an arrangement where they continue to pump oil at a rate close to their target of 4 million barrels a day. That said, the last thing that Iran wants is to be sidelined, so Tehran is bound to make its presence felt at the meeting with strong statements. But at the end of the day, it is unlikely that Iran will scuttle an agreement where it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. “There may be a little bit more to it this time. I’m still very skeptical, but it’s just with Iran being where they are production-wise, they’ll be more inclined to eventually go along with a deal,” said Again Capital’s John Kilduff, reports CNBC. Saudi Arabia The oil-rich nation underestimated the resilience of the U.S. shale oil drillers when they declared war on them in 2014. American oil has not only kept flowing—the shale producers have managed to bring down production costs considerably. This ability was not anticipated by Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has burned more than $175 billion in reserves since August 2014. The Saudis have introduced austerity measures and plans to monetize their crown jewel Saudi Aramco to survive the oil downturn. Nevertheless, things are not going well for this nation, which youth is struggling to find jobs as shown in the chart below. A large population of unemployed youths who cannot take care of their families can sow seeds of frustration, and the Arab Spring will still be fresh in the memory of the rulers. Saudi Arabia is struggling to grow in this oil downturn. Barring the 2009 dip, the current growth rate of 1.5 percent is the worst in a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If oil prices remain low, the Saudi plan to sell shares in Saudi Aramco might not fetch them the valuations they expect, and a nation that cannot provide the most basic of amenities—food for its foreign workers—says a lot about their financial condition. Saudi Arabia has seen the recent slide in crude oil prices towards the $40/barrel mark, which could have gone deeper without the chatter of a production freeze. And since they have already cried wolf once in Doha, doing so again in Algiers decrease the importance of any ‘chatter’ leverage they have in the future. Rest of the nations already onboard Barring Iran and Saudi Arabia, the rest of the nations were in agreement about the need to freeze production during the Doha meeting. From OPEC to Russia, everyone is at record production levels The oil-producing nations want to ensure that even if there are talks of a production freeze, they should not feel the pinch. Hence, even before the meeting, they will try to produce more, rather than less. The recent ramping up may very well be an indication that a freeze—although at a level higher than what would have likely come out of the Doha meeting—may be on the horizon. The oil markets are so sensitive that even a statement of agreement by OPEC at the end of the meeting is enough to send oil prices flying above the resistance level of $51 a barrel. What about the shale oil producers? Though U.S. production is declining and experiencing a flurry of bankruptcies, the remaining companies are much better positioned to continue pumping at lower levels to survive the downturn. Though the risk remains that the shale oil drillers will come back in full force when oil prices recover, the risk is worth taking. OPEC and Russia have realized that any new world order will have to include the shale oil companies. They are a large enough force not to be neglected or defeated. With all of this in mind, an agreement between OPEC and Russia is more feasible in Algiers than it was in Doha. It might not mean much though, with output levels soaring ahead of the meeting. A freeze at current levels—or levels reached by the time of the meeting—won’t do much to change the fundamentals, nor is there any indication that a freeze would have long legs.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Sept. 2 By Emil Ilgar – Trend: OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo will pay an official visit to Qatar on Sep. 4 one day before his trip to Iran, an Iranian source told Trend Sep. 2 on conditions of anonymity. Barkindo is scheduled to visit Tehran Sept. 5 and meet with Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh to convince Tehran to join an oil freeze plan. According to the Iranian source, Barkindo had a meeting with Iran’s Ambassador to Vienna Ebadollah Molaei two weeks ago as well. The oil freeze plan as well as reviewing the market situations and outlook of the supply and demand in the oil market are expected to be discussed during Barkindo’s meetings with Qatari and Iranian officials. OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. Iran’s oil minister has confirmed that he will take part in the upcoming meeting, aimed at a "common action" to support the global oil prices. It is expected that the talks on oil production freeze be held with OPEC members as well as non-members. Iran has been called on by many countries, the rival Saudi Arabia in particular, to cooperate with the proposal to hold outputs at January levels. Tehran has rejected the idea as an imposition of a new set of sanctions on Iran after the country was freed of economic sanctions in the same month. Iran’s oil output stood at 3.9 million barrels per day (mbpd) before sanctions brought it down to 2.8 mbpd. The output now stands at 3.7 mbpd. Saudi Arabia and some other countries used Iran’s partial absence from the market under sanctions to export beyond their OPEC quotas, with the result that the OPEC output for July stood at 33.44 mbpd while the official ceiling is 30.45 mbpd.

Saudi Arabia and some other countries used Iran’s partial absence from the market under sanctions to export beyond their OPEC quotas, with the result that the OPEC output for July stood at 33.44 mbpd while the official ceiling is 30.45 mbpd.

News article:
Iran ready to help restore oil market balance after it regains share - official DUBAI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Iran is ready to support any decision to help restore balance to the oil market after it regains its pre-sanctions market share, the Iranian oil ministry's SHANA news agency reported on Saturday, quoting a minister. Algerian Energy Minister Nouredine Bouterfa said after talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart, Bijan Zanganeh, that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) wanted an oil price of between $50-60 a barrel, according to SHANA "Deputy Petroleum Minister in International Affairs and Trading Amir Hossein Zamaninia voiced Iran's support for any decision that would help restore balance in the oil market, saying the country can only be cooperative in this field once it regains its pre-sanctions oil market share," SHANA said. Global oversupply in oil had knocked crude prices down from mid-2014 highs above $100 a barrel to a 12-year lows earlier this year of around $27 a barrel. Brent has since rebounded and was trading at around $49 a barrel last week. Iran, OPEC's third largest producer, has been sending positive signals that it may support joint action to prop up the oil market, potentially aiding efforts to revive a global deal on freezing production levels. Members of OPEC will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. Zanganeh has confirmed that he will attend the Algeria meeting. Zamaninia said OPEC countries need to find a way to revive the quota system. "Naturally, if a country wants to produce at its full capacity, there will not be any balance in the market," Zamaninia said, without naming any country, but in an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia. SHANA said that after the meeting with Zanganeh, Bouterfa told the agency that a crude oil price of $50 per barrel was "unacceptable".

News article:
ALGIERS — Algeria’s energy minister will meet his Saudi counterpart and OPEC’s secretary-general in Paris on Friday as part of moves towards clinching a global deal on stabilising crude output to support oil prices, an Algerian official and OPEC sources said. Algeria will host the informal meeting with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih and OPEC’s Mohammed Barkindo, said the Algerian official, who asked not to be identified. A source at the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed the meeting as part of a push for an output deal, with producers battered by a glut-induced halving of oil prices over the past two years. “There is a strong move towards a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC to at least freeze production,” the source told Reuters. “It seems we are going in this direction. But if we are going to freeze, we have to use secondary sources to gauge production levels. We can’t allow each country to use a different method,” the source said. “Iran must agree to be in line with other producers and use secondary sources.” Tehran says it supports any measures to stabilise the market. However, it has stopped short of indicating whether it would join a global deal before its production reaches 4 million barrels per day (bpd), the level at which it says it was pumping before the imposition of Western sanctions in 2012. The sanctions ended in January this year. Iran has been the main factor preventing an output deal between OPEC and non-OPEC Russia as Tehran has said it should be excluded from any such agreement before its production recovers. The OPEC source said Iran’s production before sanctions had never exceeded 3.75 million bpd according to secondary sources, which include consultants and industry media that estimate output independently. Iran has said it is producing slightly more than 3.8 million bpd. It signalled on Tuesday it was prepared to work with Saudi Arabia and Russia to prop up prices, although Tehran has begun to bargain with OPEC on possible exemptions from any output cap. The OPEC source said major oil producers were trying to convince Tehran to come onboard, adding there was an initial understanding that only Libya could be offered an exemption. “Now there is a push to smooth things out and solve any problem,” the OPEC source said, adding there had been no agreement yet on any level at which to freeze production. “This will be discussed in Algeria,” the source said. Algeria is hosting meetings of the International Energy Forum and OPEC on September 26-28. Energy Minister Noureddine Bouterfa travelled to Moscow on Thursday, following recent trips to Qatar and Iran. OPEC and Russia are expected to revive talks for a global deal on production in Algeria. A similar initiative failed in April after Saudi Arabia insisted Iran join the pact.

News article:
London: Iraq has given fellow Opec members the level of crude production at which it would be prepared to freeze output, according to the top official at the state oil marketing company. The second-biggest producer in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries could support a freeze “for a certain period,” Falah Al Amri, the director general of Iraq’s Oil Marketing Co, known as SOMO, said in an interview in Singapore on Thursday. He didn’t give any further details about the level at which the country is prepared to hold its production. Speculation that the world’s biggest oil suppliers will agree to coordinated action aimed at controlling output when they meet in Algiers this month has whipsawed global prices. Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world’s biggest producers, this week pledged to cooperate to stabilise global markets, while failing to announce any specific measures. If oil prices rise because of a freeze, that would make up for suspending plans to raise output, according to Al Amri. “We gave them a number at which we could freeze,” he said. “Output plans and a freeze are not contradictory. If a freeze means higher prices, then that compensates for not increasing production.” The nation’s oil production will continue to grow, rising by 100,000 to 150,000 barrels a day annually in the near-term, Al Amri said earlier at a conference in the city. The country plans to pump 6 million barrels a day by 2020. It currently produces about 4.48 million barrels daily, according to Bloomberg estimates. No hurry “Iraq does not want to flood the market with oil; others might, but we don’t,” he said. “We are not in a hurry. We just want to increase our production quietly.” Crude has gained about 10 per cent since Opec said in August that it will hold talks in Algiers. Brent, the global benchmark, was up 1.5 per cent at $48.68 a barrel by 3:50pm. Singapore time on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, was 1.8 per cent higher at $46.32 a barrel in New York. Separately, an official from Iran’s national oil company said it will be too early for the country to discuss freezing crude output in Algiers. Iran will be ready to decide on capping production once output reaches the level it was before international sanctions were imposed on the country, Mohsen Ghamsari, director for international affairs at state-run National Iranian Oil Co, said in an interview in Singapore. That’s “slightly” above 4 million barrels a day, which may be achieved by the end of 2016 or early next year, he said. The nation is currently pumping about 3.8 million barrels daily.

Energy Minister Noureddine Bouterfa traveled to Moscow on Thursday, following recent trips to Qatar and Iran. OPEC and Russia are expected to revive talks for a global deal on production in Algeria. Meanwhile, oil prices soared Thursday on official data revealing the biggest weekly slump in US crude stockpiles for 17 years — a hugely surprising reading that eased concerns over a supply glut. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic rallied by more than 3.5 percent, with Brent closing in again on $50 a barrel — after the US Department of Energy (DoE) said inventories of commercial crude tumbled last week, confounding analyst expectations for a modest rise. "The 14.5 million-barrels decline was the biggest (weekly) fall since 1999 and oil prices have absolutely soared higher," said Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada. He cautioned however that being only one week's worth of data, "it remains to be seen... whether the trend can be sustained". Razaqzada added: "For oil prices to rise significantly, we will need to see some further large drops in US oil inventories as they are still near record high levels." Around 1600 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October was up $1.69 at $47.19 a barrel. Brent North Sea crude for November jumped $1.67 to $49.65, compared with the close on Wednesday. Industry-compiled data Wednesday from the American Petroleum Institute meanwhile showed that US crude inventories fell 12.1 million barrels last week, helping also to lift oil prices ahead of the DoE figures. Crude futures have rallied in recent days also thanks to a softer dollar making greenback-denominated crude cheaper for holders of rival currencies.

Meanwhile, oil prices soared Thursday on official data revealing the biggest weekly slump in US crude stockpiles for 17 years — a hugely surprising reading that eased concerns over a supply glut. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic rallied by more than 3.5 percent, with Brent closing in again on $50 a barrel — after the US Department of Energy (DoE) said inventories of commercial crude tumbled last week, confounding analyst expectations for a modest rise. "The 14.5 million-barrels decline was the biggest (weekly) fall since 1999 and oil prices have absolutely soared higher," said Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada. He cautioned however that being only one week's worth of data, "it remains to be seen... whether the trend can be sustained". Razaqzada added: "For oil prices to rise significantly, we will need to see some further large drops in US oil inventories as they are still near record high levels." Around 1600 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October was up $1.69 at $47.19 a barrel. Brent North Sea crude for November jumped $1.67 to $49.65, compared with the close on Wednesday. Industry-compiled data Wednesday from the American Petroleum Institute meanwhile showed that US crude inventories fell 12.1 million barrels last week, helping also to lift oil prices ahead of the DoE figures. Crude futures have rallied in recent days also thanks to a softer dollar making greenback-denominated crude cheaper for holders of rival currencies.

ALGIERS: Algeria's energy minister will meet his Saudi counterpart and OPEC's secretary-general in Paris on Friday as part of moves toward clinching a global deal on stabilizing crude output to support oil prices, an Algerian official and OPEC sources said. Algeria will host the informal meeting with Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Khalid Al-Falih and OPEC's Mohammed Barkindo, said the Algerian official, who asked not to be identified. A source at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed the meeting as part of a push for an output deal, with producers battered by a glut-induced halving of oil prices over the past two years. "There is a strong move toward a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC to at least freeze production," the source told Reuters. "It seems we are going in this direction. But if we are going to freeze, we have to use secondary sources to gauge production levels. We can't allow each country to use a different method," the source said. "Iran must agree to be in line with other producers and use secondary sources." Tehran says it supports any measures to stabilize the market. However, it has stopped short of indicating whether it would join a global deal before its production reaches 4 million barrels per day, the level at which it says it was pumping before the imposition of Western sanctions in 2012. The sanctions ended in January this year. The OPEC source said major oil producers were trying to convince Tehran to come onboard, adding there was an initial understanding that only Libya could be offered an exemption. "Now there is a push to smooth things out and solve any problem," the OPEC source said, adding there had been no agreement yet on any level at which to freeze production. "This will be discussed in Algeria," the source said. Algeria is hosting meetings of the International Energy Forum and OPEC on Sept. 26-28. Energy Minister Noureddine Bouterfa traveled to Moscow on Thursday, following recent trips to Qatar and Iran. OPEC and Russia are expected to revive talks for a global deal on production in Algeria.

News article:
LONDON/MOSCOW: The energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Algeria will meet with Opec’s top official later on Friday as major oil producers continue to lay the ground for a potential deal to bolster crude prices in Algiers this month. Algerian Energy Minister Noor Al Deen Bouterfa told reporters in Moscow that he will hold talks with his Saudi counterpart Khalid Al Falih and Mohammad Barkindo, secretary-general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in Paris Friday afternoon. He declined to comment on the agenda of the meeting. After two years of a Saudi-led strategy of all-out pumping, adopted to protect market share against the surge in US shale oil, crude is still trading at half its 2014 level and major producers are putting cooperation to stabilise the market back on the table. Opec and Russia — which together produce more than half the world’s oil — will hold informal talks in the Algerian capital later this month, raising expectations that a deal to freeze output that failed in April could be revived. For a story on four scenarios for nations attending the Algiers talks, click here. Bouterfa was speaking before a meeting with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in Moscow. A freeze in production by Opec and Russia would be the most effective way of stabilising the market, Novak said in a joint press conference at the G20 summit in China with his Saudi counterpart on Sept. 5. Novak said his country is ready to cap output at the level of any month in the second half of this year, a period that so far has delivered record volumes from both Russia and Opec. Iraq has already given fellow Opec members the level of crude production at which it would be prepared to freeze output, Falah Al-Amri, the director general of Iraq’s Oil Marketing Co., known as SOMO, said Thursday at a conference in Singapore. It will be too early for Iran to discuss freezing crude output when the world’s biggest producers meet later this month in Algiers, Mohsen Ghamsari, director for international affairs at state-run National Iranian Oil Co., said at the same event. The April talks on freezing production collapsed in acrimony because Saudi Arabia insisted that Iran should join, while the Persian nation said it would keep increasing output after the lifting of international sanctions.

News article:
Oil producers in Iran and Saudi Arabia are increasing production just before negotiations on capping output are about to begin. Last month, the two countries increased oil output by more than any other OPEC member, according to the organization's latest data. OPEC producers are currently pumping nearly 33.2 million barrels per day. July production set an all-time high for the cartel. Largely due to global oversupply, crude prices have fallen from a 2014 high of $114 per barrel to the current price of $45-$50. The world's largest oil producers led by Russia are planning to negotiate an output freeze with OPEC during an informal meeting in Algeria at the end of September. Initially, the deal was proposed in February, but an attempt to come to an agreement failed as Iran refused to cap production seeking to reach pre-sanction levels. Earlier this month, Moscow and Riyadh called on the largest producers to cooperate in supporting the oil market. The move sent global crude prices surging. Last week, Tehran voiced plans to continue boosting its oil output to pre-sanction levels over the next couple of months, worsening tension with rival Saudi Arabia. READ MORE: Crude prices rising on shrinking US reserves, rising Asia demand Iran’s oil output has already reached 3.8 million barrels, according to Seyed Mohsen Ghamsari, the Director for International Affairs at the National Iranian Oil Company. Before Iran faced international sanctions, output hovered around four million barrels.

Dubai: The supply glut is just worsening by the day, and even the prices. After vows to stabilise the oil market by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and non-Opec members, now more supplies from Nigeria and Libya are threatening the recent price recovery ahead of the much anticipated oil producers meeting in Algeria next week. Production from Nigeria and Libya hit 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, almost half of 2013 production levels. Any additional supplies is expected to add to the current overhang of supplies, which according to the International Energy Agency will last deep into 2017. Oil prices, which recovered more than 60 per cent after prices hit a 12 years low to sub-$30 per barrel in January, traded at $45 per barrel on Friday. “With these extra barrels potentially hitting the market, the pressure on prices and the need for other producers to cut production may continue to weigh on prices. This at a time of year where crude oil prices from a seasonal perspective tend to trade lower,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank said. Analysts are not sure of a deal even as Iran and Saudi Arabia have been raising exports despite the approaching meeting from September 26 to 28 in Algeria. “I am sceptical not only about the willingness of Saudi, the Opec in general, and Russia to reach an agreement, but also about the capacity of such agreement to impact prices,” Francisco Quintana, Head of Strategy at Foresight Advisors said over email. “I am still comfortable with a 10 per cent range around the $50 benchmark as the final target for the year,” Quintana said. At the G20 meeting in China earlier in the month, Saudi Arabia and Russia vowed to undertake necessary steps to stabilise the oil market, but gave no concrete details. Other countries like the UAE, Kuwait also welcomed and agreed to support any moves. However, about the supply and demand dynamics and recent estimates by IEA and Opec, according to Quintana, “depict a complicated picture, in which supply is resilient or expanding, and demand is weakening in China and India.” “We are only seeing adjustments in over-optimistic demand forecasts that took place over the last years,” Quintana added.

ALGIERS: Opec members could decide to hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss oil prices immediately after an informal gathering in Algiers next week, Algerian Energy Minister Noor Al Deen Bouterfa said on Tuesday. Bouterfa told local radio he was optimistic that participants would reach a consensus on how to stabilise the oil markets at the Algiers meeting of Opec and non-OPEC producers on Sept. 26-28. “Oil ministers may decide to hold an extraordinary meeting immediately,” he said. Algeria has been pushing for oil to be stabilised at around $60 a barrel. Bouterfa has travelled to Qatar, Iran and Russia to lobby for action to steady the market. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures were trading at about $45 per barrel on Tuesday. On a visit to Algiers over the weekend, Mohammed Barkindo, secretary-general of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said an extraordinary meeting could happen if the Algeria conference produced a consensus. He has said the Algiers meeting was for consultations and not decision-making.

Key Information/Sub-event: The image shows that the amount of crude oil exported from Libya has decreased significantly since 2019. In 2019, Libya exported over 1 million barrels of crude oil per day. However, in recent months, exports have fallen to around 500,000 barrels per day. The decline in exports is due to a number of factors, including political instability, civil war, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

News article:
The OPEC chief says Iran is committed to building consensus among crude producers on stabilizing the oil market which is faced with a massive supply glut. OPEC and non-OPEC producers are about to gather in Algiers on Sept. 28. to discuss a deal to stabilize the market. Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said Iranian officials “assured me that Iran will do everything possible in joining hands with members within the OPEC group as well as outside OPEC.” “I am quite satisfied with the assurances given during talks this month in Tehran,” Bloomberg reported, quoting Barkindo. The burning question about the informal meeting in Algiers is whether the participants will agree on a production freeze. Previous talks on a freeze collapsed in April after Saudi Arabia walked out of an agreement with Russia. Barkindo has said the upcoming meeting is just a consultation, but it is “crucial” where “specific policy-decision tools will have to be addressed and agreed upon after a thorough review, analysis and comprehension of this very dynamic and complex energy landscape.” He has said OPEC was not seeking a definite price range for oil but rather “sustainable stability” for the market. There are reports that participants in the upcoming talks would be moving from a production freeze to voluntary output caps. However, analysts say allowing each producer to choose its own output level would do little to curb surplus production. Nevertheless, there is hope that the Algeria meeting will produce some sort of consensus among OPEC members to work on a solution when they formally meet in Vienna on Nov. 30. OPEC sources said there was strong momentum around having at least the outline of a deal agreed next month. One bright spot is that Iran is nearing the production levels which it has been working all along the way to achieve since the lifting of sanctions on the country in January. Saudi Arabia used Iran’s insistence on reaching pre-sanctions levels to scuttle the freeze deal in April. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that “at the last minute, (the Saudis) changed their point of view” on reaching a production freeze pact. Iran has been calling on OPEC to restore the quota system which was scrapped in December 2011 under the Saudi initiative. A possible freeze would keep OPEC production at 33.4 million barrels a day – a decision which is unlikely to improve prices. On Tuesday, Barkindo was quoted as saying that a possible deal to support oil prices may last for one year. By Press TV

News article:
By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - As far as OPEC decision-making is concerned, Algeria, which plays host to oil ministers next week, has always been the land of surprises. The last two meetings of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held in Algeria -- in 2004 and 2008 -- shocked the market with unexpected production cuts to prop up prices. The stars could align for OPEC again next week when its ministers return to Algiers and look ready to curb output for the first time in eight years, according to OPEC officials and sources. Saudi Arabia and Iran, arch-rivals in oil markets and in politics, are sending conciliatory signals that they want to work together, along with Russia which is involved in talks although not a member of OPEC. This comes despite their backing for different sides in conflicts in Yemen and Syria. Behind the scenes, OPEC experts are trying to work out last-minute details for an output-limiting deal that would impress the market but also allow oil ministers to claim victories at home in front of their respective domestic audiences. "This time I think (things are) a little bit different because circumstances are a little bit better, helping (producers) to reach a deal," Iraq's OPEC governor Falah Alamri said on Thursday. He said OPEC had to act when it meets Russia on the sidelines of an energy producers and consumers conference in Algeria next week simply because current oil prices at $45-50 per barrel were not acceptable to the group's members. [O/R] Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia have all ramped up output to historic highs over the past year to fight for market share with higher-cost producers such as the United States where production has been declining due to low oil prices. Iraq is seen as one of key stumbling blocks to a global oil production deal given that it wants to increase output further next year, while Russia and Iran have probably both hit peak capacity and Saudis have never tested higher production levels. But Alamri said Iraq would not kill the deal: "We are not intending to flood the market, we are intending to support the market.... we will not participate in any action that will reduce the price." OPEC EXPERTS MEETING OPEC last reduced supply in 2008 when the global economic crisis crippled demand. The first attempt at an output freeze deal between OPEC and Russia collapsed earlier this year after the Saudis said Iran needed to contribute to it as production recovered following the end to Western sanctions in January. Tehran has argued its production needs to reach pre-sanction levels before it agrees to any action. In the past three months, Iranian oil output has stagnated but Tehran is still insisting on certain exemptions from any OPEC deals to curb supplies. Saudi Arabian and Iranian OPEC officials are meeting in Vienna this week, according to sources, to try to figure out the shape of a possible output deal. "It seems that they all want to get some sort of consensus in Algiers. You can see that in the amount of meetings and diplomacy taking place. There is a real push," an OPEC source said. Other sources said the main debate was about baseline production figures from which output could be frozen or cut. OPEC has two sets of figures, estimates by countries themselves and estimates by independent market experts known as secondary sources. The latter estimates have recently been lower and a more accurate reflection of actual production numbers. Gulf producers are insisting on using these in any output deal, according to sources, in order to help better monitor supply levels. One OPEC source familiar with discussions suggested that if output was frozen at levels seen at the start the year or the average of the first six months of 2016, it would effectively represent a cut from current real production levels. "Logically speaking, it could be viewed as a cut if (all) agreed on using secondary sources," the OPEC source said. Several other OPEC sources said that Libya and Nigeria could be granted exemptions as their output is curtailed by unrest. SCENE OF SURPRISES OPEC's last two meetings in Algeria produced surprise, bullish outcomes. In the city of Oran in December 2008, ministers emerged from hours of talks to announce a huge supply cut of 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd), causing prices to jump. The number actually included earlier cutbacks from previous meetings in the year. And in 2004, when growing Chinese demand was straining supply, OPEC met in Algiers and announced a surprise supply cut. Prices jumped and within weeks the decision was reversed. Now, OPEC produces a third of global crude or around 33.5 million barrels per day with Russia and the United States producing around 10-11 million bpd each. Record OPEC production has led to a massive spike in global oil stocks, currently standing at over 3 billion barrels. The International Energy Agency said this month oil supply will outpace demand at least until the second half of 2017, meaning prices will remain depressed and further stretching the budgets of OPEC producers and Russia. Several OPEC officials have publicly suggested levels by which global output shall drop to help prices recover. Algeria's oil minister said this week supply should be reduced by at least one million bpd. Russia said it was in theory ready to cap output by 5 percent. OPEC's secretary general has said the output freeze deal shall last to October 2017. "It is the closest OPEC has come to a deal in a long time but of course challenges remain and the elephant in the room is Iran and to a certain extent Iraq," said Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects. She said that if OPEC cut output by 1 million bpd it would help rebalance the market as it would reduce stocks by 290-330 million barrels over the course of the year, even if U.S. production started to recover due to higher oil prices.

News article:
By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - As far as OPEC decision-making is concerned, Algeria, which plays host to oil ministers next week, has always been the land of surprises. The last two meetings of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held in Algeria -- in 2004 and 2008 -- shocked the market with unexpected production cuts to prop up prices. The stars could align for OPEC again next week when its ministers return to Algiers and look ready to curb output for the first time in eight years, according to OPEC officials and sources. Saudi Arabia and Iran, arch-rivals in oil markets and in politics, are sending conciliatory signals that they want to work together, along with Russia which is involved in talks although not a member of OPEC. This comes despite their backing for different sides in conflicts in Yemen and Syria. Behind the scenes, OPEC experts are trying to work out last-minute details for an output-limiting deal that would impress the market but also allow oil ministers to claim victories at home in front of their respective domestic audiences. "This time I think (things are) a little bit different because circumstances are a little bit better, helping (producers) to reach a deal," Iraq's OPEC governor Falah Alamri said on Thursday. He said OPEC had to act when it meets Russia on the sidelines of an energy producers and consumers conference in Algeria next week simply because current oil prices at $45-50 per barrel were not acceptable to the group's members. [O/R] Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia have all ramped up output to historic highs over the past year to fight for market share with higher-cost producers such as the United States where production has been declining due to low oil prices. Iraq is seen as one of key stumbling blocks to a global oil production deal given that it wants to increase output further next year, while Russia and Iran have probably both hit peak capacity and Saudis have never tested higher production levels. But Alamri said Iraq would not kill the deal: "We are not intending to flood the market, we are intending to support the market.... we will not participate in any action that will reduce the price." OPEC EXPERTS MEETING OPEC last reduced supply in 2008 when the global economic crisis crippled demand. The first attempt at an output freeze deal between OPEC and Russia collapsed earlier this year after the Saudis said Iran needed to contribute to it as production recovered following the end to Western sanctions in January. Tehran has argued its production needs to reach pre-sanction levels before it agrees to any action. In the past three months, Iranian oil output has stagnated but Tehran is still insisting on certain exemptions from any OPEC deals to curb supplies. Saudi Arabian and Iranian OPEC officials are meeting in Vienna this week, according to sources, to try to figure out the shape of a possible output deal. "It seems that they all want to get some sort of consensus in Algiers. You can see that in the amount of meetings and diplomacy taking place. There is a real push," an OPEC source said. Other sources said the main debate was about baseline production figures from which output could be frozen or cut. OPEC has two sets of figures, estimates by countries themselves and estimates by independent market experts known as secondary sources. The latter estimates have recently been lower and a more accurate reflection of actual production numbers. Gulf producers are insisting on using these in any output deal, according to sources, in order to help better monitor supply levels. One OPEC source familiar with discussions suggested that if output was frozen at levels seen at the start the year or the average of the first six months of 2016, it would effectively represent a cut from current real production levels. "Logically speaking, it could be viewed as a cut if (all) agreed on using secondary sources," the OPEC source said. Several other OPEC sources said that Libya and Nigeria could be granted exemptions as their output is curtailed by unrest. SCENE OF SURPRISES OPEC's last two meetings in Algeria produced surprise, bullish outcomes. In the city of Oran in December 2008, ministers emerged from hours of talks to announce a huge supply cut of 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd), causing prices to jump. The number actually included earlier cutbacks from previous meetings in the year. And in 2004, when growing Chinese demand was straining supply, OPEC met in Algiers and announced a surprise supply cut. Prices jumped and within weeks the decision was reversed. Now, OPEC produces a third of global crude or around 33.5 million barrels per day with Russia and the United States producing around 10-11 million bpd each. Record OPEC production has led to a massive spike in global oil stocks, currently standing at over 3 billion barrels. The International Energy Agency said this month oil supply will outpace demand at least until the second half of 2017, meaning prices will remain depressed and further stretching the budgets of OPEC producers and Russia. Several OPEC officials have publicly suggested levels by which global output shall drop to help prices recover. Algeria's oil minister said this week supply should be reduced by at least one million bpd. Russia said it was in theory ready to cap output by 5 percent. OPEC's secretary general has said the output freeze deal shall last to October 2017. "It is the closest OPEC has come to a deal in a long time but of course challenges remain and the elephant in the room is Iran and to a certain extent Iraq," said Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects. She said that if OPEC cut output by 1 million bpd it would help rebalance the market as it would reduce stocks by 290-330 million barrels over the course of the year, even if U.S. production started to recover due to higher oil prices.

Ohio – Hillary Clinton is tweaking rival Donald Trump’s decision to travel to Mexico, saying it takes more to make up for a “year of insults and insinuations” than a quick trip to America’s southern neighbor. Clinton says at the American Legion’s annual convention in Ohio that voters need to know that they can count on you. She says “it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again.” The Democratic presidential nominee adds, “That is not how it works.” Trump was meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto later Wednesday. Trump’s surprise visit was coming hours before a major address on immigration in Arizona. Clinton says the United States in “an exceptional nation” and is accusing rival Donald Trump of thinking that approach is “insulting to the rest of the world.” She says the U.S. is an indispensable nation and has a “unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress.” Referencing Trump’s threats to “walk away from our alliances,” she notes that when America fails to lead, the country leaves a vacuum for the rest of the world to fill.

News article:
Unless some unforeseen miracle happens for Donald Trump, Hawkish Hillary (at least as accurate a nickname as Crooked Hillary) is likely to be the next president of the United States. Although Hillary has run legitimate political ads implying that Trump's temperament is too volatile to be left with command of the military, especially nuclear weapons, Americans may not be all that safe with Hillary either. Throughout her career, Hillary supported her husband's bombing of Serbia and Kosovo and George W. Bush's aggressive invasion of Iraq, as well as pushing Barack Obama to attack Libya and overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. As Secretary of State, Hillary looked at the chaos caused by removing a dictator in a fractured developing country--Iraq--and then pressured Obama to do the same in Libya. So Trump's accusation that Hillary has poor judgment is not far off the mark. More important for the future, Secretary Clinton also unsuccessfully urged Obama to get more deeply involved in Syria's complicated, multi-sided, and bloody civil war. She advocated augmenting lethal aid to the Syrian opposition and creating a no fly zone to protect these forces and civilians. So if she wins power in the election, she may very well go farther down the road to enmeshing the U.S. military in another unwinnable quagmire, much like the ones in Afghanistan and Iraq. Advertisement Despite the 400,000 deaths already, Syria's civil strife is likely to continue for long while, because everyone seems to be fighting everybody else in the multi-sided bloodbath and because outside forces--such as the Russia, Iran, the militant group Hezbollah, Turkey, the Persian Gulf Arab states, and the United States--are stoking the conflict by assisting either the inherently weak Syrian government or its many lackluster opposition groups. The United States recently got its wish as the powerful Turkish military took a greater role in the neighboring civil war by invading Syria. However, it seems that the Turks have been more interested in throwing back the advancing Syrian Kurds, the United States' most effective ally against the brutal ISIS opposition group, than in destroying ISIS. The fact that two of the most effective U.S. allies are fighting each other should give Barack Obama and any incoming American administration pause. The main U.S. problem in the conflict is its pursuit of incompatible objectives. The United States is trying to overthrow the Assad government in Syria, while decimating or destroying the opposition ISIS group, keeping its Turkish ally happy, staying friends with the rival Kurds, and avoiding getting sucked more deeply into the quicksand. The top U.S. priority has changed from overthrowing Assad to weakening his ISIS opposition. However, even if the United States and its allies take most of ISIS's territory in Iraq and Syria, the group likely will continue to fight on using guerilla and terrorist tactics. The problem is that the other parties in the conflict have higher priorities than weakening ISIS. Although Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah are no friends of the heinous Sunni group, they have as their top priority keeping Assad in power and in charge of as much Syrian territory as possible; they want to weaken other opposition groups first, including those supported by the United States, so they can then say "its Assad or ISIS." In contrast, U.S. allies--Turkey and the Sunni Gulf states--place a high priority on getting rid of Assad and thus weakening his ally Shi'i Iran. Also, the Turks, despite recent ISIS attacks on their soil, seem to be more concerned about the Syrian Kurds (allied with the opposition Kurds in Turkey) consolidating territory held along the Turkish border. Advertisement With the Russians, Iranians, and Hezbollah Shi'i militants assisting Assad, the likelihood that he will leave power is very low. And any increase in arms or assistance that United States or the Gulf states give moderate Syrian opposition groups ultimately might fall into the hands of the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria or other nefarious Islamist groups, which fight intermingled with more moderate opposition forces; in warfare, the most brutal and aggressive factions usually end up with the provisions. In the past, the United States has had a knack for creating (or strengthening) future enemies--for example, al Qaeda by assisting the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s and ISIS by invading Iraq in 2003. Aiding opposition forces in Syria may already be doing this again. Furthermore, a "no fly zone" likely could put U.S. aircraft in conflict with Russian and Syrian aircraft and ground-based anti-aircraft missiles, thus possibly turning a civil war into something much bigger and nastier.

News article:
White Plains, NY – The White House was submerged in scandal. Democrats faced tough midterm elections. And Hillary Clinton, far more popular than her embattled husband, had become a one-woman campaign machine. But the nonstop travel in 1998 took a toll. Clinton developed a blood clot behind her right knee, prompting the White House doctor to recommend hospitalization and a week of bedrest. Determined to stay on the campaign trail, Clinton settled on an alternative: A nurse would travel with her to administer the medicine needed to monitor her health. She kept her condition a secret from nearly everyone but her Secret Service detail, alerted only because an injury could have been life-threatening. “Very few people knew about it at the time,” recalled Dr. Connie Mariano in her autobiography. “Her staff thought she had pulled a muscle exercising.” Nearly two decades later, Clinton’s desire to work through illness — and penchant for keeping her health secret — has helped cause the most damaging 48-hour period in her presidential campaign and given fresh ammunition to GOP rival Donald Trump. The incident has also stoked long-simmering conservative conspiracy theories about her health and questions about her commitment to openness. Video of her staggering and stumbling at a 9/11 ceremony on Sunday and her controversial comments about Trump’s supporters at a Friday fundraiser both occurred while she suffered from lingering pneumonia. At least part of the blame goes to a simple cause: Clinton’s stubborn unwillingness to follow the advice of doctors, family and friends. “This is just who she is. She is a workhorse. No matter who tells her, her husband can tell her. It doesn’t matter. Chelsea can tell her,” said Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat who served as chairman of her 2008 presidential campaign. “You’re not going to change her at this point in her life.” After her Friday pneumonia diagnosis, Clinton was determined to “power through,” she told CNN late Monday. The public and most in her campaign were kept in the dark. Her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, and her campaign manager, Robby Mook, declined to say when they first learned about her condition. The decision to keep going was one that Clinton, who suffers seasonal allergies that can become a vicious cough, came to regret. The Democrat is now taking a few days off the campaign trail, forced to the sidelines at a critical point in the fall election. Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said the Democratic nominee spent Tuesday reading briefing material, calling aides and watching President Barack Obama campaign on her behalf in Philadelphia. She will resume campaign travel on Thursday, he said. Facing criticism about her lack of disclosure, she’s agreed to release more health information soon. “I probably would have been better off if I’d just pulled down my schedule on Friday,” Clinton said on CNN, adding: “I just didn’t think it was going to be that big a deal.” Her supporters now are trying to turn the episode into a badge of honor — and a credential for the White House. “This is a woman who works 20 hours a day and comes into contact with tens of thousands of people and you pick up germs and viruses and things like that and you get exhausted,” said Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut. “If you don’t get a cold or a virus or the flu or pneumonia in a campaign, you weren’t working hard enough.” But the incident follows a long pattern, with Clinton paying a price, both physically and politically. During the waning days of her time as secretary of state, she sustained a concussion in a fainting episode at her home, which her doctor later attributed to dehydration and a stomach virus she developed during a trip to Europe. In follow-up evaluations, Clinton was found to have a blood clot in a vein in the space between her brain and the skull behind her right ear. To recover, she spent a few days at a hospital and took a month-long absence from the State Department for treatment. Her physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, said in 2013 that testing showed “complete resolution” of the concussion’s effects. But the episode became a central part of a political rumor about her health that has only grown more damaging as her presidential campaign has continued. Trump has seized on those concerns, often questioning Clinton’s stamina and energy. That infuriates Clinton’s friends and former aides, who cite dozens of stories about her simply refusing to take a sick day. “I am 20 years younger than Hillary Clinton and there is no single day when I outpaced her ever in my life,” said Neera Tanden, a former Clinton policy aide and president of the liberal Center for American Progress. “I’ve always seen her get up earlier and stay up later.” Tanden recalled a time when Clinton, then a New York senator, refused to cancel a public service announcement she was scheduled to tape with Sesame Street even though she was sick. Her staff had planned to bring their children in to meet Elmo and Clinton didn’t want to disappoint the kids. “I felt so badly. She had a throaty voice and you could tell she had a bad cough,” said Tanden, who now has a photo of her then 2-year-old daughter with Clinton and Elmo. “But she was like, ‘It’s fine. I just could not live with these kids crying about missing Elmo.'”

That infuriates Clinton’s friends and former aides, who cite dozens of stories about her simply refusing to take a sick day. “I am 20 years younger than Hillary Clinton and there is no single day when I outpaced her ever in my life,” said Neera Tanden, a former Clinton policy aide and president of the liberal Center for American Progress. “I’ve always seen her get up earlier and stay up later.” Tanden recalled a time when Clinton, then a New York senator, refused to cancel a public service announcement she was scheduled to tape with Sesame Street even though she was sick. Her staff had planned to bring their children in to meet Elmo and Clinton didn’t want to disappoint the kids. “I felt so badly. She had a throaty voice and you could tell she had a bad cough,” said Tanden, who now has a photo of her then 2-year-old daughter with Clinton and Elmo. “But she was like, ‘It’s fine. I just could not live with these kids crying about missing Elmo.'”

News article:
WASHINGTON, D.C. (JTA) — I support Hillary Clinton for president because I have seen her work up close – as first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state. She has the temperament, experience and judgment to be commander-in-chief and our country’s representative to the world. And I know she has a deep commitment to the State of Israel and a special sensitivity to help Holocaust survivors. During his first term, President Bill Clinton appointed me his special representative for Holocaust issues to provide belated justice for Holocaust victims and their families. With his and Hillary’s strong support, I helped recover $8 billion for slave and forced labor, unpaid insurance policies, Nazi-looted art, and property restitution and compensation. As senator from New York and then as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton continued her intense efforts for Holocaust victims and survivors. In my service as special adviser to the secretary of state on Holocaust issues, she supported me when we advanced a number of new initiatives to help survivors. Having worked across four U.S. administrations, I’ve seen firsthand that every president needs a temperament that can endure great pressure. Hillary Clinton has it. Donald Trump does not. With his dangerous combination of impulsiveness, erratic behavior and emotional outbursts when he is criticized, Trump would be a disaster in the Oval Office. Trump even confuses our allies and foes. He has expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin’s leadership style; he is considering recognizing Russian control of Crimea, which it brutally invaded; and has suggested Russia conduct cyber espionage against his political opponent at a time when the U.S. government is increasingly concerned that Russian intelligence is seeking to interfere in our election. Trump has also upset our NATO allies by putting conditions on our longstanding obligations to come to their defense if they are attacked. It is critical to American global leadership and influence that our allies know they can depend on us to honor our obligations. This was recognized recently by 50 former senior Republican officials who said Trump lacks the “character, values and experience” to be president, and “would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.” This election is not about partisanship, it’s about our values as a nation. Hillary Clinton believes that at a time of great challenge at home and abroad, our diversity is a great source of our country’s strength. That’s why she says we’re “stronger together.” Trump, on the other hand, seeks to inflame one group against another. Given our own history, American Jews have a special concern with this approach – especially when it comes to his plans to round up and expel over 10 million immigrants and their children. And in a chilling echo of the immigration barriers that Jewish refugees found when they sought safety from Hitler’s clutches in World War II, Trump said he wants to bar all refugees who are Muslim from our shores. One of the greatest contrasts between Trump and Clinton is over Israel and U.S.-Israel relations. The United States is Israel’s only real ally, and having the right person in the Oval Office is crucial to Israel’s security. Trump has made no effort to study and learn from the peace process, and has only the most fleeting relationship with Israeli leadership. He has even said that he was “a neutral guy” when it came to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. At one point, Trump even suggested that Israel should repay the U.S. for the military aid it provided. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has always been among Israel’s strongest supporters. In the wake of the continued knife attacks on innocent Israelis, she publicly demanded that the Palestinian leadership stop inciting their people to violence, publicly condemn terrorism and end the pernicious practice of paying rewards to the families of terrorists. She has strong relationships with leaders like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom she played a major role in negotiating the 2012 Gaza cease-fire, and supported vital U.S. assistance to Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system. Clinton has set out a concrete plan to take the U.S.-Israel relationship to “the next level.” And she called for the expeditious completion of a new 10-year defense memorandum of understanding to ensure that Israel maintains its qualitative defensive advantage; the memorandum was signed last week. Her plan includes a pledge to work shoulder to shoulder with Israel to combat the rising terrorist threat in the region. Clinton has called for tougher sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, to curb its ballistic missile development, and to cut the flow of Iranian funds and arms to Israel’s enemies. She has pledged to take swift action, including militarily if necessary, if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon. And Hillary will do everything in her power to combat the growing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions effort to marginalize Israel. Israel will have no better friend in the Oval Office than Hillary Clinton, and I enthusiastically support her. (During the Clinton administration, Stuart E. Eizenstat was the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, undersecretary of commerce and of state, deputy secretary of the Treasury, and special representative of the president on Holocaust issues. During the Carter administration, he was the president’s White House chief domestic policy adviser.)

News article:
WASHINGTON - Bombings in the New York region and a stabbing attack in Minnesota have thrust Islamic extremism into the forefront of the 2016 election just a week before the first presidential debate, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton offering dramatically different visions of how to fight it. Trump has embraced aggressive rhetoric in a plan that's short on detail, but centers on limiting immigration - both legal and illegal - and dispensing with "politically correct" policies that currently block racial profiling and the use of torture. Clinton has offered policies that would focus on leveraging alliances and improving relationships with Muslim communities at home while working closely with technology companies to crack down on propaganda and communication that encourages "lone wolf" attacks. There are limits, of course, to what the White House can do to prevent extremist attacks at the local level, where local law enforcement remains the first line of defense. Yet the occupant of the Oval Office will have the power to set the course of the nation's approach to fighting the threat of such attacks at home and abroad. Here's a look at each candidate's prescription: IMMIGRATION TRUMP: His plan to combat illegal immigration - and reduce legal immigration - is the centerpiece of his plan to address Islamic extremism. Trump has repeatedly called for a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees. His position is part of a broader stance on immigrants that has ranged from imposing a complete ban on foreign Muslims entering the United States "until we know what the hell is going on" to "extreme vetting" and an ideological test for would-be immigrants from regions plagued by Islamic extremism. CLINTON: She has said she would expand President Barack Obama's refugee program from accepting 10,000 to about 65,000 Syrian refugees annually. This would be in addition to the tens of thousands of refugees accepted from around the world every year. Clinton says she would continue to use the existing system to vet the background of immigrants and refugees, an effort that can take years to complete. More broadly, she supports creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally, so long as they are not violent criminals. FIGHTING THE ISLAMIC STATE ABROAD CLINTON: She has said she would not authorize sending ground troops to Syria or Iraq to take on the Islamic State group, instead favoring a plan to intensify the current coalition air-strike campaign. She also would increase diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving Syria's civil war and Iraq's sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shiites, which fueled the group's rise, and has pledged to improve cooperation with European intelligence agencies to halt extremist networks. She has also called for an "intelligence surge" that would include Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East and a closer partnership with regional intelligence services. TRUMP: He has said repeatedly that he wants to "bomb the hell out of ISIS." Trump spent months on the campaign trail suggesting he had a secret plan to defeat the Islamic State group - in May, he deemed it a "foolproof way of winning" - but has added he does not want to reveal it because it would tip off extremist leaders. Earlier this month, he instead suggested that, upon his election, he would give generals "30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS." He has said he'd send ground troops to the Middle East to fight the Islamic State group, in addition to the 5,500 there now, but has wavered on how many. DOMESTIC ATTACKS TRUMP: He has repeatedly endorsed racial profiling in the United States as a counterterrorism tool. Trump has not released any specifics as to how U.S. law enforcement would use profiling, or how he would require it as president, but said Monday that authorities have no choice but to use racial profiling and noted it is a tool Israel uses to combat Islamic extremists. He said "politically correct" policies currently prevent police from keeping Americans safe. The New York billionaire also believes local law enforcement agencies should monitor mosques, saying in June that it should be done "respectfully." CLINTON: She wants local law enforcement to develop improved relationships with Muslim community leaders, who she said are best positioned to recognize extremists in their communities. Clinton has argued that racial profiling is generally ineffective and demeaning to the people being profiled. She has promised to boost federal support for local law enforcement, a move she cites as a key to her strategy. And she supports a law that would prohibit people on the terror watch list from being able to purchase firearms. CYBERSECURITY TRUMP: He has not articulated a policy for addressing cybersecurity, an area national security officials cite as one of the most significant threats to the nation. Asked by an ally earlier in the month to explain his approach to cybersecurity, Trump said "cyber is so big" and later noted it's becoming "more important." On Monday morning, when asked about websites that offer directions on how to build bombs, he said people who post such sites "should be arrested immediately." CLINTON: She has called on U.S. technology companies to be more cooperative in countering extremist propaganda, tracking social media patterns and incepting encrypted communications. She supports the creation of a National Commission on Encryption to help tech companies and the government find a balance between privacy and security concerns. Clinton said in an August speech that she would treat a cyberattack from an adversary "like any other attack" against the United States. She has called on the government to work with private institutions to protect against cyberattacks from countries like Russia and China, while vowing to modernize the nation's electric grid to address its vulnerabilities. CLASH ON TORTURE CLINTON: Clinton has condemned the use of torture as an interrogation technique. During her first presidential run, Clinton briefly suggested that its limited use in extreme circumstances could save lives, but by September 2007 she categorically ruled it out, saying "it cannot be American policy, period." She has also suggested that it doesn't work and, in a March speech at Stanford University, warned that "it puts our own troops and increasingly our own civilians at greater risk" by promoting retaliation. TRUMP: He has repeatedly come out in favor of using torture. "What do you think about waterboarding?" he asked the crowd at a June rally in Ohio. "I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough." He has on other occasions suggested that he would authorize techniques that were "a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding." Waterboarding, used during the Bush administration on detainees after 9/11, was later outlawed by Congress in a law signed by Obama. COALITION BUILDING TRUMP: He has made "America First" a key campaign slogan and has suggested he would pull back on international relationships. Earlier this year, he suggested that he would consider pulling the United States out of NATO, because it was "obsolete" and "costing us a fortune." In July, he raised the possibility he would not automatically defend NATO allies unless those nations have "fulfilled their (financial) obligations to us." He also advocated for a stronger ties with Russia, saying "wouldn't it be nice" to have warmer relationship with that nation. CLINTON: She has pointed to a need to build international coalitions. In a reference to Trump's approach, she warned last month that, "You don't build a coalition by insulting our friends or acting like a loose cannon." She called NATO one of "the best investments" the United States has made and has pledged to remain a member of the military alliance. And she has pointed to her coalition-building record as secretary of state, including an 18-month effort to impose sanctions on Iran in an effort to hinder its nuclear programs.

Trump has not released any specifics as to how U.S. law enforcement would use profiling, or how he would require it as president, but said Monday that authorities have no choice but to use racial profiling and noted it is a tool Israel uses to combat Islamic extremists. He said "politically correct" policies currently prevent police from keeping Americans safe. The New York billionaire also believes local law enforcement agencies should monitor mosques, saying in June that it should be done "respectfully." CLINTON: She wants local law enforcement to develop improved relationships with Muslim community leaders, who she said are best positioned to recognize extremists in their communities. Clinton has argued that racial profiling is generally ineffective and demeaning to the people being profiled. She has promised to boost federal support for local law enforcement, a move she cites as a key to her strategy. And she supports a law that would prohibit people on the terror watch list from being able to purchase firearms. CYBERSECURITY TRUMP: He has not articulated a policy for addressing cybersecurity, an area national security officials cite as one of the most significant threats to the nation. Asked by an ally earlier in the month to explain his approach to cybersecurity, Trump said "cyber is so big" and later noted it's becoming "more important." On Monday morning, when asked about websites that offer directions on how to build bombs, he said people who post such sites "should be arrested immediately." CLINTON: She has called on U.S. technology companies to be more cooperative in countering extremist propaganda, tracking social media patterns and incepting encrypted communications. She supports the creation of a National Commission on Encryption to help tech companies and the government find a balance between privacy and security concerns. Clinton said in an August speech that she would treat a cyberattack from an adversary "like any other attack" against the United States. She has called on the government to work with private institutions to protect against cyberattacks from countries like Russia and China, while vowing to modernize the nation's electric grid to address its vulnerabilities. CLASH ON TORTURE CLINTON: Clinton has condemned the use of torture as an interrogation technique. During her first presidential run, Clinton briefly suggested that its limited use in extreme circumstances could save lives, but by September 2007 she categorically ruled it out, saying "it cannot be American policy, period." She has also suggested that it doesn't work and, in a March speech at Stanford University, warned that "it puts our own troops and increasingly our own civilians at greater risk" by promoting retaliation. TRUMP: He has repeatedly come out in favor of using torture. "What do you think about waterboarding?" he asked the crowd at a June rally in Ohio. "I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough." He has on other occasions suggested that he would authorize techniques that were "a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding." Waterboarding, used during the Bush administration on detainees after 9/11, was later outlawed by Congress in a law signed by Obama. COALITION BUILDING TRUMP: He has made "America First" a key campaign slogan and has suggested he would pull back on international relationships. Earlier this year, he suggested that he would consider pulling the United States out of NATO, because it was "obsolete" and "costing us a fortune." In July, he raised the possibility he would not automatically defend NATO allies unless those nations have "fulfilled their (financial) obligations to us." He also advocated for a stronger ties with Russia, saying "wouldn't it be nice" to have warmer relationship with that nation. CLINTON: She has pointed to a need to build international coalitions. In a reference to Trump's approach, she warned last month that, "You don't build a coalition by insulting our friends or acting like a loose cannon." She called NATO one of "the best investments" the United States has made and has pledged to remain a member of the military alliance. And she has pointed to her coalition-building record as secretary of state, including an 18-month effort to impose sanctions on Iran in an effort to hinder its nuclear programs.

News article:
US presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump jabbed at each other over how to fight terror, negotiate with allies and keep the US safe and prosperous as the two contenders locked horns in a debate marked by vociferous — and sometimes boisterous — attacks on each other. Locked in an exceedingly close race, the presidential rivals tangled for 90-minutes over their vastly different visions for the nation’s future and how to engage with the world. Trump repeatedly pushed at Clinton over her record in the Middle East and elsewhere, painting her as a “lying politician,” and accusing her of aiding Iran through the last year’s landmark nuclear deal and helping foster the rise of Islamic State. “You look at the Middle East, it’s a total mess, under your direction, to a large extent,” Trump said. “You’re talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now, it’s in over 30 countries, and you’re going to stop them? I don’t think so.” “Well at least I have a plan to fight ISIS,” Clinton shot back. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don’t think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much,” quipped Trump, insisting both that Clinton lacked a plan, but that by publishing that plan on her website “you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do.” “No wonder you’ve been fighting — no wonder you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,” he said, though it was not clear what he was referring to. Advertisement Clinton contended that Trump lacks “good judgment or the right temperament” and could take the country to war over small issues, like being mocked on Twitter. “A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes,” she said. Trump replied: “That line’s getting a little bit old.” Still, he avoided a specific declaration on how he would use nuclear weapons if elected president. The Republican nominee said he “would not do first strike” because “once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over.” That statement suggests he would not authorize a nuclear attack unless the US was struck first. But in the same answer Trump said he “can’t take anything off the table.” He mentioned adversary nations such as North Korea and Iran in his answer. Advertisement While Israel was not mentioned in the debate, Trump name-checked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met both candidates separately on Sunday, saying he was “not a happy camper” over the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump called “one of the worst deals in history.” “You started the Iran deal, that’s another beauty, they were about to fall” because of sanctions, Trump said. “They were choking on the sanctions and now they’re probably going to be a major power.” Clinton responded that Iran was only “weeks away” from a nuclear bomb when she became secretary of state — and said the Obama administration thwarted that progress with the deal, which exchanged sanction relief for limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities. “It’s been very successful in giving us access to facilities we’ve never been to before,” she said. She added that the deal freed the United States to deal with other Iranian acts, including the Islamic Republic’s backing of terrorism and record of interfering in other countries. “Personally, I would rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program,” she said. The televised face-off was the most anticipated moment in an election campaign that has been both historic and unpredictable. Both sides expected a record-setting audience for the showdown at Hofstra University in suburban New York, reflecting the intense national interest in the race to become America’s 45th president. The centerpiece of Trump’s case against Clinton was that the former senator and secretary of state is little more than a career politician who has squandered opportunities to address the domestic and international issues she’s now pledging to tackle as president. Advertisement “She’s got experience,” he said, “but it’s bad experience.” Clinton insisted that one key to fighting terrorism in the United States and abroad was working closely with Muslims and Muslim-majority countries, while Trump has “consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home.” “I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policeman of the world, we cannot protect countries all over the world, where they’re not paying us what we need,” Trump said, referring to alliances with US allies to help fight terror. Clinton knocked at Trump for his comments suggesting he would ice-out NATO, and said her plan included an intelligence surge to obtain “every scrap of information” and to “do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.” Yet Trump took credit for NATO’s focus on terrorism. He insisted the alliance’s launch of a new anti-terrorism division earlier this year was “largely because of what I was saying, and my criticism of NATO.” Clinton noted that NATO’s first-ever invocation of Article 5, charging all members to come to the defense of another member under attack, was after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on American soil. Advertisement Much of the debate focused on domestic issues, as well as personal quibbles between the candidates and their records. Clinton called for lowering taxes for the middle class, while Trump focused more on renegotiating trade deals that he said have caused companies to move jobs out of the US. The Republican candidate backed the controversial “stop-and-frisk policing” tactic as a way to bring down crime, while the Democrat said the policy was unconstitutional and ineffective. The debate was confrontational from the start, with Trump frequently trying to interrupt Clinton and speaking over her answers. Clinton was more measured and restrained, but also needled the sometimes-thin-skinned Trump over his business record and wealth. “There’s something he’s hiding,” she declared, scoffing at his repeated contentions that he won’t release his tax returns because he is being audited. Tax experts have said an audit is no bar to making his records public. She said one reason he has refused is that he may well have paid nothing in federal taxes. He interrupted to say, “That makes me smart.” Trump aggressively tried to turn the transparency questions around on Clinton, saying he would release his tax information when she produces more than 30,000 emails that were deleted from the personal internet server she used as secretary of state. Trump’s criticism of Clinton turned personal in the debate’s closing moments. He said, “She doesn’t have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina” to be president. He’s made similar comments in previous events, sparking outrage from Clinton backers who accused him of leveling a sexist attack on the first woman nominated for president by a major US political party. Clinton leaped at the opportunity to remind voters of Trump’s numerous controversial comments about women, who will be crucial to the outcome of the November election. “This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,” she said. Both candidates portrayed themselves as best-prepared to lead a nation where many are still struggling to benefit from a slow economic recovery and are increasingly fearful of terror threats at home and abroad. When Trump jabbed Clinton for taking time off the campaign trail to study for the debate, she said, “I prepared to be president, and that’s a good thing.” The candidates sparred over trade, taxes and how to bring good-paying jobs back to the United States. Clinton said her Republican rival was promoting a “Trumped-up” version of trickle-down economics — a philosophy focused on tax cuts for the wealthy. She called for increasing the federal minimum wage, spending more on infrastructure projects and guaranteeing equal pay for women. Trump panned policies that he said have led to American jobs being moved overseas, in part because of international trade agreements that Clinton has supported. He pushed her aggressively on her past support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact while she was serving in the Obama administration. She’s since said she opposes the sweeping deal in its final form. “You called it the gold standard of trade deals,” Trump said. “If you did win, you would approve that.” Disputing his version of events, Clinton said, “I know you live in your own reality.” Trump struggled to answer repeated questions about why he only recently acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States. For years, Trump has been the chief promoter of questions falsely suggesting the president was born outside of America. “He has really started his political activity on this racist lie,” Clinton charged. Trump also repeatedly insisted that he opposed the Iraq War before the 2003 US invasion, despite evidence to the contrary. Trump was asked in September 2002 whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with Howard Stern. He responded: “Yeah, I guess so.” Presented with the comment during the debate, Trump responded: “I said very lightly, I don’t know, maybe, who knows.” JTA and AFP contributed to this report

News article:
New York – Views from around the world on Monday’s first U.S. presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump: ___ CHINA WANG PEI, a graduate student in communications studies, watched the debate from a cafe in Beijing and said he thought Clinton carried herself better. “I personally like Trump’s character and the feeling that he’s a fighter,” Wang said. “But from today’s performance, I think Clinton was more like a mature politician and Trump looked a bit like a misfit in this kind of setting.” GE MENGCHAO, a graduate student in journalism, said he thought Trump would be a better president for China because his business background could mean he would appreciate the countries’ commercial ties. “I think maybe Trump would be friendlier to China, because China and the U.S. share vast common interests, especially in commercial areas,” Ge said. “From the perspective of a businessman, he may take a friendlier approach to China.” ___ AUSTRALIA RICHARD MCCONOCHIE watched the debate on a big screen in a Canberra pub and said, “To me Trump aced it.” “He came across as a man who could control himself. They said Trump’s ignorant of the issues. I think he proved that he had at least a working handle on most of the stuff he was talking about.” “I think he’ll swing a lot of Americans over to Trump just by proving that he is not the sort of unstable, dangerous lunatic that he’s painted to be,” McConochie said. “I don’t see that Trump would be any more incompetent than Clinton.” MILTON GAN, a Sydney-based photographer, said it seemed like Trump was trying to rein in his temper for the first 15 minutes, then went off the rails. “He started interrupting Clinton, he started interrupting (moderator) Lester (Holt) and he started steamrolling. And you could see he was just getting really irate about everything,” Gan said. “The most ridiculous thing was at the end when he said he had the better temperament to be president,” Gan said, laughing. “It was just hilarious.” Clinton came off prepared, confident and composed, Gan said: “Obviously, she’s done her prep and she’s got so much experience in politics and I think that really showed.” ___ BRITAIN TIM STANLEY, a columnist for Britain’s conservative Daily Telegraph, said in his column Tuesday that Trump won the debate but may lose the election. He said Trump repeated many of his outrageous campaign statements and defended his earlier questions about whether President Barack Obama was really born in the U.S., but they played well in a debate that should be judged as reality TV. He said Trump said everything that people who hate Clinton have wanted to say for 30 years. “In terms of reality TV, he did well,” Stanley wrote. “He harassed, he shouted, he taunted, he talked over. And Clinton let him do it.” But he said Trump said nothing during the debate to win over non-whites and female voters and did not act particularly presidential. That means, he said, that Trump probably won’t be getting the chance to redecorate the Oval Office. ___ GERMANY SIGMAR GABRIEL, German vice chancellor and head of the Social Democratic Party, told daily newspaper Bild on Tuesday morning that Clinton was the clear winner and that Trump’s performance showed striking weaknesses. “Trump didn’t have a plan. Neither for the U.S. nor for the big foreign policy challenges,” Gabriel said. “Clinton convinced with competence and clarity. It was a clear victory for her.” HANNES REINHARDT, a 34-year-old who works for a small German publication called zwd, said he didn’t watch the debate live because it started at 3 a.m. in Germany, but he woke up to several push alerts on his phone. “My first impression based on those alerts was that Clinton was leading in the debate,” he said, taking a puff on his cigarette before heading into his office in Berlin’s Mitte neighborhood. Reinhardt said that he hoped Clinton would also win the U.S. elections. “As a German, one can only hope that she will win. She is more moderate and more European, while Trump is very isolationist and a populist,” Reinhardt said. ___ JAPAN NARUSHIGE MICHISHITA, a Japanese analyst, said it was in some ways heartening to hear his country mentioned in the debate, since Japan is often overlooked these days. But he disagreed with Trump’s criticism that Japan and other U.S. allies aren’t contributing enough to their defense. “There is a small truth to what Mr. Trump was saying, in the sense that Japan was a kind of free-rider or at least a cheap-rider back in the 1970s and ’80s,” said Michishita, director of the security and international studies program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “But … now given what Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe is doing to make Japan much more proactive on defense and security matters, and trying to make Japan more engaged in international security affairs, it’s like, ‘What are you talking about?'” HIROTSUGU AIDA, author of a book on the Trump phenomenon, agreed that Trump misunderstood the U.S.-Japan security alliance but said he still did better than Clinton. “Trump unexpectedly acted presidential. It might be a setback for Clinton, who wanted to make him look unsuitable for presidency,” he said. ___ PHILIPPINES VICTOR ANDRES MANHIT, president of the think-tank Albert del Rosario Institute for Strategic and International Studies, welcomed Clinton’s assurances that the U.S. would honor its treaty obligations if she becomes president. “I’m really hoping that that kind of statement reminds our own government that we have an ally in the United States vis-a-vis our fight for territorial integrity and our maritime rights in the South China Sea,” he said. RICHARD HEYDARIAN, a political science professor at Manila’s De La Salle University said he thought Clinton “was clearly the more prepared candidate and was able to handle Trump’s offensives with utmost finesse. Trump seemed more subdued than expected, but spent too much time defending himself on secondary issues and failed to build up on his vision for the American people, especially the middle classes.” ___ SPAIN Spain’s main newspapers were unanimous in awarding victory to Clinton in the debate, each highlighting what they said was the Democratic Party candidate’s superior preparation and more convincing presidential image. In its digital edition Tuesday, leading daily El Pais’ headline said “Clinton corners Trump with attacks on his racism and lack of preparation.” The center-left newspaper said that while neither candidate committed any major error, Clinton was able to put Trump on the defensive by questioning his “credentials as a businessman, accusing him of racism and placing in doubt his temperament to be commander in chief.” The daily pointed out, however, that the debate was unlikely to bring about any major change in either candidate’s ratings. Conservative daily ABC said that “the first debate does not resolve anything but it does leave the impression that the ex-secretary of state did her homework, knows the lesson better and transmits a more presidential image.” ___ HUNGARY Hungary’s left-leaning daily newspaper Nepszabadsag was impressed with Clinton’s performance: “Clinton prepared and gave Trump no chance,” was its headline. “Hillary Clinton was prepared and confident, smiling as she attacked her Republican rival in the first candidate debate,” the paper’s report said. “Often, Trump was forced to defend himself and became entangled in explanations about his own business affairs and earlier statements.”

It might be a setback for Clinton, who wanted to make him look unsuitable for presidency,” he said. ___ PHILIPPINES VICTOR ANDRES MANHIT, president of the think-tank Albert del Rosario Institute for Strategic and International Studies, welcomed Clinton’s assurances that the U.S. would honor its treaty obligations if she becomes president. “I’m really hoping that that kind of statement reminds our own government that we have an ally in the United States vis-a-vis our fight for territorial integrity and our maritime rights in the South China Sea,” he said. RICHARD HEYDARIAN, a political science professor at Manila’s De La Salle University said he thought Clinton “was clearly the more prepared candidate and was able to handle Trump’s offensives with utmost finesse. Trump seemed more subdued than expected, but spent too much time defending himself on secondary issues and failed to build up on his vision for the American people, especially the middle classes.” ___ SPAIN Spain’s main newspapers were unanimous in awarding victory to Clinton in the debate, each highlighting what they said was the Democratic Party candidate’s superior preparation and more convincing presidential image. In its digital edition Tuesday, leading daily El Pais’ headline said “Clinton corners Trump with attacks on his racism and lack of preparation.” The center-left newspaper said that while neither candidate committed any major error, Clinton was able to put Trump on the defensive by questioning his “credentials as a businessman, accusing him of racism and placing in doubt his temperament to be commander in chief.” The daily pointed out, however, that the debate was unlikely to bring about any major change in either candidate’s ratings. Conservative daily ABC said that “the first debate does not resolve anything but it does leave the impression that the ex-secretary of state did her homework, knows the lesson better and transmits a more presidential image.” ___ HUNGARY Hungary’s left-leaning daily newspaper Nepszabadsag was impressed with Clinton’s performance: “Clinton prepared and gave Trump no chance,” was its headline. “Hillary Clinton was prepared and confident, smiling as she attacked her Republican rival in the first candidate debate,” the paper’s report said. “Often, Trump was forced to defend himself and became entangled in explanations about his own business affairs and earlier statements.”

New York – Views from around the world on Monday’s first U.S. presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump: ___ CHINA WANG PEI, a graduate student in communications studies, watched the debate from a cafe in Beijing and said he thought Clinton carried herself better. “I personally like Trump’s character and the feeling that he’s a fighter,” Wang said. “But from today’s performance, I think Clinton was more like a mature politician and Trump looked a bit like a misfit in this kind of setting.” GE MENGCHAO, a graduate student in journalism, said he thought Trump would be a better president for China because his business background could mean he would appreciate the countries’ commercial ties. “I think maybe Trump would be friendlier to China, because China and the U.S. share vast common interests, especially in commercial areas,” Ge said. “From the perspective of a businessman, he may take a friendlier approach to China.” ___ AUSTRALIA RICHARD MCCONOCHIE watched the debate on a big screen in a Canberra pub and said, “To me Trump aced it.” “He came across as a man who could control himself. They said Trump’s ignorant of the issues. I think he proved that he had at least a working handle on most of the stuff he was talking about.” “I think he’ll swing a lot of Americans over to Trump just by proving that he is not the sort of unstable, dangerous lunatic that he’s painted to be,” McConochie said. “I don’t see that Trump would be any more incompetent than Clinton.” MILTON GAN, a Sydney-based photographer, said it seemed like Trump was trying to rein in his temper for the first 15 minutes, then went off the rails. “He started interrupting Clinton, he started interrupting (moderator) Lester (Holt) and he started steamrolling. And you could see he was just getting really irate about everything,” Gan said. “The most ridiculous thing was at the end when he said he had the better temperament to be president,” Gan said, laughing. “It was just hilarious.” Clinton came off prepared, confident and composed, Gan said: “Obviously, she’s done her prep and she’s got so much experience in politics and I think that really showed.” ___ BRITAIN TIM STANLEY, a columnist for Britain’s conservative Daily Telegraph, said in his column Tuesday that Trump won the debate but may lose the election. He said Trump repeated many of his outrageous campaign statements and defended his earlier questions about whether President Barack Obama was really born in the U.S., but they played well in a debate that should be judged as reality TV. He said Trump said everything that people who hate Clinton have wanted to say for 30 years. “In terms of reality TV, he did well,” Stanley wrote. “He harassed, he shouted, he taunted, he talked over. And Clinton let him do it.” But he said Trump said nothing during the debate to win over non-whites and female voters and did not act particularly presidential. That means, he said, that Trump probably won’t be getting the chance to redecorate the Oval Office. ___ GERMANY SIGMAR GABRIEL, German vice chancellor and head of the Social Democratic Party, told daily newspaper Bild on Tuesday morning that Clinton was the clear winner and that Trump’s performance showed striking weaknesses. “Trump didn’t have a plan. Neither for the U.S. nor for the big foreign policy challenges,” Gabriel said. “Clinton convinced with competence and clarity. It was a clear victory for her.” HANNES REINHARDT, a 34-year-old who works for a small German publication called zwd, said he didn’t watch the debate live because it started at 3 a.m. in Germany, but he woke up to several push alerts on his phone. “My first impression based on those alerts was that Clinton was leading in the debate,” he said, taking a puff on his cigarette before heading into his office in Berlin’s Mitte neighborhood. Reinhardt said that he hoped Clinton would also win the U.S. elections. “As a German, one can only hope that she will win. She is more moderate and more European, while Trump is very isolationist and a populist,” Reinhardt said. ___ JAPAN NARUSHIGE MICHISHITA, a Japanese analyst, said it was in some ways heartening to hear his country mentioned in the debate, since Japan is often overlooked these days. But he disagreed with Trump’s criticism that Japan and other U.S. allies aren’t contributing enough to their defense. “There is a small truth to what Mr. Trump was saying, in the sense that Japan was a kind of free-rider or at least a cheap-rider back in the 1970s and ’80s,” said Michishita, director of the security and international studies program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “But … now given what Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe is doing to make Japan much more proactive on defense and security matters, and trying to make Japan more engaged in international security affairs, it’s like, ‘What are you talking about?'” HIROTSUGU AIDA, author of a book on the Trump phenomenon, agreed that Trump misunderstood the U.S.-Japan security alliance but said he still did better than Clinton. “Trump unexpectedly acted presidential.

News article:
Before things get crazy, or not, with the melodramatically delayed Wikileaks dump on Hillary Clinton (Julian Assange supposedly feared for his safety in a London balcony speech at the Ecuadorean embassy, so now he addresses followers at the Wikileaks 10th anniversary party in Berlin by video link), one thing in this messy, largely substance-free excuse for a presidential race is crystalline in its clarity. Donald Trump continues to struggle with basic politics, thus giving a free ride to Hillary Clinton's struggle with geopolitics. One of the cornerstones of the former secretary of state's geopolitical strategy, the Syrian civil war, is collapsing right now, even faster than the idea that Trump can get out of his way long enough to drive some points home. The Assad regime is calling on the rebels holding their last urban territory to surrender before the onslaught truly begins. Advertisement Iranian television highlights the progress of Syrian regime forces in retaking Aleppo, last urban stronghold of rebel forces. While Trump struggles to fight the illegal pilfering of his tax information, showing he somehow managed to lose nearly a billion bucks one year and probably skipped paying taxes for many years, he hopes that an equally illegal pilfering, probably by Russian intelligence, of information about Hillary gives him a leg up in the race. That would be the race in which he still only trails by a handful of percentage points despite his week of mostly self-inflicted wounds. But if Trump at all had his act together -- and hadn't already looked like a jock-sniffingly slavish fanboy of Russian President Vladimir Putin -- he could be making some real hay now out of one of Hillary's biggest mistakes, i.e., her attempts to push the US into the Syrian civil war. Advertisement For, despite expensive efforts by the US and some Gulf Arab allies who have pressured Washington, the Assad regime is on the verge of taking Aleppo, which until its recent smashing by Russian air power had been the last urban stronghold for Syrian rebels. Trump's preposterous social media offensive against a former Miss Universe went on for days after his losing but not entirely disastrous debate with Hillary Clinton. If Syrian regime forces, which are joined on the battlefield by Iranian special forces as well as Shiite fighters from Iraq and Lebanon, take Aleppo, the civil war essentially shrinks into a rural insurgency. And Aleppo is about to fall, almost certainly before US-backed forces get very far along in their long awaited offensive to take Mosul back from Isis. Of course, Hillary did foresee that Assad regime forces might effectively push back the rebels, especially with the active backing of Iran, Russia, and transnational Shiite forces. Which is why she has repeatedly called for the US to impose a no-fly zone over Syria. Advertisement There is just one problem with Hillary's no-fly zone. It would probably trigger what could very quickly become a world war. Since the governance of Syria, unlike, say, the maintenance of an open South China Sea, is hardly a core strategic interest of the United States, Hillary's Syria no-fly zone is, let's say, not a good idea. But it is of a piece with, as I discussed in July, the actions which explain why the Kremlin so dislikes the Clintons. Their moves to press Russia date back to NATO expansionism in the post-Cold War 1990s when the once-proud superpower was on its collective ass. Russians have long memories. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says that the Syria no-fly zone advocated by Hillary Clinton would require war with Russia and Syria. "That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not gonna make," the JCS chief noted sardonically. As you can see above, the chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, a tough Marine four-star, stated just the other day that Hillary's no-fly zone would mean war with Russia and Syria. Something he seemed notably unenthusiastic about. Advertisement Ah, but what about humanitarianism? True, the Russians did urge civilians to leave Aleppo a month ago and guaranteed their safe passage through Syrian lines. But few took up the offer. Since then they have hit hospitals and seemed less than discriminating about making sure that other civilians aren't killed. But no one who watched Vladimir Putin pound Grozny can be surprised by this. And we did make the mistake of killing more than 60 Syrian troops after the now-dead ceasefire went into effect, giving ruthless folks the sort of hazy equivalence they like to cite in passing as they pursue their obvious strategic imperatives. Yet the humanitarian issue persists, albeit in a slightly different way. The Syrian civil war has created a terrible refugee crisis that is politically destabilizing the actually kindly government of Germany -- whose Chancellor Angela Merkel's party has recently been smoked in elections in both her home base in East Germany and Berlin -- and much of Western Europe. Russian TV plays up Angela Merkel's woes as the German chancellor's celebration of German Unity Day is disrupted by large numbers of anti-refugee protesters. So the good news here is seemingly perverse. Because Barack Obama is not so foolhardy as to try to impose a no-fly zone against the Russian Air Force, and its state-of-the-art anti-aircraft system, already in place in Syria, we are likely going to lose our proxy war in Syria. Which should lessen the refugee crisis in Europe and confine its next stages to the theater in which it emerged. Advertisement Which is another way of saying that the best solution to the Syrian refugee crisis has always been an end to the Syrian civil war. This is just a more embarrassing, to some, end than the always elusive victory which the regime change-pushing Clinton always sought. Should we ever have gotten involved in the first place? Well, like most, I thrilled to the Arab Spring. But more than a year of watching daily on Al Jazeera (for which I was a part-time analyst) led to the conclusion that the situation with Assad was profoundly problematic. He would not leave and I knew that Russia, for many reasons, and Iran, due to its struggle with the Sunni powers of Gulf Arab states, would go all out to prevent a victory for what was at best an amorphous, and infrequently jihadist, crew arrayed against him. The protest leaders in the great city squares that we fall in love with turn out not to be well suited to win elections (see Egypt) or fight civil wars (see Libya and Syria). So there we are. Had Trump not fan-boyishly extolled Putin -- whom I encountered when I was trying to help Russian liberal reformers back when he was Boris Yeltsin's new intelligence chief and still ostensibly part of the big pro-democracy family -- as anything more than a ruthless, sophisticated professional with whom we can occasionally find common cause, he could make some big hay here at Hillary's expense. But of course he is caught up in his own endless psychodrama, which has tragically gripped us all. Now back to weaponized trivia ... Or not.

News article:
In a heated second presidential debate Sunday night, a red-faced and visibly nervous Donald Trump faced questions about the 2005 tape that showed him boasting of sexually harassing women. Moderator Anderson Cooper asked him: "You described kissing women without their consent and grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?" The construction magnate denied that he had ever sexually assaulted a woman and proceeded to make an incredible change of subject to, yes, the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). What does the radical Islamist group have to do with his lewd comments, one might ask? According to Trump, his comments were just "locker room talk" in a "world where you have ISIS chopping off heads and frankly drowning people in steel cages," going into the gory details of ISIS's propaganda videos. He excused his actions by saying there are worse things happening in the world and, essentially, he suggested that his offensive comments—despite vying for arguably the most important job in the world—are not significant. On the attack at every opportunity against Clinton, Trump proceeded to use the ISIS ISIS ISIS argument throughout the debate. He made it clear that he believes the Obama administration not only aided the creation of the group but has failed to defeat it as quickly as he could. But while doing this, he made a series of erroneous statements about the militant group and the battle to defeat them. Syria, Russia and Iran are "killing ISIS" Trump opposed what his running mate Mike Pence called "provocations by Russia" and his suggestion that the military should "be prepared to use military force to strike" the Assad regime. He said Washington should "knock out ISIS" and proceeded to say that the militaries of Moscow, Damascus and Tehran are "killing ISIS." But Assad's regime views all rebel groups as extremist organizations, with ISIS just one of those, targeting these groups with airstrikes in coordination with the Russian air force and Iranian ground troops. Tehran's ground forces are helping the Syrian army to reclaim territory from the rebels and Russia, just a week after the beginning of its bombing campaign in Syria in September 2015, had launched more than 90 percent of its strikes against the moderate Syrian opposition, and not ISIS, according to the Pentagon. The battle to oust ISIS from territory in Syria and Iraq is actually being undertaken by the U.S.-led coalition from the air, Kurdish forces on the ground in Iraq, and Turkish-backed Syrian rebels and U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds and Arabs in northern Syria. Washington is arming these ground forces and providing tactical and logistical support. The only ISIS-held city liberated from ISIS control by Assad's forces, backed by Russia, since Moscow's entry into the conflict is the ancient city of Palmyra in March. Clinton and Obama created the "vacuum" for ISIS Trump made the case again that Obama and Clinton played a key role in the founding of ISIS through their decision to withdraw troops from Iraq in 2011. This is not true, not on its own, anyway. ISIS already existed in an earlier form, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, from the beginning of the U.S. occupation of Iraq in 2003 under the stewardship of Abu Musab Zarqawi, later becoming the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) in 2006. Therefore, if anything, the foundations of the group lay with the Bush administration. ISI morphed with Syrian jihadis to create "ISIS" in 2013, capitalizing on the power vacuum caused by the Syrian conflict. Assad largely left the group unchallenged to rise in the country's east, where it captured Raqqa, the city that would become its de-facto capital. It is true that the U.S. withdrawal stopped setbacks against ISI, but the rise of ISIS cannot be laid solely at the feet of Obama's decision. Other factors, such as the sectarian leadership of former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, allowed the group to capture areas of predominantly disaffected Sunni populations. The rise of ISIS is a complex picture, more so than the one Trump presents. Another fact that undermines Trump's claim is that he himself called for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2007, saying at that time Washington should "declare victory and leave." Mosul: "They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul" Trump made this claim as if none of ISIS's leadership remain in Mosul. Reports have suggested that key ISIS members are attempting to leave the city, and the group is preparing a network of tunnels to make its escape when the U.S. and Iraqi forces launch their offensive on the northern city, expected to start later this month. ISIS's self-proclaimed caliph is believed to be living in the villages of Baaj, some 160 kilometers from Mosul, according to Iraqi sources. But the U.S.-led coalition is attempting to target and eliminate the group's leadership on a daily basis in the city, or in the surrounding areas that ISIS still controls. Coalition strikes killed two ISIS leaders, Basim Muhammad Ahmad Sultan al-Bajari, ISIS's deputy minister of war, and Hatim Talib al-Hamduni, an ISIS military commander in Mosul, on June 25. U.S. officials have said that in the last month alone, U.S. strikes have killed 13 ISIS leaders in Mosul who had overseen the city's capture in June 2014 and its defense for more than two years. So the U.S.-led coalition is in fact succeeding on this front. Make Mosul a "sneak attack" Trump chided the U.S.-led coalition for not making the impending offensive on Mosul a secretive and lightning attack. But such an operation would be virtually impossible and would result in the loss of more civilian lives than the current strategy of encircling the city and taking ISIS-held territory surrounding the city step-by-step. Mosul is a city of more than one million people, one that ISIS has held for more than two years, and considers to be its biggest prize, where Baghdadi announced the creation of its self-proclaimed caliphate. It also controls large areas around Mosul, that Iraqi forces would have to bypass to reach Mosul. The only possible surprise would be to airdrop thousands of Iraqi troops into the center of Mosul, an option that is completely unrealistic on both a practical and strategic level. This is not a compound in Abbottabad. ISIS knows Washington and Baghdad are coming. They have already recaptured Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah from ISIS. Any conflict to retake Mosul will be protracted and require a vast number of ground troops, intensive coordination with Kurdish and Iraqi forces, not to mention the Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. Humanitarian groups have warned of some 700,000 civilians fleeing the city. Trump's approach would maximize the loss of civilian life in the city, rather than ensure the minimum, as the current strategy plans to achieve. "ISIS has a good chunk" of Libya's oil Trump attempted to score points over Clinton in the debate by pointing to her failure over Libya as secretary of state, going further by repeating the claim that ISIS has captured large amounts of oil in the North African country. "Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi's out. It's a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I'm sure you probably have heard that." But many have not heard that because it's not true. The toppling of Gadhafi has made the country more unstable, with rival militias vying for influence in a civil war that had effectively split the country into western and eastern power centers. ISIS grew in the country as its leadership dispatched aides to set up a new affiliate in the country that was wracked by chaos. The group has attacked oil fields in Libya but has not been able to hold on to any substantial depots and refine the resources that are there. Its reasoning behind attacking oil facilities was simply to disrupt the Libyan government's revenues. It therefore controls no oil in Libya. Experts have said that some oil fields may have come under its control near the central coastal city of Sirte, the only city it controlled in the country. But pro-government militias have pushed the group from the areas surrounding Sirte and its control of the city is now contested, almost eradicated completely. Others have said that they may have only extorted money from militias in control of oil terminals, making their involvement in Libya's oil indirect. Therefore, unlike its oil operation in eastern Syria, where control of oil fields brought in millions of dollars of revenue, Libya has not been as lucrative for ISIS.

News article:
Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump clashed in an acrimonious second debate in St. Louis on October 9, assailing one another's character and record. Here are some highlights of what they had to say on several central campaign issues during the showdown, including the recently leaked video in which Trump was heard talking about kissing and groping women and making other uninvited advances and Russia's alleged attempts to influence the November 8 election with cyberattacks. On Alleged Russian Hacking And Relations With Moscow Hillary Clinton: "Our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts, to influence our election...We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. [The Russians] are doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump." Donald Trump: "I don't know [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS (Islamic State) together, as an example. But I don't know Putin. But I notice anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say 'the Russians.' She doesn’t know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia, and the reason they blame Russia is because they think they are trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia...I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia." On The Video Of Trump Making Lewd Remarks About Women Trump: "That was locker-room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I'm not proud of it. But that was something that happened. If you look at [former President] Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words and his was action. His was -- what he's done to women. There's never been anyone in the history of politics in this nation who has been so abusive to women...Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously." Clinton: "I said starting back in June that [Trump] was not fit to be president and commander in chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard [in the video] on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is. But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is." On Muslim Immigrants And Syrian Refugees Trump: "It's called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria, where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of [U.S. President] Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country, like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time." Clinton: "I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are." On The Syria Conflict And Russia Clinton: "I've stood up to Russia. I've taken on Putin and others. And I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine. And I did as secretary of state. That’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table [on Syria] with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes -- war crimes -- committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable." Trump: "Now, [Clinton] talks tough. She talks really tough against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and against [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn't even know who the rebels are. Every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look at what she did in Libya with Qaddafi. Qaddafi's out and it's a mess. ... I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy." On Clinton's Use Of A Private E-Mail Server As Secretary Of State Trump: "If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it...We're going to get a special prosecutor and we're going to look into it. Because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself." Clinton: "That was a mistake. I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I'm not making any excuses. It was a mistake, and I am very sorry about that. But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a yearlong investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using." On What The Candidates Respect About One Another Clinton: "I respect [Trump's] children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does. But I do respect that, and I think that is something that, as a mother and a grandmother, is very important to me." Trump: "I will say this about Hillary: She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She's a fighter. I disagree with much of what she's fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit. And she doesn't give up, and I consider that to be a very good trait." With reporting by NPR, dpa, and The Los Angeles Times

News article:
Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump clashed in an acrimonious second debate in St. Louis on October 9, assailing one another's character and record. Here are some highlights of what they had to say on several central campaign issues during the showdown, including the recently leaked video in which Trump was heard talking about kissing and groping women and making other uninvited advances and Russia's alleged attempts to influence the November 8 election with cyberattacks. On Alleged Russian Hacking And Relations With Moscow Hillary Clinton: "Our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts, to influence our election...We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. [The Russians] are doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump." Donald Trump: "I don't know [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS (Islamic State) together, as an example. But I don't know Putin. But I notice anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say 'the Russians.' She doesn’t know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia, and the reason they blame Russia is because they think they are trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia...I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia." On The Video Of Trump Making Lewd Remarks About Women Trump: "That was locker-room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I'm not proud of it. But that was something that happened. If you look at [former President] Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words and his was action. His was -- what he's done to women. There's never been anyone in the history of politics in this nation who has been so abusive to women...Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously." Clinton: "I said starting back in June that [Trump] was not fit to be president and commander in chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard [in the video] on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is. But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is." On Muslim Immigrants And Syrian Refugees Trump: "It's called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria, where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of [U.S. President] Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country, like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time." Clinton: "I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part.

News article:
Hillary Clinton Adam Schultz Hillary for America A batch of internal Clinton campaign emails published by Wikileaks in recent days reveals the extent to which campaign donors drive Hillary Clinton’s rhetoric and policy positions on Israel and the broader Middle East. Last year, Hillary Clinton wrote a letter to billionaire media mogul Haim Saban on her campaign stationery vowing “to make countering BDS a priority” if she wins the presidency. Saban has donated at least $7 million to getting Clinton elected president and openly confesses that his number one priority is influencing US policy in Israel’s favor. According to the emails between Clinton’s senior campaign aides, the letter to Saban was deliberately leaked to friendly media to attract pro-Israel donors concerned about the rise of the BDS – boycott, divestment and sanctions – movement. The way the campaign aides discuss the issue is completely devoid of emotion or ideology. It’s all about the donors. Opposing BDS to please donors In a 3 July 2015 email to campaign staffers, Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook wrote, “I was just thinking: has she made a clear statement on Israel yet? I get this question from donors all the time. Does she need to state her principles on Israel before Iran? Or do both at the same time?” “That’s basically the goal of the BDS letter,” responded Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin. “We could either get a donor to leak it or just give it to a reporter if we want to get it out there. I’m semi-surprised it’s not out yet,” replied deputy communications director Christina Reynolds. Clinton’s voice is nowhere to be seen in the correspondence. “We have a two pager I’m getting clearance from her on. That is what we have to ship around,” Jake Sullivan, a senior foreign policy adviser to Clinton, wrote. “Let’s def give it to someone. I see zero downside to a story. Then we can circulate around right away (hopefully) in advance of Iran,” reasoned Mook. “If Haim’s going to give it to the Jewish media, I think that solves our problem. Once they write, we can make sure it gets picked up by some of our beat guys,” Christina Reynolds responded. Three days later, Politico reported on and published the letter. The emails show Saban coordinating directly with the Clinton campaign, offering positive reinforcement for Clinton’s pro-Israel messaging and strategizing with Clinton aides against BDS. Israel’s liaison The emails show that Stuart Eizenstat, a former US ambassador to the EU under President Bill Clinton, acted as a liaison between the Israeli government and the Hillary Clinton campaign, counseling senior staffers on how to adjust their messaging to the liking of the Israeli leadership. Eizenstat wrote lengthy and detailed emails to campaign aides summarizing his meetings with Israeli government officials and recommending talking points for Clinton to adopt. The Clinton campaign frequently thanked Eizenstat for his counsel, regularly implemented his suggestions and often sought his approval on speeches related to Israel. “I took some of your concepts but left out the specifics,” foreign policy adviser Sullivan wrote in a July 2015 email to Eizenstat. Sullivan was seeking pointers for Clinton’s statement in response to the passage of the Iran nuclear deal. A month earlier, Sullivan messaged Eizenstat for advice on BDS: “I was talking to HRC [Hillary Clinton] today about the idea of having her meet with some Jewish leaders later this week about BDS/delegitimization efforts. She and the leaders could go out and make a statement following the meeting.” Sullivan sought Eizenstat’s opinion on who Clinton should include in such an initiative. Netanyahu is ready for Hillary In December 2015, Eizenstat reported on his “meeting with a senior [Israeli] official who is very close to the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu], and knows his thinking.” “The prime minister always had a ‘surprising good relationship’ with Hillary; she is ‘easy to work with,’ and that she is more instinctively sympathetic to Israel than the White House,” Eizenstat wrote. The official also told Eizenstat that “Israel [sic] Arabs are a ‘real problem.’ The government had to dismantle the northern branch of the Islamic Association because they were radicalizing the Israeli Arabs, who are 20 percent of the population.” Eizenstat was referring to Israel’s ban on the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement, a political party with a large following among Palestinian citizens of Israel. Eizenstat’s emails also reflect the Israeli leadership’s intense hostility toward President Barack Obama. In a May 2015 email to the Clinton campaign, Eizenstat noted that in his meeting with the Israelis, “The level of vitriol against the president was striking, to such a degree that one participant urged that he was being unfairly demonized.” In June 2015, Eizenstat wrote, “I was struck in my week in Israel, not only among Israeli officials, but among my friends across the political spectrum (most are former officials) and apolitical relatives, at the depth of antipathy and distrust of President Obama, as ‘weak,’ ‘pro-Muslim’ and ‘anti-Israel.’” “Attack, attack, attack” In another June 2015 email, Eizenstat provides details of a meeting with Netanyahu and his cabinet in which Netanyahu urges attacking BDS and recruiting Latinos, Evangelical Christians and Asian Americans to assist in the effort. Summarizing Netanyahu’s views, Eizenstat wrote: “On BDS, Israel should move from the defense to the offense. It should be attacked on moral grounds. It is ‘unjust’ and ‘cruel.’ Israel must attack its attackers. The best defense is a good offense: ‘attack, attack, attack.’” Smearing BDS In an August 2015 email labeled “NOT FOR CIRCULATION,” Eizenstat passed along advice to Hillary Clinton from Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador in Washington. A US-born right-winger who has been called “Bibi’s brain,” Dermer told Eizenstat that the Israeli government was plotting to smear Palestine solidarity activism on college campuses as terrorism. “They will shortly expose the funding base for the main BDS group on campus, Students for Justice in Palestine, which tie it with terrorist funding,” Eizenstat wrote. “The key is to expose BDS as anti-Semitic and anti-Israel.” No-fly zone would “kill a lot of Syrians” During the Democratic Party primary race, Bernie Sanders repeatedly called on Clinton to release the transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks, but she refused. One of the most damning aspects of the latest Wikileaks dump is the excerpts of Clinton’s paid speeches. In a speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013, Clinton confessed that a no-fly zone in Syria would “kill a lot of Syrians.” This is because it would require bombing Syria’s air defenses, “many of which are located in populated areas,” according to Clinton. While making this assessment in private, Clinton has continued to publicly advocate for a no-fly zone, ostensibly to protect Syrian civilians. Saudi support for ISIS Clinton told the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago at a luncheon in 2013 that Israel and Jordan were working in close partnership for the purpose of “shoring up King Abdullah.” That same year she told congregants at a synagogue, “One of the developments of the Arab Spring is that you now have Israel and Saudi Arabia more closely aligned in their foreign policy” in the region. Publicly, Clinton frequently casts Iran as the single greatest funder of terrorism in the world. But privately she has repeatedly acknowledged Saudi Arabia’s contribution to violent extremism. At a Jewish United Fund dinner in 2013, Clinton said she preferred “a more robust, covert action” to arm Syrian rebels against the government of Bashar al-Assad. But she added that this was complicated, because “the Saudis and others are shipping large amounts of weapons – and pretty indiscriminately – not at all targeted toward the people that we think would be the more moderate.” She also described Saudi Arabia’s fierce opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood as “kind of ironic since the Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on earth over the course of the last 30 years.” In one of the leaked emails Clinton accuses Saudi Arabia and Qatar of funding the Islamic State, sometimes referred to as ISIS or ISIL. Citing “Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region,” Clinton wrote. “We need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” It’s all about the donors The Clinton Foundation has accepted millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. And while serving as secretary of state, Clinton greenlighted enormous weapons deals to those countries. From Israel to Saudi Arabia, it is clear that Clinton’s donors are in charge. They exert more influence over her public positions and policy prescriptions than she does. If Clinton were running against Senators Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio, these emails would be scandalous. Instead, the leaks have been completely overshadowed by the even more sensational and lurid October surprise that befell Republican nominee Donald Trump. Clinton is lucky her opponent is more disliked and disingenuous than she is.

The official also told Eizenstat that “Israel [sic] Arabs are a ‘real problem.’ The government had to dismantle the northern branch of the Islamic Association because they were radicalizing the Israeli Arabs, who are 20 percent of the population.” Eizenstat was referring to Israel’s ban on the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement, a political party with a large following among Palestinian citizens of Israel. Eizenstat’s emails also reflect the Israeli leadership’s intense hostility toward President Barack Obama. In a May 2015 email to the Clinton campaign, Eizenstat noted that in his meeting with the Israelis, “The level of vitriol against the president was striking, to such a degree that one participant urged that he was being unfairly demonized.” In June 2015, Eizenstat wrote, “I was struck in my week in Israel, not only among Israeli officials, but among my friends across the political spectrum (most are former officials) and apolitical relatives, at the depth of antipathy and distrust of President Obama, as ‘weak,’ ‘pro-Muslim’ and ‘anti-Israel.’” “Attack, attack, attack” In another June 2015 email, Eizenstat provides details of a meeting with Netanyahu and his cabinet in which Netanyahu urges attacking BDS and recruiting Latinos, Evangelical Christians and Asian Americans to assist in the effort. Summarizing Netanyahu’s views, Eizenstat wrote: “On BDS, Israel should move from the defense to the offense. It should be attacked on moral grounds. It is ‘unjust’ and ‘cruel.’ Israel must attack its attackers. The best defense is a good offense: ‘attack, attack, attack.’” Smearing BDS In an August 2015 email labeled “NOT FOR CIRCULATION,” Eizenstat passed along advice to Hillary Clinton from Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador in Washington. A US-born right-winger who has been called “Bibi’s brain,” Dermer told Eizenstat that the Israeli government was plotting to smear Palestine solidarity activism on college campuses as terrorism. “They will shortly expose the funding base for the main BDS group on campus, Students for Justice in Palestine, which tie it with terrorist funding,” Eizenstat wrote. “The key is to expose BDS as anti-Semitic and anti-Israel.” No-fly zone would “kill a lot of Syrians” During the Democratic Party primary race, Bernie Sanders repeatedly called on Clinton to release the transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks, but she refused. One of the most damning aspects of the latest Wikileaks dump is the excerpts of Clinton’s paid speeches. In a speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013, Clinton confessed that a no-fly zone in Syria would “kill a lot of Syrians.” This is because it would require bombing Syria’s air defenses, “many of which are located in populated areas,” according to Clinton. While making this assessment in private, Clinton has continued to publicly advocate for a no-fly zone, ostensibly to protect Syrian civilians. Saudi support for ISIS Clinton told the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago at a luncheon in 2013 that Israel and Jordan were working in close partnership for the purpose of “shoring up King Abdullah.” That same year she told congregants at a synagogue, “One of the developments of the Arab Spring is that you now have Israel and Saudi Arabia more closely aligned in their foreign policy” in the region. Publicly, Clinton frequently casts Iran as the single greatest funder of terrorism in the world. But privately she has repeatedly acknowledged Saudi Arabia’s contribution to violent extremism. At a Jewish United Fund dinner in 2013, Clinton said she preferred “a more robust, covert action” to arm Syrian rebels against the government of Bashar al-Assad. But she added that this was complicated, because “the Saudis and others are shipping large amounts of weapons – and pretty indiscriminately – not at all targeted toward the people that we think would be the more moderate.” She also described Saudi Arabia’s fierce opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood as “kind of ironic since the Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on earth over the course of the last 30 years.” In one of the leaked emails Clinton accuses Saudi Arabia and Qatar of funding the Islamic State, sometimes referred to as ISIS or ISIL. Citing “Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region,” Clinton wrote. “We need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” It’s all about the donors The Clinton Foundation has accepted millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. And while serving as secretary of state, Clinton greenlighted enormous weapons deals to those countries. From Israel to Saudi Arabia, it is clear that Clinton’s donors are in charge. They exert more influence over her public positions and policy prescriptions than she does. If Clinton were running against Senators Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio, these emails would be scandalous. Instead, the leaks have been completely overshadowed by the even more sensational and lurid October surprise that befell Republican nominee Donald Trump. Clinton is lucky her opponent is more disliked and disingenuous than she is.

News article:
Hillary Clinton Adam Schultz Hillary for America A batch of internal Clinton campaign emails published by Wikileaks in recent days reveals the extent to which campaign donors drive Hillary Clinton’s rhetoric and policy positions on Israel and the broader Middle East. Last year, Hillary Clinton wrote a letter to billionaire media mogul Haim Saban on her campaign stationery vowing “to make countering BDS a priority” if she wins the presidency. Saban has donated at least $7 million to getting Clinton elected president and openly confesses that his number one priority is influencing US policy in Israel’s favor. According to the emails between Clinton’s senior campaign aides, the letter to Saban was deliberately leaked to friendly media to attract pro-Israel donors concerned about the rise of the BDS – boycott, divestment and sanctions – movement. The way the campaign aides discuss the issue is completely devoid of emotion or ideology. It’s all about the donors. Opposing BDS to please donors In a 3 July 2015 email to campaign staffers, Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook wrote, “I was just thinking: has she made a clear statement on Israel yet? I get this question from donors all the time. Does she need to state her principles on Israel before Iran? Or do both at the same time?” “That’s basically the goal of the BDS letter,” responded Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin. “We could either get a donor to leak it or just give it to a reporter if we want to get it out there. I’m semi-surprised it’s not out yet,” replied deputy communications director Christina Reynolds. Clinton’s voice is nowhere to be seen in the correspondence. “We have a two pager I’m getting clearance from her on. That is what we have to ship around,” Jake Sullivan, a senior foreign policy adviser to Clinton, wrote. “Let’s def give it to someone. I see zero downside to a story. Then we can circulate around right away (hopefully) in advance of Iran,” reasoned Mook. “If Haim’s going to give it to the Jewish media, I think that solves our problem. Once they write, we can make sure it gets picked up by some of our beat guys,” Christina Reynolds responded. Three days later, Politico reported on and published the letter. The emails show Saban coordinating directly with the Clinton campaign, offering positive reinforcement for Clinton’s pro-Israel messaging and strategizing with Clinton aides against BDS. Israel’s liaison The emails show that Stuart Eizenstat, a former US ambassador to the EU under President Bill Clinton, acted as a liaison between the Israeli government and the Hillary Clinton campaign, counseling senior staffers on how to adjust their messaging to the liking of the Israeli leadership. Eizenstat wrote lengthy and detailed emails to campaign aides summarizing his meetings with Israeli government officials and recommending talking points for Clinton to adopt. The Clinton campaign frequently thanked Eizenstat for his counsel, regularly implemented his suggestions and often sought his approval on speeches related to Israel. “I took some of your concepts but left out the specifics,” foreign policy adviser Sullivan wrote in a July 2015 email to Eizenstat. Sullivan was seeking pointers for Clinton’s statement in response to the passage of the Iran nuclear deal. A month earlier, Sullivan messaged Eizenstat for advice on BDS: “I was talking to HRC [Hillary Clinton] today about the idea of having her meet with some Jewish leaders later this week about BDS/delegitimization efforts. She and the leaders could go out and make a statement following the meeting.” Sullivan sought Eizenstat’s opinion on who Clinton should include in such an initiative. Netanyahu is ready for Hillary In December 2015, Eizenstat reported on his “meeting with a senior [Israeli] official who is very close to the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu], and knows his thinking.” “The prime minister always had a ‘surprising good relationship’ with Hillary; she is ‘easy to work with,’ and that she is more instinctively sympathetic to Israel than the White House,” Eizenstat wrote.

News article:
First, here is the problem with Clinton and Bashar Assad. Now she is vehemently anti -Assad, but alas, here is the famous Face the Nation interview from 27 March 2011, when Syria is already burning, in which the then Secretary of State, referred to the dictator as a ''reformist'', who is expected to take the proper action and correct the situation leading to the outburst of protest in his country. A moot point? Not really, because she should have known and understand better at that time. The reference to Bashar Assad as a ''reformist'' belonged already before the beginning of violent protest in Syria to the Hall of Fame of the political absurd. Yes, Left Wingers and Liberals in the West were fascinated by a young fellow speaking good English, believing that this in itself is a certificate of progress, ignoring a political culture of sectarian oppression leading to inevitable economic stagnation . In sum, anything but reforms. Trump of course, did not respond to that, nor did the moderators ask the former Secretary to explain, but the problem emerging is one of conceptual misunderstanding of the future President about what the Middle East in general and a country like Syria in particular, need to happen which will be considered to be a REAL reform. Second, it was the point about the Kurds, who, as she said, should be armed. Yes, they should, and should have been since 2011 when she was in place as Secretary of State. But then, what for? What is the endgame? Is it to use them as the West's mercenaries against ISIS only, or is it to allow them to finally realize a measure of nationhood in North East Syria? If it is the latter, then the Kurds fight and will always for their own homes and survival, if however it is also to achieve the former, then there is the Turkish factor, and the Turkish PM was quick to criticize the former Secretary a few days ago. I, for one, expected her to say something about the fact, that the current Turkish invasion to Syria is NOT against ISIS but against the Kurds, and it has the support of the Obama Administration. So, in fairness to reality, what REALLY does it mean when the next President calls for arming the Kurds? Third, Clinton referred to the negative role of Iran in Syria. With that, we move from the absurd and unreliable elements of the first two points, to the sheer irritation. Yes, this is Iran which is perpetuating the conflict in Syria, yes it is Iran which is engaged in a bloody anti -Sunni war there, but it does it with 150 BN $ US added to their coffers by the nuclear deal which Clinton claims credit for, and with the licence of moderation given to Iran exactly by that agreement. So, where is the real Iran role in all that? Many in Syria and the rest of the Middle East think, that it is in the killing fields of Syria where we see the true face of the Mullahs, not in the conference rooms in Vienna. It was so easy for her to get away with all that in the debate , because Trump, if I understood correctly his gibberish English, is all but ready to succumb Syria to Iran and Russia altogether.

News article:
WASHINGTON — In a series of paid speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2013, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said the US should “bomb” Iran’s nuclear facilities if the Islamic Republic inched too closely to developing a nuclear weapon, while noting that the Israelis could not “do much damage themselves,” according to transcripts released by WikiLeaks on Saturday. Clinton told the firm’s CEO Lloyd Bankfein at a South Carolina conference on June 4, 2013, that if Tehran raced toward the bomb, the US must “up the pain,” but without “boots on the ground.” She spoke five months before the interim agreement was reached that set the framework for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name of the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. During the forum, Blankfein asked Clinton how to prevent the Iranian regime from becoming a nuclear power without launching an invasion, after expressing incredulity that such an incursion would achieve the desired outcome. “It’s hard to imagine going into something as open-ended and uncontainable as the occupation of Iran,” he said. “How else can you stop them from doing something they [are] committed to doing?” To which Clinton responded: “Well, you up the pain that they have to endure by not in any way occupying or invading them but by bombing their facilities. I mean, that is the option. It is not, as we like to say these days, boots on the ground.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Later, she added: “We have to bomb the facilities. They act as though there would be no consequences either predicted or unpredicted. Of course there would be, and you already are dealing with a regime that is the principal funder and supplier of terrorism in the world today.” At that same June event, Clinton indicated the Israelis did not have the military capabilities to strike the Iranian nuclear facilities and successfully set back its activities. “The Israelis, as you know, have looked at this very closely for a number of years. The Israelis’ estimate is even if we set their program back for just a couple of years it’s worth doing and whatever their reaction might be is absorbable,” she told Blackfein. “That has been up until this recent government, the prior government, their position. But they couldn’t do much damage themselves. We now have a weapon that is quite a serious one.” Advertisement “It’s a penetrator,” she added. “Because if you can’t get through the hardened covering over these plants into where the centrifuges are you can’t set them back. So you have to be able to drop what is a very large precision-guided weapon.” The leaked transcripts of Clinton’s speeches at the June event and two others were released Saturday by WikiLeaks as part of a trove of hacked emails from her campaign manager John Podesta’s account. The release is now the latest bid by the group to inject itself into this year’s presidential campaign. US officials have said WikiLeaks is working with Russian operatives to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and boost her opponent Donald Trump. So far the group has unveiled 11,000 hacked emails and purports to release 50,000 more before the November 8 election. The Clinton campaign has neither denied nor confirmed the authenticity of the transcripts of her high-priced Wall Street speeches. They have also not challenged any of the emails that the group has already made public. In another speech at the Aims Alternative Investments Symposium on October 23, 2013, almost one month before the interim deal was announced, Clinton continued to express support for efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear threat, but also voiced skepticism about the plan. “I think it’s very tough to reach a credible deal with Iran, but I think you have to try,” she said. Advertisement She also said that Tehran has no right to enrich uranium. “The Iranians’ position for as long as I’ve been closely following it and involved in it is ‘we have a right to enrich.’ Now, technically they don’t. They’re signatory to the nonproliferation, they do not have a right to enrich, but that is their bottom line demand, and that’s what they’re trying to obtain international recognition for,” Clinton said. Clinton has made similar statements in past interviews before, but she supported allowing for some enrichment as secretary of state. During a March 2011 testimony in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, she endorsed letting Iran enrich “under very strict conditions.” Three years later, she told The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg that she’s “always been in the camp that held that they did not have a right to enrichment. Contrary to their claim, there is no such thing as a right to enrich. This is absolutely unfounded. There is no such right.” “I am well aware that I am not at the negotiating table anymore, but I think it’s important to send a signal to everybody who is there that there cannot be a deal unless there is a clear set of restrictions on Iran,” she added, before specifying the “preference would be no enrichment. The potential fallback position would be such little enrichment that they could not break out.” Since the JCPOA was signed in July 2015, Clinton has supported the deal but has suggested she would enforce it forcefully as president and combat the regime’s nefarious exploits in the region. Under the contours of the deal, Iran is allowed to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. It can retain roughly 5,000 centrifuges and preserve no more than 3.7 percent enrichment for the next 15 years. The International Atomic Energy Agency has verified that Iran eliminated its stockpile of 20 percent-enriched uranium, which, if maintained, could be purified to weapons-grade in short order. The presidential hopeful provided a robust defense of the accord at this year’s AIPAC Policy Conference, including its reduction of Iran’s enriched uranium, while also raising concerns about weaknesses in the deal and Iranian behavior. Advertisement “Today, Iran’s enriched uranium is all but gone, thousands of centrifuges have stopped spinning, Iran’s potential breakout time has increased and new verification measures are in place to help us deter and detect any cheating,” she said in March, before going on to say the deal “must come with vigorous enforcement.” According to Politico, the Clinton campaign plans to respond to the WikiLeaks releases by drawing a comparison to the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of former US president Richard Nixon. “We’re witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election,” Clinton campaign spokesperson Glen Caplin wrote in an early version of the post soon to go on Medium’s website.

News article:
WASHINGTON — In a series of paid speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2013, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said the US should “bomb” Iran’s nuclear facilities if the Islamic Republic inched too closely to developing a nuclear weapon, while noting that the Israelis could not “do much damage themselves,” according to transcripts released by WikiLeaks on Saturday. Clinton told the firm’s CEO Lloyd Bankfein at a South Carolina conference on June 4, 2013, that if Tehran raced toward the bomb, the US must “up the pain,” but without “boots on the ground.” She spoke five months before the interim agreement was reached that set the framework for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name of the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. During the forum, Blankfein asked Clinton how to prevent the Iranian regime from becoming a nuclear power without launching an invasion, after expressing incredulity that such an incursion would achieve the desired outcome. “It’s hard to imagine going into something as open-ended and uncontainable as the occupation of Iran,” he said. “How else can you stop them from doing something they [are] committed to doing?” To which Clinton responded: “Well, you up the pain that they have to endure by not in any way occupying or invading them but by bombing their facilities. I mean, that is the option. It is not, as we like to say these days, boots on the ground.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Later, she added: “We have to bomb the facilities. They act as though there would be no consequences either predicted or unpredicted. Of course there would be, and you already are dealing with a regime that is the principal funder and supplier of terrorism in the world today.” At that same June event, Clinton indicated the Israelis did not have the military capabilities to strike the Iranian nuclear facilities and successfully set back its activities. “The Israelis, as you know, have looked at this very closely for a number of years. The Israelis’ estimate is even if we set their program back for just a couple of years it’s worth doing and whatever their reaction might be is absorbable,” she told Blackfein. “That has been up until this recent government, the prior government, their position. But they couldn’t do much damage themselves. We now have a weapon that is quite a serious one.” Advertisement “It’s a penetrator,” she added. “Because if you can’t get through the hardened covering over these plants into where the centrifuges are you can’t set them back. So you have to be able to drop what is a very large precision-guided weapon.” The leaked transcripts of Clinton’s speeches at the June event and two others were released Saturday by WikiLeaks as part of a trove of hacked emails from her campaign manager John Podesta’s account. The release is now the latest bid by the group to inject itself into this year’s presidential campaign. US officials have said WikiLeaks is working with Russian operatives to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and boost her opponent Donald Trump. So far the group has unveiled 11,000 hacked emails and purports to release 50,000 more before the November 8 election. The Clinton campaign has neither denied nor confirmed the authenticity of the transcripts of her high-priced Wall Street speeches. They have also not challenged any of the emails that the group has already made public. In another speech at the Aims Alternative Investments Symposium on October 23, 2013, almost one month before the interim deal was announced, Clinton continued to express support for efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear threat, but also voiced skepticism about the plan. “I think it’s very tough to reach a credible deal with Iran, but I think you have to try,” she said. Advertisement She also said that Tehran has no right to enrich uranium. “The Iranians’ position for as long as I’ve been closely following it and involved in it is ‘we have a right to enrich.’ Now, technically they don’t. They’re signatory to the nonproliferation, they do not have a right to enrich, but that is their bottom line demand, and that’s what they’re trying to obtain international recognition for,” Clinton said. Clinton has made similar statements in past interviews before, but she supported allowing for some enrichment as secretary of state. During a March 2011 testimony in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, she endorsed letting Iran enrich “under very strict conditions.” Three years later, she told The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg that she’s “always been in the camp that held that they did not have a right to enrichment. Contrary to their claim, there is no such thing as a right to enrich. This is absolutely unfounded. There is no such right.” “I am well aware that I am not at the negotiating table anymore, but I think it’s important to send a signal to everybody who is there that there cannot be a deal unless there is a clear set of restrictions on Iran,” she added, before specifying the “preference would be no enrichment. The potential fallback position would be such little enrichment that they could not break out.” Since the JCPOA was signed in July 2015, Clinton has supported the deal but has suggested she would enforce it forcefully as president and combat the regime’s nefarious exploits in the region. Under the contours of the deal, Iran is allowed to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. It can retain roughly 5,000 centrifuges and preserve no more than 3.7 percent enrichment for the next 15 years. The International Atomic Energy Agency has verified that Iran eliminated its stockpile of 20 percent-enriched uranium, which, if maintained, could be purified to weapons-grade in short order. The presidential hopeful provided a robust defense of the accord at this year’s AIPAC Policy Conference, including its reduction of Iran’s enriched uranium, while also raising concerns about weaknesses in the deal and Iranian behavior. Advertisement “Today, Iran’s enriched uranium is all but gone, thousands of centrifuges have stopped spinning, Iran’s potential breakout time has increased and new verification measures are in place to help us deter and detect any cheating,” she said in March, before going on to say the deal “must come with vigorous enforcement.” According to Politico, the Clinton campaign plans to respond to the WikiLeaks releases by drawing a comparison to the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of former US president Richard Nixon. “We’re witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election,” Clinton campaign spokesperson Glen Caplin wrote in an early version of the post soon to go on Medium’s website.

News article:
WASHINGTON — Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer told a campaign aide of Hillary Clinton that the Obama administration was “tone deaf” to the “existential threat” Israel faces from Iran, according to an email from Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta that has been released by WikiLeaks. On July 2, 2015, roughly two weeks before the nuclear accord between Iran and world powers was reached, former US diplomat Stuart Eizenstat sent Clinton’s top foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan a summation of a recent meeting with Dermer. In that message, Eizenstat relayed that Dermer upbraided President Obama’s team for its failure to appreciate Israeli concerns over the Iranian accord. “The Administration is ‘tone deaf’ about the ‘existential threat’ to Israel from Iran,” he quoted Dermer as saying. The Israeli ambassador also recognized that the former secretary of state would likely need to support the deal in her campaign for the presidency, but went on to issue advice for how she should best handle that support amid her bid for the White House. “It is important that even as Hillary endorses the agreement, and says she would vote for it if she was in the Senate, she ‘should not get too invested in it,'” Dermer said, according to Eizenstat. “She should ‘list the concerns’ she has with it, while saying that ‘it is better than no deal.'” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Much of the further counsel that Dermer reportedly provided was seemingly heeded by the presidential hopeful. Eizenstat told Sullivan that Clinton needed to emphasize that she would, as president: “confront Iran’s challenges in other areas (terrorism, Syria, Iraq)”; “maintain all the non-nuclear sanctions on Iran (human rights, terrorism, etc.)”; “join her support for the nuclear deal with a strong statement that as president she would strengthen all of the US allies in the region, starting with Israel,”; and vow to “redouble efforts to work closely with Israel.” Indeed, in her first speech expressing support for the landmark pact, at the Brookings Institution in September 2015, Clinton promised to “vigorously enforce and strengthen, if necessary, the American sanctions on Iran and its Revolutionary Guard for its sponsorship of terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and other destabilizing activities. Advertisement “I’ll enforce and strengthen, if necessary, our restrictions on sending arms to Iran and from Iran, to bad actors like Syria,” she continued. “And I’ll impose these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities, whether they’re in Iran or overseas.” She also said of Tehran: “They vowed to destroy Israel. And that’s worth saying again, they vowed to destroy Israel. We cannot ever take that lightly, particularly when Iran ships advanced missiles to Hezbollah, and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating Israel or talks about how Israel won’t exist in 25 years.” When introducing her strategy for managing the Iran issue after implementation of the deal, Clinton stressed her objective of fortifying the US-Israel relationship and enhancing the Jewish state’s military capabilities. “First, I will deepen America’s unshakeable commitment to Israel’s security, including our longstanding tradition of guaranteeing Israel’s qualitative military edge,” she said. “I’ll increase support for Israel rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing. I’ll sell Israel the most sophisticated fighter aircraft ever developed, the F-35. We’ll work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping, as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for Northern Israel, which has been subjected to Hezbollah’s attacks for years.” Throughout her campaign Clinton has made similar pledges when prodded to discuss the Middle East, including signaling that she would enforce the Iran deal strenuously and would be willing to exert force if necessary. “If I’m elected the leaders of Iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitment not to seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, the United States will act to stop it, and that we will do so with force if necessary,” she said to the AIPAC Policy Conference in March. Advertisement WikiLeaks began divulging the Podesta emails last week, and has been releasing a steady stream of messages from the hacked account on an almost daily basis. They mark an unprecedented effort by the group to inject itself into this year’s presidential campaign. US officials have said WikiLeaks is working with Russian operatives to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and boost her opponent Donald Trump. So far the group has unveiled 11,000 hacked emails and purports to release 50,000 more before the November 8 election. The Clinton campaign has neither denied nor confirmed the authenticity of these emails.

News article:
Private documents released by WikiLeaks show that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held significantly different private views on Middle East policy than President Barack Obama, Eli Lake of Bloomberg View reported Monday. In the transcript of a speech given to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton rejected the idea that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was in any way an agent of moderate change in Iran. “I believe that Rouhani was allowed to be elected by the two major power sources in Iran, the supreme leader and the clerics and the Revolutionary Guard … in part because the sanctions were having a quite damaging effect on the economy,” her transcript read. “I don’t think anyone should have any illusions as to the motives of the Iranian leadership,” she added. “What they really want to do is get sanction relief and give as little as possible for that sanction relief.” She also dismissed Rouhani’s moderation as a “charm offensive” intended to deceive the West, not to bring about change in Iran. This contrasted with the view that Obama expressed to NPR in April 2015, when he portrayed Rouhani as a change agent: “I think that, if in fact the Rouhani administration — the forces that are more moderating, even if, let’s acknowledge, that they don’t share our values and they still consider us an enemy — if they are shown to have delivered for their people, presumably it strengthens their hand vis-a-vis some of the hardliners inside of Iran.” Leaked e-mails show Clinton to be more attentive to concerns of skeptics of the nuclear deal with Iran. In a December 2015 e-mail exchange between Stuart Eizenstat, a senior State Department official under Bill Clinton, and Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton’s chief national security adviser, Eizenstat quoted a senior Israeli official who wrote that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “always had a ‘surprising good relationship’ with Hillary; she is ‘easy to work with,’ and that she is more instinctively sympathetic to Israel than the White House.” In another speech, Clinton criticized the president for his failure to enforce the “red line” he declared when the government of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in September 2013, killing more than 1,400 people. “You can’t squander your reputation and your leadership capital,” Clinton said at a Goldman Sachs event in October 2013. “You have to do what you say you’re going to do. You have to be smart about executing on your strategies. And you’ve got to be careful not to send the wrong message to others, such as Iran.” The WikiLeaks transcripts comport with other indications Clinton has given about what shape U.S. foreign policy might take under her administration. In a speech at the Brookings Institution in September 2015, Clinton outlined five steps she would take to counter Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East: an “unshakeable commitment to Israel’s military security;” defending the Persian Gulf and assuring Gulf allies that America will act if they are threatened; building coalitions across the Middle East to battle Iran’s proxies and to enforce embargoes of Iranian arms shipments; taking a strong stand against Iran’s humans rights abuses; and adopting a “comprehensive regional strategy that promotes stability and counters extremism.” In the same speech, Clinton said that “not being able to follow through on [the “red line” violation] cost us.” She also pledged to keep disagreements with the Israeli government private, and to invite the Israeli prime minister to Washington during her first month in office, which she reiterated in an op-ed in The Forward.

News article:
At the third and final presidential debate Wednesday, claims from both candidates on issues outside of U.S. borders were once again flying around as they sought to land their verbal blows at their last face-to-face meeting before the vote on November 8. Below we look at the credibility of six key claims the candidates made about the world and U.S. foreign policy. Can the charges they made be supported by the facts on the ground? PUTIN What Hillary said: Trump would be Vladimir Putin's "puppet" as president Is it true? The idea that Putin wants Trump to win has been a key Clinton attack line for much of the campaign. There is something in it. Trump has in the past expressed admiration for Putin as a strong leader, and many commentators have noted how documents released by Wikileaks during the election cycle have disproportionately harmed Clinton. U.S. officials reportedly believe that at least some of the leaked material was stolen by Russian government hackers. But there is no proof of any direct link between Putin's government and either Trump or Wikileaks. So while it's probably valid to say that Putin is enjoying the kicking Trump has given the American establishment, the jury's out on whether Trump could be called a "puppet" or just a "more sympathetic ear." OPEN BORDERS What Trump said: "She wants open borders, OK?" Is it true? Trump was referring to a speech Clinton gave to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau in 2013, released this year by Wikileaks, in which she said: "My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders." Clinton responded at the debate that she was talking about energy policy, which isn't quite sufficient. But whatever her private ideology, anyone looking at her record on immigration and her current proposed policy won't find anything meeting the definition of "open borders." While she has supported a range of ideas making it easier for some undocumented immigrants to get a path to U.S. citizenship, she has also previously supported accompanying legislation that would toughen border security, and has said as a candidate she wants to deport some violent criminals. REFUGEES What Trump said: Obama's refugee policy involves allowing in "thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from." Is it true? It is true that Obama has welcomed "thousands and thousands" of refugees into America (about 10,000 in 2016, or one for every 31,890 U.S. citizens). But the suggestion that the origins of the refugees are unchecked is totally false. America operates a nine-stage refugee screening process involving both UN and U.S. officials, including background checks for both medical and security purposes. MOSUL What Trump said: "We don't gain anything" in helping Iraq recapture the northern Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State militant group, Trump said Wednesday, citing potential negative consequences of liberating the city. Is it true? No. Mosul is Iraq's second-largest city, ISIS's largest capture to date and a hub for its extremist activities. The city has harbored ISIS leaders and ISIS hostages, including at least one British national. Depriving the group is this city will significantly damage not only its operational capabilities but its revenue streams. It is the last city that ISIS controls in Iraq and the removal of ISIS from Mosul will not only end its biggest claim to a territorial hold in Iraq but it will effectively cut its self-declared caliphate in half, eroding its message of building a state for all the world's Muslims. Liberating the city from ISIS can only be a positive step in the fight to defeat a group that has killed Muslims across the world, launched large-scale attacks in Europe and inspired lone-wolf attacks in the U.S. IRAN What Trump said: The firebrand Republican candidate said that Iran should write Washington "a letter saying thank you very much" because Tehran "is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them." Is it true? No. Iran has indeed sought to boost its influence in Iraq, working with Shiite Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and his coalition government after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and the deposition of Abadi's predecessor Nouri al-Maliki in 2014. And it has done so. But to say that Iran is taking over Iraq is a stretch. Tehran is supporting Shiite militias that have helped to defeat ISIS in key cities across the country but Baghdad remains a key U.S. ally and Washington's assistance in the recapture of Ramadi, Fallujah and, eventually Mosul, will surely boost U.S. influence in the country. Trump's suggestion that ISIS should not be defeated in Mosul because Iran might be "the big winner" is not only misguided, it is ludicrous. RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST What Trump said: Trump launched into an impassioned passage, criticizing Clinton for being outsmarted by Putin "every single step of the way," specifically in the Middle East. "All you have to do is look at the Middle East. They've taken over," he said. "She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever." Is it true? One could be forgiven for treating most of Trump's foreign policy comments with a pinch of salt, but there is an element of truth to his statements on Russian influence in the Middle East. Putin has bamboozled the U.S. on Syria. Washington has trodden every diplomatic avenue in a bid to resolve the Syrian conflict, bar military action against the Assad regime. But Russia has still come out on top. Assad remains in power and is now on the front foot after more than five years of conflict. Moscow seems unconcerned by the threat of Western sanctions, happy to continue its attempts to secure its assets abroad and boost its influence outside of its borders. Its involvement in Syria has opened up many alliances of necessity for Moscow and Putin has capitalized. Russia is now the most influential it has ever been in the Middle East since the height of the Cold War. Relations with Israel, a historic U.S. ally, have peaked. It is coordinating closely with Iran, working with the Syrian Kurds, it is friends again with U.S. NATO ally Turkey and Egypt's strongman president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is traveling to Moscow more than Washington. As the U.S. withdraws diplomatically from other arenas in the Middle East to focus on Syria, Russia has stepped in. Rather than "taking over," Russia is now rivalling Washington's influence in the region. But Trump's claim that this happened on Clinton's watch is debatable. She left the State Department in 2013, and this uptick in Russia's Middle East policy seemingly came after Putin decided to enter the Syrian conflict in September 2015.

News article:
At the third and final presidential debate Wednesday, claims from both candidates on issues outside of U.S. borders were once again flying around as they sought to land their verbal blows at their last face-to-face meeting before the vote on November 8. Below we look at the credibility of six key claims the candidates made about the world and U.S. foreign policy. Can the charges they made be supported by the facts on the ground? PUTIN What Hillary said: Trump would be Vladimir Putin's "puppet" as president Is it true? The idea that Putin wants Trump to win has been a key Clinton attack line for much of the campaign. There is something in it. Trump has in the past expressed admiration for Putin as a strong leader, and many commentators have noted how documents released by Wikileaks during the election cycle have disproportionately harmed Clinton. U.S. officials reportedly believe that at least some of the leaked material was stolen by Russian government hackers. But there is no proof of any direct link between Putin's government and either Trump or Wikileaks. So while it's probably valid to say that Putin is enjoying the kicking Trump has given the American establishment, the jury's out on whether Trump could be called a "puppet" or just a "more sympathetic ear." OPEN BORDERS What Trump said: "She wants open borders, OK?" Is it true? Trump was referring to a speech Clinton gave to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau in 2013, released this year by Wikileaks, in which she said: "My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders." Clinton responded at the debate that she was talking about energy policy, which isn't quite sufficient. But whatever her private ideology, anyone looking at her record on immigration and her current proposed policy won't find anything meeting the definition of "open borders." While she has supported a range of ideas making it easier for some undocumented immigrants to get a path to U.S. citizenship, she has also previously supported accompanying legislation that would toughen border security, and has said as a candidate she wants to deport some violent criminals. REFUGEES What Trump said: Obama's refugee policy involves allowing in "thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from." Is it true? It is true that Obama has welcomed "thousands and thousands" of refugees into America (about 10,000 in 2016, or one for every 31,890 U.S. citizens). But the suggestion that the origins of the refugees are unchecked is totally false. America operates a nine-stage refugee screening process involving both UN and U.S. officials, including background checks for both medical and security purposes. MOSUL What Trump said: "We don't gain anything" in helping Iraq recapture the northern Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State militant group, Trump said Wednesday, citing potential negative consequences of liberating the city. Is it true? No. Mosul is Iraq's second-largest city, ISIS's largest capture to date and a hub for its extremist activities. The city has harbored ISIS leaders and ISIS hostages, including at least one British national. Depriving the group is this city will significantly damage not only its operational capabilities but its revenue streams. It is the last city that ISIS controls in Iraq and the removal of ISIS from Mosul will not only end its biggest claim to a territorial hold in Iraq but it will effectively cut its self-declared caliphate in half, eroding its message of building a state for all the world's Muslims. Liberating the city from ISIS can only be a positive step in the fight to defeat a group that has killed Muslims across the world, launched large-scale attacks in Europe and inspired lone-wolf attacks in the U.S. IRAN What Trump said: The firebrand Republican candidate said that Iran should write Washington "a letter saying thank you very much" because Tehran "is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them." Is it true? No. Iran has indeed sought to boost its influence in Iraq, working with Shiite Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and his coalition government after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and the deposition of Abadi's predecessor Nouri al-Maliki in 2014. And it has done so. But to say that Iran is taking over Iraq is a stretch. Tehran is supporting Shiite militias that have helped to defeat ISIS in key cities across the country but Baghdad remains a key U.S. ally and Washington's assistance in the recapture of Ramadi, Fallujah and, eventually Mosul, will surely boost U.S. influence in the country. Trump's suggestion that ISIS should not be defeated in Mosul because Iran might be "the big winner" is not only misguided, it is ludicrous. RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST What Trump said: Trump launched into an impassioned passage, criticizing Clinton for being outsmarted by Putin "every single step of the way," specifically in the Middle East. "All you have to do is look at the Middle East. They've taken over," he said. "She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever." Is it true? One could be forgiven for treating most of Trump's foreign policy comments with a pinch of salt, but there is an element of truth to his statements on Russian influence in the Middle East.

News article:
Donald Trump wants to keep us in suspense. The Republican nominee’s refusal to say Wednesday evening during the final debate whether he would accept the results of the election is the stuff of breaking news and six-column headlines. “What I’m saying is that I will tell you at the time, I will keep you in suspense,” Trump said. Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, called his promise “horrifying.” It is unprecedented in U.S. presidential elections for a nominee to not pledge to respect the outcome. What did Trump mean by “suspense”? Who truly knows – his aides were quick to insist that he would indeed respect the results. But whether the next three weeks will be “Suspense! Horrifying! Bad!” in a decline of the republic kind of way or “Suspense! Horrifying! Fun!” in a found footage, “Paranormal Activity: Election Day” kind of way, we’re determined not to keep our readers in suspense about Wednesday night’s Jewish content. Iran, again Clinton has been reticent about making Iran a major issue throughout the campaign: It’s a hard straddle for her between her skepticism of the nuclear deal reached last year and honoring the legacy of President Barack Obama. (Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was a prominent backer of the deal, and in a rare tonal differentiation from Clinton, has emphasized the deal as a win.) Yet she was the first to mention Iran in the final debate on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus. It was one of several cudgels she used to depict Trump as beholden to Russia. Her most prominent gambit was in goading him to condemn Russia’s responsibility for the hacks into the private emails of her associates as unprecedented interference in the U.S. election. That led to this notable exchange: Trump: (Putin) has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I’ll tell you what: We’re in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads — 1,800, by the way — where they expanded and we didn’t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she’s playing chicken. Look, from everything I see, (Putin) has no respect for this person. Clinton: Well, that’s because he’d rather have a puppet as president of the United States. Trump: No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet! No, you’re the puppet! Clinton worked in her Iran reference when she circled back to Russia a few questions later, after moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel pressed the Democratic nominee on her plans to defeat the Islamic State, the terrorist group also known as ISIS that controls swathes of land in Syria and Iraq. “I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real — a really successful military operation,” she said, referring to the thrust underway against ISIS in Mosul, the group’s stronghold in Iraq. “But we know we’ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.” This was a subtle – probably too subtle – reference to Trump’s suggestion in the second debate that the United States may as well concede Syria to Russia and Iran, a prospect that horrifies Israel and the pro-Israel community. (It was Wallace, not Clinton, who later in the debate cornered Trump on his views on Syria, Russia and ISIS.) But Clinton’s reference to Iran, and to Mosul, gave Trump the opening for one of his most cogent and damaging arguments against the Obama administration’s foreign policy, and the opportunity to tie it to a prospective Clinton presidency. The assault on Mosul, Trump argued, may be successful, but ultimately it would be a gift to Iran, which he depicted as the prevailing power in Syria and Iraq. And that’s when he brought in the deal, reviled by Republicans as well as by Israel’s government, which exchanged sanctions relief for Iran to a partial rollback in its nuclear program. Trump: So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid — the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that’s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they’ve wanted to do forever, but we’ve made it so easy for them. So we’re now going to take Mosul. And do you know who’s going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Those Jewish names Trump has taken flak from Jewish commentators – most recently Rabbi Jonah Pesner, who heads Reform Judaism’s Religious Action Center – for invoking, in a sinister way, prominent Jewish figures. He was at it again Wednesday and it’s always hard what exactly to make of it. He also cites Jewish names (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his son-in-law Jared Kushner) in a positive way to reinforce his arguments, and the Jewish folks he derides, he has genuine beefs with. On the other hand, Trump seems to subtly emphasize the names – and that coupled with his invocations of grand secret conspiracies is guaranteed to make folks nervous. The first mention Wednesday went to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice who attacked Trump this summer as a “faker” and then apologized. He cited her as the kind of justice he would definitely not appoint. Trump: Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. It’s a legitimate reference, but also emblematic of Trump’s tendency to swerve into personal affronts when he should be dealing with issues. Ginsburg’s attack on him seemed to take precedence, in his mind, over how she and others would rule on abortion and on gun laws. The second Jewish name check was George Soros, the financier who backs an array of liberal causes. It came up when Clinton attacked Trump for not paying his fair share of taxes. Trump: So let me just tell you very quickly, we’re entitled [to tax breaks] because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors — just about all of them — I know [Warren] Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars … Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do. Refugees Refugees these days are seldom Jewish, but the issue remains a priority of an array of Jewish groups, particularly HIAS, the immigrant activist group. Faulting Obama (and by extension, Clinton) for the carnage in the Syrian city of Aleppo, Trump pivoted to the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States, something Clinton has said she wants to expand. Trump: She’s taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases — not probably, who are definitely in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see — this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job. The “Lots of luck” stirred a social media hornet’s nest – the “tens of thousands” of refugees will arrive only if Clinton is elected. Was Trump, behind in the polls, in a Freudian way, conceding? In any case, here’s how Clinton responded: Clinton: He’s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. Jewish immigration advocates, led by HIAS, back Clinton’s argument – refugees coming into the United States are vetted, they say, to a fault, with the process lasting up to two years. Most Jewish groups would also be aghast at Trump’s certainty that “in many cases” the refugees are “definitely ISIS-aligned.” For them it smacks of the nativists who in the 1920s and ’30s insisted that Jews fleeing Europe did not have American interests at heart. (On the other hand, hawkish groups believe Syrian immigrants “pose a grave danger to all Americans – and an even greater danger to American Jews,” as the Zionist Organization of America has put it.) Qatar and Saudi Arabia Dinging Clinton’s charitable foundation, Trump brought up donations by Middle Eastern autocrats. Trump: It’s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women’s rights? So these are people that push gays off business — off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. That’s a bizarre gambit for a developer who has extensive dealings with the same folks.

It’s a legitimate reference, but also emblematic of Trump’s tendency to swerve into personal affronts when he should be dealing with issues. Ginsburg’s attack on him seemed to take precedence, in his mind, over how she and others would rule on abortion and on gun laws. The second Jewish name check was George Soros, the financier who backs an array of liberal causes. It came up when Clinton attacked Trump for not paying his fair share of taxes. Trump: So let me just tell you very quickly, we’re entitled [to tax breaks] because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors — just about all of them — I know [Warren] Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars … Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do. Refugees Refugees these days are seldom Jewish, but the issue remains a priority of an array of Jewish groups, particularly HIAS, the immigrant activist group. Faulting Obama (and by extension, Clinton) for the carnage in the Syrian city of Aleppo, Trump pivoted to the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States, something Clinton has said she wants to expand. Trump: She’s taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases — not probably, who are definitely in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see — this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job. The “Lots of luck” stirred a social media hornet’s nest – the “tens of thousands” of refugees will arrive only if Clinton is elected. Was Trump, behind in the polls, in a Freudian way, conceding? In any case, here’s how Clinton responded: Clinton: He’s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. Jewish immigration advocates, led by HIAS, back Clinton’s argument – refugees coming into the United States are vetted, they say, to a fault, with the process lasting up to two years. Most Jewish groups would also be aghast at Trump’s certainty that “in many cases” the refugees are “definitely ISIS-aligned.” For them it smacks of the nativists who in the 1920s and ’30s insisted that Jews fleeing Europe did not have American interests at heart. (On the other hand, hawkish groups believe Syrian immigrants “pose a grave danger to all Americans – and an even greater danger to American Jews,” as the Zionist Organization of America has put it.) Qatar and Saudi Arabia Dinging Clinton’s charitable foundation, Trump brought up donations by Middle Eastern autocrats. Trump: It’s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women’s rights? So these are people that push gays off business — off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. That’s a bizarre gambit for a developer who has extensive dealings with the same folks.

News article:
Iran’s media say the country has received the first wave of proposals by major international companies to develop oil and gas projects within the new format of oil contracts recently approved by the administration of President Hassan Rouhani. Tasnim News Agency reported that 10 companies have so far submitted their proposals to Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum for the development of 15 projects. They, Tasnim said in its report, include big European names such as Total, Lukoil, Shell, Eni, OMV and Asian giants like CNPC, Sinopec and Pertamina. Several of the key projects that the companies have targeted are the same ones they had been previously involved in or for which they had been negotiating with Iran in the past. The most lucrative project up for the grabs may be South Azadegan for which Total has presented its proposal. South Azadegan was discovered in 2001 in what was described at the time as the world’s biggest oil find in decades. Next in line could be Yadavaran for which both Shell and Sinopec have presented their proposals. Total and Shell had been negotiating with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in early 2000s over the development of South Azadegan and Yadavaran but their talks did not lead to an agreement. Shell has also bid for the re-development of Soroush oil field – located in the Persian Gulf - which it had previously developed in early 2000s. Total, Eni and Hyundai have presented proposals for unspecified phases of South Pars gas field. Total was already involved in the development of South Pars Phases 2 and 3. Eni was involved in the development of Phases 4 and 5 and Hyundai in Phases 4, 5 and 6. Iran’s new format of oil contracts is replacing buyback deals. Under a buyback deal, the host government agrees to pay the contractor an agreed price for all volumes of hydrocarbons the contractor produces. But under the new contracts, the NIOC will set up joint ventures for crude oil and gas production with international companies which will be paid with a share of the output. Under the new contracts, different stages of exploration, development and production will be offered to contractors as an integrated package, with the emphasis laid on enhanced and improved recovery.

News article:
October 4, 2016 TEHRAN, Iran — On Sept. 10, Iran and Russia launched a project to add two new 1,000-megawatt (MW) reactors to the already existing 1,000-MW reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in the southwest of the country. The operating plant was connected to Iran’s national grid in September 2011, following a long series of delays and technical problems, and amid a dispute between Tehran and the West over Iran’s nuclear program. Iran, with a population of over 80 million, has the fourth-largest oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the world. But despite its rich hydrocarbon resources, the country is pursuing projects to construct more nuclear reactors as part of efforts to increase its reliance on renewable energy sources as it has an advantageous topography for renewables. Under such a policy, Iran has in the past years taken measures to increase power capacity via sources such as wind, solar and geothermal. Projects to produce 600 MW of electricity through wind and biomass and the construction of a 50-MW geothermal power plant in the northwest of the country are among these measures. According to official figures, Iran’s existing power generation capacity stands at 74,000 MW, of which nearly 200 MW is currently produced via renewable sources, mainly solar and wind. However, the renewable energy production capacity is predicted to reach 5,000 MW in the next five years, under Iran’s sixth Five-Year Development Plan that envisions the construction of new power plants with a total capacity of 26,000 MW. The sixth development plan also requires the government to focus on clean energy to protect the environment. Rik Teeuwen, the project manager of Solarplaza’s Renewable Energy Trade Mission Iran, told Al-Monitor that for Iran, which is among the nearly 200 countries committed to the 2015 Paris climate deal that calls for cutting emissions, renewable energy is a major tool to reduce impact on the environment as it reduces the use of fossil fuels and saves water. “If you can get wind energy and solar energy cheaper than old ways of generating, you save money and you can sell the fuels you don’t need to other countries at a premium,” Teeuwen, the manager of the Netherlands-based private firm, said. Teeuwen also believes that renewable energy helps Iran attract foreign capital, which benefits both its local industry and employment. With Iran already attracting foreign investment in renewable energy, he believes that the country “definitely is well underway” to become a regional electric hub that will significantly export electricity in the years to come. To help speed up renewable energy production and fulfill the set targets, the Iranian government has facilitated investment rules and offered incentives to encourage both local and foreign investors to cooperate on the renewables sector. Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian said in July that the purchase guarantee period will be increased from five years to 20 years to further support domestic production, while the guaranteed purchase price will be raised by 30% for companies that use local technology and equipment. Jafar Mohammadnejad Sigaroodi, a senior official at the Renewable Energy Organization of Iran (SUNA), which is the central institution in charge of renewable energy, has mentioned other incentives. “We have facilitated the permit issuance process that investors need to go through, including permits demanded by the Department of Environment. Moreover, based on the talks held between the ministries of Energy and Economy, foreign investment in the sector will be guaranteed. This is an important step as it is a cause of concern for many foreign investors,” Sigaroodi, the deputy chief for planning and development at SUNA, told Tehran Times in April. Government measures appear to have been successful enough to attract foreign investors whose presence, according to Iranian officials, has increased following the nuclear deal. European firms from Germany, Italy and Denmark as well as companies from Norway, China and South Korea have either reached agreements or expressed readiness to cooperate with Iran to boost its renewable energy production. Giles Dickson, the CEO of the European Wind Energy Association, who traveled to Iran in July, has also announced his organization’s readiness to encourage European investors to have a more active role in Iran’s renewable energy projects, particularly wind energy, as Iran enjoys high potentials in wind energy — even more so than Europe. To learn more about why Iran has focused on renewable energy in recent years, Al-Monitor spoke with Mohammad Reza Babaee, an economic strategy expert in Tehran who believes that the importance of sustainable development and the necessity of supplying energy needs for future generations make the use of renewable energy more than reasonable. “There’s a strategic need for oil and its refined derivatives in the future. At the same time, fossil fuels will definitely be used up, and renewable energy can gradually replace them to meet Iran’s growing household and industrial needs for energy,” Babaee said. Pointing to the fact that renewable energy can also help the country have more control over possible price fluctuations in fossil fuels, Babaee said, "Other than being a source of improved energy security, renewable energy provides Iran with export opportunities as well.” As Iran’s significant resources of solar, wind and geothermal energy along with its special geopolitical location has made the country one of the best areas for investment in renewable energy, experts like Babaee and Teeuwen believe that Iran could become an electric hub in the region to export the produced electricity, as its production could exceed local demand in coming years. Up until last year, when nuclear-related sanctions against the country were still in place, Iran’s plan for investment in renewable energy projects would have appeared highly ambitious and very difficult to achieve. But with the removal of major restrictions on foreign investment in Iran, in the eyes of many experts, the country’s investment goals of $10 billion by 2018 and $60 billion by 2025 now appear quite feasible. Experts say development of the industry involves various challenges, including aged or underdeveloped infrastructure or a lack of expertise in certain specialized renewable energy technologies. But many believe that the government’s strong commitment to diversifying its energy mix and modernizing its infrastructure along with local and foreign investors’ interest to invest in renewable projects leaves little doubt that Iran is moving in the right direction.

News article:
October 4, 2016 TEHRAN, Iran — On Sept. 10, Iran and Russia launched a project to add two new 1,000-megawatt (MW) reactors to the already existing 1,000-MW reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in the southwest of the country. The operating plant was connected to Iran’s national grid in September 2011, following a long series of delays and technical problems, and amid a dispute between Tehran and the West over Iran’s nuclear program. Iran, with a population of over 80 million, has the fourth-largest oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the world. But despite its rich hydrocarbon resources, the country is pursuing projects to construct more nuclear reactors as part of efforts to increase its reliance on renewable energy sources as it has an advantageous topography for renewables. Under such a policy, Iran has in the past years taken measures to increase power capacity via sources such as wind, solar and geothermal. Projects to produce 600 MW of electricity through wind and biomass and the construction of a 50-MW geothermal power plant in the northwest of the country are among these measures. According to official figures, Iran’s existing power generation capacity stands at 74,000 MW, of which nearly 200 MW is currently produced via renewable sources, mainly solar and wind. However, the renewable energy production capacity is predicted to reach 5,000 MW in the next five years, under Iran’s sixth Five-Year Development Plan that envisions the construction of new power plants with a total capacity of 26,000 MW. The sixth development plan also requires the government to focus on clean energy to protect the environment. Rik Teeuwen, the project manager of Solarplaza’s Renewable Energy Trade Mission Iran, told Al-Monitor that for Iran, which is among the nearly 200 countries committed to the 2015 Paris climate deal that calls for cutting emissions, renewable energy is a major tool to reduce impact on the environment as it reduces the use of fossil fuels and saves water. “If you can get wind energy and solar energy cheaper than old ways of generating, you save money and you can sell the fuels you don’t need to other countries at a premium,” Teeuwen, the manager of the Netherlands-based private firm, said. Teeuwen also believes that renewable energy helps Iran attract foreign capital, which benefits both its local industry and employment. With Iran already attracting foreign investment in renewable energy, he believes that the country “definitely is well underway” to become a regional electric hub that will significantly export electricity in the years to come. To help speed up renewable energy production and fulfill the set targets, the Iranian government has facilitated investment rules and offered incentives to encourage both local and foreign investors to cooperate on the renewables sector. Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian said in July that the purchase guarantee period will be increased from five years to 20 years to further support domestic production, while the guaranteed purchase price will be raised by 30% for companies that use local technology and equipment. Jafar Mohammadnejad Sigaroodi, a senior official at the Renewable Energy Organization of Iran (SUNA), which is the central institution in charge of renewable energy, has mentioned other incentives. “We have facilitated the permit issuance process that investors need to go through, including permits demanded by the Department of Environment. Moreover, based on the talks held between the ministries of Energy and Economy, foreign investment in the sector will be guaranteed. This is an important step as it is a cause of concern for many foreign investors,” Sigaroodi, the deputy chief for planning and development at SUNA, told Tehran Times in April. Government measures appear to have been successful enough to attract foreign investors whose presence, according to Iranian officials, has increased following the nuclear deal. European firms from Germany, Italy and Denmark as well as companies from Norway, China and South Korea have either reached agreements or expressed readiness to cooperate with Iran to boost its renewable energy production. Giles Dickson, the CEO of the European Wind Energy Association, who traveled to Iran in July, has also announced his organization’s readiness to encourage European investors to have a more active role in Iran’s renewable energy projects, particularly wind energy, as Iran enjoys high potentials in wind energy — even more so than Europe. To learn more about why Iran has focused on renewable energy in recent years, Al-Monitor spoke with Mohammad Reza Babaee, an economic strategy expert in Tehran who believes that the importance of sustainable development and the necessity of supplying energy needs for future generations make the use of renewable energy more than reasonable. “There’s a strategic need for oil and its refined derivatives in the future. At the same time, fossil fuels will definitely be used up, and renewable energy can gradually replace them to meet Iran’s growing household and industrial needs for energy,” Babaee said. Pointing to the fact that renewable energy can also help the country have more control over possible price fluctuations in fossil fuels, Babaee said, "Other than being a source of improved energy security, renewable energy provides Iran with export opportunities as well.” As Iran’s significant resources of solar, wind and geothermal energy along with its special geopolitical location has made the country one of the best areas for investment in renewable energy, experts like Babaee and Teeuwen believe that Iran could become an electric hub in the region to export the produced electricity, as its production could exceed local demand in coming years. Up until last year, when nuclear-related sanctions against the country were still in place, Iran’s plan for investment in renewable energy projects would have appeared highly ambitious and very difficult to achieve. But with the removal of major restrictions on foreign investment in Iran, in the eyes of many experts, the country’s investment goals of $10 billion by 2018 and $60 billion by 2025 now appear quite feasible. Experts say development of the industry involves various challenges, including aged or underdeveloped infrastructure or a lack of expertise in certain specialized renewable energy technologies. But many believe that the government’s strong commitment to diversifying its energy mix and modernizing its infrastructure along with local and foreign investors’ interest to invest in renewable projects leaves little doubt that Iran is moving in the right direction.

News article:
BP, Hungary buy first post-sanctions Iran oil British oil company BP has clinched its first oil deal with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) since last year’s landmark nuclear accord for purchase of condensate, a NIOC official says. Under the deal, BP will receive South Pars condensate for loading between September and October, the unnamed official was quoted as saying on Wednesday. Director of NIOC’s international affairs Mohsen Qamsari said on Monday that BP would get a cargo of one million barrels of Iranian condensate, based on a spot contract. He said another firm had also purchased condensate but did not identify it, only saying Iran was negotiating to sell crude to British companies. BP has a long history of operation in Iran. The company started life as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1908 before parting ways with Iran and becoming British Petroleum. NIOC and BP equally own the Rhum gas field in the North Sea, which was shut down for four years due to Western sanctions. Condensate is a type of light crude oil produced in association with natural gas. Iran’s total crude oil and condensate sales likely reached around 2.8 million barrels per day in September, nearly matching a 2011 peak in shipments before sanctions were imposed, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Iran sold 600,000 bpd of condensate for September, including about 100,000 bpd shipped from storage, to meet robust demand in Asia, the news agency said. The sale to BP marks another milestone in NIOC’s efforts to win back its former customers around the world, including those in Europe, after the lifting of sanctions. France’s Total was the first European oil major to resume purchases of Iranian oil in February this year while Royal Dutch Shell shipped a cargo of Iranian crude to Europe in July. Hungary’s MOL said on Tuesday it has commissioned a cargo of 140,000 tonnes of Iranian heavy crude oil on Oct. 23 for the first time since the lifting of sanctions. “Since sanctions against Iran are lifted, Iranian crude has become part of these alternative crude grades MOL is actively considering for use in its refineries,” an MOL spokeswoman was quoted as saying by Reuters. The cargo will be delivered from Iran’s Kharg Island terminal to Croatian port of Omisalj, the report said. The world’s second largest private oil trader, Trafigura, has also been in talks to supply Iran’s heavy crude grade to independent processors in China for the first time. Trafigura loaded 2 million barrels of Iranian heavy crude for the first time in June. Independent processors, known as teapots, typically buy shipments at short notice and in small quantities. The arrangement is expected to further boost Iran’s resurgent rise in the oil market. The country has surprised the market by ramping up its oil output faster than expected, to 3.63 million bpd in August, according to OPEC. Iran aims to increase exports to 2.35 million barrels a day in coming months from about 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd), Qamsari said on Sunday. The Shana news agency quoted NIOC Managing Director Ali Kardor as saying that Iran’s crude oil production capacity must reach 5.2 to 5.7 million bpd in the future. By Press TV

Belarus, Iran in talks on oil supplies – President Belarusian President said that Belarus is in talks with Iran on supplies of oil. MINSK (Sputnik) —Belarus is in talks with Iran on supplies of oil, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday. “We have been in talks with Iran which is desperately trying to find an oil market and is ready to lower prices,” Lukashenko told Belarusian lawmakers. He added that the country’s refineries should not face shortage of oil deliveries and should receive crude oil to the full extent. Belarus faces decline in oil deliveries from Russia. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that the decrease in deliveries was linked to Minsk’s gas debt and shortfall of petrochemicals’ deliveries to Russia. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said that the level of deliveries could be restored if Moscow and Minsk reached an agreement on the gas debt. Moscow and Minsk have been locked in talks over the price of Russian gas supplied to Belarusian consumers. In July, Novak said that Belarus owed $270 million in unpaid gas bills to Russia. Minsk has been refusing to recognize the debt, saying that the price of $132.77 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas demanded by Moscow is unfair. Russia has stressed that payments must be made in line with the contract. At the same time, the Belarusian leader said that oil and gas issues should not be mixed. By Sputnik

Shahdaie made the remarks on the sidelines of a ceremony where NPC and Japan’s Sojitz signed a memorandum of understating for studies on construction of a methanol to propylene plant (MTP) in Iran. Shahadie said, “One of the priorities of our petrochemical industry is using natural gas as feedstock. Alongside, the MTP project will be commissioned in cooperation with a Japanese company.” She said the NPC is to implement the MTP project using foreign investment. “Of course, the NPC Research and Technology Company has attained such a knowledge.” She said following improvement of Iran’s relations with the international companies, Sojitz announced its readiness for investment in the MTP and GTPP projects and the MoU signed by the two parties will soon be implemented.” “Since there are abundant gas sources in Iran, implementation of the MTP project is big in its kind as it and its commissioning are one of the main policies of the Ministry of Petroleum.” If the project is economically and technically justified for foreign investor, including Sojitz, and addresses its needs, it will be implemented in Assalouyeh, she added. Shahdaie said the NPC is in talks with German companies as well. “Many German companies seek cooperation with and investment in the Iranian petrochemical industry, hoping that once banking problems and barriers of the two sides are eliminated, the German companies’ investment will increase.” By SHANA

Iran says it is discussing a long-term deal to sell crude oil to Poland – what could widen the list of the country’s European oil clients once finalized. Mohsen Qamsari, the director for international affairs of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), told Iranian media that talks with Poland’s Grupa Lotos to the same effect have just started but a final deal between the two sides is yet to be worked out. Qamsari added that Grupa Lotos – which is Poland’s largest oil refining company – has already purchased a consignment comprising one million barrels of oil from Iran. He emphasized that East European countries are currently the focus of NIOC’s post-sanctions marketing activities. Apart from Poland, Qamsari further said, Iran has also sold a consignment comprising one million barrels of oil to Hungary. “Talks are already underway with several East European countries over purchases of Iran’s crude oil,” the official added. Grupa Lotos announced in September that it had purchased two consignments of oil from Iran. “After the Iranian oil is refined, we will have detailed results of the analysis, which will confirm whether we will ultimately sign a long-term agreement with Iran on oil supplies to Gdansk,” Marcin Jastrzebski, Grupa Lotos deputy head, told reporters, as reported by Reuters. Qamsari said in August that the NIOC is working on a plan to move from spot oil sales contracts to long-term ones with the Europeans. He emphasized that long-term agreements secure stable sales of oil thus better protecting the interests of the country in terms of national revenues.

Leading with Lukoil: Russia’s economic diplomacy in Iran The approval of the Iranian Petroleum Contract is the culmination of a summer of economic diplomacy between Moscow and Tehran. A long summer On September 17th, Iran’s parliament endorsed a new Petroleum Contract put forward by the energy ministry and the cabinet. The coming weeks will reveal which oil majors are willing to risk investment in ventures with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). Vagit Alekperov, CEO of Russian oil major Lukoil, has expressed serious determination since the signing of the nuclear deal to return to the Anaran oil field — frozen by economic sanctions — and develop other fields. Two days after the contract was endorsed, Alekperov flew to Tehran to meet with Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh who announced to the press that Lukoil was the first foreign oil firm to sign a memorandum of understanding. The symbolism of the announcement comes after a long summer of economic diplomacy between Moscow and Tehran. A wake up call Trade between Russia and Iran bottomed out last year at $1.24 billion. Iran signaled at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum in June that economic ties fall far short of the strength of political ties. June and July saw lots of chatter and signaling, An agreement was reached for direct flights from the Caspian port of Astrakhan to Tehran around the same time. A commercial attaché was sent to Moscow to facilitate business relations and Russia extended two loans worth about $2.5 billion to fund Russian exports, but a promised $5 billion loan has not materialized. Iranian Minister of Communications and Information Technology Mahmoud Vaezi met with Energy Minister Alexander Novak in late July to reiterate the need for expanding economic cooperation and smaller business forums continued as usual. These are all well and good but energy is where the money lies. A meeting in Baku Putin capitalized on Azerbaijan’s increasing dissonance with the West at a trilateral conference in Baku early this August between Russia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to strengthen economic ties. The collapse in oil prices and decline in international energy investment has made cooperation in energy projects economically and politically attractive for all three. Energy cooperation — pipelines, joint ventures, and oil swaps — dovetails with the proposed North-South Transport Corridor (NSTC), meant to open up trade possibilities through the Indian Ocean. Oil and gas projects fund all three governments who are the largest investors in infrastructure in their respective economies. Lukoil is ready to open the gates for other Russian firms and incentivize further work on the NSTC, strengthening the potential for trade in other sectors. Alekperov’s advantages Lukoil has an unquantifiable advantage over competing Russian producers in the form of its CEO, Vagit Alekperov. Alekperov is Azeri and speaks Azeri. Nearly one-fifth of Iran is ethnically Azeri, the current Supreme Leader Khamenei is ethnically Azeri, and Azeris make up a large part of the business community in Tehran. The incalculable benefits of ethnic and linguistic ties to business counterparts have catapulted Lukoil into the position of being a bridge of sorts for other Russian firms. Events since the summit in Baku bear this out. A day after the Baku summit, Iranian Minister Vaezi said that there were good opportunities for Lukoil to sign deals with Iranian firms. Three days later, Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan was quoted saying that Lukoil planned to develop two fields in the southwestern province of Khuzestan. When Alekperov came to Tehran on September 19th, he also met with NIOC’s managing director Ali Kardor and announced that appraisal studies for the Ab Teymour and Mansouri oil fields would be finished soon. After a year of negotiating, cajoling, and jumping at every chance to open up new projects, Lukoil is leading Russia’s economic diplomacy in Iran. The firm is looking for better returns on investment as it competes for greater market share and influence in Russia. Iran is the most promising low-cost market it has available. If Lukoil builds it, will others come? The notable absence of Rosneft in Iran is telling, Gazprom is pursuing memoranda of understanding with the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) but is cash-strapped, burdened by the combined costs and complications of projects in the Far East and Europe, and has not seemed to get anywhere in the run up to the endorsement of the Petroleum Contract. However, the Krasnye Barrikady Shipyard concluded a $1 billion deal to build 5 offshore rigs for an Iranian firm. Gazprom is one of Krasnye Barrikady’s main clients and other firms selling equipment are finding openings. This second tier of Russian firms tied to the energy sector is key to prospective Russian-Iranian trade ties. Iran’s energy and transport infrastructure is underdeveloped and of poor quality. Russia’s struggling construction sector is in the hunt for project-hungry markets willing to provide financing. Russia and Iran signed a memorandum of understanding to expand banking ties in early September and there are reports that they would like to create a joint bank. Assuming these have impact, Lukoil’s entrance into the oil sector will cement business and financial ties that smaller firms providing relevant services will exploit. There remain serious limits to the countries’ mutual trade. Russia’s agricultural sector is driving exports, predominantly wheat. Iran has steadily reduced its wheat imports in recent years. Without government spending, Russia’s infrastructure is inadequate to export competitive quantities of foodstuffs or other goods as other exporters use Iran’s well-developed Persian Gulf ports. There will be a considerable wait-and-see period as companies the world over gauge the risk-level of Iran’s business climate. But Lukoil’s push into the Iranian market is cause to believe that Russian-Iranian economic relations may be set to change. Russian oil and construction firms have to get creative to cope with sanctions and the recession. Iran is a golden opportunity that the Kremlin is trying to seize. By Global Risk Insights

News article:
State-run energy giant Pertamina officially received a cargo of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from Iran on Oct.13, marking Iran’s first shipment as a new supplier of LPG to Indonesia, The Jakarta Post reported. Pertamina president director Dwi Soetjipto welcomed the 44,000 metric tons of LPG transported from Asaluyeh Port in Iran 13 days ago by its VLGC Pertamina Gas 2 vessel, at Kalbut Port in Situbondo, East Java. According to him, the LPG shipment from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) would open up other business development opportunities between Pertamina and the NIOC, in both the upstream and downstream sectors. "It marks a new chapter of cooperation between Pertamina and the NIOC and makes trade cooperation between Indonesia and Iran more significant," Dwi said in a statement on Thursday. Earlier, the NIOC agreed to supply Pertamina with a total volume of 600,000 tons of LPG for 2016 and 2017. Following the arrival of the first cargo, the NIOC will immediately send the next cargo, which is expected to arrive on Nov. 20. In addition to the LPG purchase , the two state-run companies signed an agreement to conduct a preliminary study of two giant oil fields in Iran, namely Ab-Teymour and Mansouri, which have an oil reserve of more than 5 billion barrels.

State-run energy giant Pertamina officially received a cargo of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from Iran on Oct.13, marking Iran’s first shipment as a new supplier of LPG to Indonesia, The Jakarta Post reported. Pertamina president director Dwi Soetjipto welcomed the 44,000 metric tons of LPG transported from Asaluyeh Port in Iran 13 days ago by its VLGC Pertamina Gas 2 vessel, at Kalbut Port in Situbondo, East Java. According to him, the LPG shipment from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) would open up other business development opportunities between Pertamina and the NIOC, in both the upstream and downstream sectors. "It marks a new chapter of cooperation between Pertamina and the NIOC and makes trade cooperation between Indonesia and Iran more significant," Dwi said in a statement on Thursday. Earlier, the NIOC agreed to supply Pertamina with a total volume of 600,000 tons of LPG for 2016 and 2017. Following the arrival of the first cargo, the NIOC will immediately send the next cargo, which is expected to arrive on Nov. 20. In addition to the LPG purchase , the two state-run companies signed an agreement to conduct a preliminary study of two giant oil fields in Iran, namely Ab-Teymour and Mansouri, which have an oil reserve of more than 5 billion barrels.

Iran to import 500MW electricity from Russia TEHRAN, Oct. 14 (MNA) – The completion of two new projects provides the needed infrastructure for Iran-Russia electricity exchange, according to Iranian officials. After a contract was signed in last winter between Iranian and Azeri sides, power transmission networks of the two countries were officially connected in the summer. According to the agreement, the grid operators of the two countries, TAVANIR of Iran and Azeri Energy of Azerbaijan, have the pilot phase capacity of 90 megawatt transfer of electricity. Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Houshang Falahatian had told the media in August that to make the connection a 51 kilometer line of 230 kilovolt transmission was constructed for connecting the grids. He also recounted that one of the objectives behind the project was to ease the way for power connection between Iran and Russia. Energy Minister of Russia Alexander Valentinovich Novak and Iranian Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian had agreed three years ago in Tehran to pave the way for transmission of 500 MW electricity and they signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the cause. Now with the competition of the two recently opened projects, a post of 220 kilovolt and 330 kilovolt in Parsabad of Moghan, the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to import 500 MW power annually from Russia.

News article:
Iran has invited international companies to begin bidding for the country’s vast oil and gas fields for the first time since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal was implemented in January of this year. Foreign companies will be able to bid for exploration and production of Iran’s oil and gas starting today, according to the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). The NIOC has said that it will be giving priority to neighboring countries that share border fields, which include 28 joint offshore and onshore gas and oil reserves. Since bidding began, Iran has already signed several agreements. The first company to sign is the domestic Iranian organization Persia Oil & Gas Industry Development Co. The US Treasury claims that this company is a subsidiary of Setad Ejraiye Farman-e Emam, or Setad – an organization with strong ties to the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Setad is known for its shadowy dealings within the Islamic Republic. The company provides Ayatollah Khamenei with immense economic strength as it holds significant real estate and corporate investments. One of the leaders of Setad has been wanted by the United States since 2013 on arms smuggling charges. Iran has also signed agreements with two British companies, including British Petroleum (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell. French Company Total SA has also resumed oil trade with Iran – in 2010 it was forced to stop all oil exploration and production in the country as a result of international sanctions placed on Iran. International sanctions on Iran were lifted in January under the JCPOA deal, allowing for Iran to expand trade with the international community. The country was slapped with sanctions by the United Nations Security Council and the EU as a result of intelligence that suggested Iran’s nuclear program – which it claimed was for peaceful use – was instead being used for clandestine weapons development. The international community signed an agreement with Iran that prevented the country from producing nuclear weapons in exchange for the dropping of sanctions. Iran’s oil production exceeds 3.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, compared to approximately 10 million barrels per day produced by Saudi Arabia in 2015. The country hopes to bring more than $150 billion in foreign investment by 2020. DL

News article:
TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran will launch next month its first new style tender to develop oil and gas fields since the lifting of international sanctions, a leading oil official said on Monday, after months of internal discussions over the terms, intended to be more alluring to foreign companies. OPEC’s third largest oil producer hopes to revive its energy sector following the lifting of the sanctions in January after years of under investment and to achieve production levels last seen in 2012. Other U.S. sanctions that remain in place, particularly on the banking sector, have dampened hopes for a rapid resumption of investment. Iran expects to tender new oil and gas contracts, knows as IPCs, in November, Ali Kardor, the managing director of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) said on the sidelines of an oil conference in Tehran. Oil companies will be able to bid for a contract to develop the South Azadegan oil field as early as November 19, and NIOC will award the contract by early 2017, he said. After South Azadegan, NIOC will start tendering one field month by month, Kardor said. There are total 11 oil and gas fields‎ available for tendering, he said. The launch of the Iran’s new oil and gas contracts was postponed several times as hard line rivals of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani resisted any deal that could end the so-called buy-back system, under which foreign firms were banned from owning stakes in Iranian companies. NIOC signed the first oil output contract under IPC earlier this month with a company identified by the United States as part of a conglomerate controlled by Iran’s supreme leader. NIOC began taking applications on Monday for its upstream oil and gas projects as Iran hopes to sign exploration and production contracts early next year. The oil companies will upload on to NIOC’s website the pre-qualification documents. NIOC will then evaluate the companies within two weeks and will select some for the first tender in November. Some analysts said Iran’s IPCs do not seem to be attractive enough to raise billions of dollars in foreign direct investment at a time of low oil prices, especially when compared with neighboring Iraq’s new oil contracts that enabled it to boost its output. However Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said on Monday that Iran’s security and business climate is better than other neighboring countries. “Some countries are run by tribes, Iran is different than that,” Jahangiri told the petroleum conference, addressing representatives of oil majors such as Total and BP. “Even if Iran’s contracts are not as attractive as others signed in neighboring countries, Iran has its own advantages.”

News article:
TEHRAN, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's oil minister said here Sunday that the country's oil industry needs an investment of 200 billion U.S. dollars in the next five years, semi-official Fars news agency reported. "In the sixth Five-Year Economic Development Plan (2016-2021), the oil industry will need 200 billion U.S. dollars investment, of which 130 billion dollars would go to the upstream sector," Bijan Namdar Zangeneh told an energy seminar in Tehran. The minister said investment in oil industry should be taken seriously as it is linked with the national economy. Development of Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC) is the key strategy, which Tehran is still working on, to attract investment and upgrade the country's oil industry. Iran's IPC, if implemented, would help the country attract finance from Asian and European investors. The new contracts are replacing traditional Iranian "buy-back" contracts which are no longer attractive to foreign companies. Under the contracts, the National Iranian Oil Company will set up joint ventures for crude oil production with international companies which will be paid with a share of the output. Iran and the world powers reached a nuclear deal last July, which was implemented in January and is expected to enable the country to re-engage with energy firms of the world to develop its oil and gas fields.

Moscow and Tehran are in talks over a potential exclusive presentation of Iran’s oil and gas contracts to Russian companies, Russia’s Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov said, TASS reported. Molodtsov added that the sides have reached this agreement and currently the place and date are being discussed. “We expect the agreements reached by heads of two ministries – of energy [of the Russian Federation] and Iran’s Petroleum Ministry – about a potential exclusive presentation of the current conditions and contracts, under which the Islamic Republic of Iran is planning to attract foreign companies and foreign investments in the projects on its soil, to be presented to Russian companies,” he said. “Respective notes and respective documents have been sent and we are expecting a response from the Iranian side about the date and location,” Molodtsov added. Amir Hossein Zamaninia, Iranian deputy oil minister, has, in turn, said that Lukoil, Gazprom, Rosneft, Gazprom Neft, Zarubezhneft and Tatneft have made preliminary agreements with Iranian companies. Iran intends to sign first contracts with Russian oil producers by the end of 2016, Zamaninia said earlier.

News article:
Tension along the Israel-Egyptian border grew considerably today following reports that Egyptian army units have entered the Gaza Strip which has hitherto been guarded by United Nations Emergency Force units and locally recruited police. The reports said that the Egyptian military units are virtually isolating the posts of the UN forces. The deployment represented the first time that substantial Egyptian forces have been in the area since UNEF contingents began to patrol the Gaza-Israel border after the 1956 seizure by Israel of the strip and subsequent withdrawal by Israel forces. It was also reported that for the past several days, substantial movements of Russian-equipped Egyptian troops have been observed from the Israel side in many sections of the Egyptian-Israel border areas. There were unconfirmed reports that two Egyptian divisions have been deployed in the Gaza Strip border area. Other Egyptian units were reported to have been stationed in Abou Ageila and Juscima, sites of sharp battles during the 1956 Sinai campaign. The United Arab Republic also was reported to be concentrating forces on the northern front. Only national guard units and gendarmes were reported to have participated in the huge parade in Damascus earlier this week where UAR President Nasser received a salute on the second anniversary of the Egyptian-Syrian merger. The Army remained deployed on the Israel border. GOLDA MEIR TELLS FOREIGN AMBASSADORS OF ISRAEL’S ‘GRAVE VIEW’ Mrs, Golda Meir, Israel’s Foreign Minister, conferred today with ambassadors of several countries and told them that Israel took a "grave view" of the reported United Arab Republic troop concentrations on the Gaza Strip-Israel border. Israel military sources indicated the Army was keeping a close watch all along the border. However, while the military authorities were taking necessary precautions, the atmosphere in Israel toward the UAR military activities was one more of curiosity than tension. Opinion was widespread in Israel that Nasser would not dare to unleash a major attack on the borders and that Israel would not currently initiate new retaliatory action. (U. N. sources in New York said this morning they had received no information on UAR troop movements in the Gaza Strip and Sinai and were awaiting an Israeli letter. An indication that Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold did not take an overly serious view of the latest reported developments was that he left this afternoon on a trip to Stockholm.) Observers here, speculating on Nasser’s reasons, noted that tension had been built up in recent weeks by Nasser’s absolute refusal to allow passage through the Suez Canal of Israel cargoes and Nasser’s statement Monday that the Tripartite Declaration of 1950, committing the United States, Britain and France to oppose violent changes of Israel-Arab borders, was dead. Another theory was that the troop concentrations were intended to demonstrate the seriousness of Nasser’s warning that Israel implementation of plans to divert some of the Jordan River waters for Negev irrigation would mean war. Still another was that the troop concentrations were Nasser’s answer to a statement by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion that he did not think Nasser would attack.

It was also reported that for the past several days, substantial movements of Russian-equipped Egyptian troops have been observed from the Israel side in many sections of the Egyptian-Israel border areas. There were unconfirmed reports that two Egyptian divisions have been deployed in the Gaza Strip border area. Other Egyptian units were reported to have been stationed in Abou Ageila and Juscima, sites of sharp battles during the 1956 Sinai campaign. The United Arab Republic also was reported to be concentrating forces on the northern front. Only national guard units and gendarmes were reported to have participated in the huge parade in Damascus earlier this week where UAR President Nasser received a salute on the second anniversary of the Egyptian-Syrian merger. The Army remained deployed on the Israel border. GOLDA MEIR TELLS FOREIGN AMBASSADORS OF ISRAEL’S ‘GRAVE VIEW’ Mrs, Golda Meir, Israel’s Foreign Minister, conferred today with ambassadors of several countries and told them that Israel took a "grave view" of the reported United Arab Republic troop concentrations on the Gaza Strip-Israel border. Israel military sources indicated the Army was keeping a close watch all along the border. However, while the military authorities were taking necessary precautions, the atmosphere in Israel toward the UAR military activities was one more of curiosity than tension. Opinion was widespread in Israel that Nasser would not dare to unleash a major attack on the borders and that Israel would not currently initiate new retaliatory action. (U. N. sources in New York said this morning they had received no information on UAR troop movements in the Gaza Strip and Sinai and were awaiting an Israeli letter. An indication that Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold did not take an overly serious view of the latest reported developments was that he left this afternoon on a trip to Stockholm.) Observers here, speculating on Nasser’s reasons, noted that tension had been built up in recent weeks by Nasser’s absolute refusal to allow passage through the Suez Canal of Israel cargoes and Nasser’s statement Monday that the Tripartite Declaration of 1950, committing the United States, Britain and France to oppose violent changes of Israel-Arab borders, was dead. Another theory was that the troop concentrations were intended to demonstrate the seriousness of Nasser’s warning that Israel implementation of plans to divert some of the Jordan River waters for Negev irrigation would mean war. Still another was that the troop concentrations were Nasser’s answer to a statement by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion that he did not think Nasser would attack.

News article:
When Israeli soldiers entered the Palestinian Dheisheh refugee camp within the Bethlehem district, they committed a violation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreements often referred to as the Oslo Accords. The accords, which were scheduled to expire before the end of the 20th century, are still with us a decade and a half into the 21st. But the Israeli bullets that ripped the body of Jihad Al Jaafari on Tuesday might very well have killed not only the 19-year-old Palestinian but also the Palestinian security coordination with Israel. The Oslo Accords divided the occupied territories (minus East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed) into three distinct areas. Israel has total security access to and control of Areas B and C. The difference is only that in Area B, Palestinians are allowed administrative control, i.e., to pick up garbage and so on. Area A, which was supposed to gradually grow to cover the entire occupied territories, is under both administrative and security control of the Palestinians. Israel is not allowed to enter Area A and anything or anyone they want from Area A they can only have by coordinating with the Palestinian security forces.The Dheisheh refugee camp is squarely within Area A, under total Palestinian security control. Advertisement So when the Dheisheh resident Jaafari was killed there, the Israelis not only violated Palestinian security areas but also put to shame the only remaining mechanism of positive engagement with Palestinians, security coordination. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been under strong pressure to end security coordination. The issue will no doubt be debated in the upcoming session of the 124-member Palestine Central Council. The PCC is usually called to discuss and ultimately approve strategic decisions involving the future of the Palestinian national struggle.A meeting is scheduled to be held on March 4 and 5 at the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian presidency.In discussing security coordination, Palestinians may cut the final strand of the cord that connects them with Israel and its occupation apparatus. Naturally, such a decision will have huge consequences on the Palestinian daily lives. Israel has already caused serious damage to the Palestinian population by not transferring, for the third month in a row, the tax revenues collected on behalf of the Palestinian government by Israel. The tax agreement is one other element of the Israeli-Palestinian memorandum of understanding.Top Palestinian security official Majed Farraj, who heads the intelligence directorate, who is rumoured to be appointed as vice president, comes from the Dheisheh camp. He will certainly be asked to explain why the security coordination should continue while fellow camp residents are being killed by Israeli soldiers who do not respect this coordination. Advertisement Without security coordination and without the tax revenues, plus the risk of losing millions of dollars due to legal compensations decided on it by a U.S. court, the Palestinian government, technically called the Palestinian Authority, will have worked itself out of existence. Israel, as an occupying power, will have to take responsibility for the occupied territories and the population it inherited when its troops ran over the West Bank and Gaza Strip.The Fourth Geneva Convention, which was established followed the prolonged (at the time) German occupation of France, regulates the responsibilities of an occupying power.Israeli courts refuse to accept that Palestinian areas Israeli troops control are occupied territories. It argues that they are disputed territories and as a result, they refused to dissolve the civil administration created by the Israeli army following the 1967 occupation. The civil administration has continued to work in Area C, mostly in sync with the demand of the settlers and with the aim of stunting any Palestinian development and growth. Area C, which covers nearly 65 percent of the occupied territories, includes all areas outside populated cities, as well as the entire Jordan Valley, with the exception of Jericho. The Israeli soldier who pulled the trigger in Dheisheh Wednesday may have killed a two-decade-old security and political arrangement that has mostly benefited the Israelis and their settlement scheme.

News article:
The leader of Hamas' military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, made a rare appearance Sunday evening in Gaza – the first in years – and said the group is preparing for a new conflict with Israel. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Marwan Issa, who replaced Ahmed Jabari as the group's military leader after he was killed in a targeted Israeli attack in 2012, said that Hamas "is continuing to produce rockets, but is not currently striving for a conflict with Israel, but (preparing) for a future" one. Marwan Issa (Archive) Issa, who has served as top commander for Hamas' military wing in the past three years, made the rare appearance as part of a conference organized by a think tank linked to Hamas' security apparatus. Unlike his predecessor, Issa has kept a low profile and has rarely been photographed, as was the case in the current conference. Issa addressed a recent ruling by an Egyptian court, that blacklisted the military wing and then Hamas itself as a terror group. "Any regional or international attempt to blockade Hamas or its military wing will fail. The military wing has the ambition, the ability and the faith needed to reach our end goals," Issa said. He also addressed the group's ongoing struggle with Israel and sent it a message: "We are not currently striving for a conflict, but we are continuing to act so that we will be strong in a any future conflict," he said. "We are continuing to produce rockets and Israel's statements in this regard are pointless as far as we are concerned," his comments came amid ongoing attempts by Hamas to train by firing rockets into the sea, an almost daily occurrence He also said that Hamas is working to forge regional alliances that will allow it to procure additional arms, though he said the terror group would not sell itself out to any one player. "We are working to increase cooperation with all resistance factions," Issa explained, failing to deliver the names of those potential partners, though it is safe to assume its main target is Iran and Hezbollah, who have long supported them, though the relations fell out after Hamas refused to continue to support Iran's ally Bashar Assad in Syria. Growing isolation Gaza residents said Sunday they fear growing isolation and more hardships after an Egyptian court declared the territory's ruling Hamas a terrorist organization. Some blamed the Islamic militant Hamas while others said Egypt is being unreasonable. Hamas called for protests against the Egyptian government and issued angry statements, but did not offer a way out of the crisis. Salah Bardaweel, a Hamas spokesman, alleged Sunday that Egypt has become a "direct agent" of Israeli interests. Saturday's court ruling signaled Egypt's growing hostility toward Hamas, an offshoot of the region-wide Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt has blamed Hamas for violence in the country's restive Sinai Peninsula, a charge Hamas denies. Hamas seized Gaza by force in 2007, and the territory's borders have been largely sealed by Israel and Egypt since then. Egypt intensified the blockade after its military toppled a Hamas-friendly government in Cairo in 2013. In recent months, Egyptian soldiers have destroyed virtually all smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border. In October, they began razing parts of the Egyptian town of Rafah on the border with Gaza. Residents near the border said homes are still being dynamited or bulldozed at a steady pace, with the latest explosion heard Sunday afternoon.

News article:
Ramallah: Hamas’ Ministry of Interior and National Security in Gaza has warned about the proliferation of online adverts offering Gazan youngsters the chance to leave the Strip and work in other parts of the world. “The tempting fake job vacancies are organised by the Israeli security services targeting the Gaza youth,” said the ministry in a statement. Hamas’ ministry said that the main aim of the adverts is to recruit Palestinian youngsters as collaborators with Israel. “These are fake ads and it would be extremely dangerous for Gazans to follow them,” said the ministry. Palestinian youth, on the other hand, said Hamas should not be so obsessed with the Israeli intelligence services and should not underestimate the capabilities of young people to assess the adverts. “The occupation’s tactics are known to all the Palestinian public, not only to Hamas... We were born under the Israeli occupation and we know the Israeli tactics perfectly well,” said Essam E.B, a 28-year-old unemployed university graduate from Al Maghazi, Gaza in an interview with Gulf News. “Hamas should work on creating job opportunities for the unemployed youth, which are in the tens of thousands. We are not talking politically — the issue should be addressed socially and economically,” he said. Esam said that living conditions, especially for young people, in Gaza have become intolerable and that young Gazans are ready to take the risk to make a better life. “Many Gazans who followed those ads have ended up in Europe,” he said, adding that those companies do not ask for money initially but pay the recruitment companies from their salaries afterwards. He said that Hamas had issued warning against the adverts only when the security forces in the Strip noticed the adverts had been attracting a lot of attention. “The ads are worth examining to see if they will work out or if they are merely traps,” he said. “The unemployed remain unemployed and need to explore opportunities. There are none in Gaza but they exist in many other parts of the world.”

Ramallah: Hamas’ Ministry of Interior and National Security in Gaza has warned about the proliferation of online adverts offering Gazan youngsters the chance to leave the Strip and work in other parts of the world. “The tempting fake job vacancies are organised by the Israeli security services targeting the Gaza youth,” said the ministry in a statement. Hamas’ ministry said that the main aim of the adverts is to recruit Palestinian youngsters as collaborators with Israel. “These are fake ads and it would be extremely dangerous for Gazans to follow them,” said the ministry. Palestinian youth, on the other hand, said Hamas should not be so obsessed with the Israeli intelligence services and should not underestimate the capabilities of young people to assess the adverts. “The occupation’s tactics are known to all the Palestinian public, not only to Hamas... We were born under the Israeli occupation and we know the Israeli tactics perfectly well,” said Essam E.B, a 28-year-old unemployed university graduate from Al Maghazi, Gaza in an interview with Gulf News. “Hamas should work on creating job opportunities for the unemployed youth, which are in the tens of thousands. We are not talking politically — the issue should be addressed socially and economically,” he said. Esam said that living conditions, especially for young people, in Gaza have become intolerable and that young Gazans are ready to take the risk to make a better life. “Many Gazans who followed those ads have ended up in Europe,” he said, adding that those companies do not ask for money initially but pay the recruitment companies from their salaries afterwards. He said that Hamas had issued warning against the adverts only when the security forces in the Strip noticed the adverts had been attracting a lot of attention. “The ads are worth examining to see if they will work out or if they are merely traps,” he said. “The unemployed remain unemployed and need to explore opportunities. There are none in Gaza but they exist in many other parts of the world.”

News article:
A top Hamas general says the militant group is preparing for a war with Israel, according to a report from the Times of Israel on Monday. Marwan Issa, the top commander of Hamas’ military wing, said his group has continued to stockpile rockets in anticipation of a war though it is not actively seeking a new round of violence with Israel. “We are not seeking confrontation with Israel, but we continue to strengthen our capabilities by producing more rockets,” Issa said during a rare public appearance Sunday, ToI reported. The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam brigades commander also said Hamas was looking to forge regional alliances that would help it get more arms, though he emphasized that the group was not interested in aligning itself with any specific country or faction. Issa’s remarks come amid growing fear in Gaza that the Palestinian territory has become increasingly isolated in the wake of Egypt’s decision to declare Hamas a terrorist organization. Egyptian troops have destroyed virtually all smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border in recent months, leading some Gazans to fear increasing hardship, the Associated Press reported. A Hamas spokesman alleged Sunday that Egypt had become a “direct agent” of Israeli interests, urging Saudi Arabia to pressure Egypt to open the border. Hamas’ self-declared attempts to continue building its weapons capabilities were highlighted Monday when Israel filed indictments against three businessmen for allegedly smuggling weapons-making material to Hamas. The men were accused of “providing raw materials directly to Hamas for the benefit of manufacturing rockets, missiles, and other armaments,” the Jerusalem Post reported. Authorities alleged that the effort was part of an attempt to rehabilitate the “terror infrastructure” in Gaza, which was badly damaged during last summer’s 50-day war between Israel and Hamas.

News article:
Gaza – A senior Hamas military official said Monday his Palestinian Islamist group which controls Gaza is rebuilding its heavily depleted rocket arsenal in case of fresh conflict with Israel. “Any regional or international attempt to lay siege to Hamas or its armed wing is bound to fail,” said Marwan Eissa, a commander of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades armed wing. Hamas was “not looking for confrontation” with Israel, he said, quoted by Hamas-run news agency Al-Ray. “But we are making sure our forces are reinforced in case of a confrontation. We’re continuing to make rockets.” Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel during a July-August conflict in and around the Gaza Strip when an Israeli military campaign killed nearly 2,200 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Militant fire killed 73 people on the Israeli side, mostly soldiers. Six months after the conflict ended, there has been no reconstruction of Israeli-blockaded Gaza and more than 100,000 Palestinians are still homeless. Hamas has been struggling to pay its security forces due to Egypt’s destruction of cross-border tunnels used to ferry in supplies.

News article:
The Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry has been beefing up security arrangements along the Gaza Strip's border with Egypt for several days now. Troops deployed along the border with Egypt have set up barriers made of sacks of sand around their positions. These measures have been taken because the Interior Ministry wants to impose tighter control over the border, according to a source at the Palestinian Homeland Security Agency, a department of the Interior Ministry. "We had to beef up security on the border after the Egyptian army opened fire on the Gaza Strip more than once," the source told The Anadolu Agency on condition of anonymity. He added that Egyptian fire had targeted checkpoints on the Palestinian side of the border. In February, Gaza's Interior Ministry accused the Egyptian army of opening fire on the Palestinian side of the border. However, an Egyptian army source denied this charge. "The Egyptian army has never done this before," the source told AA at the time. "If we do it today, we will declare it." A Palestinian source, meanwhile, said the latest measures taken by Gaza's Interior Ministry on the border with Egypt had nothing to do with growing tension between Egypt and Palestinian faction Hamas. The source said Homeland Security personnel deployed on the border with Egypt had only taken positions 100 meters from the border so they would not be exposed to potential Egyptian gunfire. He added that the sand barriers had been set up for this purpose. "The measures aim first and foremost at protecting personnel deployed on the border," the source told AA. He revealed that Gaza's Interior Ministry had a plan to increase the number of checkpoints on Gaza's shared border with Egypt. Relations deteriorated remarkably between Egypt and Hamas in 2013 soon after the ouster of Islamist Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi by the army. Hamas is an ideological offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, the movement from which Morsi hails. The Egyptian army also accuses the Palestinian faction of standing behind repeated attacks against Egyptian army personnel in the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, which shares borders with both Gaza and Israel. Hamas has consistently denied the allegations.

News article:
In a tunnel dug deep underneath the besieged Gaza Strip, masked gunmen from Islamic Jihad ferry rockets and mortars back and forth, preparing for the next conflict with Israel. Six months ago, the Palestinian militant group emerged battered and bruised from a 50-day conflict with Israel, where it fought alongside fellow Islamist movement Hamas, which controls Gaza. Islamic Jihad's armed wing the Al-Quds Brigades lost 123 men, but fired 3,249 rockets at the Jewish state, it says, including Iranian-made Fajr 5 missiles which reached Tel Aviv and even northern Israel. The conflict, where Israel tried to flush out Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants by bombarding the coastal enclave, killed nearly 2,200 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and 73 people on the Israeli side, mostly soldiers. But the group says it is resurgent. "We're at our highest level of alert to counter any attack. We're used to the occupation (Israel) breaking its ceasefires," senior commander Abu al-Bara told Agence France Presse from one of the group's tunnels. "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger. We're gathering all our strength since it's a war that never ends. We're ready to go to another level against the Zionist occupation and carry out actions we've never done before," he said, without elaborating. The war ended on August 26 with a fragile Hamas-Israel ceasefire brokered by Egypt. In the meantime, Islamic Jihad has sought to replace its fallen comrades, and its manpower is estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000 fighters. Hamas and Islamic Jihad refuse to specify the number of fighters, or rockets, they currently possess, but both were severely depleted by the Israeli assault, which included fierce ground combat. - 'Abu Bakr street' - Israel's ground invasion was aimed at destroying the hundreds of tunnels Gaza's two main Islamist groups had built, both for smuggling supplies and for attacks inside Israel. Islamic Jihad and Hamas staged deadly assaults on Israeli troops using the tunnels. For the first time, AFP correspondents were permitted to enter a tunnel, provided they were blindfolded whilst being taken to them, so as not to give away its location. Inside, placards had been erected on the concrete walls, naming "streets" to help militants navigate the network. One route was named after Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, the first Islamic caliph following the Prophet Mohammed's death in 632; another, Othman Ibn Affan, a successor. Quds fighters said the group had a network of tunnels of "different lengths, some with several entrances". But they were silent on the network's location or how it was built. Their weapons were made inside Gaza, they said, but without elaborating on how the parts were obtained or purchased. It was an open secret before July 2013 that smuggling tunnels underneath the Egyptian border brought in much of Gaza's construction and fuel needs, money, and weapons, or the material to make them. But Egypt destroyed the vast majority after the military ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi and a crackdown was launched against his Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas's ally. Islamic Jihad, founded like Hamas in the 1980s, traditionally has its closest ties with Tehran, having been inspired by the Iranian revolution. - 'Mujahedin school' - Israel accuses the groups of continuing to seize construction material entering Gaza to make tunnels and weapons. "Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have openly declared that they are rebuilding tunnels and testing rockets and other things like that," army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told AFP. "They've been siphoning off from the civilians of Gaza forever," he said, warning that Israel was prepared for further confrontation. Underground and overground, the Quds Brigades lie ready. In the southern city of Khan Yunis, a banner reads: "School of the Mujahedin". Some 200 new recruits aged 19 to 22 are training at the camp, ducking under live fire, jumping through flaming hoops and shouting "Death to Israel! Death to America!". Instructor Abu Ahmed says the masked young men are going through "very advanced training". "Their training lasts between 36 days and six months, before they go to a specialised unit like explosives or sharp shooting," he said. "We don't just have tunnels -- we also invest in people," Abu al-Bara interjected. "With ideas and fighting, it is people who will liberate this land."

The conflict, where Israel tried to flush out Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants by bombarding the coastal enclave, killed nearly 2,200 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and 73 people on the Israeli side, mostly soldiers. But the group says it is resurgent. "We're at our highest level of alert to counter any attack. We're used to the occupation (Israel) breaking its ceasefires," senior commander Abu al-Bara told Agence France Presse from one of the group's tunnels. "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger. We're gathering all our strength since it's a war that never ends. We're ready to go to another level against the Zionist occupation and carry out actions we've never done before," he said, without elaborating. The war ended on August 26 with a fragile Hamas-Israel ceasefire brokered by Egypt. In the meantime, Islamic Jihad has sought to replace its fallen comrades, and its manpower is estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000 fighters. Hamas and Islamic Jihad refuse to specify the number of fighters, or rockets, they currently possess, but both were severely depleted by the Israeli assault, which included fierce ground combat. - 'Abu Bakr street' - Israel's ground invasion was aimed at destroying the hundreds of tunnels Gaza's two main Islamist groups had built, both for smuggling supplies and for attacks inside Israel. Islamic Jihad and Hamas staged deadly assaults on Israeli troops using the tunnels. For the first time, AFP correspondents were permitted to enter a tunnel, provided they were blindfolded whilst being taken to them, so as not to give away its location. Inside, placards had been erected on the concrete walls, naming "streets" to help militants navigate the network. One route was named after Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, the first Islamic caliph following the Prophet Mohammed's death in 632; another, Othman Ibn Affan, a successor. Quds fighters said the group had a network of tunnels of "different lengths, some with several entrances". But they were silent on the network's location or how it was built. Their weapons were made inside Gaza, they said, but without elaborating on how the parts were obtained or purchased. It was an open secret before July 2013 that smuggling tunnels underneath the Egyptian border brought in much of Gaza's construction and fuel needs, money, and weapons, or the material to make them. But Egypt destroyed the vast majority after the military ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi and a crackdown was launched against his Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas's ally. Islamic Jihad, founded like Hamas in the 1980s, traditionally has its closest ties with Tehran, having been inspired by the Iranian revolution. - 'Mujahedin school' - Israel accuses the groups of continuing to seize construction material entering Gaza to make tunnels and weapons. "Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have openly declared that they are rebuilding tunnels and testing rockets and other things like that," army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told AFP. "They've been siphoning off from the civilians of Gaza forever," he said, warning that Israel was prepared for further confrontation. Underground and overground, the Quds Brigades lie ready. In the southern city of Khan Yunis, a banner reads: "School of the Mujahedin". Some 200 new recruits aged 19 to 22 are training at the camp, ducking under live fire, jumping through flaming hoops and shouting "Death to Israel! Death to America!". Instructor Abu Ahmed says the masked young men are going through "very advanced training". "Their training lasts between 36 days and six months, before they go to a specialised unit like explosives or sharp shooting," he said. "We don't just have tunnels -- we also invest in people," Abu al-Bara interjected. "With ideas and fighting, it is people who will liberate this land."

News article:
Yoav Galant, a former IDF general running for Knesset with the centrist Kulanu party, charged Saturday that the government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu largely ignored the tunnel threat posed by Hamas in the Gaza Strip until Operation Protective Edge last summer. Some 30 tunnels dug under the Gaza Strip leading into Israeli territory were exposed and demolished during the war. One led into a kibbutz dining hall, another into a kindergarten in communities bordering the Palestinian enclave. Some of the tunnels were also used to ambush and attack IDF soldiers during the war. “When there are tunnels, the government knows about it and the defense minister knows about it and no one did anything, and that’s unacceptable,” Galant said at a cultural event in Beersheba, according to Ynet. “Thirty-something tunnels are not built in a day. After Operation Cast Lead [in 2008-2009], there were no tunnels. This is negligence. The State of Israel essentially allowed 30 tunnels [to be built] and to me, this is unacceptable,” he said. Galant, a former candidate for IDF chief of staff, said that the next round of violence with Hamas will likely occur over the next four years and that the Israeli public is being misled on the situation in the Gaza Strip. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The public thinks it’s [a choice between] a long, expensive war [and with minimal deaths on our side ] but with largely ineffectual results or rivers of blood,” he said. Galant, who was head of the Southern Command during Cast Lead, said he “forced Hamas to fight soldiers, not civilians” during that conflict and did so in less than half the time it took to conclude Protective Edge, and without the protection of the Iron Dome anti-missile system. “The public must decide who will lead the next round. Someone who has brought victory in the past and can do it again in the future or someone who reached a stalemate [with Hamas],” he said. Advertisement Galant has in the past run into some trouble for his sharp statements during this election campaign. Last month, he appeared to backpedal after he implied that an alleged Israeli attack on Hezbollah and Iranian personnel on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights in January was ordered out of political considerations and not just due to security concerns. Amos Yadlin, a retired general on the center-left Zionist Union list, also speaking at the cultural event Saturday took aim at Netanyahu for his controversial speech to Congress on Iran last week, charging that Israel was not under an existential threat. Dismissing comparisons between the period leading up to the Holocaust and present day, Yadlin said Israel now “has an army, and allies like the United States. Iran must be stopped in other ways.” Yadlin said Netanyahu’s insistence to speak to Congress over the objections — and fury — of the White House was “not smart.” “It was done for the sake of internal politics,” he said. Yadlin also criticized Netanyahu for the 50-day summer war with Hamas and for approving the release of hundreds of convicted Palestinian murderers, a reference to the 2011 Shalit deal (in which 1,027 Palestinians were released in exchange for Gilad Shalit who was held captive by Hamas for five years) and the release of some 80 prisoners in late 2013 and early 2014 as a gesture to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the framework of peace talks. Advertisement Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, who was also at the event in Beersheba, rejected the two military men’s criticism over the handling of Operation Protective Edge “Defense is a complicated matter. It’s not the time for slogans and this isn’t child’s play. The use of military force has a price,” said Ya’alon. “We handled the operation responsibly,” he asserted. Meanwhile, the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad group said it was preparing for the next conflict with Israel. Six months ago, the Palestinian terrorist group emerged battered and bruised from the 50-day conflict with Israel, where it fought alongside fellow Islamist movement Hamas, which controls Gaza.

We’re gathering all our strength since it’s a war that never ends. We’re ready to go to another level against the Zionist occupation and carry out actions we’ve never done before,” he said, without elaborating. Advertisement Israel launched Operation Protective Edge on July 8 to stop Hamas and other groups’ indiscriminate rocket fire on Israeli cities and to destroy the terror tunnels that infiltrate into Israeli territory. During the operation, Hamas rejected a number of ceasefire proposals and violated a number of those that were agreed to. Israel lost 66 soldiers and six civilians, and a Thai agricultural worker, in the month-long conflict while the Palestinian death toll surpassed 2,100, according to Hamas officials in Gaza. Israel said half of the Gaza dead were gunmen and blamed Hamas for all civilian deaths because it operated against Israel from residential areas, placing Gazans in harm’s way. Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups launched over 3,000 rockets indiscriminately at Israeli cities. The war ended on August 26 with a fragile Hamas-Israel ceasefire brokered by Egypt. AFP contributed to this report.

News article:
March 6, 2015 Hamas never imagined that it would be classified as a terrorist movement by an Arab country — a classification that has dangerous political, media and perhaps military repercussions. However, Egypt’s Court of Urgent Matters declared Hamas a terrorist organization on Feb. 28 against the backdrop of the proven movement’s implication in armed operations that claimed the lives of Egyptian officers and soldiers in Sinai Peninsula, after its members seeped through the tunnels into Egypt. Why is this decision dangerous? Egypt is considered the only leeway for Gaza where Hamas is in control. Egypt’s classification of Hamas as a terrorist organization implies that all efforts are being made to cut off its arms supplies and funding by all means necessary. Moreover, whoever cooperates with Hamas is considered a criminal by law, according to a statement on March 4 by Egypt’s Minister of Justice Mahfouz Saber. The law stipulates seizing Hamas properties, arresting all its affiliated members and confiscating their funds and locations. As soon as the decision was issued, Hamas condemned it and Ismail Radwan, the former minister of awqaf and religious affairs and Hamas spokesman, told Al-Monitor, “The Egyptian decision constitutes a service handed to the Israeli occupation on a silver platter. Moreover, it has exported Egypt’s internal crises abroad. But Hamas won’t get carried away with side wars, and its weapons will remain directed against the occupation.” Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri described on Feb. 28 the Egyptian decision as shocking and dangerous. He said that it targets the Palestinian people and their resistance and turns the tables, making the occupation a friend and the Palestinian people a foe. The decision shames Egypt and tarnishes its reputation, but it will not affect Hamas’ status. Hamas did not only make political statements condemning Egypt’s decision, but also staged several public protests and mass marches all over the Gaza Strip after Egypt took this decision. A high-ranking security source in Gaza told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, “The security apparatus in Gaza has in its possession documents condemning some officials in the Palestinian Authority [PA] who provided the Egyptian media with fabricated reports about an alleged role of Hamas in Egypt.” However, the most important statement issued by Hamas came from its former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh on March 3, when he underlined that Hamas is making calls to rectify the historical mistake in Egypt’s decision that is in direct conflict with Egyptian-Palestinian relations. Hamas is dealing patiently and wisely with the issue to right this wrong that neither suits the Arab nation nor Palestine. Hamas has started pulling diplomatic strings from behind the scenes with influential states in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, to pressure Egypt to take back its decision. Al-Monitor had previously quoted some of Hamas’ internal sources expressing optimism about Saudi Arabia’s new role under the reign of King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, hoping for a more balanced stance on the part of the kingdom. Hamas is making regional calls to stop the Egyptian decision, but the problem is that its main allies in the region, notably Turkey and Qatar, have a bad and tense relationship with Egypt. Therefore, Hamas is mainly hanging its hopes on Saudi Arabia, which is the most influential player in Egypt. Egypt’s decision against Hamas coincided with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s visit to Saudi Arabia on March 1. Hamas is well aware that Egypt is careful not to anger Saudi Arabia, its main funder. Thus, Saudi Arabia has been asked to intervene to revoke Egypt’s decision. Hamas has warned against expected repercussions on the ground with a possible military attack on the Gaza Strip, which according to an Egyptian anchorman close to the regime's security circles could take place on April 1. Hamas member of parliament Yahya Moussa, the chairman of the Legislative Council’s Oversight Committee, told Al-Monitor, “I rule out the possibility of a military attack waged by Egypt, despite information confirming otherwise. I personally believe that such a crazy act will not happen since the Egyptian regime can easily do without it.” However, Mousa Abu Marzouk, the deputy chairman of Hamas’ political bureau, who is currently in Egypt, said on March 1 that the Egyptian decision against Hamas is a prelude to its intention to attack Gaza. Meanwhile, Radwan told Al-Monitor, “The Gaza Strip and Hamas will not take things lying down, although we don’t think the Egyptian army will get involved in massacres against Palestinians. Whoever is threatening Hamas should perhaps recall the bitter experience of the Israeli army in the face of [Izz ad-Din] al-Qassam Brigades.” Hamas, despite having publicly declared the unlikelihood of an Egyptian military attack against it in Gaza, has taken precautions in case such a catastrophic scenario occurs. Maj. Gen. Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, leader of the Palestinian security forces, said on March 5 that there has been security mobilization, while security sites stretching along the border with Egypt have been fortified so as to control the border, preventing any security incident from taking place. He also denied any direct contact with the Egyptian army during the ongoing patrols and activities on the border between the two countries. The security measures by Hamas on the border with Egypt aim at preventing any infiltration from and into Sinai, as the movement fears to be dragged into an Egyptian internal conflict, which would have significantly negative consequences. Wael Attiya, Egypt’s ambassador to the PA, said on March 3 that the media statements regarding the Egyptian army’s intention to target certain locations in Gaza does not express the official Egyptian stance because such plans are not on the agenda of Egypt’s political leadership. In the past few days, Al-Monitor has learned of an internal position assessment that Hamas was circulating, but that has not been reported in the media. The assessment stated that there were several scenarios as to how Hamas would deal with a possible Egyptian attack on Gaza. Hamas could keep silent about the possible attack that would most likely be an airstrike without a ground offensive, or it could respond in a way that is in line with the magnitude and depth of the Egyptian attack. Hamas could also direct its response at Israel, so that the latter pressures Egypt to stop its attack on Gaza. “All the previous scenarios have advantages and disadvantages, but Hamas will be careful to take the road that does not lead to a clash with the Egyptian army, as this option would be very costly,” the internal assessment stated. Finally, Hamas knows very well that Egypt’s recent decision against it will likely kill any chance of communication between both parties and dismiss a possible Egyptian role in the Palestinian reconciliation, truce with Israel and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. This decision increases the possibility of an armed clash between al-Qassam Brigades and the Egyptian army, which is something that Hamas does not want. Hamas is consistently practicing restraint vis-a-vis the official Egyptian enmity against it, either by toning down and controlling its reactions and steering clear of anger, or by increasing its calls with Arab states to pressure Egypt. At the same time, it is seeking to take any step that would keep the confrontation with Egypt at bay. Editor's note: This article has been updated since its initial publication.

Hamas member of parliament Yahya Moussa, the chairman of the Legislative Council’s Oversight Committee, told Al-Monitor, “I rule out the possibility of a military attack waged by Egypt, despite information confirming otherwise. I personally believe that such a crazy act will not happen since the Egyptian regime can easily do without it.” However, Mousa Abu Marzouk, the deputy chairman of Hamas’ political bureau, who is currently in Egypt, said on March 1 that the Egyptian decision against Hamas is a prelude to its intention to attack Gaza. Meanwhile, Radwan told Al-Monitor, “The Gaza Strip and Hamas will not take things lying down, although we don’t think the Egyptian army will get involved in massacres against Palestinians. Whoever is threatening Hamas should perhaps recall the bitter experience of the Israeli army in the face of [Izz ad-Din] al-Qassam Brigades.” Hamas, despite having publicly declared the unlikelihood of an Egyptian military attack against it in Gaza, has taken precautions in case such a catastrophic scenario occurs. Maj. Gen. Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, leader of the Palestinian security forces, said on March 5 that there has been security mobilization, while security sites stretching along the border with Egypt have been fortified so as to control the border, preventing any security incident from taking place. He also denied any direct contact with the Egyptian army during the ongoing patrols and activities on the border between the two countries. The security measures by Hamas on the border with Egypt aim at preventing any infiltration from and into Sinai, as the movement fears to be dragged into an Egyptian internal conflict, which would have significantly negative consequences. Wael Attiya, Egypt’s ambassador to the PA, said on March 3 that the media statements regarding the Egyptian army’s intention to target certain locations in Gaza does not express the official Egyptian stance because such plans are not on the agenda of Egypt’s political leadership. In the past few days, Al-Monitor has learned of an internal position assessment that Hamas was circulating, but that has not been reported in the media. The assessment stated that there were several scenarios as to how Hamas would deal with a possible Egyptian attack on Gaza. Hamas could keep silent about the possible attack that would most likely be an airstrike without a ground offensive, or it could respond in a way that is in line with the magnitude and depth of the Egyptian attack. Hamas could also direct its response at Israel, so that the latter pressures Egypt to stop its attack on Gaza. “All the previous scenarios have advantages and disadvantages, but Hamas will be careful to take the road that does not lead to a clash with the Egyptian army, as this option would be very costly,” the internal assessment stated. Finally, Hamas knows very well that Egypt’s recent decision against it will likely kill any chance of communication between both parties and dismiss a possible Egyptian role in the Palestinian reconciliation, truce with Israel and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. This decision increases the possibility of an armed clash between al-Qassam Brigades and the Egyptian army, which is something that Hamas does not want. Hamas is consistently practicing restraint vis-a-vis the official Egyptian enmity against it, either by toning down and controlling its reactions and steering clear of anger, or by increasing its calls with Arab states to pressure Egypt. At the same time, it is seeking to take any step that would keep the confrontation with Egypt at bay. Editor's note: This article has been updated since its initial publication.

News article:
March 6, 2015 Hamas never imagined that it would be classified as a terrorist movement by an Arab country — a classification that has dangerous political, media and perhaps military repercussions. However, Egypt’s Court of Urgent Matters declared Hamas a terrorist organization on Feb. 28 against the backdrop of the proven movement’s implication in armed operations that claimed the lives of Egyptian officers and soldiers in Sinai Peninsula, after its members seeped through the tunnels into Egypt. Why is this decision dangerous? Egypt is considered the only leeway for Gaza where Hamas is in control. Egypt’s classification of Hamas as a terrorist organization implies that all efforts are being made to cut off its arms supplies and funding by all means necessary. Moreover, whoever cooperates with Hamas is considered a criminal by law, according to a statement on March 4 by Egypt’s Minister of Justice Mahfouz Saber. The law stipulates seizing Hamas properties, arresting all its affiliated members and confiscating their funds and locations. As soon as the decision was issued, Hamas condemned it and Ismail Radwan, the former minister of awqaf and religious affairs and Hamas spokesman, told Al-Monitor, “The Egyptian decision constitutes a service handed to the Israeli occupation on a silver platter. Moreover, it has exported Egypt’s internal crises abroad. But Hamas won’t get carried away with side wars, and its weapons will remain directed against the occupation.” Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri described on Feb. 28 the Egyptian decision as shocking and dangerous. He said that it targets the Palestinian people and their resistance and turns the tables, making the occupation a friend and the Palestinian people a foe. The decision shames Egypt and tarnishes its reputation, but it will not affect Hamas’ status. Hamas did not only make political statements condemning Egypt’s decision, but also staged several public protests and mass marches all over the Gaza Strip after Egypt took this decision. A high-ranking security source in Gaza told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, “The security apparatus in Gaza has in its possession documents condemning some officials in the Palestinian Authority [PA] who provided the Egyptian media with fabricated reports about an alleged role of Hamas in Egypt.” However, the most important statement issued by Hamas came from its former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh on March 3, when he underlined that Hamas is making calls to rectify the historical mistake in Egypt’s decision that is in direct conflict with Egyptian-Palestinian relations. Hamas is dealing patiently and wisely with the issue to right this wrong that neither suits the Arab nation nor Palestine. Hamas has started pulling diplomatic strings from behind the scenes with influential states in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, to pressure Egypt to take back its decision. Al-Monitor had previously quoted some of Hamas’ internal sources expressing optimism about Saudi Arabia’s new role under the reign of King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, hoping for a more balanced stance on the part of the kingdom. Hamas is making regional calls to stop the Egyptian decision, but the problem is that its main allies in the region, notably Turkey and Qatar, have a bad and tense relationship with Egypt. Therefore, Hamas is mainly hanging its hopes on Saudi Arabia, which is the most influential player in Egypt. Egypt’s decision against Hamas coincided with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s visit to Saudi Arabia on March 1. Hamas is well aware that Egypt is careful not to anger Saudi Arabia, its main funder. Thus, Saudi Arabia has been asked to intervene to revoke Egypt’s decision. Hamas has warned against expected repercussions on the ground with a possible military attack on the Gaza Strip, which according to an Egyptian anchorman close to the regime's security circles could take place on April 1.

News article:
Per a recent article in these ages – https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-offers-long-term-ceasefire-in-exchange-for-end-of-blockade/ Gazan businessmen claiming to convey messages on behalf of Hamas to Western diplomats have recently offered the possibility of a multi-year ceasefire in exchange for Israel’s lifting of the blockade. Call me cynical, but I see a few problems right off the bat: 1) From the article there seem to be two disparate sets of terms proposed have been proposed by different people to different diplomats – so this seems more like a trial balloon designed to elicit an Israeli on-the-record response than anything else. 2) Per one set of terms, “4) Hamas is interested in improved relations with the international community, and would like to discuss with it all issues related to stability and international peace.” But anyone familiar with Hamas’ charter could never take this seriously. Hamas’ professed desire to involve the international community via Western diplomats in this effort and the quoted statement in particular must be rejected as ultra vires given that Hamas has not (to my knowledge) ever annulled its Charter – Articles 13, 15 and 34 prima facie seem to preclude any substantial settlement with Israel – especially one that involves international mediation. That’s besides the fact that Article 7 of the Charter calls for genocide of the Jews, in so many words. In short, Hamas’ own founding document expressly precludes/outlaws the particular activities now ascribed to the high-level Hamas officials. That any respected journalist would report this uncritically as anything serious – without even mentioning these points seems credulous, at best. Now, this kind of reportage does have years of tradition behind it. After all, when the PLO proclaimed a “state” in November 1988, a state that implicitly covered all of Israel, thus making the proclamation a declaration of war, the act was reported in Israel and the West as a conciliatory and moderate statement. Still, one would think the serious journalists might have had learned something in the past 25 years, or so. One last point: 3) The term referenced by the article is ‘Tahadiyah’ – not a theological term (which Hamas as a theological group might feel bound by), but a modern concept Hamas has appealed to before in 2009 for those can remember. It means ‘calm’ or ‘lull’ – not really a ‘cease fire’. Per Micha Halpern, “The word implies a reduction, not a stoppage, of aggression. The concept of Tahadiyah implies that there is plenty of wiggle room. Tahadiyah is not quiet nor is it a commitment to enforce a quiet. Quite to the contrary a Tahadiyah actually allows for attacks and a gradual increase of pressure and a change in the status quo over time. It is a very ambiguous and amorphous term that translates into a very ambiguous and amorphous status on the ground.” In short, this offer is an invitation to formalize what Israel has endured since 2005. Nothing substantive is being offered because whenever Hamas has used the word Tahadiyah in the past rockets have continued to fly or re-arming has proceeded at a feverish pace. Only in the Arab-Israeli conflict has the world become accepting of a certain level of rocket fire aimed at civilians as ‘normal’. This absurd state of affairs should hardly be institutionalized with our acquiescence. Instead, Hamas should be called to respond to points raised above. Hamas started a war, violated 11 ceasefires, and lost. This appeal to Israel – designed to provide Hamas time and cover to replenish its arms and continue “low level” rocket fire – is an “offer” that should be treated with precisely the disdain it deserves.

News article:
In a tunnel deep underground the Gaza Strip, masked terrorists from Islamic Jihad are preparing for their next war with Israel. Following the 50-day summer war with Israel, Islamic Jihad, Hamas and other Gaza-based terror groups are licking their wounds. The Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Islamic Jihad, lost 123 terrorists in the fighting with Israel and fired some 3,300 rockets into the Jewish state. Gaza terrorists attempted to show their might by firing the Iranian made Fajr 5 missile, which has the ability to reach Tel Aviv and northern Israel. Israeli intelligence are keeping a close eye on the activities of the Gaza terror groups. Days after the announcement of a ceasefire with Israel, Hamas and Islamic Jihad boasted that they were already preparing for the next round of conflict with Israel. “We’re at our highest level of alert to counter any attack,” senior commander Abu al-Bara told AFP from one of the group’s terror tunnels. “We’re used to the occupation (Israel) breaking its ceasefires.” “What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. We’re gathering all our strength since it’s a war that never ends. We’re ready to go to another level against the Zionist occupation and carry out actions we’ve never done before,” he said While Islamic Jihad refuses to specify the number of fighters currently aligned with the terror group, conservative estimates put the number between 10,000 and 15,000, Israel’s ground invasion into Gaza greatly reduced the number of fighters and rockets both Hamas and Islamic Jihad possess. However, the terror groups are quickly making up for what they lost. AFP reporters were allowed access into an Islamic Jihad tunnel network for the first time. Blindfolded while being transported to its entrance, once inside the tunnels are akin to a mini city, filled with interconnecting concrete passages and even “streets” to help the terrorists navigate the vast network. One of the “streets” was named after Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, the first Islamic caliph after the death of the Prophet Mohammed. An Islamic Jihad terrorist said that the group’s tunnels were of “different lengths, some with several entrances.” Gaza terror groups have successfully used the interconnected tunnel network to smuggle in illegal supplies, usually from Egypt, to build weaponry and carry out attacks against Israel. During Operation Protective Edge, the IDF said it had demolished majority of terror tunnels inside Gaza, but a few unknown ones remained active. “Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have openly declared that they are rebuilding tunnels and testing rockets and other things like that,” IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told AFP. “They’ve been siphoning off from the civilians of Gaza forever,” he said, confirming previous reports of the terror groups usual practice of utilizing humanitarian goods shipped into Gaza from Israel for terror purposes. While Islamic Jihad terrorists are preparing for their underground war with Israel, above ground the group is training its young recruits to die in the battle of jihad. In the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis, the “School of the Mujahedin” is training some 200 new recruits by having them duck live fire, jump through flaming hoops, and practice chanting, “Death to Israel! Death to America!” Abu Ahmed, the instructor at the terror training camp, says that the young men are going through “very advanced training.” “Their training lasts between 36 days and six months, before they go to a specialized unit like explosives or sharp shooting,” he said. Abu al-Bara emphasized that Islamic Jihad is not just investing in tunnels, “we also invest in people.” He added, “With ideas and fighting, it is people who will liberate this land.”

The Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Islamic Jihad, lost 123 terrorists in the fighting with Israel and fired some 3,300 rockets into the Jewish state. Gaza terrorists attempted to show their might by firing the Iranian made Fajr 5 missile, which has the ability to reach Tel Aviv and northern Israel. Israeli intelligence are keeping a close eye on the activities of the Gaza terror groups. Days after the announcement of a ceasefire with Israel, Hamas and Islamic Jihad boasted that they were already preparing for the next round of conflict with Israel. “We’re at our highest level of alert to counter any attack,” senior commander Abu al-Bara told AFP from one of the group’s terror tunnels. “We’re used to the occupation (Israel) breaking its ceasefires.” “What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. We’re gathering all our strength since it’s a war that never ends. We’re ready to go to another level against the Zionist occupation and carry out actions we’ve never done before,” he said While Islamic Jihad refuses to specify the number of fighters currently aligned with the terror group, conservative estimates put the number between 10,000 and 15,000, Israel’s ground invasion into Gaza greatly reduced the number of fighters and rockets both Hamas and Islamic Jihad possess. However, the terror groups are quickly making up for what they lost. AFP reporters were allowed access into an Islamic Jihad tunnel network for the first time. Blindfolded while being transported to its entrance, once inside the tunnels are akin to a mini city, filled with interconnecting concrete passages and even “streets” to help the terrorists navigate the vast network. One of the “streets” was named after Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, the first Islamic caliph after the death of the Prophet Mohammed. An Islamic Jihad terrorist said that the group’s tunnels were of “different lengths, some with several entrances.” Gaza terror groups have successfully used the interconnected tunnel network to smuggle in illegal supplies, usually from Egypt, to build weaponry and carry out attacks against Israel. During Operation Protective Edge, the IDF said it had demolished majority of terror tunnels inside Gaza, but a few unknown ones remained active. “Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have openly declared that they are rebuilding tunnels and testing rockets and other things like that,” IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told AFP. “They’ve been siphoning off from the civilians of Gaza forever,” he said, confirming previous reports of the terror groups usual practice of utilizing humanitarian goods shipped into Gaza from Israel for terror purposes. While Islamic Jihad terrorists are preparing for their underground war with Israel, above ground the group is training its young recruits to die in the battle of jihad. In the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis, the “School of the Mujahedin” is training some 200 new recruits by having them duck live fire, jump through flaming hoops, and practice chanting, “Death to Israel! Death to America!” Abu Ahmed, the instructor at the terror training camp, says that the young men are going through “very advanced training.” “Their training lasts between 36 days and six months, before they go to a specialized unit like explosives or sharp shooting,” he said. Abu al-Bara emphasized that Islamic Jihad is not just investing in tunnels, “we also invest in people.” He added, “With ideas and fighting, it is people who will liberate this land.”

News article:
A proposal to end the military blockade on Gaza in return for a long-term ceasefire with Hamas was initiated by Israel and rejected by the Islamic movement over concerns that it would effectively detach the Gaza Strip from the West Bank, a senior Hamas official claimed. Responding to a report published by The Times of Israel on March 9, Hamas’s deputy political chief Moussa Abu Marzouk wrote Wednesday on his Facebook page that it was Israel — not Hamas — which proposed the establishment of air and sea ports in Gaza in return for calm. The Israeli offer was never put on paper, however, he said. “There were in fact those who conveyed ideas regarding an airport and sea port, thereby separating the Gaza Strip from Israel primarily, and hence from the West Bank, since the occupation prevents geographic contiguity [between Gaza and the West Bank],” Abu Marzouk wrote. “Gaza would be open to the outside world without the limitations of the Rafah Crossing [with Egypt] or Israel’s policies.” The message to Hamas was conveyed by Israeli army officers through independent politicians and Gaza businessmen, Abu Marzouk noted, adding that he had discussed the matter with ministers of the Palestinian unity government several times before deciding to reject it. “The basic purpose of this plan is not to serve Gaza, but rather to separate it from the West Bank; which will subsequently be swallowed up [by Israel],” he wrote. “We in Gaza pay the price for rejecting these ideas through an intensification of the siege, economic pressures and limitations on our freedom of movement. But we did not accept this plan.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The IDF declined to comment. According to documents obtained by The Times of Israel, Hamas had agreed through international intermediaries to halt all of its military activities for at least five years in return for Israel lifting its military blockade and export ban, and allowing the construction of sea and air ports. Abu Marzouk said that the ideas mentioned in the leaked document were being endorsed by PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah as part of their “bad policies regarding Gaza and its population.” Advertisement “We have never given our agreement to any of the people bearing these ideas, nor have we put them on our agenda to study, because there can be no debate on our national responsibility or the unity and future of our cause,” he continued. We have stated dozens of times that there will be no Palestinian state in Gaza [alone] and no Palestinian state without Gaza.” Abbas and the PA, Haya charged, are ‘waiting to see whether the Islamists are erased in the Arab world, and with them Hamas’ Hamas official Khalil Haya said on Thursday that the Palestinian Authority has demanded control of 50 percent of the funds pledged for the reconstruction of Gaza. Speaking at a political gathering in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, Haya said that UNRWA, the UN body responsible for Palestinian refugees and their descendants, would receive 20% of the funds, leaving just 30% to “the residents.” Abbas and the PA, Haya charged, are “waiting to see whether the Islamists are erased in the Arab world, and with them Hamas.” Donor states have pledged $5.4 billion for reconstruction projects in Gaza at a conference held last October, but have failed to make good on their promises. On Tuesday, however, Qatar began constructing 1,000 homes for local residents displaced during Operation Protective Edge.

News article:
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said today that the suicide truck bombing that took the lives of 12 Israeli soldiers and wounded 14 in south Lebanon yesterday would not precipitate the Israel Defense Force into speeding up its phased withdrawal from Lebanon. The IDF will continue to withdraw from south Lebanon in an orderly fashion while maintaining a security belt to protect Israel’s northern border settlements, Rabin said. Several Likud Knesset members insisted today that Israel maintain a permanent security belt in south Lebanon, beyond the international border, as suggested recently by Gen. (res.) Yehoshua Saguy, former chief of military intelligence. MKS URGE IMMEDIATE PULLOUT But six other MKs presented urgent agenda motions today calling for an immediate pull-out of of the IDF from Lebanon instead of the gradual three stage withdrawal presently underway. The first stage was completed on February 16. The second stage, begun last week, is now in progress. The third and final stage, which as originally envisaged would bring the IDF to the international border, is not expected to be completed until some time next summer. Amnon Rubinstein, of the Shinui faction suggested that the second and third stages be completed in succession, without pausing for Cabinet review and approval. The MKs who called for an immediate, total pull-out are Haika Grossman and Victor Shem-Tov of Mapam; Shulamit Aloni of the Citizens Rights Movement (CRM); Mordechai Virshubsky of Shinui; Meir Wilner of the Hadash Communist Party; and Gen.(res.) Matityahu Peled of the Progressive Movement for Peace. Meanwhile, President Chaim Herzog, who sent condolences today to the families of the 12 fallen soldiers (see separate story) lashed out at mindless terrorism. “We are witnessing a terrifying phenomenon which threatens the peace of the world, ” he said. “This new terrorist dimension, based on extreme religious fanaticism, augers ill for civilized society. This expression of bitter, uncompromising and inhuman hatred, bereft of all reason, has already caused casualties to the citizens of other nations, and the civilized world must awake to the realities and mobilize to face this danger and eradicate it, ” Herzog said. He was referring to the extremist elements of the Shiite Moslem community in south Lebanon, believed to be influenced by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. A minority among the Shiites, they are held responsible for most of the attacks on IDF units. SHIITES NOT ENEMY Herzog stressed that Israel has never been and is not now an enemy of the Shia sect in Lebanon. “Israel had nothing to do with the cruel and murderous events which have taken place lately in Lebanon,” he said. He was referring to last Friday’s car-bomb attack on an apartment house in a Shiite suburb of Beirut which killed at least 75 persons. The immediate reaction of the Shiite population was to blame Israel and the United States. Israel’s sole purpose, Herzog declared, is to secure the lives of its citizens “and we shall continue with determination to do everything compatible with our civilized principles in order to remove any threat to our borders and eliminate any hand raised to strike us. That is our sole purpose.”

News article:
The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas has rejected a proposal for a five-year truce with Israel that would have included the lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip, according to senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouk. Marzouk said that the proposal—put forth by Israeli, Palestinian, and international parties—also included clauses about the establishment of an airport and a seaport in Hamas-ruled Gaza, Haaretz reported. “We’re paying a steep price for our stance by the continued blockade and economic pressure over the Strip, but we reject any idea that would lead to the separation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, despite the fact that Palestinian President Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) and his government are actively doing so with their policies,” Marzouk said in a Facebook post. Robert Serry, the outgoing United Nations special coordinator for Middle East peace, had apparently proposed a three-to-five year truce with Israel to Hamas officials in order to aid the reconstruction of Gaza following last summer’s war there. A different report, by Walla News, indicated that Hamas sent a series of messages to Israel through U.N. and Western diplomats that it was willing to strike a five-year truce. Several such truces—known as “hudna” in Arabic—have been offered by Hamas in the past.

News article:
The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas has rejected a proposal for a five-year truce with Israel that would have included the lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip, according to senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouk. Marzouk said that the proposal—put forth by Israeli, Palestinian, and international parties—also included clauses about the establishment of an airport and a seaport in Hamas-ruled Gaza, Haaretz reported. “We’re paying a steep price for our stance by the continued blockade and economic pressure over the Strip, but we reject any idea that would lead to the separation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, despite the fact that Palestinian President Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) and his government are actively doing so with their policies,” Marzouk said in a Facebook post. Robert Serry, the outgoing United Nations special coordinator for Middle East peace, had apparently proposed a three-to-five year truce with Israel to Hamas officials in order to aid the reconstruction of Gaza following last summer’s war there. A different report, by Walla News, indicated that Hamas sent a series of messages to Israel through U.N. and Western diplomats that it was willing to strike a five-year truce. Several such truces—known as “hudna” in Arabic—have been offered by Hamas in the past.

Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon spoke out Saturday against hardline critics of the Netanyahu administration, including his own ministerial colleagues, saying that if Israel had conquered the Gaza Strip during last summer’s war, the IDF would still be suffering casualties. Addressing a conference in the central town of Ness Ziona, the former IDF chief of staff rebuffed those who called for the IDF to reoccupy the Palestinian coastal enclave during last summer’s conflict, saying that “if we had gone for such a move, we would still be bringing back bodies (of soldiers) and (terrorists) would still be launching rockets at Israel. “We understood that even if we were to bring forces into Gaza (permanently), placing a rocket with a timer under a building and launching it wouldn’t be much of a problem. So we acted responsibly and level-headedly and decided Hamas shouldn’t gain anything from this escalation.” He said that Hamas suffered immense casualties and that cabinet ministers’ criticism of the Israeli government’s handling of the war at the time and since was baseless. Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman (Yisrael Beytenu) and Economy Minister Naftali Bennett (Jewish Home), who both sat in the inner security cabinet, slammed their own government for its handling of the war at the time, and both have asserted that Israel should have “brought down Hamas” in a succession of comments in the run-up to the March 17 elections.

The Labor Party leader said that Netanyahu’s inattention to the 2011 social justice protesters’ demands concerning the housing crisis was “an unforgivable sin.” He said that every seat which his party wins over the ruling Likud party “will be dramatic for the future of the state of Israel.” Advertisement Earlier on Saturday a former head of Israel’s internal security agency backed Herzog ahead of Tuesday’s election, criticizing Netanyahu for his record in security. “Why is this the moment to give Herzog a chance? Mainly because Netanyahu has failed in almost every area and because Herzog is the better alternative,” Yuval Diskin, who headed the Shin Bet agency from 2005 to 2011, wrote on Facebook. Netanyahu has campaigned for the general election on a security mandate, casting himself as the only person capable of leading Israel against the threat of Iran and regional jihadist groups. But Diskin criticized the premier on his safety record as well as his approach to peace talks with the Palestinians, which the former security chief said were “conducted with astonishing ineffectiveness.” He said he was against the prisoner swap in 2011 that saw Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit released in return for hundreds of Palestinian inmates. “Netanyahu freed dozens of terrorists, several of them dangerous,” he wrote. Advertisement Diskin also criticized the most recent Israeli military campaign in Gaza last year, which he said “had achieved no decisive result” against Hamas militants. The Zionist Union, a coalition of Herzog’s Labour Party with the centrist Hatnua led by former chief negotiator Livni, has made a show of the support it has received from Israel’s security sector, traditionally a key voter influence. Former military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin has joined the Zionist Union list and is tipped to become defense minister if Herzog is the next prime minister. As well as Diskin, two former heads of the Mossad spy service, Meir Dagan and Shabtai Shavit, have publicly criticized Netanyahu’s security record.

News article:
Premier David Ben Gurion served notice today that Israel reserves its freedom of action if there is any return of Egyptians to the Gaza Strip and, if the need arises, won’t announce its action in advance. He said concern expressed in the Knesset over the Gaza situation was not imaginary, but real. The Israeli leader takes sharp issue with Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, over a statement attributed to him that the United Nations Emergency Force was in Gaza only with the consent of Egypt. “It is not in the power of the Egyptian dictator to agree or disagree, since he was ignominiously expelled from the Strip.” Mr. Ben Gurion asserted. “I must add with regret that Dr. Bunche’s superiors in the United Nations have sometimes been more concerned with the prestige of the Egyptian dictator than with the fulfilment of Egypt’s international obligations and the preservation of peace in the Middle East. “In accordance with the Foreign Minister’s declaration in the General Assembly.” Mr. Ben Gurion announced, “Israel reserves its freedom of action in case the Egyptians return to the Strip which never belonged to them and which was used by them only for the purpose of attacks or threats against Israel. SAYS ISRAEL WILL NOT GIVE PRIOR NOTICE OF ITS ACTIONS “If the time comes when action is appropriate and necessary,” Mr. Ben Gurion declared, the Government of Israel will not, of course, give prior notice of its actions.” Two moves by opposition parties to subject the Government’s Gaza policy to Knesset review were defeated today. A General Zionist motion for debate was rejected by Parliament 51-24 and. Herut Party motion, 53-24. The rejections followed an unusual procedure in which Mr. Ben Gurion replied briefly only to the General Zionist motion and disdained reply to the Herut, merely asking the House to defeat the motion. The Achdut Avoda Party, a coalition member was not present for the voting. In introducing the Herut motion, Menachem Beigin, who cut short an American tour to return to Jerusalem, called for full discussion of the “catastrophic policy of the Government.” He accused Mr. Ben Gurion of a “putsch by a dictator giving orders to abandon parts of the homeland.” In his brief reply to the General Zionists, Mr. Ben Gurion admitted that the situation was worse today than when he last addressed the Knesset. ADMITS ISRAELI ARMY DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER GAZA WITHDRAWAL In response to questions in Parliament today, the Prime Minister admitted that the Israel Army and the border settlements had been deeply concerned over the Government decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. He said he had met with representatives of both elements in an effort to explain the Government’s motives and reasons. Mr. Ben Gurion said an additional budget allowance of one million pounds had been made to strengthen the security of the border settlements. The Army, he said, had been instructed to prepare two detailed plans for ensuring the security of these settlements, one an “ideal” program and are based on the practical realities of the budget. Mr. Ben Gurion, who also holds the portfolio of Ministry of Defense, announced that with the return to Jerusalem of Mrs. Golda Meir, the Foreign Minister, he would, in coming weeks, devote practically all his time to security matters. This concentration, he said, was particularly required to ensure that overall budget cuts do not affect the strength of the Army and its capabilities. Meanwhile, the Israel Cabinet today recommended extension for another year of the special defense tax deducted from all salaries and business incomes. The tax extension is expected to bring in 55,000,000 pounds during the fiscal year. A like Gum will be saved through economies in the various government departments and cuts in civil service persuaded. Reports reaching here from Gaza state that Communist elements in the Gaza population, who went underground during the Israeli occupation, were reported today to have re-appeared and begun intensive activity in collaboration with extremist elements. The Communists are said to oppose the presence of United Nations Emergency Forces in the Strip as a strengthening of United Nations States position in the Middle East.

News article:
The Hamas-held interior ministry in the Gaza Strip on Saturday accused security forces reporting to the rival Palestinian Authority of being behind a wave of violence in the coastal enclave. Spokesman Iyad al-Bozum accused "members of the former security establishment in Gaza" of "exploiting the difficult conditions, especially since the last war, to spread chaos and confusion with explosions, car burnings and shootings." The war to which he referred was last summer's conflict with Israel. Palestinian Authority security forces were ousted from Gaza in 2007 by fighters from the Islamist Hamas movement's armed wing. Bozum did not elaborate, but explosions have targeted vehicles used by Hamas in recent months, as well as some owned by members of PA president Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party. He told a news conference investigations had shown the incidents were "the result of plans by security chiefs in Ramallah", headquarters of the PA in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Bozum said they were aimed at "spreading chaos in Gaza in order to cover up the government's failure and absolve him (Abbas) from any responsibility." Since last spring, when Hamas signed a reconciliation deal with the PA, it has accused the government of independents created under the agreement of abandoning Gaza. In return, the PA accuses Hamas of raising obstacles to the work of the government in the enclave, where it is reluctant to transfer power. Relations between Fatah and Hamas have been further strained since November, when a series of blasts targeted the homes of a dozen Fatah officials in Gaza, causing damage but no casualties. Bozum told reporters several suspects have been arrested and played recordings he said were of them, their voices distorted and images blurred. Bozum said they were members of the PA security services in Gaza before 2007 claiming to have carried out the attacks after receiving orders from Ramallah. WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, issued a statement from Fatah rejecting the accusation. It reported Fatah spokesman Usama al-Qawasmi as dismissing "Hamas lies that nobody believes because everyone knows it imposes its will by force". Qawasmi accused Hamas itself of "being behind explosions and car burnings."

News article:
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rivals Hamas and Fatah have traded some of the harshest accusations in months, raising fresh doubt about their ability to work together to rebuild areas of the Gaza Strip destroyed in last year’s Israel-Hamas war. Hamas, which rules Gaza, claimed over the weekend that the Fatah-run government in the West Bank ordered supporters to carry out several bombings in Gaza to create chaos. Hamas released videos purportedly showing confessions of three men involved in the alleged plot. Gaza Interior Ministry spokesman Iyad Bozum also claimed that Fatah ordered supporters in Gaza to relay information about Hamas’ military infrastructure. Adnan Damiri, a spokesman for Fatah-loyal forces in the West Bank, on Sunday dismissed the purported confession videos as forgeries. He said Hamas is making such claims to distract from its failure in governing Gaza. Last week, Palestinian security forces arrested several dozen Hamas supporters in the West Bank. The sweep came several days after Hamas detained several Fatah activists in Gaza. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The rival factions are meant to be setting aside their differences for the sake of rebuilding Gaza. The current plan calls for a Hamas-backed technocrat government headed by Fatah’s leader, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. This unity government was to replace the rule of Hamas, which had seized Gaza in 2007, but the two sides have failed to make the agreement work. The political paralysis is seen as a major reason for the slow reconstruction pace. A border blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt, in place to varying degrees since 2007, has also hampered reconstruction. Israel has restricted the import of building material, amid concerns Hamas would divert it for military use. Advertisement Since Operation Protective Edge, Israel has eased those restrictions under a UN-brokered deal. The office of the Israeli military dealing with Gaza affairs said Sunday that more than 91,000 tons of construction materials have entered the territory since October. But Gisha, an Israeli advocacy group, said Gaza needs about 5 million tons of building materials to rebuild the approximately 18,000 Gaza homes the UN estimates were destroyed or severely damaged in the 50 days of fighting.

Skip to comments. Hamas warns to retaliate any Egyptian attack on Gaza Posted on by DeaconBenjamin GAZA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Hamas militants will retaliate if the Egyptian army wages attacks against the Islamic movement in the Gaza Strip, a senior Hamas official warned on Sunday. Mahmoud al-Zahar, Hamas strongman, told a political seminar that he rules out any Egyptian war on Gaza, but said "under the current situation, everything is possible, and Hamas will respond to any Egyptian attack on Gaza." Ties between Hamas and Egypt deteriorated since the ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, which was followed by security crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters leaving hundreds of them dead while thousands others are on trials. Matters got worse when an Egyptian court decided in two consecutive sessions that both Hamas and its armed wing al-Qassam Brigades are outlawed and termed them as terrorist organizations. Officially, Egypt has not charged Hamas of any actions against its security, but Egyptian media has been accusing Hamas militants of disturbing the national security of Egypt and aiding and training militants in Sinai. However, Zahar said that his movement "is looking forward to establishing a good relation with Egypt whatever the political area of the current administration is." "In case the Egyptian court annuls its decisions, we will welcome this, and then we will politically build on this step and most probably it will be the start of a new good and stable relation between Hamas and Egypt," he said. Meanwhile, Zahar accused Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah Party of suffocating the Gaza Strip by obstructing the consensus government and helping to keep the blockade imposed on the enclave.

Ties between Hamas and Egypt deteriorated since the ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, which was followed by security crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters leaving hundreds of them dead while thousands others are on trials. Matters got worse when an Egyptian court decided in two consecutive sessions that both Hamas and its armed wing al-Qassam Brigades are outlawed and termed them as terrorist organizations. Officially, Egypt has not charged Hamas of any actions against its security, but Egyptian media has been accusing Hamas militants of disturbing the national security of Egypt and aiding and training militants in Sinai. However, Zahar said that his movement "is looking forward to establishing a good relation with Egypt whatever the political area of the current administration is." "In case the Egyptian court annuls its decisions, we will welcome this, and then we will politically build on this step and most probably it will be the start of a new good and stable relation between Hamas and Egypt," he said. Meanwhile, Zahar accused Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah Party of suffocating the Gaza Strip by obstructing the consensus government and helping to keep the blockade imposed on the enclave.

News article:
Gaza City – Rivals Hamas and Fatah have traded some of the harshest accusations in months, raising fresh doubt about their ability to work together to rebuild areas of the Gaza Strip destroyed in last year’s Israel-Hamas war. Hamas, which rules Gaza, claimed over the weekend that the Fatah-run government in the West Bank ordered supporters to carry out several bombings in Gaza to create chaos. Hamas released videos purportedly showing confessions of three men involved in the alleged plot. Gaza Interior Ministry spokesman Iyad Bozum also claimed that Fatah ordered supporters in Gaza to relay information about Hamas’ military infrastructure. Adnan Damiri, a spokesman for Fatah-loyal forces in the West Bank, on Sunday dismissed the purported confession videos as forgeries. He said Hamas is making such claims to distract from its failure in governing Gaza. Last week, Palestinian security forces arrested several dozen Hamas supporters in the West Bank. The sweep came several days after Hamas detained several Fatah activists in Gaza. The rival factions are meant to be setting aside their differences for the sake of rebuilding Gaza. The current plan calls for a Hamas-backed technocrat government headed by Fatah’s leader, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. This unity government was to replace the rule of Hamas, which had seized Gaza in 2007, but the two sides have failed to make the agreement work. The political paralysis is seen as a major reason for the slow reconstruction pace. According to U.N. figures, about 18,000 Gaza homes were destroyed or severely damaged, and thousands more suffered lesser damage in 50 days of fighting. A border blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt, in place to varying degrees since 2007, has also hampered reconstruction. Israel has restricted the import of building material, amid concerns Hamas would divert it for military use. Since the Gaza war, Israel has eased those restrictions under a U.N.-brokered deal. The office of the Israeli military dealing with Gaza affairs said Sunday that more than 91,000 tons of construction materials have entered the territory since October. Gisha, an Israeli advocacy group, said Gaza needs about 5 million tons of building materials.

March 17, 2015 GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Talks about a long-term truce between Hamas and Israel have surfaced again after it was revealed that there had been an initiative to reach an understanding that could last for years, in return of achieving complete stability on the Israeli borders with the Gaza Strip, and ending the siege. The initiative was made about two months ago by Robert Serry, UN special coordinator for the peace process in the Middle East, between the main parties, Hamas and Israel, as well as the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Ramallah and Egypt, the recent war’s cease-fire agreement sponsor. Hamas quickly denied proposing a truce with Israel for five years, in return for ending the siege, according to what the Israeli website Walla published. But at the same time, it noted that a similar initiative was made by foreign parties, whose names it did not mention in its official statement. Serry himself had confirmed that he made the initiative during a meeting with a number of Palestinian journalists in Gaza City. The initiative included a truce that would last four to five years, under the umbrella of the Palestinian unity government led by Rami Hamdallah. During this period, the Gaza Strip would be reconstructed and all military activity above ground and underground (tunnels) would be halted. In return, the Rafah crossing would be reopened and the Israeli siege that has lasted for over seven years would end. Mousa Abu Marzouk, the deputy chairman of Hamas’ political bureau, denied on Twitter the existence of any agreement or initiative. But a source who participated in the meeting held by the UN envoy to Gaza confirmed that a truce was proposed to Hamas. Abu Marzouk tweeted: “We did not give our approval to any of the parties that spread the news. This is not on our agenda because our national responsibility, the unity of our cause and its future are undisputable.” Serry’s proposal included a long-term cease-fire for the sake of the Gaza Strip’s reconstruction, since countries are not up to donating money for the reconstruction of buildings that might be destroyed again in another round of war unless there is a guarantee that it won’t happen again. The proposal also included the Palestinian government’s participation, which means that Hamdallah’s government would have the freedom to operate in the Gaza Strip without any interference. A prominent Hamas source explained the situation to Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, saying “Two meetings were held between Hamas and the UN envoy, Serry. The first was around two months ago, attended by three Hamas leaders, during which the initiative was presented to them. The envoy gave them two printed copies of the initiative, one in Arabic and the other in English. The second meeting was held at the beginning of this month [March], attended by Hamas’ Gaza leader Ismail Haniyeh, during which the initiative’s outlines were discussed." He added, “Serry was serious in his initiative. He wanted to leave office by accomplishing an achievement on the ground and he wanted the concerned parties to reach a truce that would guarantee achieving stability. However, the fact that he is leaving office at the end of this month [March] might impede the success of this initiative, especially in light of the changes in the Israeli political map following the general elections.” The source noted that the proposed initiative is indeed on the table of discussion of Hamas’ political bureau and the movement did not reject it. The initiative can be achieved in light of specific details since the outlines have been agreed upon, but certain definitions and further details for a number of proposed points must be added. Hamas does not mind implementing the current fragile calm agreement that was set since the Egyptian-sponsored cease-fire was announced in Cairo following last year's 50-day war, which was supposed to be more thoroughly discussed; however, the current security events in the Sinai Peninsula and in Egypt are still preventing that. The head of Hamas’ political bureau and the leader of the military wing in the Gaza Strip both noted that their movement does not wish to renew the confrontation with Israel at this moment. On Feb. 24, Haniyeh said, “Hamas is not concerned with a new confrontation with the occupation.” The same was expressed by Marwan Issa, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades leader, at the same place during his speech, when he said, “We do not currently seek to have further confrontations with the Israeli occupation.” The same source told Al-Monitor, “Hamas cannot give clear and explicit answers, or agree to a long-term truce due to the Israeli elections, since the form and the policies of the future Israeli government toward the Gaza Strip are still unknown.” Al-Monitor Israel Pulse columnist Shlomi Eldar wrote, “In my assessment, no Israeli leader — not incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and not even Zionist Camp leader Isaac Herzog should he be elected — would be willing to open the passages to Gaza merely on the basis of a Hamas promise of a cease-fire. Considering Hamas' current situation, it needs to go the distance and make some far-reaching changes if it wants to save Gaza residents, and itself.” Hamas does not seem eager to engage in a new confrontation with Israel any time soon in light of the current political complications on the internal Palestinian scene, in addition to the changes of the situation in the region. However, Hamas aims to show that it is renewing its military power and sending signals, almost on a daily basis, whether through statements or by trying out its locally made rockets in the sea, to prove that it was not defeated in the recent war.

News article:
Twelve years after Purim celebrations in Israel marked the end of the first Persian Gulf War, Israelis spent the holiday this week preparing for the next war. With an American attack on Iraq imminent, the Israel Defense Force’s Home Front Command on Tuesday ordered the public to prepare sealed rooms for protection against potential chemical or biological attack. The army said the public should not yet open their gas mask kits. Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said President Bush’s speech Monday giving dictator Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq or face war motivated the decision to heighten the level of civil defense readiness. At the same time, Mofaz reiterated the view that an Iraqi attack on Israel in response to a U.S.-led military strike was very unlikely. “Our assessment hasn’t changed. The threat is low and our preparedness is high,” Mofaz said during a visit Tuesday to the special broadcasting studios set up by the Home Front Command. “What changed was the speech of President Bush early this morning, essentially giving a clear ultimatum to Saddam Hussein and Iraq, and determining a timetable that when this ultimatum expires, the American strike is inevitable.” The defense minister went on to add that Israelis should not alter their regular routine because of the heightened state of civil defense preparations. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was due to convene security and political consultations to discuss the situation. The order to prepare sealed rooms came hours before Iraq rejected Bush’s ultimatum. It also came a day after the army formally instructed the public to acquire materials to prepare sealed rooms in their homes. The army also issued call-up orders for several hundred reservists who serve in the Home Front Command and anti-aircraft units. The civil preparations, detailed in an instruction booklet distributed by the Home Front Command several weeks ago, included purchasing plastic sheeting and duct tape to seal a room; stocking up on bottled water and canned and dry foods; buying batteries for radios and flashlights in the event of a power outage; and packing a personal bag for each family member in the event of an evacuation due to a nonconventional attack. The directive was the latest in a series of phased civil defense preparations that have been implemented over the past several months. They included a campaign calling on the population to update their gas mask kits, an information booklet on preparing a sealed room and what to do in the event of attack, and an advisory to stock up on supplies needed to prepare sealed rooms. The instructions didn’t help an Israeli Arab woman and her two teen-aged sons, who suffocated while sleeping in a sealed room the family had prepared in case of a possible Iraqi attack. The woman, 37, and her 13- and 14-year-old sons died from lack of oxygen due Sunday night to a coal-run heater they used to warm the room. The father of the family and two smaller children survived. At the same time, military defensive measures have been implemented, including the deployment in Israel of American Patriot missile batteries to back up Israel’s Arrow anti-missile system, and a raised level of alertness in the Israeli air force. The latest developments followed months in which Israelis have lived in uncertainty over how the Iraqi crisis will play out. Maj.-Gen. Amos Gilad, chosen to serve as a “national commentator” during the conflict, rejected criticism that the army’s gradual approach to preparing the public was confusing. “The easy decision could have been to” tell the public “to open the masks three months ago,” he said on Israel Radio. “The correct decision has to be taken at the right time.” As part of the heightened readiness, an Israeli public television channel was to begin broadcasting instructional videos Tuesday on how to prepare a sealed room and how to put on gas masks. Gas mask distribution centers were to be open for extended hours on Wednesday and Thursday. Israel’s fuel, electricity and water authorities said they were prepared to go on emergency footing, and a situation room was being opened in the infrastructure ministry in Jerusalem. Despite the heightened civil defense preparations, Education Minister Limor Livnat said after consultations with Mofaz that schools would be open as normal on Thursday, following the Purim holiday. Livnat said the decision was subject to change depending on the security situation. British Airways announced Tuesday that it would halt all flights to Israel as of Wednesday night, until further notice. The airline said the decision was in line with a revised travel advisory the British Foreign Council issued Monday, urging British citizens in Israel and the Palestinian territories to leave the region immediately. The army announcement to prepare sealed room did not appear to trigger a rush to buy supplies or change gas mask kits. Gas mask distribution centers have reported increased activity throughout the Iraqi crisis. The head of the Home Front Command said some 92 percent of Israelis already had refreshed their gas mask kits, Army Radio reported. There also were no reports of runs on supplies at stores, though the Consumer Council did receive some complaints of alleged price-gauging on sealed-room supplies. On Monday, before the army order to prepare sealed rooms, shoppers from Ramat Gan, which was hit by Iraqi missiles in 1991, were divided over whether to prepare sealed rooms. As some shoppers loaded nylon sheeting and special protection kits for pets into their carts, one woman said she was not making any specific preparations. “After the last war, some said the plastic and tape wouldn’t have helped us anyway,” she told Israel’s Channel 2 television. “So what’s different now?”

Twelve years after Purim celebrations in Israel marked the end of the first Persian Gulf War, Israelis spent the holiday this week preparing for the next war. With an American attack on Iraq imminent, the Israel Defense Force’s Home Front Command on Tuesday ordered the public to prepare sealed rooms for protection against potential chemical or biological attack. The army said the public should not yet open their gas mask kits. Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said President Bush’s speech Monday giving dictator Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq or face war motivated the decision to heighten the level of civil defense readiness. At the same time, Mofaz reiterated the view that an Iraqi attack on Israel in response to a U.S.-led military strike was very unlikely. “Our assessment hasn’t changed. The threat is low and our preparedness is high,” Mofaz said during a visit Tuesday to the special broadcasting studios set up by the Home Front Command. “What changed was the speech of President Bush early this morning, essentially giving a clear ultimatum to Saddam Hussein and Iraq, and determining a timetable that when this ultimatum expires, the American strike is inevitable.” The defense minister went on to add that Israelis should not alter their regular routine because of the heightened state of civil defense preparations. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was due to convene security and political consultations to discuss the situation. The order to prepare sealed rooms came hours before Iraq rejected Bush’s ultimatum. It also came a day after the army formally instructed the public to acquire materials to prepare sealed rooms in their homes. The army also issued call-up orders for several hundred reservists who serve in the Home Front Command and anti-aircraft units. The civil preparations, detailed in an instruction booklet distributed by the Home Front Command several weeks ago, included purchasing plastic sheeting and duct tape to seal a room; stocking up on bottled water and canned and dry foods; buying batteries for radios and flashlights in the event of a power outage; and packing a personal bag for each family member in the event of an evacuation due to a nonconventional attack. The directive was the latest in a series of phased civil defense preparations that have been implemented over the past several months. They included a campaign calling on the population to update their gas mask kits, an information booklet on preparing a sealed room and what to do in the event of attack, and an advisory to stock up on supplies needed to prepare sealed rooms. The instructions didn’t help an Israeli Arab woman and her two teen-aged sons, who suffocated while sleeping in a sealed room the family had prepared in case of a possible Iraqi attack. The woman, 37, and her 13- and 14-year-old sons died from lack of oxygen due Sunday night to a coal-run heater they used to warm the room. The father of the family and two smaller children survived. At the same time, military defensive measures have been implemented, including the deployment in Israel of American Patriot missile batteries to back up Israel’s Arrow anti-missile system, and a raised level of alertness in the Israeli air force. The latest developments followed months in which Israelis have lived in uncertainty over how the Iraqi crisis will play out. Maj.-Gen. Amos Gilad, chosen to serve as a “national commentator” during the conflict, rejected criticism that the army’s gradual approach to preparing the public was confusing. “The easy decision could have been to” tell the public “to open the masks three months ago,” he said on Israel Radio. “The correct decision has to be taken at the right time.” As part of the heightened readiness, an Israeli public television channel was to begin broadcasting instructional videos Tuesday on how to prepare a sealed room and how to put on gas masks. Gas mask distribution centers were to be open for extended hours on Wednesday and Thursday. Israel’s fuel, electricity and water authorities said they were prepared to go on emergency footing, and a situation room was being opened in the infrastructure ministry in Jerusalem. Despite the heightened civil defense preparations, Education Minister Limor Livnat said after consultations with Mofaz that schools would be open as normal on Thursday, following the Purim holiday.

News article:
March 20, 2015 RAMALLAH, West Bank — Fatah-Hamas ties slid down a slippery slope late last week following mutual accusations of treason. This has weighed down the ties between the two movements, as well as the timid efforts to implement the stalled reconciliation deal signed in April 2014. Islamic Jihad and leftist factions attempted to prevent the collapse of reconciliation prospects. To this effect, the PLO's Executive Committee announced March 19 that it will be send a delegation representing all factions to the Gaza Strip to hold an inclusive dialogue with the participation of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The dialogue will address the implementation of previous agreements, such as preparing for the elections, developing the framework of the PLO and helping the government supervise the Gaza Strip and certain border crossings. Accusations of treason were ignited March 13, when Gaza's Interior Ministry released recordings attributed to Ramallah's security services. The ministry claimed that the security forces were responsible for “the destabilization of Gaza, the spread of chaos and the surveillance and armament of military wings in Gaza.” Meanwhile, Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar accused President Mahmoud Abbas of “personally being involved in the destabilization of Gaza.” Fatah spokesman Ahmad Assaf said that the objective of Hamas’ accusations is “to justify the separation of the Gaza Strip [from the West Bank], and to cover up the involvement of some of its leaders in spying and security cooperation with Israel.” The mutual accusations have escalated the dispute between the two movements — a dispute that is concretely reflected in the administrative separation of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank. The separation began on June 7, 2007, when Hamas and Fatah-affiliated security forces clashed in the Gaza Strip, essentially a civil war lasting just a few days. ​Hamas then took over Gaza's security and political institutions, prompting Abbas to declare a state of emergency in the Palestinian territories. Assaf told Al-Monitor that Hamas accusing Fatah of collaborating with Israel proves that Hamas “does not want reconciliation,” and has only a single plan: “the separation of Gaza from the West Bank and the establishment of its [Hamas’] chiefdom in Gaza.” Hamas’ accusations, said Assaf, are designed “to complete the separation of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank, to cover up the treason at the top of Hamas' pyramid [that is] taking place in Gaza under the pretext of so-called collaboration [with Israel].” Assaf said that the treason of Hamas' leaders is evidenced by Israel's knowledge of the whereabouts of Mohammed al-Deif, commander of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, during the recent war. ​Knowledge of top leaders' locations is usually confined to the narrow circle of Hamas' leadership, yet Israel was also able to identify the whereabouts of Said al-Sayyam in 2009 and Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in 2010, leading to the figures' assassinations. "He who wants reconciliation does not speak this way," said Assaf, "but implements what was agreed upon, and consults with the people by holding comprehensive elections." Assaf ruled out the possibility that the two movements will hold meetings in the near future, and said, “The Hamas movement is farthest from reconciliation.” Last April 23, Fatah and Hamas signed a reconciliation deal — known as the Beach refugee camp agreement — under the auspices of PLO factions in the Gaza Strip. The agreement stipulated the formation of a consensus government that would pave the way for elections. The consensus government was sworn in last June 2, yet it has failed to conduct the task of preparing for presidential and legislative elections, as required. As detailed in the agreement, the government's main duty was to prepare for elections, since the Legislative Council is disabled and no longer has any powers. Furthermore, the institutions of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were to be unified under the supervision of a government based on popular support. Fatah and Hamas have also failed to implement other clauses in the reconciliation deal, including “community reconciliation, developing the PLO, holding elections and resuming the work of the Legislative Council.” Hamas leader Yahya Moussa told Al-Monitor in a phone interview, “The implementation of the reconciliation deal’s clauses depends on President Abbas’ political will and decision, because he doesn't want the consensus government to assume its task and does not want to implement the reconciliation deal’s clauses.” Moussa rejected the accusations leveled against his movement, saying: “Should we have wanted a state to be established in Gaza, it would have been an easy thing to do. Yet Gaza and Hamas are paying the price for rejecting the separation of Jerusalem and the West Bank from the Gaza Strip.” Moussa expressed Hamas’ wish for national factions to control the implementation of the reconciliation deal. He added that Hamas has opted for "national unity." Hamas is also eager for the "consensus government to assume its responsibility and tasks, the partnership and the inevitable work to restore the West Bank, in which Israel has increased ambitions.” Regarding the Interior Ministry news conference, Moussa said it "disclosed the facts. These facts are not part of a media dispute or a threat to the reconciliation. It is the existing reality and President Abbas has not denied it when he said that ‘security coordination is sacred.’" A delegation of PLO factions was supposed to visit Gaza in early February to discuss the implementation of the reconciliation deal and the enablement of a consensus government in Gaza. Yet, PLO Executive Committee member Wasel Abu Yousef told Al-Monitor: “The mutual accusations between the two parties will have an impact on the reconciliation. Yet the bet on the national project that includes all factions still holds.” Abu Yousef added that Hamas' accusations have aggravated the situation, at a time when one must be keen to unite the ranks to achieve national unity and to give the consensus government a chance to extend its sovereignty over Gaza and the border crossings. Abu Yousef said that the two parties must agree to halt the bickering that is blocking reconciliation. Qais Abdul Karim, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said the recent bickering between Fatah and Hamas has turned the clock back in terms reconciliation. Abdul Karim said that the Executive Committee will discuss the PLO delegation's visit to Gaza in an attempt to halt the dispute between the two movements. “This requires a clear atmosphere to resume efforts for a successful dialogue,” said Karim. Ahmad Jamil Azem, a university lecturer and political analyst, told Al-Monitor that reconciliation, from the beginning, was nearly impossible, given the presence of parties within the movements — as well as international parties — that oppose reconciliation. “All factors are not now serving the reconciliation, because the parties are not suggesting a new strategic vision for the current phase, and there is no national reference following up on what is going on,” he said. Azem said that the situation between the two movements might deteriorate: "Both parties have many plans that are not based on the reconciliation, but rather on the resolution of the conflict and their disputes." After seven years of division, the two movements continue to exchange mutual accusations from time to time, throwing reconciliation into an open-ended vicious circle, despite the persistent internal problems and popular discontent.

News article:
Hamas has launched a new propaganda campaign against Israel - this time, claiming with the support of Palestinian Arabs and "human rights" organizations that Gaza "is still under Israeli Occupation." In a broadcast on Hamas's new website, former Hamas government head Ismail Haniyeh stated that Gaza was "liberated" from the "occupier," and that the liberation is "proof that fighting can fulfill the hopes of our people and realize aspirations of a return to freedom and independence." Haniyeh apparently failed to forge the connection between the terms "liberation" and "freedom," however. "Our problem, our enemy, and our struggle is for the land of Palestine, and our gun is aimed only at the occupier, who steals our land," Haniyeh stated. "We are not fighting the Jews because they are Jews, but we are fighting those who occupied the country and plunder the holy places and expelled our people and carried out massacres." Haniyeh also stressed Hamas's determination to establish a Palestinian 'Right of Return' to Israel and to secure terrorist releases.

Hamas has launched a new propaganda campaign against Israel - this time, claiming with the support of Palestinian Arabs and "human rights" organizations that Gaza "is still under Israeli Occupation." In a broadcast on Hamas's new website, former Hamas government head Ismail Haniyeh stated that Gaza was "liberated" from the "occupier," and that the liberation is "proof that fighting can fulfill the hopes of our people and realize aspirations of a return to freedom and independence." Haniyeh apparently failed to forge the connection between the terms "liberation" and "freedom," however. "Our problem, our enemy, and our struggle is for the land of Palestine, and our gun is aimed only at the occupier, who steals our land," Haniyeh stated. "We are not fighting the Jews because they are Jews, but we are fighting those who occupied the country and plunder the holy places and expelled our people and carried out massacres." Haniyeh also stressed Hamas's determination to establish a Palestinian 'Right of Return' to Israel and to secure terrorist releases.

News article:
The Israel press reported today heavy concentrations of Egyptian troops pouring into the Gaza area. The reports, from foreign sources, said that the equivalent of two brigades of regular troops and a special volunteer commando unit had arrived in the Gaza strip. These reports were viewed here against a background of almost daily reports from Israel settlements near the border which speak of endless convoys of military trucks filled with Egyptian troops moving north from Rafah. It was also learned that an Egyptian battalion trained by former Nazi officers is among those now stationed in the Gaza strip. Finally, it was reported today that the Egyptians are planning the construction of a radar station along the border strip. The post and its equipment would be put together from stores left in the Suez Canal zone when the British Army withdrew. Meanwhile, two incidents along the Israel-Egyptian demarcation line in the Gaza area were reported by the Israel Army. An Israel patrol was fired on near Kissufim last night, and replied in kind. It suffered no casualties. A party of Egyptian infiltrators harvesting crops in an Israel field was discovered by an Israel patrol, but fled across the line into Egyptian territory when the Israelis opened fire. Israel complained to the Mixed Armistice Commission about both incidents. The Israel-Jordan Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Jordan last night for the murder of an Israel settlement watchman in the Mt. Gilboa area last week-end.

News article:
Amid claims that it committed war crimes in the last Gaza conflict, Hamas' political leader Khaled Mashal has condemned what he referred to as "Israeli extremism," telling the BBC in an interview aired Wednesday that the Palestinian attacks against Israel would continue "as long as there is occupation, aggression, war and killing." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "We're not looking for any escalation, but we will defend ourselves," Mashal told BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen in an interview from his headquarters in Qatar, adding that Hamas will be "careful to respect international humanitarian law and to target only military targets." He lamented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's win in the recent Israeli elections, saying that "even in the eyes of Americans and Europeans, Netanyahu is the most extreme leader and the one who lives to shed blood the most. That's why we're expecting difficult times with him." Hamas leader Khaled Mashal (Photo: AFP) Netanyahu, whose Likud party won 30 seats in the Knesset, is currently working to form a government with his right-wing "natural partners." Mashal asserted it was the international community's responsibility "to put a stop to (Netanyahu's) stubbornness and Israeli extremism," saying the Palestinians have already shown they are "flexible, serious and keen to achieve a just and rightful peace." Related articles: The Hamas leader, who has always vehemently objected peace talks with Israel and rejected the two-state solution, accused "Israel with its extremist leadership" of killing "the peace process, the two-state solution and every opportunity for a political solution for the Palestinian cause." He called on the US and other Western states to place their pressure on Israel instead of the Palestinians. "We are not the ones who are responsible" for the diplomatic stagnation, he claimed. Mashal, whose organization is defined as a terror group by Israel, Egypt, the US, and other countries, rejected Netanyahu's accusations that Hamas was a jihadist group, claiming there is "no Islamic State or al-Qaeda in Palestine" and that Palestinians caught committing terror attacks against Israelis were "lone wolves" and "isolated." "We don't allow such thoughts in Palestine. The Palestinian people are in a movement for national liberation. It is a just cause, and it is certainly not terrorism," Mashal said, saying the Palestinians were actually "the victims of Israeli terrorism for decades." Mashal claimed Hamas, whose charter calls for the destruction of Israel, has a "moderate ideology and an open mind." He also compared himself and his movement to the likes of Nelson Mandela and George Washington and the causes they led. "The ones who are laughing at our logic today, they should laugh at Mandela and what the Vietnamese people have done. And what (French president) de Gaulle did when he led the liberation war against the Nazi occupation in the Second World War," Mashal said. "They should laugh at George Washington and the American Revolution. The people of the world have been liberated from occupiers and the Palestinian people are doing the same. And so is Hamas."

"(The news) is completely devoid of truth," Fadi al-Hassan, head of Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport said in a statement, adding he believed Israel had sent the letter to damage the reputation of Lebanon and its international airport. Iran has also denied Israel's accusation.

"There have been attempts to attack our forces," Netanyahu informed a meeting of his Likud faction, referring to the shooting and mortar attack launched by IS militants near the Israeli-Syrian border on Sunday. "We will not allow radical Islam to open a front against us in the Golan Heights," said Netanyahu, adding that Israel "will not allow any drizzle (of assaults), and if necessary, we will attack the enemy." On Sunday, IS militants fired at Israeli soldiers from a machine gun-mounted truck. Israel quickly responded with an airstrike, killing four gunmen in the vehicle. In addition, Israel's Air Force struck a compound used by IS militants in the southern Syrian Golan Heights overnight between Sunday and Monday. Reportedly, it is the first confrontation between Israeli soldiers and IS militants.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented Monday on the Israeli Air Force (IAF) strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria, saying Israel will not allow any radical jihadist group to get a foothold on its borders. The IAF mounted two strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria between Sunday and Monday. The air force killed four Islamic State operatives Sunday after the terrorists fired mortars and artillery on Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Golani Brigade troops patrolling the Israel-Syria border. Monday’s strike targeted an Islamic State post on the southern edge of the Syrian Golan Heights. The post, an abandoned military instillation once used by the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force stationed in the buffer zone between Israel and Syria, was used by an Islamic State proxy in southern Syria to gain a foothold near the border. The IAF dropped 10 one-ton bombs on the site, leveling the facility and destroying the weapons stored there. “Over the past few days there have been several attempts to attack Israeli troops on the Israel-Syria border. We mounted a swift, forceful response and exacted a heavy price from our enemies,” Netanyahu said Monday in a weekly meeting of the Likud party. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and we will enforce the policy I have set: We will not tolerate sporadic fire, we will respond forcefully to any incident, and if need be — we will strike our enemies before they attack us. We will not allow radical Islam or any other hostile element to impose a terrorist front on us in the Golan Heights,” he said. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Speaking at a Yisrael Beiteinu party meeting, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel will respond to any provocation on its borders. “This is actually the first time when we’ve encountered an attack by an Islamic State-affiliated cell on our soldiers. We responded the way we always do—in a forceful way,” he said. “Let me be clear: We will respond to any provocation, regardless if it is from the Gaza Strip or anywhere else.” Lieberman noted that the IAF does not need to coordinate its operations with Russia, whose air force is involved in the civil war in Syria. In September 2015, Netanyahu met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, where the two leaders agreed to set up a mechanism to prevent unintended friction between the Israeli and Russian militaries in light of Russia’s growing military presence in Syria. “There’s no need to coordinate [Israel’s current operations] with anyone,” Lieberman said. “Any attack on Israeli soldiers in Israel’s sovereign territory is met with a forceful response. Once we identify the source of the fire, we respond. When we don’t identify the source, [Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s regime is the one responsible. In this case, we identified an Islamic State cell firing from a certain location, fired and destroyed their post.” An IDF Spokesperson’s Unit statement said that the Israeli strikes “aimed to prevent the terrorists from becoming a substantial threat in the area. The IDF will continue to spare no effort to defend the Israeli public while maintaining the military’s freedom of operation in Israel’s sovereign territory, and it will not hesitate to counteract terrorist organizations threatening Israel.”

We responded the way we always do—in a forceful way,” he said. “Let me be clear: We will respond to any provocation, regardless if it is from the Gaza Strip or anywhere else.” Lieberman noted that the IAF does not need to coordinate its operations with Russia, whose air force is involved in the civil war in Syria. In September 2015, Netanyahu met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, where the two leaders agreed to set up a mechanism to prevent unintended friction between the Israeli and Russian militaries in light of Russia’s growing military presence in Syria. “There’s no need to coordinate [Israel’s current operations] with anyone,” Lieberman said. “Any attack on Israeli soldiers in Israel’s sovereign territory is met with a forceful response. Once we identify the source of the fire, we respond. When we don’t identify the source, [Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s regime is the one responsible. In this case, we identified an Islamic State cell firing from a certain location, fired and destroyed their post.” An IDF Spokesperson’s Unit statement said that the Israeli strikes “aimed to prevent the terrorists from becoming a substantial threat in the area. The IDF will continue to spare no effort to defend the Israeli public while maintaining the military’s freedom of operation in Israel’s sovereign territory, and it will not hesitate to counteract terrorist organizations threatening Israel.”

News article:
http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265016/high-stakes-game-over-syria-khamenei-putin-axis-p-david-hornik The news out of Syria this week is, as usual, complex—and seemingly contradictory. On the one hand, the Russian-Syrian-Iranian-Hizballah alliance appeared to have overcome rebel resistance in Aleppo—a major turning point that would shift the war’s momentum in the alliance’s favor. On the other hand, Arab and other media reported that on Wednesday the Israeli air force struck a Syrian weapons depot west of Damascus and a weapons convoy headed for Hizballah in Lebanon. As of Thursday evening there had been no retaliation against Israel, and Israeli analysts generally saw a retaliation as unlikely. Media outside of Israel have, of course, often reported in the past on Israeli airstrikes—usually against Hizballah-bound weaponry—in Syria. Israel’s policy has been to keep mum, neither denying nor confirming the reports. Last April, though, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel had carried out “dozens” of strikes in Syria against “game-changing weaponry” for Hizballah. It’s no secret that, since the 2006 war between Israel and Hizballah in Lebanon, Hizballah has massively rearmed and now harbors tens of thousands of missiles. But Israel regards some kinds of weapons—precision rockets, advanced antiship and antiaircraft systems—as out of bounds for the terror group. What has changed in the Syrian arena, though, is that late last year Russia deployed its powerful S-400 radar and antiaircraft system there. It covers Syria, Lebanon, and much of Israel and can track Israel’s northern airspace. Since then there have been far fewer reported Israeli airstrikes in Syria. In one of them, last September, the outcome seemed ominous when Syria—not a military match for Israel by itself, but backed by Russia and Iran—fired missiles at two Israeli aircraft. Why, then, the Israeli strike this week? Why no military response this time? One conjecture: the weapons Israel struck in the Syrian depot and in the convoy would have been particularly unacceptable weapons in Hizballah’s hands. Another conjecture: the much-touted Israeli-Russian coordination, whereby Netanyahu and Russian president Vladimir Putin are said to have worked out arrangements to avoid clashes, is still operative. Other possible mitigating factors are that Israel reportedly hit the targets from Lebanese, not Syrian, airspace, and that no Syrian or Hizballah fighters appear to have been killed. The larger question: what happens if Syria’s Assad and his backers have indeed turned the tide and will be looking to keep extending their control over Syrian territory? Of interest here are remarks to the Algemeiner website by Yossi Kuperwasser, who has held major positions in Israel’s Military Intelligence. Kuperwasser, as the site paraphrases it, says that Iran is stepping up the speed at which it is arming its proxies in the region due to its fear that after Donald Trump assumes the US presidency in January, its room to maneuver in Syria will be greatly hampered…. And regarding Israel and Russia, in Kuperwasser’s own words: There is a mutual understanding of each other’s interests. Though Russia and Iran are backing Hezbollah combat rebel forces fighting against the Assad regime, Russia understands that Israel cannot allow weapons from Hezbollah in Syria to be moved to Lebanon, where they will be aimed at the Jewish state. How long can this relatively tolerable—for Israel—situation continue? Indications are that its days may be numbered. Even if Putin’s strategic goals are not identical to those of his allies—he is clearly not a Shiite ideologue like the Iranians and Hizballah or a Shiite-aligned Arab like Assad—his steps have been increasingly brazen. Along with the transfer of major weapon systems to Syria, and an aircraft carrier to its coast, they include major weapons sales to Iran, joint provision with Iran of weapons to Iran’s Houthi proxies in Yemen, and reports of Russian aid to Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq. As Kuperwasser puts it, Israel’s most serious concern is “Iran’s increasing territorial contiguity—crossing Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.” For the incoming Trump administration, stemming this tide should be an urgent priority. Whatever Putin’s real motive, he is helping create a situation of unacceptable danger to Israel and a Middle East bifurcated between Shiite and Sunni blocs—a recipe for ongoing war and explosive instability.

News article:
The recent attention-grabbing exchange of fire between Israel and Islamic State is just one aspect of the Jewish state’s assessment of the current threats at its northern border with Syria. Israeli forces killed four fighters from the Islamic State-affiliated Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade Nov. 27 after the terrorists had fired at Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers in the Golan Heights border region. The exchange drew significant attention because it was the first report of an Islamic State attack on Israel from Syria. Islamic State has previously threatened Israel, but until now the terror group did not appear to open such a front at the Israel-Syria border. Yet despite the numerous news headlines that followed the Islamic State attack, the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade does not have nearly as large of a footprint in the region as Hezbollah or its patron, Iran, which have been increasing their presence in Syria to back President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in that country’s civil war. The IDF estimates that about 120,000 Hezbollah rockets are aimed at Israel. Hezbollah has a full-blown army with around 45,000 members, 21,000 of whom are regularly in service, Haaretz reported in July. By contrast, the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade has between 600 and 1,000 fighters, according to a report in The Economist in January. The report quoted Israeli officers as calling the brigades “Daesh lite,” using an alternative name for Islamic State. Given that Hezbollah’s forces amount to a far greater security threat to Israel, the Islamic State attack may have been no more than an effort by the jihadist group to distract from its losses in Syria and Iraq. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Israeli Deputy Regional Cooperation Minister Ayoub Kara (Likud) told JNS.org that three groups—the al-Qaeda linked Nusra Front, the Western-backed Free Syrian Army, and Islamic State—are struggling for control of the area near Israel’s border. These groups “sometimes fight each other,” Kara said. Three enemies of Israel—the Syrian army, Hezbollah, and Iran—are on the other side of Syria’s civil war, he noted. Besides the rebel group led by Syrian opposition leader Kamal al-Labwani, “all of these groups in the area are against us,” said Kara. “Islamic State is trying to get close to our border to attack in order to gain popularity,” asserted the deputy minister. But he added, “Islamic State, Assad, Hezbollah, and Iran have no interest right now in getting Israel involved.” Syrian rebel leader Labwani told JNS.org that there is “chaos” on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. “We need to create one authority,” said the rebel activist, who has many sources on the ground in the area. Speaking from Sweden, Labwani claimed that Hezbollah could have been behind the Nov. 27 attack rather than Islamic State. Hezbollah is paying rebels to carry out attacks on Israel, he claimed. Israel’s Kara, however, maintained that Islamic State carried out the recent attack. Labwani, who snuck out of Syria in 2012 and who has visited Israel, has supported the implementation of a safe zone that buffers Israel’s border with Syria, though he admits that such a move would need to be approved by the U.S. and/or Russia. Asked how the southern Syrian region is fairing from Israel’s perspective, Labwani responded that the situation is manageable, but that the Jewish state should be more proactive in bringing about the safe zone. Mendi Safadi, an Israeli Druze political activist who has traveled in the region and met with leaders of Syria’s opposition, said the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade was responsible for the Nov. 27 attack and that the brigade is comprised of Syrian Palestinians. “Yarmouk is not a typical Islamic State group, but has taken advantage of the popularity of Islamic State in order to raise funds,” said Safadi, adding that this represents another example of the radicalization of Islamist groups. He added, “Yarmouk’s abilities are limited compared to the core Islamic State [organization], but they presumably will continue operations against Israel unless Israel launches pre-emptive strikes.” Moti Kahana, an American-Israeli businessman and founder of the American Jewish NGO Amaliah, which delivers humanitarian supplies to Syrian civilians, said that because of the humanitarian crisis in the southern province of Quneitra bordering Israel, the Nusra Front and Islamic State have sought to provide aid to win the hearts and minds of the Syrian population. Amaliah is the only organization delivering aid to Syrians from the Golan Heights in coordination with the IDF. Syrian women and children are also being brought into Israel for medical treatment. Kahana said his group is stepping up funding for aid because “if we don’t bring humanitarian supplies to the area, radicals will fill the vacuum.” He worries that if President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration stops U.S. support for Syrian rebels, Islamist-supporting Qatar would step in, emboldening the Islamist nature of the Syrian opposition. Indeed, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Reuters last month that if the U.S. cuts funding for the rebels, Qatar’s support for rebels “is going to continue, we are not going to stop it.” Kahana is a Democrat who explained that for the past four years, he tried to get the Obama administration to implement safe zones in Syria, but got no support. Now, Kahana is optimistic about the Trump administration’s Syria policy because Trump himself has voiced support for safe zones. “The Trump administration does not want Syrians coming to America, but for them to stay in their country,” Kahana told JNS.org. “And the only way to do this is by creating safe zones.”

But he added, “Islamic State, Assad, Hezbollah, and Iran have no interest right now in getting Israel involved.” Syrian rebel leader Labwani told JNS.org that there is “chaos” on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. “We need to create one authority,” said the rebel activist, who has many sources on the ground in the area. Speaking from Sweden, Labwani claimed that Hezbollah could have been behind the Nov. 27 attack rather than Islamic State. Hezbollah is paying rebels to carry out attacks on Israel, he claimed. Israel’s Kara, however, maintained that Islamic State carried out the recent attack. Labwani, who snuck out of Syria in 2012 and who has visited Israel, has supported the implementation of a safe zone that buffers Israel’s border with Syria, though he admits that such a move would need to be approved by the U.S. and/or Russia. Asked how the southern Syrian region is fairing from Israel’s perspective, Labwani responded that the situation is manageable, but that the Jewish state should be more proactive in bringing about the safe zone. Mendi Safadi, an Israeli Druze political activist who has traveled in the region and met with leaders of Syria’s opposition, said the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade was responsible for the Nov. 27 attack and that the brigade is comprised of Syrian Palestinians. “Yarmouk is not a typical Islamic State group, but has taken advantage of the popularity of Islamic State in order to raise funds,” said Safadi, adding that this represents another example of the radicalization of Islamist groups. He added, “Yarmouk’s abilities are limited compared to the core Islamic State [organization], but they presumably will continue operations against Israel unless Israel launches pre-emptive strikes.” Moti Kahana, an American-Israeli businessman and founder of the American Jewish NGO Amaliah, which delivers humanitarian supplies to Syrian civilians, said that because of the humanitarian crisis in the southern province of Quneitra bordering Israel, the Nusra Front and Islamic State have sought to provide aid to win the hearts and minds of the Syrian population. Amaliah is the only organization delivering aid to Syrians from the Golan Heights in coordination with the IDF. Syrian women and children are also being brought into Israel for medical treatment. Kahana said his group is stepping up funding for aid because “if we don’t bring humanitarian supplies to the area, radicals will fill the vacuum.” He worries that if President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration stops U.S. support for Syrian rebels, Islamist-supporting Qatar would step in, emboldening the Islamist nature of the Syrian opposition. Indeed, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Reuters last month that if the U.S. cuts funding for the rebels, Qatar’s support for rebels “is going to continue, we are not going to stop it.” Kahana is a Democrat who explained that for the past four years, he tried to get the Obama administration to implement safe zones in Syria, but got no support. Now, Kahana is optimistic about the Trump administration’s Syria policy because Trump himself has voiced support for safe zones. “The Trump administration does not want Syrians coming to America, but for them to stay in their country,” Kahana told JNS.org. “And the only way to do this is by creating safe zones.”

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — In the event of another war between Hezbollah and Israel, the terror group will know exactly which places to avoid – but finding a spot that will not be targeted by the IDF is likely to be difficult. In a social media post, the IDF published its target map of south Lebanon – specific sites that would be targeted by ground troops or aerial attacks. The map was not “leaked,” but was published on the official IDF social media channel, and has been shown at the U.N. by Israeli U.N. ambassador Danny Danon. The declassified map lists over 10,000 targets that Israel says provide infrastructure, assistance, cover, protection and other resources for Hezbollah terrorists. Among the infrastructure are 85 civilian villages – where location of terror forces, the IDF said, constitutes a war crime on Hezbollah’s part – as well as thousands of underground bunkers, weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, command posts and more. The data is based on intelligence gathered by Israel since the Second Lebanon War, the IDF said. The army’s purpose in publicizing the map is not to show off its knowledge of Hezbollah’s capabilities, but to show how the terror group has embedded itself in the civilian life of south Lebanese villagers and farmers. In recent days, reports said that Israel has stepped up its attacks on weapons shipments from Syria to Lebanon, where Hezbollah takes possession of them. Earlier Wednesday, foreign reports said that a military base in Damascus where weapons are stored was attacked, with Hezbollah accusing Israel of carrying out the attack. Last week, Israeli planes were said to have destroyed a convoy of trucks headed from Damascus to Beirut, also presumably carrying weapons from Syria to Lebanon for the benefit of Hezbollah. The IDF had no comment on either attack.

News article:
Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman acknowledged that Israel was responsible for recent attacks in Syria, saying on Wednesday that they were meant to prevent “advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction” from reaching Hezbollah. Speaking to ambassadors from the European Union, Liberman did not specify what incident or incidents he was referring to, speaking only about “what was done in Syria,” according to a statement from his office. “We are working, first and foremost, to defend the safety of our citizens and to protect our sovereignty, and we are trying to prevent the smuggling of advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah,” he said. His office refused to expand on what weapons of mass destruction Hezbollah may have been trying to acquire. In the past, however, Israeli officials, including former defense minister Moshe Ya’alon, have expressed concerns that the terrorist group may specifically receive chemical weapons from the Syrian regime. During the meeting with EU officials, the defense minister also laid out his view for how Israel would like to see the Syrian civil war resolved and his skepticism at the prospects of a peace deal with the Palestinians in the near future. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms One EU ambassador told The Times of Israel that a “good, constructive conversation” had been held with Liberman, but expressed “deep concern” over the so-called regulation bill, which would legalize some Israeli settlements built on private Palestinian land. “They entire world is watching” what Israel is doing with this bill, the ambassador said, requesting anonymity. On Wednesday morning, a bombing near a Damascus military airport was blamed on Israel. Advertisement “At 3:00 a.m., the Israeli enemy fired several surface-to-surface missiles from inside occupied territory,” the Syrian state news agency SANA said, citing a military source. The report said the Israeli missiles caused a large fire but no injuries or deaths. Last week, Israeli planes also reportedly struck both a weapons site near the Syrian capital and a Hezbollah convoy, causing some large explosions but also no casualties. Israel generally does not officially admit to carrying out attacks deep inside Syria, though it has publicly maintained it will not allow advanced weapons to be transferred to Hezbollah. In his remarks, the defense minister insisted that Israel is not interested in getting involved in the Syrian civil war, but will work to defend itself. Regarding an eventual resolution to the civil war, which has been raging since 2011 and has caused the deaths of the hundreds of thousands of people, Liberman said he would be amenable to any peace deal — so long as it does not include Iran and Syrian President Bashar Assad. “When I am asked, time after time, what a possible future agreement with Syria will be like, I say that my position is that regardless of what agreement will be in Syria — the Iranians and [Syrian President Bashar] Assad have to be out of Syria and not be a part of any deal,” Liberman said. Advertisement The defense minister also dismissed the possibility of a peace agreement with the Palestinians anytime soon, calling it “unrealistic and impossible” for one to be reached at the point in time. “The notion of a permanent solution will have to be postponed for at least a few years, and in the meantime, we need to ensure normal lives in Judea and Samaria for both Jews and Palestinians,” Liberman said, using the biblical term for the West Bank. The defense minister scolded European leaders in general for considering Israeli settlements to be “the biggest problem in the world,” pointing to deadlier conflicts around the world. “At least five hundred people are killed each day in the Middle East, from South Sudan to Iraq, which is much more serious and important than what is happening in Amona, but this is something you don’t see in the European press,” he said. Addressing the EU ambassadors directly, he said: “The fact that you are always talking about the settlements is hypocritical. I’m waiting for you to start talking about North Korea and the Iranians’ ballistic missiles.”

News article:
Israel is working hard to keep chemical weapons out of the hands of the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman told a Knesset committee Thursday. Israel does not usually acknowledge foreign military actions, but Liberman told European diplomats Wednesday—the same day that the Mazzeh military airport near Damascus was reportedly hit by surface-to-surface missiles, and a week after two strikes elsewhere in Syria—that that his country was taking action to keep Hezbollah from acquiring “advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction.” His latest comments to the Knesset seemed to suggest that at least one of the strikes was in order to stop Hezbollah from acquiring chemical weapons. “Our policies and our positions are very clear and are based on three red lines: We won’t allow any harm to the citizens of the State of Israel, we won’t allow any harm to the sovereignty of the State of Israel, and we will not allow the smuggling of high-quality advanced weapons and chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah,” Liberman told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Liberman added that Israel has no interest in immersing itself in Syria’s civil war, but the country would enforce its “red lines” as necessary “without considerations for any other circumstances or limitations.” Israeli leaders have made it clear in public statements and conversations with foreign leaders that they will act to prevent Hezbollah from acquiring “game-changing” weapons or strengthening its positions on Israel’s borders. Hezbollah reportedly has an arsenal of 130,000 rockets, more than the combined total of all 27 non-U.S. NATO member states. According to a July report published by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Israeli officials believe that any future war with Hezbollah has the potential to cause “thousands of civilian deaths” in Israel. Hezbollah has, among other things, threatened to attack ammonium tanks in Haifa, which could kill tens of thousands of people. The think tank’s vice president for research, Jonathan Schanzer, explained that Hezbollah’s widely-reported tactic of hiding military assets in civilian areas would also lead to mass casualties. Reports emerged two years ago that Hezbollah was offering reduced-price housing to Shi’ite families who allowed the terrorist group to store rocket launchers in their homes. An Israeli defense official told The New York Times in May 2015 that the buildup of Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure in southern Lebanese villages meant that “civilians are living in a military compound” and that their lives were at risk. A few days later, a newspaper linked to Hezbollah bolstered the Israeli assessment.

News article:
Israel is working hard to keep chemical weapons out of the hands of the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman told a Knesset committee Thursday. Israel does not usually acknowledge foreign military actions, but Liberman told European diplomats Wednesday—the same day that the Mazzeh military airport near Damascus was reportedly hit by surface-to-surface missiles, and a week after two strikes elsewhere in Syria—that that his country was taking action to keep Hezbollah from acquiring “advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction.” His latest comments to the Knesset seemed to suggest that at least one of the strikes was in order to stop Hezbollah from acquiring chemical weapons. “Our policies and our positions are very clear and are based on three red lines: We won’t allow any harm to the citizens of the State of Israel, we won’t allow any harm to the sovereignty of the State of Israel, and we will not allow the smuggling of high-quality advanced weapons and chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah,” Liberman told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Liberman added that Israel has no interest in immersing itself in Syria’s civil war, but the country would enforce its “red lines” as necessary “without considerations for any other circumstances or limitations.” Israeli leaders have made it clear in public statements and conversations with foreign leaders that they will act to prevent Hezbollah from acquiring “game-changing” weapons or strengthening its positions on Israel’s borders. Hezbollah reportedly has an arsenal of 130,000 rockets, more than the combined total of all 27 non-U.S. NATO member states. According to a July report published by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Israeli officials believe that any future war with Hezbollah has the potential to cause “thousands of civilian deaths” in Israel. Hezbollah has, among other things, threatened to attack ammonium tanks in Haifa, which could kill tens of thousands of people. The think tank’s vice president for research, Jonathan Schanzer, explained that Hezbollah’s widely-reported tactic of hiding military assets in civilian areas would also lead to mass casualties. Reports emerged two years ago that Hezbollah was offering reduced-price housing to Shi’ite families who allowed the terrorist group to store rocket launchers in their homes. An Israeli defense official told The New York Times in May 2015 that the buildup of Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure in southern Lebanese villages meant that “civilians are living in a military compound” and that their lives were at risk. A few days later, a newspaper linked to Hezbollah bolstered the Israeli assessment. Earlier this week, the IDF declassified a map showing that Hezbollah had hidden thousands of military assets in civilian areas in Lebanese areas bordering northern Israel.

News article:
Israel’s defense minister has broken Tel Aviv’s secrecy over its policy on Syria, stating it is working to prevent weapons of mass destruction from reaching Hezbollah. It came hours after a rocket attack on a Damascus air base was blamed on Israel. Speaking to ambassadors from the European Union on Wednesday, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said that Israel is “working, first and foremost, to defend the safety of our citizens and to protect our sovereignty, and we are trying to prevent the smuggling of advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah,” The Times of Israel reported. The defense minister’s office refused to elaborate on the type of weapons of mass destruction Hezbollah may be trying to obtain. Liberman went on to reiterate that Israel is not interested in getting involved in the Syrian civil war, but will work to defend itself. The defense minister’s comments followed a Wednesday attack on an airbase in Damascus, Syria, which was blamed on Israel. Although that attack has not been confirmed or denied by Tel Aviv, Liberman did speak of “what was done in Syria” when referring to efforts to protect the citizens of Israel, according to a statement from his office. Last week, Israel was also accused of striking a weapons site near Damascus and a Hezbollah convoy, causing large explosions, but no casualties. Israel does not usually admit to carrying out attacks deep inside Syria, although it has publicly maintained that it will not allow advanced weapons to be transferred to Hezbollah. Speaking of the possibility of an end to Syria’s civil war which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions, Liberman said: “When I am asked, time after time, what a possible future agreement with Syria will be like, I say that my position is that regardless of what agreement will be in Syria — the Iranians and [Syrian President Bashar] Assad have to be out of Syria and not be a part of any deal.” Liberman also took the opportunity to scold European leaders for their claims that Israeli settlements are the “biggest problem in the world,” citing deadlier world conflicts. “At least five hundred people are killed each day in the Middle East, from South Sudan to Iraq, which is much more serious and important than what is happening in Amona, but this is something you don’t see in the European press… I’m waiting for you to start talking about North Korea and the Iranians’ ballistic missiles," he said, dismissing the possibility of a peace agreement with the Palestinians anytime soon.

News article:
Despite almost six years of war between his army and rebels backed by the West and Gulf countries, Syrian President Bashar Assad said he still considers Israel the one and only “enemy” state, in an interview published Thursday. The statement came in an apparent attempt to extend an olive branch to citizens of Gulf countries, as his regime neared a victory in Aleppo seen as possibly decisive in stamping out the insurgency that has left Syria in tatters. Much of the interview, with Syrian daily Al-Watan, was devoted to Assad’s recent success in the battle over Aleppo, with the defiant leader dismissing calls for a ceasefire in what was once the country’s largest city. But the Syrian president was also asked whether the shifting sands in the Middle East, partially blown by the winds of the Syrian civil war, had caused any other country to attain the level of enmity Damascus felt toward the Jewish state. “Before the war, it was known to us that Syria had but a single enemy—Israel… After six years of war in Syria, is it possible that Syria has some new official enemies?” Assad was asked. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Syrian president responded by saying only a state that is “occupying your land” can be considered an enemy state, and that having a “hostile policy” isn’t enough to earn the title. He brought up France, the former colonial power in Syria, as an example of a country no longer considered an enemy. “Whereas Israel occupies Syrian territory, so the issue is different,” said Assad. Advertisement Israel seized 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) of the Golan Heights from Syria during the Six Day War of 1967, then effectively annexed it in 1981. Syria, and much of the West, considers the Israeli Golan Heights occupied Syrian territory and Syria has pushed for its return. On the other hand, Assad said he didn’t blame residents of Gulf countries for their governments’ support of the rebels. “The story is the same with the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have taken very hostile positions and have historically been one of the reasons for Israel’s continued existence and superiority in the region,” Assad said. “This does not make the people of Saudi Arabia or Qatar or any other country an enemy people. Therefore, I say that officials in these [Gulf] countries may have put themselves in the enemies box, but not the state or the people.” “As for Israel, it remains the enemy,” Assad said. Both Saudi Arabia and Qatar are well-known financial backers of rebel groups currently fighting Assad’s army in Syria. Both countries have called for Assad to step down from power. In the past eight days, Syria has twice claimed Israel carried out strikes against its military positions.

A map of southern Lebanon released this week by the Israeli military that ostensibly showed Hezbollah positions, infrastructure and armaments along a section of the Israeli border was a fabrication, the army admitted Thursday. The map, tweeted by the army Tuesday, appeared to feature over 200 towns and villages, which the IDF said the organization had turned into its operations bases, along with over 10,000 potential targets for Israeli strikes in the event of a new war with the terror group. “This is a war crime,” the army asserted in its tweet. A caption on the photo claimed that it had been “declassified,” in what was construed as an IDF attempt to build a case for future military action, and a warning to the terror group itself, demonstrating Israel’s superior intelligence-gathering capabilities. But on Thursday, based on an analysis by Twitter user JudgeDan48, it emerged that the map had in fact been prepared by the IDF spokesperson’s desk.

Israel is working to keep chemical weapons out of Hezbollah’s hands, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said Thursday, clarifying comments a day earlier that hinted the terror group was attempting to obtain mass-casualty arms. In a conversation with the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Liberman again seemed to confirm that Israeli forces had been behind two recent strikes inside Syria that had been blamed on the Jewish State. The defense minister again insisted that Israel has “absolutely no interest” in getting involved in the Syrian civil war, but will work to defend itself. “Our policies and our positions are very clear and are based on three red lines: We won’t allow any harm to the citizens of the State of Israel, we won’t allow any harm to the sovereignty of the State of Israel and we will not allow the smuggling of high-quality advanced weapons and chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah,” Liberman said.

These once regular airstrikes on Hezbollah convoys and Syrian weapons depots have slowed in recent months, with many claiming that Russia’s deployment of the long-range, advanced S-400 missile defense system in western Syria has deterred Israel from carrying out airstrikes in Syria and curbed Israel’s once unquestioned air superiority in the region. Advertisement Israeli security officials, including former defense minister Moshe Ya’alon, have dismissed such claims, but few believe that the S-400 has had no effect on Israel’s operations. A senior air force official, speaking to reporters last month, noted that the Russians’ deployment in Syria represented a “challenge” to the Israeli military, but said the country still operated as needed in the region.

Israel is working to keep chemical weapons out of Hezbollah’s hands, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said Thursday, clarifying comments a day earlier that hinted the terror group was attempting to obtain mass-casualty arms.

Israel “does what is necessary” to prevent game-changing weapons from falling into the Hezbollah terror group’s hands, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman told the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. “Israel has no interest in intervening in the civil war in Syria. Our policies and positions are very clear, and they are based on three red lines: We will not allow any harm to come to the Israeli public, we will not allow anyone to undermine Israel’s sovereignty, and we will not allow the smuggling of sophisticated weapons or chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon and to Hezbollah,” Lieberman said Thursday. Thursday’s statement echoed similar remarks Lieberman made in a meeting Wednesday with European Union ambassadors in Jerusalem. “Israel does what is necessary first and foremost to maintain public security and defend our sovereignty, as we try to prevent the smuggling for sophisticated weapons, military equipment, and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah,” he said. Lieberman’s comments were widely construed as responding indirectly to Arab media reports suggesting that Israeli fighter jets struck the Mezzeh Military Airport near Damascus. Several Arabic-language outlets, including Qatar’s Al Jazeera and Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya, reported of a series of large explosions at the airport, which caused a raging fire. The Syrian government denied an attack had taken place, saying only that a fire had broken out at the airport over a “technical malfunction,” whose nature was not specified.

Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said Tuesday that he had asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to officially request an emergency United Nations Security Council session on the worsening humanitarian situation in Syria, asserting that, “as Jews, we cannot ignore these atrocities.” Deri, chair of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, said that the history of the Jewish people demanded Israel do what it can to the prevent the “massacre” of innocent civilians. “Six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust and the world was silent. As Jews, we cannot ignore these atrocities that have been taking place for nearly six years in Syria,” he said in a statement. More than 300,000 people have been killed in Syria and millions more have fled their homes in nearly six years of civil war between government forces and a collection of rebel and Islamist groups. On Tuesday, government troops poised for the final sweep to take the last rebel holdouts in eastern Aleppo as the international community and aid agencies appealed for the lives of thousands of civilians who have “nowhere safe to run” to be spared and for those fighting to capture the rebel enclave to refrain from atrocities. The UN said that pro-regime forces had executed 82 civilians in the city. “The increasing massacre in Aleppo and the murder of babies, children, women and the elderly obligates us as Jews — a people that has known the horrors of the Holocaust and unbearable massacres — to raise our voices and cry out,” Deri said, adding that he had asked Netanyahu to turn to the UN. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment on whether Netanyahu planned to ask for a UN Security Council session. While several officials have spoken out about the humanitarian situation in Syria, Israel has largely kept out of the international debate over the plight of the victims, focusing instead on the security threat posed by fighting on its borders. Since March 2011, when the Syrian conflict began, dozens of mortar shells have landed in Israeli territory as a result of accidental spillover from the fighting. The IDF often responds to fire that crosses into Israel by striking Syrian army posts. Jerusalem says it maintains a policy of holding Damascus responsible for all fire from Syria into Israel regardless of the source. Advertisement In February, after a now-broken ceasefire was announced, Netanyahu said that while Israel was glad about the prospect of an end to hostilities, any long-term solution had to provide security for the Jewish state as well. “We welcome the efforts to attain a stable, long-term and real ceasefire in Syria. Anything that stops the terrible carnage there is important, first and foremost from a humane standpoint,” he told the cabinet. “But at the same time, it’s important that one thing remains clear: Any arrangement in Syria must include ending Iranian aggression against Israel from Syrian territory.” In September 2015, as hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees began to arrive in Europe, a brief public debate ensued in Israel over its own responsibility toward Syrian refugees. Netanyahu rejected the possibility of Israel taking in refugees, saying that while the Jewish state was not unsympathetic to the suffering of citizens across its border — Israel has treated hundreds of injured Syrians who have arrived on the northern border — it did not have the capacity to absorb masses of people. Opposition leader Isaac Herzog hit back at Netanyahu’s claims that Israel could not take in refugees, accusing the prime minister of ignoring basic Jewish ethical concerns. As interior minister, Deri is responsible for asylum requests but has not said he would support taking in Syrian refugees. A spokesperson for the minister did not immediately respond to a question from The Times of Israel as to whether his call for a Security Council debate indicated a willingness to consider taking in Syrian refugees. Advertisement Deri has repeatedly called for tougher measures against an influx of illegal immigrants from Africa, many of whom claim to be fleeing oppression in Sudan and Eritrea. Eritrean nationals submitted 7,218 requests for asylum to Israeli authorities between 2009 and the beginning of July 2016, of which only eight were approved, with 3,105 still waiting for a response and the rest either rejected or withdrawn, according to Interior Ministry figures. On Monday Deri tweeted a report by the Haaretz daily that 12,000 Sudanese and Eritrean illegal immigrants had left Israel of their own accord in the past three years. Alongside the article Deri proudly claimed, “We are continuing to take care of the residents of the underprivileged communities,” a reference to Israelis from neighborhoods that have complained about an influx of African immigrants.

Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment on whether Netanyahu planned to ask for a UN Security Council session. While several officials have spoken out about the humanitarian situation in Syria, Israel has largely kept out of the international debate over the plight of the victims, focusing instead on the security threat posed by fighting on its borders. Since March 2011, when the Syrian conflict began, dozens of mortar shells have landed in Israeli territory as a result of accidental spillover from the fighting. The IDF often responds to fire that crosses into Israel by striking Syrian army posts. Jerusalem says it maintains a policy of holding Damascus responsible for all fire from Syria into Israel regardless of the source. Advertisement In February, after a now-broken ceasefire was announced, Netanyahu said that while Israel was glad about the prospect of an end to hostilities, any long-term solution had to provide security for the Jewish state as well. “We welcome the efforts to attain a stable, long-term and real ceasefire in Syria. Anything that stops the terrible carnage there is important, first and foremost from a humane standpoint,” he told the cabinet. “But at the same time, it’s important that one thing remains clear: Any arrangement in Syria must include ending Iranian aggression against Israel from Syrian territory.” In September 2015, as hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees began to arrive in Europe, a brief public debate ensued in Israel over its own responsibility toward Syrian refugees. Netanyahu rejected the possibility of Israel taking in refugees, saying that while the Jewish state was not unsympathetic to the suffering of citizens across its border — Israel has treated hundreds of injured Syrians who have arrived on the northern border — it did not have the capacity to absorb masses of people. Opposition leader Isaac Herzog hit back at Netanyahu’s claims that Israel could not take in refugees, accusing the prime minister of ignoring basic Jewish ethical concerns. As interior minister, Deri is responsible for asylum requests but has not said he would support taking in Syrian refugees. A spokesperson for the minister did not immediately respond to a question from The Times of Israel as to whether his call for a Security Council debate indicated a willingness to consider taking in Syrian refugees. Advertisement Deri has repeatedly called for tougher measures against an influx of illegal immigrants from Africa, many of whom claim to be fleeing oppression in Sudan and Eritrea. Eritrean nationals submitted 7,218 requests for asylum to Israeli authorities between 2009 and the beginning of July 2016, of which only eight were approved, with 3,105 still waiting for a response and the rest either rejected or withdrawn, according to Interior Ministry figures. On Monday Deri tweeted a report by the Haaretz daily that 12,000 Sudanese and Eritrean illegal immigrants had left Israel of their own accord in the past three years. Alongside the article Deri proudly claimed, “We are continuing to take care of the residents of the underprivileged communities,” a reference to Israelis from neighborhoods that have complained about an influx of African immigrants.

News article:
The fall of Aleppo to Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran has heightened alarm in Israel about potential threats to its borders and a wider reshaping of the region. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left no doubt on Wednesday about the depth of Israel's concern about Tehran, whose position and that of its proxies in Syria has been strengthened by the crushing of rebel resistance in Aleppo. At a meeting in Astana with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev , Netanyahu was asked whether he had a message for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is scheduled to visit Kazakhstan next week. "Don't threaten us. We are not a rabbit, we are a tiger," the Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling Nazarbayev. "If you threaten us, you endanger yourself." Destruction in Aleppo (Photo: EPA) Asked by Nazarbayev if he seriously believed Iran wanted to destroy Israel, Netanyahu replied: "Yes, I do." The more than five-year-old civil war in Syria has enabled Iran, whose Supreme leader has called for an end to the Jewish state, to steadily increase its influence across the region. Whether via its own Revolutionary Guard forces or Shi'ite Muslim proxies, especially Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, Tehran's reach extends from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean Sea. As well as concerns about an increased flow of arms now that Iran has access to a port on the Mediterranean at Tartus, on the southern Syrian coast, Israel worries Hezbollah, emboldened by Iran's patronage, may launch new attacks on its territory. There have been isolated border incidents in recent months, and Israel and Hezbollah fought a war in 2006. While Hezbollah's ranks have suffered in the fighting in Syria—Israeli officials estimate 1,700 fighters have been killed and 7,000 wounded—the group has restocked its weaponry and retains an arsenal of at least 100,000 rockets, Israeli and independent analysts say. Hezbollah armored vehicles In recent weeks, unclaimed airstrikes have targeted southern Syria and near Damascus. Syria has pointed the finger at Israel, which has made no comment. But Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week Israel was working "to prevent the smuggling of sophisticated weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah." Wary of Iran Avi Dichter, the chair of Israel's foreign affairs and defence committee and the former head of the Shin Bet intelligence agency, said Iran had tried several times in the past to move forces into the Syrian Golan Heights, next to territory that Israel captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. Those moves were repelled, Dichter told Reuters. But he said that, with Iran flush with cash and confidence after last year's agreement restricting Iran's nuclear program, it was possible further attempts would be made to test Israel's responses. "Iran has a strategic plan," he said. "It might bring Iranian troops closer to Israel, either Revolutionary Guards, who are pure Iranians, or others, like Hezbollah or the Basij militia, which might be a very good cover for them." Avi Dichter (Photo: Motti Kimchi) Beyond the threat from Iran and its proxies, Dichter has warned that Israel, widely thought to be the only nuclear capable state in the Middle East despite maintaining a policy of ambiguity, must not put too much confidence in Russia. The Israeli government sees Moscow as an ally but Dichter says it could shift position if its interests are threatened. Dichter believes Russia has long-term aspirations in the Middle East which could bring fundamental changes to the borders of the region, depending largely on how incoming US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin interact. "Those two leaders might not just think but act in order to create what we call a new Middle East," Dichter said. He called Russia the "supreme decider" in Syria but made clear the immediate concerns were Iran and Hezbollah. "We have no intention to allow Hezbollah to test their sophisticated weapons because there are no other targets in the Middle East except Israel when Hezbollah and Iran think about an offensive initiative," said Dichter. "By all means Israel is going to stop it, never mind whether by alerts or activities or any other tools."

News article:
In the city of Aleppo, humanity is dying, as the UN envoy to Syria said with chilling precision. Dozens of people have been killed since a cease-fire was announced Tuesday; the truce collapsed within less than a day. Thousands of civilians are trapped in their homes, which continue to be bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. Iranian and Syrian militias are murdering civilians in their homes indiscriminately, and the buses that were supposed to rescue residents from this hell can’t approach the city. The panicked cries for help that the people sent via cellphones are gradually fading, and fear for their fate has prompted denunciations around the world. Yet not a single significant action has been taken to rescue them. The international community, which includes both Western and Arab states, is watching this horror show with fury but can’t muster the fortitude for any action against the joint evil of the Russian and Syrian regimes. Open gallery view A 3-D image of Warsaw, in January, 1945. As in other parts of the world where massacres have occurred and still are occurring, diplomatic logic has overcome the human impulse. Sending troops into Syria would mean a violent conflict with Russia, and perhaps also with Iran, while bombing Syrian air force bases could invite retaliation against the West’s strategic bases. Nobody wants to get dragged into World War III because of an Arab city. No government wants to sacrifice its own citizens for a goal that isn’t found in its strategic target bank. After all, the war in Aleppo isn’t against the Islamic State. But for the international community, and no less for Israel, there are other options. A diplomatic war against Russia, similar to that imposed after its war in Ukraine, could be of use. And on this issue, Israel too could make a contribution. The country that mobilized the world against Iran is also capable of rousing world opinion and putting pressure on global leaders. And yes, this is the moment to mention the Holocaust. Israel can and must encourage the international Jewish community, especially in America, to wield its power. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can also utilize his close relationship with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Israel should also offer to absorb thousands of Syrian refugees and participate in an international effort to help the Syrians under siege. The same Israel that is suffocating Eritrean and Sudanese refugees must now change direction, for the sake of its own history. At the very least, the prime minister must personally appeal to the world and add Israel to the long list of those who view Russia and Syria as war criminals.

News article:
Israeli tanks, bulldozers and armored personnel carriers knocked down a fence and barreled over the Lebanese border Saturday as forces seized a village from the Hezbollah guerrilla group. The soldiers battled militants throughout the day and raided the large village of Maroun al-Ras in several waves before finally taking control, military officials said. Tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing north packed into the port of Sidon to escape the fighting as the United Nations warned of a growing humanitarian "disaster." Click here for full Mideast coverage. Early Sunday, warplanes for the first time hit inside the port city of Sidon, currently swollen with refugees, destroying a religious complex that the Israeli military said was used by Hezbollah. Hospital officials said four people were wounded. A series of large explosions reverberated through Beirut in the early hours Sunday as Israeli aircraft again pounded Hezbollah's stronghold in the south. Warplanes also hit targets in eastern Bekaa Valley, firing missiles in the cities of Hermel and Baalbek, witnesses said. There was no immediate word on casualties in either strike. CountryWatch: Israel The growing use of ground forces, 11 days into the fighting, signaled Israeli recognition that airstrikes alone were not enough to force Hezbollah out of southern Lebanon. But a ground offensive carries greater risks to Israel, which already has lost 18 soldiers in the recent fighting. It also threatens to exacerbate already trying conditions for Lebanese civilians in the area. Israeli military officials have said they want to push Hezbollah beyond the Litani River, about 20 miles north of the border, with the Lebanese army deploying in the border zone. An Israeli radio station that broadcasts to southern Lebanon warned residents of 13 villages to flee north by Saturday afternoon. The villages form a corridor about 4 miles wide and 11 miles deep. With Lebanese fearing an escalation in the battle, international officials worked to end the conflict. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was set to arrive in the Middle East on Sunday, though she ruled out a quick cease-fire as a "false promise." (Full story) President Bush said his administration's diplomatic efforts would focus on finding a strategy for confronting Hezbollah and its Syrian and Iranian backers. "Secretary Rice will make it clear that resolving the crisis demands confronting the terrorist group that launched the attacks and the nations that support it," Bush said in his weekly radio address. CountryWatch: Lebanon Italy, which has been trying to mediate an end to the fighting, said it would hold a conference Wednesday to work out the basis for a truce agreement. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed a beefed-up U.N. force along the Lebanese border, but Israel has called for the Lebanese army to take control of the area. Annan said the conflict had displaced at least 700,000 Lebanese so far, and Israel's destruction of bridges and roads has made access to them difficult. "I'm afraid of a major humanitarian disaster," he told CNN. U.N. humanitarian chief Jan Egeland said it would take more than $100 million to help the displaced. He said he would make an appeal "urging, begging" the international community for contributions. As part of an effort to avert such a crisis, Israel eased its blockade of Lebanon's ports to allow the first shiploads of aid to arrive. It remained unclear how that aid would get to the isolated towns and villages where the fighting has been centered. (Full story) Israel has attacked mostly with airstrikes, but small units have crossed the border in recent days and fought with Hezbollah fighters. A far larger force of about 2,000 troops entered the area Saturday trying to root out Hezbollah bunkers and destroy hidden rocket launchers. The troops, backed by tanks and armored vehicles, raced past a U.N. outpost and headed into Maroun al-Ras. Gunfire could be heard coming from the village, and artillery batteries in Israel also fired into the area. "The forces have completed, more or less, their control of the area of the village, Maroun al-Ras, and made lots of hits against terrorists," said Maj. Gen. Benny Gantz, chief of Israel's ground forces. "It was a difficult fight that continued for not a short time." Dozens of Hezbollah fighters were injured or killed in the battle, Gantz said. Hezbollah said two of its fighters were killed Saturday, bringing the total number of acknowledged Hezbollah fighters killed to eight. Israel accuses the group of vastly underreporting its casualties. The village was strategically important because it overlooked an area where Hezbollah had command posts, Gantz said. The forces seized a cache of weapons and rockets in a village mosque, he added. The village is believed to be a launching point for the rocket attacks on northern Israel. At one point, a half-ton bomb was dropped on a Hezbollah outpost, about 500 yards from the border and near the village. Other positions were bombarded by Israeli gunboats off the coast. About 32 residents took refuge at the U.N. observers post. Nearly the entire remaining population of the village — which numbered about 2,300 before the crisis broke out — were believed to have fled, Lebanese security officials said. Some of the invading forces returned to Israel during the day. U.N. peacekeepers and witnesses said Israel also briefly held the nearby village of Marwaheen before pulling back. About 35,000 fleeing Lebanese filled Sidon as they searched for a place to stay or a way to get farther north. "I'm afraid a disaster is going to happen with all these refugees. There's no aid, not from other nations, not from Lebanon," Mayor Abdul-Rahman al-Bizri said. More than 200,000 Lebanese fled to Syria, according to the Syrian Red Crescent. A steady stream of foreign nationals boarded ships and planes Saturday to take them away. U.S. officials said more than 7,500 Americans had been evacuated from Lebanon by Saturday night. "Everybody's crying and kissing and wishing you well, and you have to turn and leave. We have the chance to get out, but they don't," said Susan Abu Hamdan, 44, of Northville, Mich., who was visiting her siblings in Beirut. The Israeli army said it wanted to completely destroy all Hezbollah infrastructure in an area between a half-mile and two miles from the border, but it had no intention of going deeper into Lebanon. "We really want to knock out Hezbollah in this area," said Capt. Jacob Dallal, an army spokesman. "We want to wipe them out, and we don't intend for them to ever be there again." A senior Israeli military official confirmed that Israel did not plan to reoccupy southern Lebanon as it did in 1982-2000 to create a buffer zone to protect northern Israel. Israel's current offensive began July 12 when Hezbollah guerrillas captured two Israeli soldiers and killed three others in a cross-border raid. Israeli airstrikes on Saturday blasted communications and television transmission towers in the central and northern Lebanese mountains, knocking the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. off the air and killing one person at the station. The death toll in Lebanon rose to at least 372, Lebanese authorities said. Over the past 11 days, Hezbollah has launched nearly 1,000 rockets into Israel, killing 15 civilians and sending hundreds of thousands of others fleeing into bunkers. At least 132 rockets landed in Israel on Saturday, wounding 20 people, three seriously, rescue officials said. A total of 19 Israeli troops have been killed in the fighting so far. Hezbollah also fired at the army base of Nurit in Israel, wounding one soldier, the army said. Israel's call for Lebanese to leave much of the area south of the Litani River caused many to fear that a far deeper Israeli ground incursion was being planned, an offensive that would almost certainly lead to far higher casualties. More than 400,000 people live south of the Litani. Though tens of thousands have left, many are believed still there, trapped by the damaged roads or by fear of being caught in an airstrike.

News article:
Israeli tanks, bulldozers and armored personnel carriers knocked down a fence and barreled over the Lebanese border Saturday as forces seized a village from the Hezbollah guerrilla group. The soldiers battled militants throughout the day and raided the large village of Maroun al-Ras in several waves before finally taking control, military officials said. Tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing north packed into the port of Sidon to escape the fighting as the United Nations warned of a growing humanitarian "disaster." Click here for full Mideast coverage. Early Sunday, warplanes for the first time hit inside the port city of Sidon, currently swollen with refugees, destroying a religious complex that the Israeli military said was used by Hezbollah. Hospital officials said four people were wounded. A series of large explosions reverberated through Beirut in the early hours Sunday as Israeli aircraft again pounded Hezbollah's stronghold in the south. Warplanes also hit targets in eastern Bekaa Valley, firing missiles in the cities of Hermel and Baalbek, witnesses said. There was no immediate word on casualties in either strike. CountryWatch: Israel The growing use of ground forces, 11 days into the fighting, signaled Israeli recognition that airstrikes alone were not enough to force Hezbollah out of southern Lebanon. But a ground offensive carries greater risks to Israel, which already has lost 18 soldiers in the recent fighting. It also threatens to exacerbate already trying conditions for Lebanese civilians in the area. Israeli military officials have said they want to push Hezbollah beyond the Litani River, about 20 miles north of the border, with the Lebanese army deploying in the border zone. An Israeli radio station that broadcasts to southern Lebanon warned residents of 13 villages to flee north by Saturday afternoon. The villages form a corridor about 4 miles wide and 11 miles deep. With Lebanese fearing an escalation in the battle, international officials worked to end the conflict. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was set to arrive in the Middle East on Sunday, though she ruled out a quick cease-fire as a "false promise." (Full story) President Bush said his administration's diplomatic efforts would focus on finding a strategy for confronting Hezbollah and its Syrian and Iranian backers. "Secretary Rice will make it clear that resolving the crisis demands confronting the terrorist group that launched the attacks and the nations that support it," Bush said in his weekly radio address. CountryWatch: Lebanon Italy, which has been trying to mediate an end to the fighting, said it would hold a conference Wednesday to work out the basis for a truce agreement. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed a beefed-up U.N. force along the Lebanese border, but Israel has called for the Lebanese army to take control of the area. Annan said the conflict had displaced at least 700,000 Lebanese so far, and Israel's destruction of bridges and roads has made access to them difficult. "I'm afraid of a major humanitarian disaster," he told CNN. U.N. humanitarian chief Jan Egeland said it would take more than $100 million to help the displaced. He said he would make an appeal "urging, begging" the international community for contributions. As part of an effort to avert such a crisis, Israel eased its blockade of Lebanon's ports to allow the first shiploads of aid to arrive. It remained unclear how that aid would get to the isolated towns and villages where the fighting has been centered. (Full story) Israel has attacked mostly with airstrikes, but small units have crossed the border in recent days and fought with Hezbollah fighters. A far larger force of about 2,000 troops entered the area Saturday trying to root out Hezbollah bunkers and destroy hidden rocket launchers. The troops, backed by tanks and armored vehicles, raced past a U.N. outpost and headed into Maroun al-Ras. Gunfire could be heard coming from the village, and artillery batteries in Israel also fired into the area. "The forces have completed, more or less, their control of the area of the village, Maroun al-Ras, and made lots of hits against terrorists," said Maj. Gen. Benny Gantz, chief of Israel's ground forces. "It was a difficult fight that continued for not a short time." Dozens of Hezbollah fighters were injured or killed in the battle, Gantz said. Hezbollah said two of its fighters were killed Saturday, bringing the total number of acknowledged Hezbollah fighters killed to eight. Israel accuses the group of vastly underreporting its casualties. The village was strategically important because it overlooked an area where Hezbollah had command posts, Gantz said. The forces seized a cache of weapons and rockets in a village mosque, he added. The village is believed to be a launching point for the rocket attacks on northern Israel. At one point, a half-ton bomb was dropped on a Hezbollah outpost, about 500 yards from the border and near the village. Other positions were bombarded by Israeli gunboats off the coast. About 32 residents took refuge at the U.N. observers post. Nearly the entire remaining population of the village — which numbered about 2,300 before the crisis broke out — were believed to have fled, Lebanese security officials said. Some of the invading forces returned to Israel during the day. U.N. peacekeepers and witnesses said Israel also briefly held the nearby village of Marwaheen before pulling back. About 35,000 fleeing Lebanese filled Sidon as they searched for a place to stay or a way to get farther north. "I'm afraid a disaster is going to happen with all these refugees. There's no aid, not from other nations, not from Lebanon," Mayor Abdul-Rahman al-Bizri said. More than 200,000 Lebanese fled to Syria, according to the Syrian Red Crescent. A steady stream of foreign nationals boarded ships and planes Saturday to take them away. U.S. officials said more than 7,500 Americans had been evacuated from Lebanon by Saturday night. "Everybody's crying and kissing and wishing you well, and you have to turn and leave. We have the chance to get out, but they don't," said Susan Abu Hamdan, 44, of Northville, Mich., who was visiting her siblings in Beirut. The Israeli army said it wanted to completely destroy all Hezbollah infrastructure in an area between a half-mile and two miles from the border, but it had no intention of going deeper into Lebanon. "We really want to knock out Hezbollah in this area," said Capt. Jacob Dallal, an army spokesman. "We want to wipe them out, and we don't intend for them to ever be there again." A senior Israeli military official confirmed that Israel did not plan to reoccupy southern Lebanon as it did in 1982-2000 to create a buffer zone to protect northern Israel. Israel's current offensive began July 12 when Hezbollah guerrillas captured two Israeli soldiers and killed three others in a cross-border raid. Israeli airstrikes on Saturday blasted communications and television transmission towers in the central and northern Lebanese mountains, knocking the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. off the air and killing one person at the station. The death toll in Lebanon rose to at least 372, Lebanese authorities said.

The most important thing we learned about in school was the Holocaust. The second most important thing, after learning about the Nazi horrors, was how the rest of the world’s nations, including the West, including the future State of Israel’s close friends, stood idly by and did nothing while Adolf Hitler annihilated the European Jewry. One key case study stood out in this lesson—why didn’t the Allies bomb the Auschwitz death camp, even after learning what was going on there? The Holocaust, the European nations that cooperated with the Nazis, and the others that stood idly by, have been used as an argument for the lessons Israel and its leaders live by, “to make sure that a second Holocaust never happens,” “to only trust ourselves” and to use these as a frequent justification of the use of massive force throughout its years of existence. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who uses the death camps’ bombing issue in his speeches, even said that “the Allies argued that bombing Auschwitz would lead to a radicalization of the Nazi regime and are now making similar claims about Iran.” If everything we learned in school is right, why didn’t Israel stop the horrible massacre and war crimes in Syria as early as five years ago? (Photo: AFP) The question of whether the Allies could have even bombed Auschwitz’s railways and furnaces is in a deep historical dispute, but let’s assume that everything we learned in school in Israel is right and accurate—if that’s the case, then why didn’t Israel stop the horrible massacre and the war crimes taking place beyond the fence, in Syria , as early as five years ago? Israel is the strongest power in the region. It could have easily beaten Bashar al-Assad’s forces, which are shattered and scattered throughout the country and have not posed any threat to the IDF for many years now. Even if Israel had imposed a no-fly zone on the Syrian Air Force, or defined an area for the refugees, without a real military intervention, it could have saved the lives of tens of thousands and spared the suffering of millions. It is very likely that an Israeli intervention would have also prevented the Russian military involvement in the region. There are many reasons why Israel did not intervene—because it had more important things to do, because there were more relevant enemies to fight, because it did not want to appear as a country meddling in the internal affairs of another country, because the many casualties were not Jews. But these are the exact arguments which, according to the Israeli ethos, stopped Britain and the United States from intervening in favor of the European Jewry. And it’s not that there has been no Israeli military intervention in Syria. On the contrary: Israel has a routine of frequently striking deep within Syrian territory. But these bombings are aimed solely at preventing the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Last week, Arab media outlets reported that Israel had struck in Damascus . When he first addressed the bombings in public, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman clarified unequivocally that “the State of Israel has no interest in intervening in the civil war in Syria.” I wonder how such a declaration would have been interpreted in retrospect by Netanyahu, had the American secretary of defense said in 1944 that the US Air Force would not bomb Auschwitz so as not to intervene in its affairs with Germany. The daily average annihilation rate carried out by members of the Hutu tribe against the Tutsi in Rwanda was higher than the daily average death toll of European Jews during the Holocaust. The US later apologized for not intervening in the situation there, although it could have intervened and although most of the dead were murdered by gangs of civilians armed with machetes, which the US Air Force could have easily stopped. The US will apologize to Syria's citizens, too. Rwanda is far away from Israel, and Israel does not have the huge international deployment that the US Army possesses. But Syria is just a few minutes away from all Israeli Air Force bases. There have been days when the annihilation rate over there was similar to that of the Holocaust. The guilt of standing idly by during the genocide in Aleppo, Damascus and the rest of that miserable country will forever weigh upon us, too.

News article:
Armored personnel carriers provided by the United States to the Lebanese Armed Forces have been used by Hizbullah forces in Syria, a senior Israeli military official said on Wednesday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel "recognized these specific APCs... as those given by the U.S. to Lebanon." Israel shared the information with the United States "a few weeks ago," the official told reporters. He did not specify how many armored personnel carriers were involved. Israel fought a devastating war with Lebanon's Hizbullah in 2006 and closely monitors the group's activities. The Lebanese group has been fighting alongside President Bashar Assad's forces in Syria's civil war. The APCs were probably handed by the Lebanese army to Hizbullah as part "of a deal," the Israeli official said, noting that the armed Lebanese group had "tightened its grip" over central Lebanese institutions. Images shared on social media in recent weeks showed Hizbullah staging a military parade in the Syrian town of Qusayr, which it retook from rebels in 2013 in its first major victory after it intervened in support of Assad's regime. Photographs of tanks, armored vehicles and anti-aircraft batteries displaying the movement's yellow flag could be seen. Washington said last month that the United States would be "gravely concerned" if military equipment it supplied to the Lebanese army ended up in Hizbullah's hands. The Lebanese army denied that the vehicles in the pictures had belonged to it. Al-Jadeed TV also quoted Hizbullah sources as saying that the vehicles were seized in south Lebanon after the disintegration of the pro-Israel South Lebanon Army militia following the Israeli army's withdrawal. According to the Israeli official, Hizbullah has "about 8,000 people in Syria," estimating that 1,700 of its fighters have been killed there since the war began in 2011. The Israeli official also accused the Lebanese army of building watchtowers on the Lebanese-Israeli border at Hizbullah's instructions and of conducting “joint patrols” with Hizbullah militants. Israel has sought to limit its involvement in the Syrian conflict, but has carried out sporadic sorties against Hizbullah inside Syria. Israel says it reserves the right to stop the group acquiring sophisticated weapons from Syria and Iran.

News article:
A senior Israeli military officer said the army believes the chaos in the Middle East has weakened the country’s enemies, creating a low probability of war involving Israel in 2017. The official said that the army concluded that neither Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Shiite terrorist organization, nor the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas which rules the Gaza Strip is interested in sparking a new conflict. The official spoke on Wednesday on condition of anonymity according to military protocol. He was sharing an official year-end intelligence assessment. He said that Hezbollah is mired in the Syrian civil war, where it has been supporting Bashar Assad’s government troops. He also claimed that Hamas has lost much of its support from outside Gaza. Still, the official cautioned that an unexpected “dynamic of escalation” could always risk sparking a new conflict. Israel fought a month-long war with Hezbollah in 2006 and has since waged three wars with Hamas, most recently in 2014. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The official also showed a photograph of a Hezbollah military parade which included several M113 armored personal carriers. He told journalists in English that the “APCs are of the Hezbollah, while fighting in Syria, that they took from the Lebanese armed forces,” Reuters reported. “We shared this information with other countries, including the US of course,” he said. “I can even say that we recognized these specific APCs with some specific parameters that we know… these were given to the Lebanese armed forces. It’s not an assumption,” he told reporters. The M113 was first used by the US in 1962 during the Vietnam War. Since then it has been modified and adapted and it is one of the most widely used military vehicles of all time. Some 80,000 M113s have been produced and used by over 50 countries worldwide. Advertisement The Lebanese Army has over 2,000 M113s. Tobias Schneider, a defense analyst, has speculated on Twitter that the APCs displayed by Hezbollah came from the Lebanese Army — a charge that the Pentagon denied.

We are working closely with our colleagues in the Pentagon and in the Intelligence Community on to resolve this issue.”

Jerusalem – Israel has informed the United States that Lebanese Hezbollah fighters in Syria are using U.S. armored personnel carriers originally supplied to the Lebanese Army, a senior Israeli military officer said on Wednesday. The U.S. State Department said last month that the American embassy in Beirut was working to investigate images on social media purporting to show Hezbollah, which supports President Bashar al-Assad, displaying U.S. military equipment in Syria. Those images were widely reported to have been of U.S.-made M113 armored personnel carriers, which the State Department said were extremely common in the region. In an intelligence briefing to foreign reporters in Tel Aviv, the senior officer showed a photograph of military vehicles, which he said included U.S.-made armored personnel carriers (APCs), along a road. “These APCs are of the Hezbollah, while fighting in Syria, that they took from the Lebanese armed forces,” he said in English, describing the guerrilla group as dominant in Lebanon. “We shared this information with other countries, including the U.S. of course, and I can even say that we recognized these specific APCs with some specific parameters that we know … these were given to the Lebanese armed forces. It’s not an assumption,” said the officer, who under the rules of the briefing could not be identified by name, rank or position. Western diplomatic sources have said the APCs were delivered to the Lebanese Army by the United States as part of a program to equip that force. The officer made no comment about when the APCs would have been supplied to the Lebanese Army. The officer said Hezbollah has 8,000 fighters in Syria where more than 1,700 of the group’s combatants have been killed since 2011. Israel and Hezbollah, which the officer said has 30,000 members, half of them combatants, last fought a war in 2006.

News article:
Washington (AFP) - The United States denied Wednesday an Israeli claim that US-supplied armored vehicles seen being operated by Hezbollah in Syria had been given to the Islamist militia by Lebanon's official army. Last month, footage emerged of Hezbollah fighters operating M113 armored personnel carriers in Syria, where the militia -- blacklisted by Washington as a terrorist organization -- is fighting in support of Bashar al-Assad's regime. On Wednesday, a senior Israeli military official speaking on condition of anonymity said Israel believes these vehicles were drawn from stocks supplied by Washington to the Lebanese Armed Forces. But, in Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby said US officials have investigated and do not believe that Lebanon has violated its agreement not to transfer on US-supplied equipment. "When this allegation was raised in November, the Department of Defense did a structural analysis of the armored personnel carriers in question at that time and concluded that these vehicles were not from the Lebanese Armed Forces. Our assessment remains the same now," Kirby told AFP. "As we noted when this first came up, the Lebanese Armed Forces stated publicly that the vehicles depicted online were never part of their equipment roster," he added. "The LAF fully complies with end use monitoring requirements, continues to have an exemplary track record with US equipment and remains a valued partner in the fight against ISIL and other extremists," he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. - Captured APCs - The United States supplies Lebanon's official army with arms on condition they are for official use and would be obliged to review military ties if it were proved the APCs ended up in Hezbollah's hands. Pentagon spokesman Gordon Trowbridge told AFP that Hezbollah does indeed have a "small number" of M113 armored personnel carriers in its inventory. Story continues "They've had them for a number of years," Trowbridge said. "They could have come from a variety of sources because it's a relatively common vehicle in the region." Neither US spokesman said where Hezbollah's M113s might have come from if not from the Lebanese army. But last month some officials noted that Hezbollah is thought to have captured armored vehicles from the defunct South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed Christian militia that collapsed in 2000. Earlier, the anonymous Israeli military official had told reporters that Israeli intelligence had "recognized these specific APCs... as those given by the US to Lebanon". He said new information had been shared with the United States "a few weeks ago" but did not specify how many armored personnel carriers were involved. Israel fought a devastating war with the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah in 2006, and closely monitors the group's activities. More recently, the Iranian-funded Lebanese Shiite movement has been fighting alongside Assad's forces in Syria's civil war. - Sporadic sorties - The APCs were probably handed to Hezbollah as part of a deal with the Lebanese army, the Israeli official said, asserting that the group had "tightened its grip" over Lebanese institutions. Images shared on social media in recent weeks showed Hezbollah staging a military parade in the Syrian town of Qusayr, which it retook from rebels in 2013 in its first major victory since it intervened. Photographs of armored vehicles and anti-aircraft batteries displaying the movement's yellow flag could be seen. Washington said last month that the United States would be "gravely concerned" if military equipment it supplied to the Lebanese army ended up in Hezbollah's hands. According to the Israeli official, Hezbollah has "about 8,000 people in Syria," estimating that 1,700 of its fighters have been killed there since the war began in 2011. Watchtowers built by the Lebanese army on the Israeli border were constructed according to Hezbollah instructions and the country's military and Iran-backed Shiite militiamen conduct joint patrols, the Israeli official said. Israel has sought to limit its involvement in the Syrian conflict, but has carried out sporadic sorties against Hezbollah inside Syria. Israel says it reserves the right to stop the group acquiring sophisticated weapons from Syria and Iran and threatening the country from both its Lebanese base and positions in Syria.

Hezbollah is fighting in Syria with American weapon systems supplied by the United States to the Lebanese Army, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer speaking under conditions of anonymity said Wednesday. According to the officer, Israel has supplied the U.S. administration with evidence, including photographs, of American-supplied armored personnel carriers being used by Hezbollah in Syria. The senior officer added that while it is not clear under which circumstances Hezbollah obtained the American APC’s from the Lebanese Armed Forces, he believed that it was part of “a deal” and that Hezbollah has recently “strengthened its grip on the main national institutions in Lebanon,” including its army. Lebanon is currently the fifth-highest recipient of U.S. military aid in the form of light and medium weapons and armored vehicles, supplied by the Obama administration in order to help the Lebanese fight Islamist terror organizations. This includes M-113 APC’s and M-60 tanks. The latest shipment in August was worth an estimated $50 million and included 50 new APCs and 40 artillery pieces. According to the officer, “Israel wants to see Lebanon flourish and believes that it needs an army but doesn’t want to see Hezbollah play a major role in it.” Israeli intelligence believes that cooperation between the LAF and Hezbollah has reached a level whereby the two forces patrol together on the Israel-Lebanon border and Hezbollah directs the LAF where to build its new observation posts on the border and shares in the intelligence collected. In recent weeks, Israel has obtained evidence of some of the U.S.-supplied APCs being used by Hezbollah on the battlefield in Syria. Hezbollah has been fighting for most of the last six years alongside the Assad regime and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Syria and has lost by now over 1,700 of its fighters. The evidence was passed on the U.S. through the standard intelligence cooperation channels and it is not clear yet whether the administration has acted upon it with the Lebanese government. Open gallery view File photo: Lebanese soldiers on U.S.-made M-60 tanks. Credit: AP Earlier in December, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that although "Israel has no intention of intervening in the civil war in Syria," it would not allow chemical weapons to reach Hezbollah in Lebanon. Speaking a day after Israel's second reported attack in Syria, the defense minister said that "Israel's policy is clear and based on three red lines: We won't allow any harm to come to our citizens, we won't allow our sovereignty to be infringed on and we will not allow advanced weapons or chemical weapons from Syria to be smuggled to Lebanon for Hezbollah." In a possible reference to Russian presence in Syria, Lieberman asked to clarify that Israel acts "freely" in the area "without taking into account the circumstances or other restrictions." A week earlier, Syria said that Israeli jets attacked west of Damascus, with reports in Arab media saying an arms convoy intended for Hezbollah was the target. The news came amid tensions along Israel's northern border after clashes between the Israeli army and militants affiliated with the Islamic State group.

News article:
By PanARMENIAN Israel has informed the United States that Lebanese Hezbollah fighters in Syria are using U.S. armored personnel carriers originally supplied to the Lebanese Army, a senior Israeli military officer said on Wednesday, December 21, according to Reuters. The U.S. State Department said last month that the American embassy in Beirut was working to investigate images on social media purporting to show Hezbollah, which supports President Bashar al-Assad, displaying U.S. military equipment in Syria. Those images were widely reported to have been of U.S.-made M113 armored personnel carriers, which the State Department said were extremely common in the region. In an intelligence briefing to foreign reporters in Tel Aviv, the senior officer showed a photograph of military vehicles, which he said included U.S.-made armored personnel carriers (APCs), along a road. “These APCs are of the Hezbollah, while fighting in Syria, that they took from the Lebanese armed forces,” he said in English, describing the guerrilla group as dominant in Lebanon. “We shared this information with other countries, including the U.S. of course, and I can even say that we recognized these specific APCs with some specific parameters that we know … these were given to the Lebanese armed forces. It’s not an assumption,” said the officer, who under the rules of the briefing could not be identified by name, rank or position. Western diplomatic sources have said the APCs were delivered to the Lebanese Army by the United States as part of a program to equip that force. The officer made no comment about when the APCs would have been supplied to the Lebanese Army. The officer said Hezbollah has 8,000 fighters in Syria where more than 1,700 of the group’s combatants have been killed since 2011. Israel and Hezbollah, which the officer said has 30,000 members, half of them combatants, last fought a war in 2006.

News article:
December 21, 2016 Israeli Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz pledged on Dec. 14 that his government would seek US recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights during the Donald Trump administration. His statement came in the wake of recent bolder-than-usual Israeli attacks against Syrian and Hezbollah interests. On Dec. 7, the Israeli army targeted the Syrian heartland, hitting the Mazzeh air base with several surface-to-surface missiles. The base, southwest of Damascus, is home to Syrian air force intelligence headquarters. Another strike was reported later that same night, targeting Hezbollah sites near the Syrian capital, in the Zabadani area. The airstrikes were the second within a week in Syria attributed to Israel. Another attack had been reported Nov. 30, on an arms convoy near Damascus. International media suggested that Israel had hit the convoy because it was transferring weapons to Hezbollah, which is currently engaged in the Syrian war in support of President Bashar al-Assad's forces. The strikes are indicative of the long-running covert war between Hezbollah and Israel. Avi Melamed, an Israeli affairs expert at the Eisenhower Institute in Washington, told Al-Monitor that the repeated Israeli attacks shed light on Israel’s main priorities in Syria. He observed, “Israel has made it clear that it won’t accept Hezbollah's attempts to acquire what is defined by Israel as ‘balance breaking’ weapons, such as weapons of mass destruction, advanced ground-to-air missiles, etc.” After the Nov. 30 attack, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, addressing a gathering of European Union representatives, stated that Israeli governments have always sought “to protect our sovereignty, and we are trying to prevent the smuggling of advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah.” Liberman’s statement was a rare claim of responsibility by Israel for attacks on Syrian soil. “Israel won’t tolerate attacks being launched from Syrian territory on its home turf, including the Golan Heights, or allow Iran to establish and operate a new military front against Israel on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights,” Melamed explained. Gen. Amin Hoteit, a Lebanese military expert, shared Melamed's opinion, telling Al-Monitor that Israel’s red lines in Syria are two-pronged. “Israel won’t allow the emergence of a resistance movement in the Golan area similar to what took place in Lebanon,” he said. “It also won’t tolerate attacks on Israel from the Syrian border areas.” Israel ended its occupation of south Lebanon in 2000 after a yearslong war of attrition with Hezbollah. Hoteit explained that these red lines have determined the nature of Israel's military operations in Syria, which he said have been of three types. “The first type of strike is a simple show of force by Israel to maintain balance of power,” he said. “Since the beginning of the war in Syria, at least six strikes of this type have been conducted in the Damascus area, targeting alleged Hezbollah interests without leading to any losses in the organization.” The second type is defensive strikes targeting key Hezbollah figures. In December 2015, Syrian reports claimed that Israel had killed Samir Kuntar, who spent decades in an Israeli prison on terrorism charges, using surface-to-surface missiles fired from Israel. In January 2015, Jihad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah's commander on the Golan and son of Hezbollah commander Imad Mughniyeh, was killed in Quneitra. Also killed in the strike were commander Mohammad Issa, Iranian commander on the Golan Abu Ali al-Tabtabai and Ismail al-Ashhab. It was believed that Hezbollah had been training militiamen and Syrian government forces somewhere in the area of the strikes. The third type of operation involves Israeli secret missions targeting key figures and resources. These have been kept under the radar by Syria and Hezbollah as well as Israel. “I believe that several operations have targeted areas of Damascus and Tartous, without being reported,” Hoteit said. Hezbollah has remained mum about the recent Israeli operations. The organization had replied in restrained fashion to previous strikes, the boldest retaliation without a doubt following Mughniyeh’s killing, when it targeted an Israeli border patrol with an improvised explosive device, killing two soldiers in the Shebaa Farms area. Hezbollah has been stretched thin in Syria, where it is believed to have deployed more than 7,000 fighters on multiple fronts since the beginning of the war, according to sources speaking on condition of anonymity. Opening a new front with Israel does not seem to be a priority for the organization, which is focusing for now on buttressing the Assad regime, an important ally. “Given the current conditions prevailing in Syria and Lebanon and taking into consideration the interests and factors involved, the likelihood of a massive Israeli-Hezbollah confrontation in the foreseeable future appears to be low,” Melamed assessed. According to Hoteit, the elements that could lead to a military operation against Hezbollah appear to be missing. “The guarantee of a successful mission, the possibility to strike and more importantly to translate a victory on the political scene are not available on the Israeli side,” he explained. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel thus appears to be contained for the moment, despite the recent escalation by Israel, putting the prospects of an all-out war on hold for the near future.

News article:
Riyadh: Although the United States denied an Israeli claim that the US-supplied armoured vehicles seen during an unprecedented Hezbollah military parade in the Syrian town of Qusayr on November 11 originated from the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), Israel sought to revisit the issue a few days ago, most probably as a warning to President Michel Aoun. The latest accusations, which were widely reported including in the influential New York Times, alleged that the tanks and armoured personnel vehicles were drawn from stocks supplied by Washington to the LAF. According to an unnamed senior Israeli officer who briefed foreign journalists, Hezbollah acquired the equipment from the LAF, a clear violation of US laws that prohibit third-party transfers. Importantly, the Department of State spokesman John Kirby reiterated on Wednesday that American officials investigated the matter when videos of the parade circulated, and concluded that Lebanon did not violate its agreements. Kirby told AFP that the Department of Defence conducted “a structural analysis of the armoured personnel carriers in question at that time and [further] concluded that these vehicles were not from LAF” stocks. Beyond the fact that the LAF was careful in all end use clauses attached to all of the arms it receives from Washington, and while the more logical source[s] of these items were either the former Free Lebanon Army [Antoine Lahad] or Israeli vehicles abandoned after the 2000 withdrawal, the latest timing was revelatory. Barely a month after his election, President Michel Aoun signed major political concessions for Hezbollah, including a veto power within the government. This fact did not sit well as Israelis were increasingly wary of Hezbollah’s growing influence within Lebanon, as the group “tightened its grip” over state institutions, which promised to grow even more under the Aoun administration. Moreover, and because of the party’s critical role alongside other Iranian militias in the battle for Aleppo, Israel looked at Hezbollah with added caution. By revisiting a story like the alleged LAF weapons, what Israel aimed to achieve was a concerted effort to derail American-Lebanese ties, which are vital to Beirut. An LAF Colonel serving at the Ministry of Defence in Yarzeh confirmed to Gulf News that Lebanon was aware of the accusations against it that, he insisted, were devoid of any truths. Speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, the Colonel claimed that General Jean Qahwaji, the LAF Commander, was adamant on honouring its commitments as he repeatedly called on the rank and file to depoliticise the armed forces. “Our internal challenges suffice but we understand that Israel is sending a warning to President Aoun,” affirmed the LAF Colonel, “especially to maintain a certain distance from Hezbollah”. Lebanon is caught between a rock and a hard-place, with two difficult neighbours who agree on regime stability in Damascus, though at Beirut’s expense. President Aoun has not responded to the latest Israeli accusations though the Lebanese government relied on Washington to retort.

Estimates are ranging to half million deaths in the four year civil war in Syria that shows no sign of reaching an end, or even of agreement among observers about what is likely to occur. The most recent headlines have focused on what Hebrew and Arabic speakers call Chalab, and the speakers of western languages call Aleppo. What had been a city with some 2.3 million residents now is providing videos looking like Berlin and Tokyo in 1945, estimates of 30-40 thousand dead, perhaps 100,000 refugees seeking relief from cold, hunger, and thirst, as well as threats of more killing, rape, and pillage. The city is 500 km (300 miles) from northern Israel, assuming it would be possible to make the trip. There is also fighting right over the border of the Golan Heights, with occasional shells falling by mistake or intention in Israel. Aside from clucking our tongues in sadness at the carnage, pretty much like other outsiders, Israelis aren’t doing much, also like other outsiders. Medical personnel take care of injured fighters or civilians who make it to the border, the IDF bombards in response to the shells that land on Israeli territory, and has destroyed stockpiles and shipments of munitions apparently destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Jerusalem Post published an editorial with the headline, “Israel’s moral obligation to help save Aleppo’s civilians,” but the item’s content is a pale shadow of anything heroic. Its essence is that Israel must promote action by the UN, US, EU, Russia, Turkey and others to stop the carnage. The concluding paragraphs read more as a moral whisper than anything practical. “As a people who suffered the Holocaust, we should see it as our moral imperative to protect the lives of Syrian civilians, including the thousands of innocent children. There are no easy answers in the ongoing conflict. But before time runs out, the innocent – civilians and aid workers trapped in the fighting – must be saved.” The Prime Minister spoke about bringing injured civilians from Chalab to Israel. However, in the aftermath of Muslim refugees killing civilians in Berlin, that may go the way of a lot that the Prime Minister says and doesn’t do. A group of Israelis acquired air-time on radio to ask for donations for the purchase of baby food for the refugees from Chalab. How the delivery would be made is its own mystery. More prominent than moral worries are the benefits Israel enjoys from carnage among our enemies. Muslim civil war and its uptick in Islamic extremism is keeping our enemies busy, and distracting the world’s elites from making any effort to impose a solution for Israel and Palestine. It’s also helping to minimize the clout of the country’s own leftists, and their standard claim that Israel is at fault for not trying harder to please those claiming priority where Israelis are residing on one or another side of the armistice lines created in 1948. IDF planners as well as Arabic speaking commentators are pondering the warfare in Syria and its implication for us via which groups may end up on top, especially in areas near the border. For some 40 years Israel’s relationship with Syria has been one of enmity and threat, along with restraint. Israel has posted significant military resources along the border, but the area is generally quiet. There was an attack against a nuclear site in 2007. There was also the final exit of what had been a substantial Jewish community with a history of two millennia, with some of the last remnants making their way to Israel from way stations in the US or Europe. Officially Israel has distanced itself from what is happening, along with some kind of relationship with several of the combatants and sources of their support, including Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the Kurds, not all of whom are usually on the same side of the fighting. Hezbollah and its Iranian supporters are arguably the most assiduous of Israel’s adversaries, and they are deeply involved in the fighting, with significant casualties. Optimistic Israelis see both of them as bleeding enough in Syria to postpone any likelihood of significant efforts against Israel. Should they position themselves in any major way close to the border, that would be one of the reasons to contemplate an Israeli preemption. In a situation where the forces of Russia and Assad appear to have some degree of staying power, while dozens of militias are competing in a chaos that sees allies turning into enemies and again allies, it is best for Israel to stay out of it, while using its power when appropriate. There have been declarations of friendship with Israel from individuals claiming to speak for one or another of the groups rebelling against the Assad regime. There have also been Syrians who refuse to speak to a reporter identified as an Israeli, perhaps because of fear of retribution or because of the person’s own enmity to anything Jewish. We can assume that the militias killing one another’s fighters and civilian supporters would unify with escalated enthusiasm, and turn their weapons against Israelis if they had the opportunity. The level of pathos may be significantly greater among Israel’s Arabs than Jews, and especially among the Muslims. It is their people who are tearing themselves apart, and producing mass graves as well as countless refugees. We hear of bitterness within families as individuals choose sides and justify the actions of those seen as more just, or more likely to emerge victorious, with other individuals depressed by what seems to be a hopeless chaos of shifting loyalties with no results beyond more death and destruction. There is no shortage of governments to blame for the unrestrained warfare and civilian misery. For some, Russia is the prime evil, but for others it is the excessive restraint of Barack Obama. Against the occasional bombing run, supplies and advisers sent to favored militias, as well as joining the EU in economic sanctions against Russia for what it has done in Ukraine, the greater impact of the US is to keep its force at home and to provide a free hand to Russians who are supporting and leading the actions of Assad’s forces.

News article:
THOUGHTS ON SYRIA, ANTISEMITISM, ALEPPO AND BEING JEWISH When I was a child, I remember my mother speaking to me about Eli Cohen, “the spy from Damascus” with such reverence and respect and admiration that I believed that he had to be one of our close relatives. Mr. Cohen had infiltrated the Syrian hierarchy and was high up in the elder Al- Assad’s government ; when he was discovered to be a spy for the fledging country of Israel, he was brutally tortured and humiliated, put to death by public hanging and left hanging for days out in the open. This was not unusual behavior for the Syrians. Since pre-biblical times their forefathers, the Assyrians, were considered to be the cruelest, most vicious of peoples. This point was further brought home to me by Judy Feld Carr, one of my greatest heroes, who masterminded, organized and personally ran one of the most incredible life -saving missions in the 20th century. Judy, who I so proudly consider my adopted older sister, saved the lives of upwards of 3,000 Syrian Jews secretly for 28 years — stopping only in 2011. Syrian Jews were not allowed to leave Syria from the time of Israel’s creation and the Jews were held in Syria against their will. They were persecuted and demonized and if they tried to leave and were caught, they were tortured, imprisoned and in many cases, murdered. Judy, at great personal risk organized their escapes, surreptitiously collected ransom money and planned their escape routes. She did so, even though she received ongoing death threats and her own wellbeing was constantly under threat. Her late husband, Dr. Ronald Feld actually died as a result of her involvement in the cause- and yet, she persevered. The stories she has shared with me about the barbarity, cruelty and viciousness of the Syrians was extraordinary, even by Middle Eastern standards. Advertisement So, what does this have to do with today’s Syria- and me? Initially, when this horrendous civil war broke out, my position on the Syrians was …tempered. I did not react with my customary outrage at a horrendous and devastating civil war. I thought of Eli Cohen, hanging in the square, stripped of his dignity as well as his life, and I thought of the 3000 Jews who were smuggled out of Syria, most times with just their clothes on their backs, through dangerous and expensive channels, people whose families had lived in Syria for centuries, people who had contributed so much to their country, who were treated like criminals, ostracized and demonized, solely for being Jewish. I thought of the barbarism, cruelty, inhumanity that these Jews had endured and it certainly impacted my level of humanitarianism vis a vis their Muslim counterparts.. And then — I just couldn’t stand it anymore. The children being indiscriminately murdered by their own president, hospitals being deliberately targeted by bombs, ordered by their president, neighbourhoods being wiped out, by their own president. Advertisement At one point, I began to cry with such fury and anger that I couldn’t stop shaking. I thought about it, long and hard. I thought about how I could not personally bear moral equivalency and it made me reflect on why I reacted this way. I realized I am a product of my own upbringing, of what I believe to be decency and morality, of being, inherently and unconditionally, Jewish.. We are a people who celebrate and honour life. When we toast someone, we say “L’chaim- to life”. When we want to celebrate someone, we say” May you LIVE to 120.” Every single important concept in Judaism is focused on life- being grateful for it, enjoying it, acknowledging it. And- protecting life as sacred. And so, as we have watched the horrendous genocide of Syria play out, with bombs ordered by the murderer ,Assad raining down indiscriminately on children and hospitals, turning Aleppo into rubble, annihilating an entire nation, I thank G-d that I am imbued with a humanity that comes from my religion, from my ancient code of ethics, from Judaism. Thank you, G-d — for making me Jewish, for giving me such a morality and code of ethics, for giving me my humanity. Amen.

News article:
One of the more iconic and sobering elements of Israeli reality were the gas masks distributed on the street or at post offices to every citizen after Saddam Hussein fired SCUD missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War. They continued to be distributed until early 2014, when the Israeli government decided to end the practice in the wake of an international deal to disarm Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. Now, nearly three years later, the issue has resurfaced as a direct result of the Syrian civil war—in particular, the threat from both Hezbollah and the Islamic State. In August 2013, the Assad regime deployed chemical weapons against the neighborhood of Ghouta near Damascus, asphyxiating to death over a thousand civilians, including women and children. U.S. President Barak Obama threatened a military response and issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government—his notorious “red line”—only to acquiesce to Russian mediation efforts. Under the terms of the brokered deal, Syria’s chemical weapons would be shipped out of the country and destroyed by international monitors. A triumph of diplomacy, some called it at the time. But problems with the deal emerged almost immediately. Citing Israeli and Western intelligence officials, reports surfaced in April 2014 that the Assad regime was, contrary to the deal, hiding parts of its chemical weapons stockpile as a deterrent against rebel forces. This didn’t stop the U.S., in mid-2014, from proclaiming that Syria was free of chemical weapons. Tellingly, however, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that there remained “important questions with regard to discrepancies and omissions.” These discrepancies and omissions appear to have come home to roost. In early December, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman told European ambassadors in Tel Aviv that Israel would “prevent the smuggling of advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah.” Coming on the heels of mysterious air strikes inside Syria, not much was left to the imagination, although in accordance with longstanding policy the Israeli government refused to confirm that it was the responsible party. One day later, Lieberman doubled down on his headline-making statement, telling the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Israel “will not allow the smuggling of high-quality advanced weapons and chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah.” The Netanyahu government has, since the start of the Syrian civil war, tried to keep the hellstorm to its northeast at arm’s length. But one exception, as Lieberman made clear, is any attempt by Hezbollah to alter the existing balance of power. “Hezbollah holding strategic weapons is a problem not just for Israel but the region and the entire Western world,” one senior Israeli military officer recently told me. “It can easily be a reason for a ‘dynamic of escalation’”—that is, war. If he were to give one piece of advice to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the officer added, it would be “keep an eye on Hezbollah if you want a stable Middle East, and if you want to achieve something in Syria.” The officer was speaking at an annual intelligence briefing for foreign journalists in a conference room high above the Israel Defense Forces’ Tel Aviv headquarters. An overview of the major milestones of 2016—as the IDF saw it—flashed on flat-screen televisions. Interspersed between Brexit, Donald Trump, and Aleppo, one ostensibly less momentous event caught the eye: the use of chemical weapons by ISIS in Iraq. While reports only surfaced this past year, by one estimate the group has deployed crude chemical weapons on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq 52 times since 2014—including, in at least one instance, against U.S. soldiers. ISIS indeed has a presence on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights bordering Israel, but not until recently has it attacked the Jewish state. That changed in late November, when fighters from the ISIS franchise in the area (usually referred to as the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade) fired on an IDF border patrol. Despite the fact that no Israeli soldiers were injured and the terrorists were killed by return fire, and despite the fact that it wasn’t, according to the senior officer, a pre-planned attack, it did mark a watershed. The event goes some way toward explaining why the use of chemical weapons in Iraq by ISIS made it into the IDF’s annual summary a few weeks later. Israel, for its part, is taking notice—and making it clear that it is taking notice. The country’s leading news website, Ynet, published an article in late December about an elite IDF engineering unit tasked, among other delicate missions, with defending Israel against the use of chemical weapons. Based on the large number of official training pictures—gas masks and all—embedded in the article, it was clear that the authorities granted Ynet special access. “The assessment by the defense establishment is that terrorist elements are trying to get their hands on unconventional weapons, abandoned in the field by the army of Syrian President Bashar Assad on the northern border,” the article stated. This was the reason for the unit’s expansion and new training program. When Israel stopped distributing gas masks to its civilians three years ago, it was viewed as a small, rare positive development in the Syrian civil war. That decision may now join the gruesome conflict’s expanding list of losses.

News article:
One of the more iconic and sobering elements of Israeli reality were the gas masks distributed on the street or at post offices to every citizen after Saddam Hussein fired SCUD missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War. They continued to be distributed until early 2014, when the Israeli government decided to end the practice in the wake of an international deal to disarm Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. Now, nearly three years later, the issue has resurfaced as a direct result of the Syrian civil war—in particular, the threat from both Hezbollah and the Islamic State. In August 2013, the Assad regime deployed chemical weapons against the neighborhood of Ghouta near Damascus, asphyxiating to death over a thousand civilians, including women and children. U.S. President Barak Obama threatened a military response and issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government—his notorious “red line”—only to acquiesce to Russian mediation efforts. Under the terms of the brokered deal, Syria’s chemical weapons would be shipped out of the country and destroyed by international monitors. A triumph of diplomacy, some called it at the time. But problems with the deal emerged almost immediately. Citing Israeli and Western intelligence officials, reports surfaced in April 2014 that the Assad regime was, contrary to the deal, hiding parts of its chemical weapons stockpile as a deterrent against rebel forces. This didn’t stop the U.S., in mid-2014, from proclaiming that Syria was free of chemical weapons. Tellingly, however, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that there remained “important questions with regard to discrepancies and omissions.” These discrepancies and omissions appear to have come home to roost. In early December, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman told European ambassadors in Tel Aviv that Israel would “prevent the smuggling of advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah.” Coming on the heels of mysterious air strikes inside Syria, not much was left to the imagination, although in accordance with longstanding policy the Israeli government refused to confirm that it was the responsible party. One day later, Lieberman doubled down on his headline-making statement, telling the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Israel “will not allow the smuggling of high-quality advanced weapons and chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah.” The Netanyahu government has, since the start of the Syrian civil war, tried to keep the hellstorm to its northeast at arm’s length. But one exception, as Lieberman made clear, is any attempt by Hezbollah to alter the existing balance of power. “Hezbollah holding strategic weapons is a problem not just for Israel but the region and the entire Western world,” one senior Israeli military officer recently told me. “It can easily be a reason for a ‘dynamic of escalation’”—that is, war. If he were to give one piece of advice to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the officer added, it would be “keep an eye on Hezbollah if you want a stable Middle East, and if you want to achieve something in Syria.” The officer was speaking at an annual intelligence briefing for foreign journalists in a conference room high above the Israel Defense Forces’ Tel Aviv headquarters. An overview of the major milestones of 2016—as the IDF saw it—flashed on flat-screen televisions. Interspersed between Brexit, Donald Trump, and Aleppo, one ostensibly less momentous event caught the eye: the use of chemical weapons by ISIS in Iraq. While reports only surfaced this past year, by one estimate the group has deployed crude chemical weapons on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq 52 times since 2014—including, in at least one instance, against U.S. soldiers. ISIS indeed has a presence on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights bordering Israel, but not until recently has it attacked the Jewish state. That changed in late November, when fighters from the ISIS franchise in the area (usually referred to as the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade) fired on an IDF border patrol. Despite the fact that no Israeli soldiers were injured and the terrorists were killed by return fire, and despite the fact that it wasn’t, according to the senior officer, a pre-planned attack, it did mark a watershed. The event goes some way toward explaining why the use of chemical weapons in Iraq by ISIS made it into the IDF’s annual summary a few weeks later. Israel, for its part, is taking notice—and making it clear that it is taking notice. The country’s leading news website, Ynet, published an article in late December about an elite IDF engineering unit tasked, among other delicate missions, with defending Israel against the use of chemical weapons. Based on the large number of official training pictures—gas masks and all—embedded in the article, it was clear that the authorities granted Ynet special access. “The assessment by the defense establishment is that terrorist elements are trying to get their hands on unconventional weapons, abandoned in the field by the army of Syrian President Bashar Assad on the northern border,” the article stated.
