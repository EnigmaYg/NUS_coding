-----------------------------------
True

The image depicts armed individuals in a vehicle with a camouflage pattern and the Iraqi flag, which aligns with the news article's description of an Iraqi coalition battling toward Tikrit, facing Islamic State snipers and roadside bombs. The individuals in the image appear to be security forces or militia members, which corresponds with the article's mention of Shi'ite and Kurdish militia members joining Iraqi troops. The context of military action and the presence of armed forces in the image are highly related to the news of the offensive against the Islamic State in Iraq. Thus, the image is aligned with the news article's subject matter.

-----------------------------------
False

The image depicts armed individuals, likely militia members or soldiers, in a desert environment, which aligns with the context of the news article discussing the offensive against ISIS in Tikrit, Iraq. The involvement of Iranian-backed Shiite militias and the presence of IRGC advisers and troops, as mentioned in the article, is consistent with the type of forces shown in the image. However, the specific events mentioned in the news events, such as the IRGC's Quds Force employing remotely piloted aerial munitions, Martin Dempsey's intent to cooperate economically, and Ashton Carter's pessimistic comments, are not visually represented in the image. The image shows ground troops, which does not directly depict the use of aerial munitions or the individuals mentioned (Dempsey and Carter) making statements. Therefore, while the image is related to the broader context of the article, it does not specifically illustrate the detailed events mentioned.

Image Ok.

-----------------------------------
True.

The image depicts what appears to be a group of soldiers marching with flags, including the flag of Iraq and other flags that could be associated with Iranian-backed groups or militias. This aligns with the news article's discussion of Iranian involvement in Iraq, where it mentions "Iranian-backed Shiite militia leaders said that their fighters made up more than two-thirds of the pro-government force of 30,000." The image is relevant to the news events described, as it portrays pro-government troops that are likely receiving military aid from Iran, consistent with the news article's focus on the increasing dependency of America's strategy in fighting ISIS on Iranian fighters and the role of Iranian-backed troops in Iraq.
