Based on the provided rules and domain knowledge, the relationship between the image and the news article is not complementary. The image depicts a map labeled "Peace with Egypt," which includes demarcation lines, such as the Cease Fire Line 1967, Israeli Front Line according to the Agreement of Disengagement of Forces (1974), and other zones with specific conditions regarding military presence.

The news article, on the other hand, discusses a historical context involving Israel's ambassador Abba Eban and his statements regarding the conflict with Egypt, including armistice violations, calls for peaceful settlement, and accusations of aggression. The article seems to be set in a time frame that predates the agreements shown on the map, focusing on a period of conflict rather than the peace arrangements depicted.

Therefore, while the image and the news article both relate to the broader theme of the Israeli-Egyptian relationship, the specific events and time frames do not align, and the visual information in the image does not complement the details of the news story as described. The image is more relevant to a discussion of peace agreements and their conditions, while the news article addresses earlier diplomatic and military tensions between the two nations.
