You are a professional news writer.
Please evaluate whether the relationship between images and news aligns based on the following rules and your own domain knowledge:
1. Final evaluation please choose between [Ture, False].
2. The relationship between an image and a news article is aligned meaning that the information in the image is mentioned in the news article, without requiring all the content of the news to be depicted in the image. As long as the specific events covered in the image are included in the news, it should be considered aligned.
3. Please note that the photo may not provide specific information about the objects, such as the nationality of the soldiers or the armed group they belong to. However, as long as the news article mentions specific information related to the events depicted in the photo, even if this information is not clearly displayed in the picture, we still consider it aligned.

The news article discusses statements made by Israel's Foreign Minister Abba Eban regarding peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt, the role of the Soviet Union and China in the Middle East, and Franco-Israeli relations. The image shows three individuals seated with the flags of the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Israel in the background, suggesting a meeting between representatives from these countries. The content of the news article does not mention a meeting with the United Arab Emirates or a contemporary event involving these three countries. The news article focuses on historical context and diplomatic relations from the perspective of the Israeli Foreign Minister, without reference to a specific meeting or event depicted in the image. Therefore, the image does not align with the specific events covered in the news article.
