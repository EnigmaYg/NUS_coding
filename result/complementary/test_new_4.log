 The image shows the trend of Iran-China trade and global oil prices from 1992 to 2022. The blue bars represent the total Iran-China trade in billions of US dollars, while the red line represents the average crude oil price per barrel. It is clear that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables. When the oil price is high, the trade volume between Iran and China is also high. When the oil price is low, the trade volume is also low. This suggests that the two countries' economies are closely linked.

The information extracted from the image:


 The image is a line graph showing the trend of Iranian oil production from 1980 to 2012. The graph shows that oil production increased steadily from 1980 to 1997, after which it declined sharply until 2002. Production then recovered somewhat but has remained below its peak levels of the late 1990s.

The graph illustrates that Iran's oil production has fluctuated over the past three decades. The decline in production in the late 1990s and early 2000s was likely due to a combination of factors, including political instability, economic sanctions, and declining global oil prices. The recovery in production in the mid-2000s was likely due to increased global oil demand and improved political stability in Iran.

The recent decline in production is likely due to a combination of factors, including renewed economic sanctions, declining global oil prices, and political instability in the region.

The vertical axis represents the amount of crude oil imported in thousand barrels per day (kb/d), while the horizontal axis represents the time period. The graph shows that South Korea's crude oil imports from Iran increased from around 100 kb/d in January 2014 to around 2,500 kb/d in February 2018. This increase can be attributed to the lifting of sanctions on Iran in January 2016, which allowed South Korea to resume imports of Iranian crude oil. In November 2018, the U.S. re-imposed sanctions on Iran, causing South Korea's imports of Iranian crude oil to drop to zero.

The graph shows that Japan's oil imports from Iran increased significantly from 1973 to 1979, before declining sharply in 1980. Imports then remained relatively low until 2003, when they began to increase again. In 2007, Japan imported more than $16 billion worth of oil from Iran, making it Japan's third-largest supplier of crude oil. However, imports fell again in 2008 and 2009 due to the global financial crisis and sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and other countries. In 2016, Japan imported just over $1 billion worth of oil from Iran. The graph shows that Japan's oil imports from Iran have fluctuated over the years but have generally declined since 1979.

* Keeping out a segment of public leaders, particularly Pakhtun nationalists, was not only bound to create suspicion and concerns but also seemed elusive.
* The 1998 Geneva Accords were negotiated between the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan but unfortunately the major guarantors failed to honour their main provisions regarding ending military support to the warring groups.
* Dr Najeebullah offered his adversaries major concessions, including declaring a six-month unilateral ceasefire, approving a new constitution that recognised Islam as the state religion, introducing an electoral and multiparty system, implementing economic reforms to respect private property, granting amnesty to opposition leaders, releasing more than 16,000 political prisoners, and offering the opposition half of the posts in a government of national reconciliation.
* The acrimony between key personalities and the parties they represented resulted in a civil war with devastating effect on the country.
* The US has, in its own wisdom, incapacitated the al Qaeda network which is no longer considered strong enough to threaten their vital national interests and social order.
* The Taliban are in a belligerent mood trying to advance their influence on ground using the negotiating table as part of the tactics.
* The immediate withdrawal of the US, without bolstering the National Unity Government with the presence of neutral forces to the satisfaction of all stakeholders, may plunge the country into chaos.
* Projecting the Taliban as the sole player within Afghanistan is a departure from the path of reconciliation as it neglects other major players within society.
* The Taliban, with guns in hand and freedom to move in all directions, will provide no free choice to those sitting on the sidelines.

* Iranian officials abruptly ended a meeting with European envoys on Jan. 8 in Tehran, slamming the door in protest of a message that Europe could no longer tolerate ballistic missile tests in Iran and assassination plots on European soil.
* The next day, the EU imposed its first sanctions on Iran since world powers agreed the 2015 Vienna nuclear arms control deal with Tehran.
* The sanctions were largely symbolic but the stormy meeting encapsulated the unexpected shift in European diplomacy since the end of last year.
* Smaller, more dovish EU countries have joined France and Britain in a harder stance on Tehran, including considering new economic sanctions.
* Those could include asset freezes and travel bans on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Iranians developing the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program.
* The new approach moves Europe closer to US President Donald Trump’s policy of isolating Iran with tough sanctions even though European governments still support the 2015 Vienna deal from, which he withdrew in May.
* Iran’s firing of short-range ballistic missiles into Syria on Sept. 30, missile tests and a satellite launch this month have niggled Western powers.
* For Europe, alleged assassination plots by Iran on French and Danish soil in 2018 were the last straw.
* The same day as the meeting, the Netherlands publicly blamed Iran for killings on its soil in 2015 and 2017.
* On Jan. 9, the EU designated a unit of Iran’s Intelligence Ministry a terrorist organization, froze its assets and those of two men.
* The EU is set to officially launch a mechanism, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to trade with Iran later this month but it will not be operational for several months.
* EU foreign ministers planned to issue a rare joint statement on Jan. 21 about what they say is Iran’s interference in the region and calling for an end to missile tests.
* EU diplomats said there was a risk that a two-day conference in Poland in February focused on the Middle East, particularly Iran, convened by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could divide eastern and western Europe.

 The image illustrates the仕組み of INSTEX, a European Union-backed system designed to facilitate legitimate trade between Iran and the EU. It aims to circumvent US sanctions imposed on Iran. The system involves a complex mechanism where Iran exports goods such as pistachios to the EU, and the proceeds from these exports are used to pay for Iranian imports of medicine from the EU. The process is facilitated by a bank in the EU, which ensures that no payments go through Iranian hands, thereby complying with US sanctions. The image highlights the key components of INSTEX, including the flow of goods and payments between Iran and the EU, as well as the role of the EU bank in facilitating these transactions.

The sub-events of news article:
* Iran’s judiciary chief, Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani, criticized the new payment system set up by France, Germany, and the UK to allow “legitimate trade” with Iran, saying it has limited capacity and humiliating conditions.
* The new payment channel named the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) was launched by France, Germany, and the UK in the wake of US sanctions.
* European countries have set two “strange conditions” for the mechanism: Iran should join the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and enter negotiations on its missile program.
* Iran will not accept these humiliating conditions and will not accede to any demand at the expense of opening a small waterway such as INSTEX, said Larijani.
* Some experts said the mechanism was useless and won’t change anything for European companies as they cannot feel confident that they could do business with Iran without being subject to US sanctions.

* The Palestinian Authority (PA) paid out NIS 230 million to 13,656 families of "martyrs" (terrorists killed carrying out attacks against Israel) in 2018.
* The figures are based on data from leftist groups, the PA and the Shin Bet, and were prepared by the Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) organization.

* Overall, the PA pays out NIS 732 million (over $200 million) to terrorists and their families, dead or alive.
* Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said that by the end of the week a mechanism should be in place to deduct money transferred to the PA in the amount of payouts to terrorists, as required by Knesset legislation passed last July that came into effect on January 1st.
* PMW head Itamar Marcus said that "the report shows that over 13,000 families of ‘martyr’ terrorists are getting paid by the PA, in addition to some 6,000 terrorists who are getting a salary from the PA. This is a clear measure of how the PA is supporting terror, with all of the consequences that should follow from that."

* Israel views the Palestinian payments as incitement to murder or pay-to-slay, while the Palestinian Authority counter claims that the payments are a source of welfare for families who have lost their main breadwinner.

The sub-events of news article:
* Palestinian Authority (PA) will no longer accept tax revenues collected by Israel due to Israel's decision to trim the sum over the PA’s financial support of militants’ families.
* Israel collects about 700 million shekels ($193 million) in Palestinian taxes and transfers around 600 million shekels of that to the Palestinian Authority after deducting payments for electricity, water, sewage and medical treatment services.
* Israel said it would freeze about 5 percent of that against stipends the Palestinian Authority pays to families of Palestinians killed or jailed by Israel.
* PA will continue to pay out these stipends rather than accept a partial transfer of the tax revenues from Israel.

* Last month the Palestinians declined some $60 million in U.S. annual funding for their security forces, worried about exposure to lawsuits under new U.S. anti-terror laws.
* Washington has further slashed hundreds of millions of dollars to humanitarian organizations and U.N. agencies which aid the Palestinians as it seeks to pressure Abbas to enter peace negotiations with Israel.
* Peace talks have been frozen since 2014.
* The Palestinians suspended ties with Washington after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 and opened the new U.S. Embassy in the city in May.
* Israel has at times withheld the tax money over other matters.

The sub-events of news article:
* Israel has decided to carry out an economic sanction against Palestinian Authority-supported terrorism by deducting the amounts the PA pays out to the families of terrorists imprisoned in Israel and of those killed in carrying out attacks on Israelis.
* The measure was approved by the Israeli government months ago, but it did not obligate Israeli officials to do so.
* After the brutal murder by a Palestinian terrorist of 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher in Yerushalayim two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu decided to seek Cabinet approval to implement the measure.
* The amount in question is $138 million out of a total $222 million, according to estimates quoted by Reuters.
* The PA’s total outlay for terrorists and their families, both living and dead, is about NIS 1.2 billion ($329 million) a year.
* Mahmoud Abbas declared that he will not accept any part of the monthly tax transfer if the deduction is made.
* Neither the U.N. nor the European Union came forth this week to voice support for Israel’s decision to withhold the funds for terror.
* The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe called for the PA to halt its terror payments last year.
* News agencies such as The Associated Press were no help either, as they seemed confused about who the victims and the perpetrators were.

 In the image, a group of elderly people, presumably Holocaust survivors, are seen protesting against the recent anti-Semitic remarks made by Israel's acting foreign minister, Yisrael Katz. They are holding signs and a Polish flag with the word "Polin" written on it, which means "Poland" in Hebrew, and the words "Wejście ma siebie co wy zrobili," which translates to "You did it to yourselves." The protesters are expressing their anger and disappointment at Katz's statement, which they see as a gross distortion of history and a betrayal of the memory of the Holocaust victims.

The sub-events of news article:
* Jews with any connection to the Holocaust tend to harbor prejudice against Poles.
* Despite their 1,000-year sojourn in Poland, Jews were often discriminated against.
* The extermination of the three million Jews concentrated in Poland was the prime Nazi objective.
* Even while suffering from the brutal Nazi oppression, many Poles continued to harbor prejudice against Jews.
* Tens of thousands of Poles collaborated with the Nazis by acting as informants.
* There were also heroic Poles who risked a mandatory death sentence for their help in hiding and saving Jews.
* Antisemitism prevailed in Poland, as evidenced by the 1946 Kielce pogrom.
* When the communists took over Poland in 1945, they suppressed exposure of the genocide.
* In 1968, the Polish government conducted an antisemitic purge, and 30,000 Jews were expelled from the country.
* After the collapse of communism in the early 1990s, the newly independent Polish government sought to create a fresh Polish image based upon nationalism and democracy.
* In 2018, the Polish government passed a law that effectively criminalized anyone “besmirching” the Polish people by associating them with the Nazi genocidal industry applied against the Jews.
* Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki accused Israel’s newly appointed acting foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, of engaging in racist defamation of the Polish people.
* The diplomatic upheaval caused by Katz led to the Polish prime minister canceling Poland’s participation in the Visegrád group summit of Central European countries in Jerusalem.
* Populist and nationalist parties are emerging as powerful political forces in Europe.
* Many of the voters for these nationalist parties support Israel as a bastion of the free world.
* Over the past decade, most of these parties began purging their ranks of antisemites and publicly undertook to eradicate all anti-Jewish elements.
* Israel has no allies in the EU, which is now notorious for its shameless bias and double standards against the Jewish state.
* As long as leaders of the new generation publicly repudiate the crimes of their antecedents and practice what they preach, Israel would be making a major long-term blunder to spurn their support and continue accusing them collectively of being antisemitic.

* Foreign Minister Marek Magierowski called Katz's comment "shameful and racist" and demanded an apology.
* To try and fix the attempts to "distort history" and accuse the Poles of contributing to the Nazi crimes of the WWII era, the Foreign Ministry has issued a booklet, dubbed How it was in reality.
* The booklet, printed in English, German and Polish, is based on interviews with the survivors of Nazi death camps.

 The image shows the trend of Iran-China trade and global oil prices from 1992 to 2022. The blue bars represent the total Iran-China trade in billions of US dollars, while the red line represents the average crude oil price per barrel. The data is from the UN Comtrade, Thomson Reuters, and the US Energy Information Administration.

The image shows that Iran-China trade increased significantly from 1992 to 2012, with a slight dip in 2013. After 2013, the trade volume remained relatively stable until 2022. The average crude oil price per barrel also increased from 1992 to 2008, with a peak in 2008. After 2008, the oil price dropped sharply and remained relatively low until 2022.

The image suggests that there is a positive correlation between Iran-China trade and global oil prices. When the oil price is high, Iran-China trade also tends to be high. This is because China is a major importer of Iranian oil, and the higher the oil price, the more revenue Iran earns from its oil exports. The revenue from oil exports can then be used to purchase goods from China.

* Jordan has been a strong and reliable ally to the US and a staunch supporter of genuine peace for all peoples of the Middle East.

* Jordan is for Jordanians, and the Palestinian state is for Palestinians.
* The Palestinians have been seeking a state of their own for almost a century, and it is high time this long-overdue demand and right is given to the Palestinians through the two-state solution.
* Jordan has welcomed Palestinians and other refugees, out of compassion and a sense of chivalry and responsibility, but it should not be manipulated into being made a permanent home for refugees who are eagerly waiting to go home.

* President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt and the chief of Sudan’s military council Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan met in Cairo to discuss wide-ranging cooperation between the two countries.
* Egypt and Sudan have had a history of ups and downs in their relations, but there is a feeling that the meeting could mark the beginning of solid relations on all fronts.
* Egypt fears that political chaos in Sudan would lead to security chaos, and the fact that the ruling military council is not in full control of the country is pushing major Arab governments to support the transitional ruling council.
* Egypt has been demanding that Sudan stop offering refuge to militant Islamists, including leading figures from the Muslim Brotherhood.
* Al-Burhan made no final promises, but was clearly committed to working with Egypt on security matters.
* Egypt and Sudan have a number of longstanding disagreements beyond security, including Khartoum’s support for Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam.
* Al-Burhan and his second in command, Hamdan Daglo, are pursuing an alliance with the Cairo-Abu Dhabi-Riyadh axis, suggesting the future trajectory of Khartoum’s relations.
* Egypt is also keen to ensure the cooperation of Sudan over Red Sea security.
* The longstanding dispute over Halayeb and Shalatin, the triangle of land on the Egyptian and Sudanese border that both countries claim, was not on the agenda of the Cairo talks between Al-Sisi and Al-Burhan.
* To secure truly positive prospects for Egypt-Sudan relations, it is important that Cairo takes into account the views of Sudan’s revolutionary leaders as well as its military council.
* Egypt’s priority on Sudan is to support the military council and the traditional opposition, but Cairo is also aware that it should not antagonise public opinion in Sudan.
* It is too early to make any final judgements on the path Sudan’s foreign policy is likely to take.

* President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt and the chief of Sudan’s military council Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan met in Cairo to discuss wide-ranging cooperation between the two countries.
* Egypt and Sudan have had a history of ups and downs in their relations, but there is a feeling that the meeting could mark the beginning of solid relations on all fronts.
* Egypt fears that political chaos in Sudan would lead to security chaos, and the fact that the ruling military council is not in full control of the country is pushing major Arab governments to support the transitional ruling council.
* Egypt has been demanding that Sudan stop offering refuge to militant Islamists, including leading figures from the Muslim Brotherhood.
* Al-Burhan made no final promises, but was clearly committed to working with Egypt on security matters.
* Egypt and Sudan have a number of longstanding disagreements beyond security, including Khartoum’s support for Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam.
* Al-Burhan and his second in command, Hamdan Daglo, are pursuing an alliance with the Cairo-Abu Dhabi-Riyadh axis, suggesting the future trajectory of Khartoum’s relations.
* Egypt is also keen to ensure the cooperation of Sudan over Red Sea security.
* The longstanding dispute over Halayeb and Shalatin, the triangle of land on the Egyptian and Sudanese border that both countries claim, was not on the agenda of the Cairo talks between Al-Sisi and Al-Burhan.
* To secure truly positive prospects for Egypt-Sudan relations, it is important that Cairo takes into account the views of Sudan’s revolutionary leaders as well as its military council.
* Egypt’s priority on Sudan is to support the military council and the traditional opposition, but Cairo is also aware that it should not antagonise public opinion in Sudan.
* It is too early to make any final judgements on the path Sudan’s foreign policy is likely to take.

 The infographic shows Egypt's top trading partners and the value of their bilateral trade in 2014. The largest trading partner is the European Union, with a total trade value of $26.7 billion. Other major trading partners include the United States ($14.7 billion), China ($11.2 billion), Saudi Arabia ($7.6 billion), and Russia ($6.4 billion).

The main exports from Egypt are crude oil, petroleum products, and cotton. The main imports to Egypt are machinery, vehicles, and iron and steel.

The image also shows that Egypt's trade with the rest of Africa is relatively small, with a total value of only $5.4 billion in 2014. This is likely due to the fact that many African countries are also major exporters of oil and gas, which means that they compete with Egypt for market share.

* Jason Greenblatt, President Donald Trump’s top Middle East negotiator, led Jewish prayer services at a synagogue in Bahrain during the conference there that rolled out the economic portion of the Trump administration’s peace plan.
* Greenblatt mustered an Orthodox minyan — a quorum of ten adult Jewish males — for morning services Wednesday at the synagogue, which dates to the 19th century.
* The conference wrapped up on its second day without news of whether Jared Kushner, the peace team’s boss and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, had extracted the $50-70 billion in pledges he is seeking to seed the infrastructural changes he says the Palestinian economy needs as a predicate for peace.
* The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the conference, in part because Trump has favored Israel by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and because Trump and Congress have cut off all U.S. funding to the Palestinians.
* The same day the conference opened, on Tuesday, officials of the United Nations Work and Relief Agency, which administers aid to Palestinian refugees and their descendants, garnered $113 million in pledges to help make up for the $360 million the Trump administration had cut in funding for the agency.
* The Bahrain conference, while inconclusive in its immediate goals — Kushner says he will roll out the political component of his plan later this year — was yet another signal of growing acceptance of Israel in the Arab world.
* Bahrain for the first time allowed Israeli journalists to enter to cover the conference.

* Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa said Israel is part of the region's heritage and the Jewish people have a place among them.
* Sheikh Khalid called for improved relations with Israel but reiterated his country's commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative.
* An Israeli journalist published an interview with prominent UAE businessman Mohammed Alabbar, who said young people want to live a life with hope and optimism.
* A handful of Israeli journalists attended the conference in Bahrain, with which their country has no diplomatic relations.
* The Gulf message is that Israel could be a useful, stable ally in a volatile region but only if there is an agreement with the Palestinians.
* It is unlikely the conference in Bahrain will lead directly to full diplomatic relations with Israel without the Palestinian leadership backing the final and political 'deal'.
* Full and proper political normalisation with Israel is still some way off, especially after the United States recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017.
* Normalisation of ties between Arab countries and Israel still depends on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

* The Bahrain conference aimed to provide $50 billion in investments for economic development in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, including for Palestinian refugees.
* Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his colleagues have rejected the Bahrain conference proposals, prioritizing their plan to end Israel's existence through mass immigration.
* Some Arab states and Palestinian businessmen are sympathetic to the Bahrain conference proposals and accept the existence of Israel.
* The Palestinian Authority's insistence on the "right of return" claim hinders discussions on other political issues, such as borders and the status of East Jerusalem.
* In the 2000 Camp David negotiations, President Clinton proposed a similar solution for the "right of return" issue, involving financial assistance and resettlement of Palestinian refugees in other countries, but it was rejected by PLO leader Arafat.
* The Palestinian leadership's rejection of peace is rooted in the ideology of Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini, who opposed Jewish migration to the Palestinian Mandate.
* The UN General Assembly's annual endorsement of resolutions supporting the Palestinian claim of a "right of return" reinforces the Palestinian leadership's stance.
* To achieve Israeli/Palestinian peace, it is crucial for the Palestinian leadership to accept the existence of Israel and abandon the idea of ending its existence through mass population transfer.
