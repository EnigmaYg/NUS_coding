The information extracted from the image:


 The image shows two men in suits, one of whom is Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and the other is an unidentified man. They are shown in a close-up, with their heads bowed together as if in conversation. The background is blurred, and the overall effect is one of intimacy and secrecy. The image is cropped in such a way that only the men's faces are visible, which suggests that the photographer wanted to focus on their expressions and body language. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes the men appear larger and more imposing. The lighting is also dramatic, with the men's faces being cast in shadow. This adds to the sense of mystery and intrigue.

The sub-events of news article:
* Iranian-backed Shiite militias and Sunni tribes have joined Iraq's military in a major operation to retake Tikrit from the Islamic State group, while the U.S.-led coalition has remained on the sidelines.
* The campaign for Tikrit is a dress rehearsal for the real contest: The fight to recapture Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the extremists' biggest stronghold.
* The Tikrit operation is aimed at stopping Islamic State fighters from closing in on Samarra, a Shiite holy city just to the south.
* Directing the offensive with the aid of dozens of Iranian military advisers is a powerful Iranian general, Ghasem Soleimani, commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force.
* The U.S.-led coalition forces are not providing air power in the Tikrit operation because the Iraqis haven't requested them to.
* Liberating Tikrit without the backing of coalition airstrikes will put Iraq's security forces to the ultimate battle-readiness test.
* Iran has long been influential in Iraq, but never so much so as over the past year, when the Iraqi military collapsed in the face of the Sunni extremists' onslaught.
* Embedding coalition advisers and forward air controllers with Iraqi military units presents a twofold challenge: Frontline positions would put their lives in danger and it raises the potential for coalition forces and Iranian soldiers to share a battlefield.
* The U.S.-led mission has hit a roadblock in its efforts to support the Iraqi government, as both the Iraqi and U.S. government agree that airstrikes have pushed the militants back but there will come a point where airstrikes alone will not be enough.
* Most of the battlefield successes in Iraq have been coordinated efforts, with Iraqi and Kurdish forces and Shiite militias fighting on the ground and the U.S.-led coalition providing air power.
* The military operation to retake Mosul is planned for as early as April, but many are skeptical about whether the Iraqi military will be ready for the fight.
* The failure so far to make headway in Tikrit does not bode well, as Iraqi forces are bogged down on the outskirts of the city, unable to penetrate the extremists' defenses.
* The Islamic State group has littered major roadways with mines that slow any ground advance and require painstaking clearance operations before troops can safely move through.
* The battle for Tikrit is likely to involve Iraq's first serious urban warfare challenge, involving street battles that Iraqi security forces are not trained for.
* Concerns are also mounting over the Shiite militias' battlefield conduct in a largely Sunni region where some residents are said to have initially welcomed the Islamic State militants as a better alternative to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.
* Winning over the Sunni tribes is essential because they know the terrain of the Sunni-majority areas under Islamic State control and can fight with and advise the Shiite fighters.
* Heavy Iranian involvement only threatens to exacerbate sectarian tensions.

* Concerns are also mounting over the Shiite militias' battlefield conduct in a largely Sunni region where some residents are said to have initially welcomed the Islamic State militants as a better alternative to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.
* Winning over the Sunni tribes is essential because they know the terrain of the Sunni-majority areas under Islamic State control and can fight with and advise the Shiite fighters.
* Heavy Iranian involvement only threatens to exacerbate sectarian tensions.

The sub-events of news article:
* The Iraqi army's latest effort to defeat ISIS militants and reclaim Tikrit coincided with the public debate on the perceived emergence of a new Sunni bloc against the backdrop of Turkish-Saudi rapprochement.
* A notable aspect of the military campaign was the prominent role Tehran-backed Shiite militias and, in particular, Qasim Suleimani played.
* Iran follows a policy of expansion by accumulating greater soft and hard power.
* Tehran's expansionist tendencies can be traced back to the post-1979 efforts to export the Islamic revolution.
* The U.S. occupation of Iraq in 2003 created new opportunities for Shiite sectarianism.
* Shiite sectarianism has most recently become embodied by militias in Syria and Iraq.
* According to U.S. Gen. Dempsey, the militias comprise two-thirds of all fighters on the ground.
* A number of those groups remain terror-listed by the United States.
* The U.S. conveniently ignores the issue of foreign fighters among the ranks of Shiite militias.
* The current situation not only consolidates Iran's leadership role in the Shiite world but also triggers hatred toward the Shiite community among Sunni Muslims.
* Iran's efforts to obtain soft power through over 40 state-funded media outlets hardly exerts any influence over anyone beyond the Shiite community.
* The country's emphasis on hard power faces resistance from Sunni Muslims.
* Regional powers must step up their efforts to balance Iran out in order to help create a new order in the Middle East.

* The fight against the Islamic State group in Tikrit is at a standstill, as the Iraqi military reorganizes itself on the front lines.
* Some leaders in the Iraqi military are considering asking new forces, including Shiites, to enter the fight against the Islamic State group in Tikrit.
* The approach is igniting decade-old rifts between Shiite and Sunni fighters and is perpetuating the military's distrust of Iranian-backed Shiite militias.
* The sectarian divisions between the paramilitary and military forces in Iraq pose a problem not just in defeating ISIS in Tikrit but also in repelling the militant group in other Sunni-majority places such as Anbar province.
* The battle for Tikrit was one of the Iraqi military’s first major attacks on ISIS since the militant group took Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, in June.
* The Iraqi military is halting its assault in Tikrit to minimize casualties.
* Some military leaders have been quoted as saying they want the U.S.-led coalition to intervene, from the air, in the battle for Tikrit.
* The U.S. has distanced itself from working directly with Shiite paramilitary fighting groups by conducting airstrikes.
* American air support for Iran-backed fighters would look awkward in Tehran as well; Shiite armed groups, most of whom are backed by Iranian money, say they do not need air support from the U.S.-led coalition.
* The Iraqi military has so far not officially asked the U.S. to intervene with airstrikes in Tikrit.
* Washington, D.C., insists that ISIS is retreating from Tikrit.

* Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert expressed shock and disappointment that the U.S. government did not veto U.N. Security Council Resolution 280, which he believes will create obstacles in the peace process by raising unrealistic expectations on the part of the Palestinians regarding the future of Jerusalem.
* The resolution, which was passed Friday, criticized the killings of at least 29 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque and called for measures to guarantee that Palestinians be protected in the future and for the speedy implementation of the self-rule accord signed last September in Washington.
* The resolution's preamble contained language regarding Jerusalem that Jewish leaders found impossible to swallow, referring to "territories occupied by Israel in June 1967, including Jerusalem."
* In a compromise formula worked out before the resolution came to a vote, the United States was able to abstain on this and another paragraph of the preamble while being able to approve the resolution as a whole.
* The United States abstained on a paragraph about the status of Jerusalem and a second paragraph that said the Hebron attack "underlines the need to provide protection and security for the Palestinian people."
* A paragraph in the main body of the resolution, which the United States supported, called for an international presence in the territories, which was provided for in the declaration of principles that formed the basis of the Palestinian self-rule accord.
* While the United States twice abstained during the voting, the 14 other members of the Security Council voted for every paragraph in the resolution.
* Following the resolution's passage, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had agreed to return to Washington next month to resume negotiations with Israel.
* The Clinton administration's handling of the resolution was sharply attacked by the American Jewish leadership and members of Congress, who criticized the administration for sacrificing core principles for short-term objectives.
* Jewish groups expressed disappointment with the resolution's preamble, which referred to Jerusalem as occupied territory, but supported the overall thrust of the resolution's condemnation of the Hebron killings and its call for a speedy resumption of the Israeli-PLO dialogue.
* Reps. Charles Schumer and Nita Lowey criticized the resolution, questioning why a similar resolution was not introduced before the Security Council regarding the killings of Israelis by Arab terrorists.
* The Clinton administration has been working on damage control, reaffirming its position recognizing a united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and explaining that the United States would have exercised its veto if the reference to Jerusalem had been in an operative paragraph of the resolution rather than in its preamble.

* Israel's chief of delegation, Abba S. Eban, refused to comment on the Burns report at Thursday's Security Council meeting, a move that was praised by observers.

* Halpern accused the Administration of “a lack of will power and resolve” in going along on the resolution and noted that “Israel has certainly as much right to defend her territory against guerrilla terrorism as we have to defend South Vietnam.”
* Israel Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin warned Jordan that neither it nor the terrorists it is harboring “will dictate to us how to react or in what proportion.”
* The triennial convention of B’nai B’rith Women adopted a resolution deploring the Security Council resolution that condemned Israel in a manner that “unfairly gave way to the Soviet-Arab bloc.”

The sub-events of news article:
* The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning Israel's attack on Gaza as a violation of the cease-fire provisions and inconsistent with the obligations of the Israel-Egyptian armistice agreement and the UN Charter.
* The resolution called upon Israel to take all necessary measures to prevent such actions.
* The United States, Britain, and France said that while Egypt must be held responsible for numerous acts of violence on the Israel frontier, the Western powers do not consider Israel’s retaliatory attack on Gaza justified.
* American delegate Henry Cabot Lodge referred to the 1950 Tripartite Declaration by the United States, Britain, and France and to a public statement made by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that should these three powers find that any of the Middle East states was preparing to violate frontiers or armistice lines, the “Big Three” would immediately take action both within and outside the United Nations to prevent such a violation.
* Ambassador Lodge emphasized that Secretary Dulles also said in his statement that Israel should become part of the Middle East community and cease to look upon itself, or be looked upon by others, as alien to this community.
* Lodge stated that to achieve this would require concessions on both sides.
* Lodge noted that General E.L.M. Burns, UN truce supervisor, had pointed out in his report that infiltration from Egyptian-controlled territory, while not the only cause of tension prior to the Gaza incident, had undoubtedly been one of its main causes.
* The U.S. Government believed that whatever the provocation might have been in this case, there was no justification for the Israeli military action at Gaza.
* The Security Council had made the point clear three times previously that Israel’s retaliatory actions were inconsistent with its Charter obligations.
* The Security Council believed that the Gaza incident was the fourth incident and the United States believed it was most serious because of its obvious premeditation.
* Sir Pierson Dixon, British delegate, called the Egyptian attack on the Israel wedding party at the Patish settlement an “outrage.”
* Henri Hoppenot, the French delegate, said that the Gaza action appeared to be a military action, deliberately planned and carried out by regular Israeli forces, “for purposes of intimidation and reprisal.”
* Soviet delegate Arkadi Sobolev declared that the statements of Israel, Egypt, and Gen. Burns had indicated that Israel was responsible for the Gaza attack and that therefore the Council had to take action to censure Israel.

* Moshe Shertok, representing the Jewish Agency, spoke against trusteeship and for the continuation of U.N. plans to implement the partition decision.
* Shertok emphasized that if a truce is achieved in Palestine, there must be an international authority to maintain and supervise it.
* Shertok argued that the U.S. proposal for a truce was "misleading" because it presented a distorted picture of the situation in Palestine by giving the impression that it was a purely local matter and that both sides were actually at fault.
* Shertok warned that Jerusalem was in danger of becoming a battlefield, even a "shambles," and emphasized that it was the responsibility of the United Nations to enforce peace and order in this city.
* U.S. delegate Warren Austin invited all of the Council members to meet on Monday afternoon to consider the U.S. proposal for a temporary U.N. trusteeship over Palestine.

* General von Horn accused both Syria and Israel of denying “freedom of movement” to the UN military observers in the demilitarized zone along the Lake Tiberias shore opposite Israel.

* Iran has rejected a request by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect the country's Parchin nuclear facilities.
* Iran has clarified its position on the subject and that there has been no policy change.
* The IAEA visited the Parchin site twice in 2005 in a voluntary cooperation by Iran to build trust with the world community.
* In mid-2014, an explosion occurred in the site, which Western powers, the US in particular, used to raise doubt about the nature of the activities carried out there.
* Iranian officials said the "fire" was the result of "chemical reactions of flammable material".
* The group P5+1 (the US, UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany) has been pushing an idea to gain more access not only to Iran's nuclear facilities, but military and other centers.
* Iran has strongly rejected the idea, stressing that visiting military sites is a red line with the Islamic Republic.
* Tehran has also said that its voluntary cooperation with the IAEA for inspecting the nuclear sites does not mean granting the international organization unlimited access to its facilities.
* Tehran stresses adherence to international norms and regulations.
* Head of Iran Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi said April 26 that it is possible that Iran would allow the IAEA access to non-nuclear sites under conditions.
* Iranian nuclear negotiators face the parliament that has so far not deemed it necessary to approve the Additional Protocol to the NPT.
* Iranian lawmakers tried to retaliate against the US Senate's move in giving the Congress a say on a final agreement by drafting a similar bill that would oblige its government to okay the deal with the legislative body before approval.

The sub-events of news article:
* Iran will have to accept inspections of its military sites if it signs a nuclear deal with world powers.
* Iran has agreed to implementing the Additional Protocol of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that allows for snap inspections of its nuclear facilities, and if required, military sites.
* Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out allowing nuclear inspectors to visit military sites or the questioning of scientists.
* Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the protocol allows “some access” but not inspections of military sites, in order to protect national “military or economic secrets.”
* The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has the right to request access at all locations, including military ones.
* Iran and the so-called P5+1 group have been engaged for nearly two years in negotiations on Tehran’s nuclear drive.
* Iran has agreed to cut the number of its centrifuges, used for enriching uranium, by two thirds from 19,000 to about 6,000.
* Iran has also reportedly agreed not to build any new facilities for enriching uranium for 15 years, cut back its stockpile of enriched uranium and mothball some of its plants.
* The IAEA is at the same time trying to probe allegations that Iran tried to develop nuclear weapons prior to 2003, and possibly since.
* Iran denies the allegations, saying they are based on hostile intelligence provided by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel’s Mossad.
* The IAEA has identified 12 areas to clarify, including the Parchin military base, where they suspect tests relating to the development of nuclear weapons have taken place.
* If a deal is reached with the P5+1, the IAEA will be charged with overseeing it and reporting back to the UN Security Council.
* The IAEA will need to prepare well and plan well for the most extensive safeguard operation of the IAEA.
* Currently the watchdog has between four and 10 inspectors in Iran at any given time, and if a deal is reached at least 10 will need to be on the ground daily.

The sub-events of news article:
* The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Yukia Amano said that in cases of "inconsistency" of information, Iran would be asked to submit to inspections of military sites.
* Iran has consistently denied any ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon but has not fully cooperated with international inspections and has masked some program, leading to suspicions there was research to develop a military component in the nuclear sector.
* Iran has said it will not open up military sites to the IAEA or other inspectors for reasons of national security.
* Amano said that this would not be acceptable after an agreement with the international community.
* Iran, in the event of inspection requests, says it wants 24 days' notice of any such process, but French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius last week intimated that this was excessive.
* Amano said his Vienna-based agency "has the right to request access to all locations, including military ones."
* It would take some time, possibly "several months", to determine if Iran was doing military, nuclear research and development.
* The IAEA has located twelve sites in Iran where it needs clarification on what "sensitive activities", if any, were being carried out there.

* For example, no country reported that General Qassem Suleimani, commander of the elite Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, violated a UN-mandated travel ban despite “a number of media reports with photographs and videos” showing him in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
* The report included examples of such photos.

* Israel has repeatedly said that Iran poses an existential threat to the country.
* Pro-Israel organizations have called for stricter sanctions and opposing the concessions the United States has reportedly made to placate the Iranians.
* Congress is powerless to stop Obama from appeasing Iran.
* If press reports are accurate, the proposed agreement will allow Iran to remain on the threshold of building nuclear weapons, to continue its advanced missile research, to continue uranium enrichment, to prevent inspections of military sites, to refuse to disclose information about its past nuclear activities and to continue to promote terrorism and the destabilization of the region.
* The legislation passed by Congress to allow it to review any agreement the president signed is toothless; Obama can ignore it and will if need be.
* Opponents of the Iran framework have been unable to counter Obama’s false dichotomy of an agreement or war.
* The only hope of preventing a bad agreement is for the leaders of the pro-Israel community to mobilize the public the way they did in the heyday of the Soviet Jewry movement.

* Ben Barak noted that there is “almost no area in the Middle East today where Iran remains uninvolved: Iraq, where Iranian interests are in line with US interests, Lebanon, where Hezbollah is effectively an Iranian division, and Yemen, which was mostly conquered by Iran.”
* Ben Barak said he shared the view that countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia were almost certain to enter a nuclear arms race to counterbalance Iran’s nuclear aspirations.
* Ben Barak said Iran’s proxy, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, may lose its war in Syria against the Islamic State, one instance where the Sunni-Shiite conflict rages closer to Israel.

* The Israel Project CEO and President Josh Block issued a statement in response to the announced nuclear agreement with Iran.
* The nuclear agreement with Iran is a realization of the deepest fears and the most dire predictions of skeptics.
* The deal will give Iran billions in cash and sanctions relief to fuel its terror and war machines.
* The deal will shred the hard-won sanctions regime beyond repair and enable the Iranians to get away with hiding the full extent of their nuclear work, infrastructure, and know-how.
* The deal will not have an enforceable inspections regime or a workable way to re-impose pressure on Iran when it cheats.
* After just over a decade, most of this deal will expire, and Iran will be allowed to have a full-blown nuclear program.
* Iran’s repressive regime needs economic relief far more than the US needs an agreement by these terms.
* President Obama promised Congress and the American people that he would secure a good deal or walk away, but he could not bring home a good deal and could not bring himself to walk away.
* President Obama walked away from every key position demanding the shuttering or dismantlement of Iran’s military nuclear infrastructure.
* The American people and their lawmakers rightly do not trust Iran.
* Congress will review this accord over the next 60 days and acknowledge that the President has not lived up to the promises that he made.
* Congress must insist on a better deal and reject this bad deal.

The sub-events of news article:
* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decried an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program hundreds of times.
* The agreement finalized Tuesday morning in Vienna will relieve Iran of crippling international sanctions in return for Iran limiting its uranium enrichment, ridding most of its stockpile of enriched uranium and submitting to agreed-upon inspections of its nuclear facilities.
* The deal stipulates that Iran freeze and store — but not dismantle — much of its nuclear infrastructure, and requires inspectors to request access to some Iranian facilities before entering.
* Sanctions are set to be lifted once Iran fulfills its commitments to deactivate centrifuges, restructure its nuclear facilities and transfer or dilute its uranium stockpile.
* Sanctions could be restored within 65 days if a committee of representatives from world powers and Iran determines that Iran has violated the agreement.
* Portions of the accord will expire between 10 and 25 years from the date the accord is adopted.
* The United Nations Security Council is expected to endorse the accord in a resolution.
* Netanyahu has made opposing Iran’s nuclear program the defining issue of his premiership, and has consistently criticized the potential agreement since negotiations began in 2013.
* The agreement also was criticized by Israeli opposition leaders, and the Israeli public has long been skeptical of a deal.
* The only thing standing in the way of the deal’s implementation now is a vote in Congress.
* Senators and congressmen will have two months to parse the deal’s details, and will vote to accept or reject it when Congress reconvenes in September.
* Obama has promised to veto a rejection, and overriding that veto would require a two-thirds majority in both houses.
* Israel will need to build a broad coalition of the deal’s opponents — including former members of the Obama administration — if it is to convince enough lawmakers to reject the deal.
* Republicans have staunchly opposed a deal.
* Some experts said that Netanyahu’s March speech before Congress damaged the effort to fight the deal by forcing Democratic members of Congress to choose between backing Israel and supporting Obama.
* Should the effort in Congress fail, some Israeli politicians have declared that there’s only one avenue left to prevent a nuclear Iran: a military strike.
* Experts have assessed that an Israeli strike on Iran would not be able to destroy its nuclear program.
* A strike has grown more likely, as the deal has left Iran with the capability to enrich uranium, giving it the ability to produce a bomb.

* Nuclear Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz said Israel was like the boy in the fairy tale who pointed out the emperor had no clothes, criticizing the nuclear deal with Iran.

* Steinitz said Israel is agitated by the fact that Iran will have access to around $100 billion of frozen assets as soon as the deal is implemented.
* Steinitz said Israel reserves the right to defend itself unilaterally if required.

 The image shows an aerial view of the Parchin military complex in Iran. It is a large, sprawling complex with several buildings and structures. The complex is located in a desert area and is surrounded by a fence.

The image is significant because it provides a visual representation of the Parchin military complex, which is at the center of allegations that Iran has conducted nuclear weapons experiments. The image shows that the complex is a large and well-developed facility, which suggests that it could be capable of carrying out such experiments. The image also shows that the complex is located in a remote area, which would make it difficult for inspectors to monitor its activities.

The image is a valuable piece of evidence in the investigation into Iran's nuclear program. It provides visual confirmation of the existence of the Parchin military complex and suggests that it could be capable of carrying out nuclear weapons experiments. The image also raises questions about Iran's willingness to cooperate with the IAEA's investigation.

 The image is a decision tree that models the decision-making process of a powerful state when considering a military strike against a weaker state. It shows that the powerful state will first assess whether the weaker state's actions pose a high threat to its national security. If so, it will then consider whether it has the capability to disrupt the weaker state's nuclear program. If it does, it will then consider whether its national security policy advocates preemptive strikes. If so, it will then consider whether the weaker state has crossed its redlines. If so, it will then consider whether it has domestic support for a military strike. If so, it will then decide to use military force.

The sub-events of news article:
* Iran will be allowed to use its own experts to inspect a site it allegedly used to develop nuclear arms under a secret agreement with the UN agency that normally carries out such work.
* The agreement diverges from normal inspection procedures between the IAEA and a member country by essentially ceding the agency’s investigative authority to Iran.
* Iran will provide agency experts with photos and videos of locations the IAEA says are linked to the alleged weapons work, “taking into account military concerns.”
* IAEA experts would normally take environmental samples for evidence of any weapons development work, but the agreement stipulates that Iranian technicians will do the sampling.
* The main focus of the July 14 deal between Iran and six world powers is curbing Iran’s present nuclear program that could be used to make weapons.
* Iran and the UN agency agreed last month to wrap up the investigation by December, when the IAEA plans to issue a final assessment on the allegations.

* Iran will be allowed to use its own experts to look for signs of nuclear weapons work at a contested military facility.
* The secret agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the Parchin facility has emerged as one of the most contested aspects of the multinational deal signed by the U.S., Iran and five other world powers.
* Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said that the details of the agreement “would not be unlike causing athletes to just mail in their own urine specimens in the mail, and us believing that it came from them.”
* House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other GOP lawmakers were quick to blast the “secret” agreement Wednesday.
* Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) — the No. 2 Senate Republican — said the deal is based on a “remarkably naïve” trust of Iran.
* The former deputy director general of the IAEA, Olli Heinonen, told the AP that he could not think of a single instance in which a country being monitored for nuclear work has been allowed to do its own investigations.
* Under the terms of the agreement, Iran has agreed to provide the IAEA with photos and videos of areas that may be linked to weapons work.
* The White House has repeatedly denied allegations that the bilateral agreement between Iran and the IAEA is a “secret side-deal” to the main nuclear accord.

Under the terms of this agreement, the Iranian inspectors would report their findings to the IAEA. However, the agreement has been met with strong criticism from Israeli and American opponents of the nuclear deal, who argue that it will allow Iran to continue its nuclear weapons program. Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz was particularly scathing in his criticism, sarcastically asking if the Iranian inspectors would also have to wait 24 days before being able to visit the site and look for incriminating evidence.

* Iran will inspect itself at its most sensitive known military complex to clear up suspicions of past military activity.
* Iran is required to "close the file" on past military dimensions of its nuclear program before it can get sanctions relief and proceed with the long-term nuclear deal negotiated in Vienna.
* Two senior U.S. officials told NBC News that the unusual arrangement between the IAEA and Tehran relates only to past military activity and that UN inspectors, including IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, would be on site to supervise the Iranians at every step of the way.
* A senator who opposes the deal and attended classified briefings on the IAEA's role at the Parchin complex southeast of Tehran disputes the claim that IAEA inspectors will be inside the Parchin facility while soil samples are being taken.
* The senator says the IAEA will be outside the facility where the soil samples are being taken - a concession to save face for Iran.
* Congress has not been shown the side deal negotiated between the IAEA and Tehran.
* The administration claims the future inspection regime is unprecedented in its intrusiveness.
* The Parchin "side deal" is becoming a key talking point against the deal by critics.

* The State Department denied the UN atomic watchdog agreed to let Iran inspect its own nuclear facilities, rejecting revelations of a secret side deal between the Islamic Republic and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
* The Associated Press reported on a previously undisclosed side deal between Iran and the IAEA that would allow Tehran to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it has been accused of using to develop nuclear arms at least a decade ago.
* State Department spokesman John Kirby dismissed the report, saying in “no way” would the UN nuclear agency cede its oversight to Iran.
* Olli Heinonen, in charge of the Iran investigation as IAEA deputy director general from 2005 through 2010, said he could think of no similar arrangement — a country essentially allowed to carry out much of the probe of suspicions against it.
* Republican lawmakers have been severely critical of the broader agreement to limit Iran’s future nuclear programs, signed by the Obama administration, Iran and five world powers in July.
* House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi questioned the significance of the disclosure, noting it relates to investigations of past military work, not nuclear dealings going forward.
* Pelosi asserted that House Democrats have the votes to uphold any Obama veto of a congressional resolution disapproving of the Iran agreement.
* The director general of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, defended the agreement the agency reached with Iran concerning the Parchin military site, saying the arrangements are technically sound and consistent with long-established practices.
* Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman of Iran’s nuclear agency, called the AP report “media speculation” without denying its substance.
* The document seen by the AP is a draft that one official familiar with its contents said doesn’t differ substantially from the final version.
* The document suggests that instead of carrying out their own probe, IAEA staff will monitor Iranian personnel as they inspect the Parchin nuclear site.

The sub-events of news article:
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is conducting a campaign against the nuclear deal with Iran, hoping to defy Capitol Hill arithmetic and inspire enough American lawmakers to thwart it.
* Netanyahu has good reasons to be skeptical about the accord six world powers signed with Iran last month, fearing the cementing of the ayatollahs’ regime, increased terrorism, the establishment of Iran as a regional power, and perhaps even mushroom clouds over Israel.
* Netanyahu's relentless and vociferous lobbying against the deal is causing severe climate change in the already-not-so-warm ties between Washington and Jerusalem.
* The US administration was, is and will remain willing to provide Israel with military assistance, and has even pledged to be more generous than usual because of the Iran deal.
* Israel’s aggressive lobbying, which includes speaking to US lawmakers about a “moral duty” to oppose the deal, is proving corrosive.
* US President Barack Obama has openly criticized the Israeli government’s “unprecedented” effort to scuttle the deal, but insists that it will go unpunished.
* Talks about upgrading Israel’s military capabilities are conducted by human beings, not robots. Israel’s interlocutors in the Pentagon will naturally not be as well-disposed toward the Jewish state as they would have been had Jerusalem not been fighting a bitter campaign seeking to kill the president’s most important foreign policy initiative.
* Netanyahu believes that his public fight with the administration will lead Democrats to want to “mend fences with Jewish voters,” especially ahead of the 2016 presidential elections, and press the government to be especially generous to Israel when it finally discusses an increase in US military aid.
* Netanyahu’s confrontation with the White House and his call on American Jews to oppose the deal is liable to have at least two other undesired side effects: turning support for Israel into a partisan issue and leading to serious rifts in the American Jewish community.

The sub-events of news article:
* A group of rabbis across religious denominations expressed concerns with the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran.
* The rabbis believe the agreement will harm the short-term and long-term interests of the United States and its allies, particularly Israel.
* If implemented, Iran will receive up to $150 billion without committing to changing its behavior, including denying basic human rights, calling for America's downfall and Israel's annihilation, and denying the Holocaust.
* The deal will not subject Iran to a comprehensive inspections structure, allowing the regime to violate the agreement and develop a covert nuclear program.
* The deal will lift key arms embargos, giving Iran international legitimacy to arm terror groups with conventional weapons and ballistic missiles in eight years.
* The agreement entitles Iran to develop advanced centrifuges after 10 years, paving the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons with virtually zero "breakout time."
* The rabbis agree with assessments from leaders and experts in the United States and Israel that a better deal is possible and necessary.
* The rabbis call upon Senators and Representatives to vote against the deal and support the opposition of many Jewish organizations.
* The rabbis emphasize the critical responsibility to shape a better world for future generations and insist on a better deal.

* Iran will have the ability to make as many centrifuges as they want, enrich as much uranium as they want to whatever level that they want within 13 years under the deal.
* The deal will put the Iranian Islamic state that practices terrorism worldwide on the threshold of an entire nuclear arsenal.
* Obama said those who want a better deal typically mean that they want Iran not to have any nuclear program at all, even a peaceful one.
* Obama compared tensions between the US and Israel over the nuclear deal to a family feud and said he expected quick improvements in ties between the longtime allies once the accord was implemented.
* Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., became the 30th senator to publicly back the agreement.
* Obama has vowed to veto the resolution if it passes, and Democrats could hold off Republican efforts to override his veto if they get 34 votes.
* The president encouraged skeptics of the agreement to “overcome the emotions” that have infused the debate and evaluate the accord based on facts.
* Obama sought to refute criticism of the accord point by point.
* He disputed the notion that Iran would funnel the bulk of the money it receives from the sanctions relief into terrorism.
* He also said the agreement wasn’t built on trusting Iran’s government, which frequently spouts anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric.

The sub-events of news article:
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's public warmongering and confrontational policies played a major role in shaping the US strategy against Iran, leading to the nuclear deal.
* Israel's previous policy was to avoid taking a leading role in the campaign against Iran's nuclear program and to coordinate all major strategic decisions with the US.
* The Mossad was responsible for executing Israel's anti-Iranian policy, which included sanctions, covert operations, and exploiting ethnic divisions in Iran.
* The Stuxnet computer virus, which damaged Iran's uranium-enrichment centrifuges, was a joint project of the Israeli and American intelligence communities, initiated and executed by the Mossad.
* Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak's public threats and military preparations led the Obama administration to believe that Israel was serious about a military strike, increasing anxiety and leading to the decision to negotiate a deal with Iran.
* The US approach to the negotiations was hasty, resulting in a less than perfect deal with weaknesses in punitive measures and inspection clauses.
* The deal paves the way for Iran to purchase better air defense systems, making a future military strike more dangerous.
* Netanyahu should have coordinated his concerns with the US administration to influence the outcome of the deal and define red lines for substantial violations.

* Moscow informed Israel of its plan to launch air strikes in Syria before the attacks.
* Russian warplanes struck in two Syrian provinces alongside regime aircraft and provided targeting guidance for regime aircraft in a third.
* Israel had been given advance notice by the Russians.
* The notice came just over a week after a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which the two agreed on a mechanism to avoid "misunderstandings" and clashes in Syrian airspace between the two militaries' jets.
* Israeli military officials reportedly fear that the Russian air presence could cut their room for maneuver after several purported strikes on Iranian arms transfers to Hizbullah through Syria in recent months that were not officially acknowledged by Israeli authorities.
* Israel opposes President Bashar Assad's regime in Syria but has sought to avoid being dragged into the conflict there.
* The provinces targeted on Wednesday were far from Israel.
* The strikes marked the formal start of Moscow's military intervention in the conflict.

The information extracted from the image:


 The image shows a map of Syria, with the location of Homs highlighted. Homs is a city in central Syria that has been heavily contested during the Syrian civil war. The image is significant because it provides a visual representation of the location of the air strikes that were carried out by Russian warplanes. The air strikes were part of Russia's military intervention in the Syrian civil war, which began in 2015. The intervention has been a major turning point in the conflict, and has helped to tip the balance in favor of the Syrian government.

* Russia's air strikes in Syria have restricted Israel's freedom of action and maneuverability in Syria.
* Russia's air strikes targeted positions of rebel groups opposing the regime of President Bashar Assad, including factions supported by the US.
* Russia is trying to create a division of labor that is not to the liking of the US and its Arab and Western coalition partners assembled to fight on two fronts: the Assad regime and Islamic State.
* The big winner of the new situation is Assad and his failed regime.
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have met with Russian officials to discuss "deconfliction" to avoid accidental clashes between Israel and the Russia armies.
* Putin hopes to achieve the following aims: to help Assad to consolidate his regime, to ensure Russian access to warm water ports in the Mediterranean, to safeguard Russia's last bastion and stronghold (Syria) in the Middle East, to enable Putin to conduct a confrontational foreign policy against the US, to leverage Syria as a bargaining chip for Russia to enhance agreements across the board, to contain ISIS, and to avoid sending "boots on the ground" to fight in Syria.
* The bloody civil war that has already caused the death of more than 250,000 Syrians will be prolonged because of Russian involvement, at least in the short term.
* Against the background of negative ramifications on Israel's security posture, there is a possible positive side: the continuation of the war benefits Israel by enhancing its standing as an unmatched regional power, while Hezbollah and Iran are weakened by their involvement.

* Russia understands Israel's security concerns better than the Obama administration and the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party.
* Obama has failed to challenge the Russians in Europe and the Chinese in Asia, and his administration has never had a Syrian policy.
* The success of the Bush experiment in democracy within Iraq led to the Arab Spring, but Obama's support for the pro-Iranian al-Maliki government and its repression of the Sunni community in Iraq led to the rise of the Jihadi extremists.
* The Obama administration's failure to follow up its words of condemnation against Assad with any real action led to a region-wide Sunni response against a perceived US tilt toward Iran.
* Russia entered Syria because it saw the Islamic State as a far more potent danger than the initial peaceful democratic opposition in Syria or a successful electoral process in Iraq.
* Moscow understands that for there to be a serious political settlement in Syria, Iranian influence needs to be vastly reduced and its links to non-state actors eliminated.
* Russia claims to have some kind of understanding with Israel, but Iranian hegemony is as serious a threat to Jerusalem as it is to the Sunni world.
* The US elections are only a year away, and President Putin cannot count on an isolationist US administration to be installed.
* The Russian "spring" has caused the US position on Syria to harden, and its allies, such as Turkey, Germany, France, and eastern Europe, are deeply concerned over Russian actions.
* The future of NATO is under severe pressure due to Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria.
* Events in Taiwan and the South China Sea, as well as Ukraine and Syria, are propelling the world into very dangerous territory.

* An Iranian resupply of its proxies in Yemen could become the theatre of a superpower showdown.
* President Putin knows that Shiite supremacy will be fought tooth and nail, and Iranian nuclear weapons are not in his interest.
* A political settlement in Syria requires a broad regional and global superstructure in order to be implemented on the ground.
* Moscow needs Jerusalem to help build that regional structure through an understanding on the future of nuclear weapons within the region.
* President Putin also needs the cooperation of the US in order to establish such a regional settlement.
* The Middle East could continue to deteriorate into superpower proxy client states, all with a destabilized nuclear arms component, or the region could seek genuine peace.
* Iran's recent missile test and its now documented underground missile bases assure movement toward an apocalyptical nuclear scenario.
* The region of the Middle East will either help to establish a multipolar cooperative world order or continue on the path it's already on and pay the consequences.

* The Russian "spring" has caused the US position on Syria to harden, and its allies, such as Turkey, Germany, France, and eastern Europe, are deeply concerned over Russian actions.
* The future of NATO is under severe pressure due to Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria.
* Events in Taiwan and the South China Sea, as well as Ukraine and Syria, are propelling the world into very dangerous territory.

* President Putin knows that Shiite supremacy will be fought tooth and nail, and Iranian nuclear weapons are not in his interest.
* A political settlement in Syria requires a broad regional and global superstructure in order to be implemented on the ground.
* Moscow needs Jerusalem to help build that regional structure through an understanding on the future of nuclear weapons within the region.
* President Putin also needs the cooperation of the US in order to establish such a regional settlement.
* The Middle East could continue to deteriorate into superpower proxy client states, all with a destabilized nuclear arms component, or the region could seek genuine peace.
* Iran's recent missile test and its now documented underground missile bases assure movement toward an apocalyptical nuclear scenario.
* The region of the Middle East will either help to establish a multipolar cooperative world order or continue on the path it's already on and pay the consequences.
* The three superpowers, Russia, China, and the US, must begin to cooperate and lead the way toward a durable world peace.

* Iran is poised to export its first oil shipments to Europe since international economic sanctions were lifted in mid-January.
* Two million barrels of oil are being pumped aboard a tanker at Kharg Island in the Gulf, bound for French energy giant Total.
* Another two tankers are preparing to ship a million barrels each to Spain's CEPSA and Lukoil of Russia.
* Loading of the tankers would be complete within 24 hours.
* In early 2012, the European Union and United States strengthened economic sanctions against Iran because of its controversial nuclear programme, forcing the Islamic republic to halt oil exports to Europe.
* Since then, Asia -- mainly India and China -- have been the main market for Iranian oil.
* Iran's nuclear agreement last July with world powers means that now that most of the sanctions have been lifted it can resume oil exports to Europe.
* Last month, the National Oil Company said it had ordered production to increase by 500,000 bpd -- a move Tehran had long planned once the nuclear deal with world powers took effect.
* When President Hassan Rouhani visited France in January, a deal was signed with Total to buy 160,000 bpd.
* Oil prices rose on Monday with US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery climbing 57 cents to $33.01 per barrel from Friday's close.

* France will recognize a Palestinian state if a final push for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians fails.
* US-led efforts to broker peace for a two-state solution collapsed in April 2014.
* Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has repeatedly warned that letting the status quo continue risks killing off a two-state solution.
* Last year, Fabius failed to get the United States on board to push for a UN Security Council resolution to set parameters for talks between the two sides and set a final deadline for a deal.
* The expansions of settlements by Israel since have been described by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as "provocative acts" that raise questions about its commitment to a two-state solution.
* Fabius has previously called for an international support group comprising Arab states, the European Union and UN Security Council members that would essentially force the two sides to compromise.
* Fabius said Paris would begin preparing in the "coming weeks" an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European and Arab.
* If this last attempt at finding a solution hits a wall, "well in this case, we need to face our responsibilities by recognising the Palestinian state", he said.
* A French diplomatic source said the aim was to launch the conference before the summer and that it would not be accompanied by a UN Security Council resolution, which would inevitably fail.
* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously criticized recent French initiatives, calling them "counter-productive".
* Despite anger in the US administration over Israeli settlements, there is little prospect of US President Barack Obama supporting any initiative that could upset the US Jewish lobby just 10 months before an election.

The sub-events of news article:
* France proposed an international summit in Paris to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and preserve the two-state solution.
* France warned that it would recognize a Palestinian state if the initiative fails.
* Israel called the French initiative "puzzling" and said it ensures the talks will fail.
* The Palestinian Authority welcomed the French initiative.
* The French proposal is seen as out-of-touch, as neither side is in any mood to compromise or has the political ability to push for radical solutions.
* Europe is preoccupied with the refugee crisis, the Arab states are dealing with ISIS and each other, and the U.S. is in an election year and has essentially relinquished the Israeli-Palestinian issue.
* The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, visited Israel-Palestine to promote a two-state solution that the Obama administration itself seems to have given up on.
* The two-state solution is still supported by many think tanks, organizations, and lobby groups, as well as the American and European left.
* The PA is on the verge of collapse, and recent Israeli policies have been criticized as skirting the thin line between South African apartheid and Loony Tunes cartoons.
* The only way forward is equality, but achieving equality will require uneasy compromises by both parties, responsible leadership, committed foreign allies, and a willingness to recognize that the current situation is simply untenable.

* US Secretary of State John Kerry said efforts to revive the stalled Israeli Palestinian peace process need to take a “slightly different” course than they have in the past.
* Kerry said he saw the justification behind the multilateral confab, backing comments reportedly made by an Israeli general weeks ago that rampant violence over the past month would only get worse without a diplomatic effort on the horizon.
* Paris’s proposal — to convene two regional peace conferences aimed at advancing the implementation of the two-state solution, and unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood should the effort fail — is “a reflection of the frustration the international community feels” about the turmoil in the region.
* Kerry asserted at the hearing that the US government opposed any unilateral steps toward Palestinian statehood.
* Kerry quoted Israel media reports about statements made by IDF military intelligence chief Herzl Halevi, who told a Knesset committee that lack of progress with the Palestinians could lead to more violence.
* Twenty-nine Israelis and three foreign nationals have been killed in a wave of Palestinian terrorism and violence since October, during which nearly 170 Palestinians have also been killed.
* US President Barack Obama said he discussed ways to reduce the violence via a diplomatic solution with Jordan’s King Abdullah.
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the French proposal during a press conference in Berlin.
* Kerry called on both sides to take measures to signal “readiness and willingness to reduce the violence.”
* Kerry said Israel was at least partially responsible for the moribund peace efforts.
