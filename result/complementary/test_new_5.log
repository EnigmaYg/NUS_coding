* Iran seized a foreign oil tanker and its crew of 12 for allegedly smuggling oil through the Persian Gulf’s Strait of Hormuz.
* The United States jammed and destroyed an Iranian drone that came close to an American ship, a claim Iran denied.
* The Strait of Hormuz is a strategic channel through which about 20 percent of all oil traded worldwide travels.
* The Strait of Hormuz is shallow and only 24 miles at its narrowest point, making large ships such as aircraft carriers and oil tankers easy targets.
* Iran has based small mine- and missile-armed motorboats, truck-mounted anti-ship missiles and torpedo-armed mini-submarines that can suddenly ambush and interdict ships all along the coast of the Gulf.
* The U.S. Navy has the littoral combat ship, specially designed for skirmishes in shallow coastal areas, to defend U.S. interests and international commerce in the Strait of Hormuz.
* The littoral combat ship program has been plagued by so many technical issues that the Navy doesn’t seem to consider them ready for service in the Gulf.
* The House and Senate are including funding to build three more littoral combat ships than the Navy wanted in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act.
* Legislators are cutting funding for the anti-submarine and mine warfare modules necessary for the existing littoral combat ships to perform their missions.
* The littoral combat ship program was intended to be inexpensive and easy to construct, but the ships have cost $550 million per ship, 250 percent more than the original price tag.
* The Pentagon’s department of testing and evaluation estimated that “neither LCS variant is survivable in high intensity combat.”
* Congress is looking to cut $33 million to $120 million out of the $197 million requested by the Navy to finish developing the mine warfare module.

 The image shows an Iranian oil tanker. The tanker is sailing in the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway between Iran and Oman. The tanker is flying the Iranian flag. The image was taken from a distance, and the tanker is not clearly visible. However, it is clear that the tanker is a large ship. The image is significant because it shows an Iranian oil tanker sailing in the Strait of Hormuz. This is a significant development because the Strait of Hormuz is a major shipping route for oil. If Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz, it would have a major impact on the global oil supply.

 In the picture, you can see an Iranian Navy ship in the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It is one of the world's most important shipping lanes, and it is a major source of tension between Iran and the United States. The United States has accused Iran of threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, and Iran has accused the United States of trying to strangle its economy by imposing sanctions. The Iranian Navy regularly conducts exercises in the Strait of Hormuz, and the United States Navy often sends warships to the region to monitor Iranian activity.

The sub-events of news article:
* US President Donald Trump appointed Avi Berkowitz, a 30-year-old White House administrative assistant, as the new Middle East envoy.
* Berkowitz has zero foreign policy experience and used to run errands and get coffee for Jared Kushner.
* Berkowitz's appointment has raised concerns about the Trump administration's "lack of seriousness" in their plans to broker peace in the Middle East.
* Berkowitz's Zionist background has also raised concerns about the inherent bias that comes with any US-brokered peace talks between Palestine and Israel.
* Berkowitz inherits America's so-called "deal of the century" peace deal, which was masterminded by Kushner and Greenblatt.
* The deal has already been rejected by the Palestinians and the international community.
* Experts say that Berkowitz could be a disposable player that the Trump administration has brought on board only to kick out later in order to save face in the event of the peace deal's anticipated failure.

* Netanyahu's backing appears to be quite shaky, with the outcome of the upcoming vote hard to predict.
* Former Pentagon official Michael Maloof believes that a US-Israel alliance won't be that great a step, as the US would already come to Israel's assistance if it was physically attacked en masse.
* Trump's decision to announce such plans just a few days before the Israeli elections is not a coincidence.
* Israel was one of the first major non-Nato ally (MNNA), and in 2014 the US enshrined Israel into a new class of ally - a major strategic partner.
* Under the Trump administration, the US established its first permanent military base - an air defense facility - in Israel.
* If the mutual defense treaty between the two countries fleshes out, it would be the first such deal for Washington in decades.

* Pakistan has become a key player in settling growing tensions in the region after US President Donald Trump requested Prime Minister Imran Khan to talk to Iran and Saudi Arabia.
* Saudi Arabia and Iran have traditionally had a tense relationship, which has worsened after oil installations at Aramco were attacked by Houthi rebels, which Saudi Arabia says are backed by Iran.
* Pakistan's efforts to act as mediator have not been particularly successful in the past, with former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif failing to bring about improvement after meeting with the Saudi leadership in 2016.
* PM Imran Khan has met Saudi Crown Prince Prince Muhammad bin Salman in Riyadh to discuss the situation and suggest all countries work towards peace.
* Imran Khan, keeping his promise to President Trump, met Iranian President Rouhani in Tehran and also put forward proposals for peace.
* Iran had agreed it sought peace in the region.
* One of the issues is the worsening relationship between the US and Iran after President Trump withdrew from an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons.
* Islamabad’s ties with Riyadh and Tehran are both good, but it may not be so easy to bring an end to hostilities between them given the animosity that exists and which is based on many factors including sectarian politics.
* Pakistan will however be very eager to reduce temperatures in the region since any conflict in the Gulf would also affect it very badly.
* Pakistan shares a long border with Iran while Saudi Arabia is one of closest allies.
* The prime minister and his advisers on foreign relations would wish to achieve some kind of settlement, which would also earn them points with Washington given that President Trump had assigned them with a difficult task of acting as mediator.

The information extracted from the image:


 The image is a map of the Nile River basin, showing the location of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the Aswan High Dam. It also shows the water availability per capita in Egypt and Ethiopia.

The GERD is a large dam being built by Ethiopia on the Blue Nile, a tributary of the Nile River. The dam is expected to be completed in 2022 and will be the largest hydroelectric dam in Africa.

Egypt is concerned that the GERD will reduce the amount of water available to it from the Nile. Egypt relies on the Nile for 90% of its water needs. Ethiopia says that the GERD will not have a significant impact on Egypt's water supply.

The image shows that the GERD is located upstream of the Aswan High Dam, which is a large dam built by Egypt on the Nile River. The Aswan High Dam provides Egypt with water for irrigation and electricity.

The image also shows that Egypt has a much lower water availability per capita than Ethiopia. This is because Egypt has a much larger population than Ethiopia and because Egypt's water resources are limited by the Nile River.

The image highlights the potential for conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Nile River. The GERD is a major project that could have a significant impact on the water supply of both countries. It is important for both countries to work together to find a solution that is fair to both sides.

* Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former Egyptian foreign minister and the first African to become the United Nations secretary general, once said a military confrontation over water was “nearly inevitable”.
* The long-running row between Egypt and Ethiopia over who can lay claim to the 6,650-kilometre river Nile is a complex issue that stretches back years.
* Ethiopia began constructing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile in 2012, close to the border with Sudan.
* Ethiopia says the $4 billion hydroelectric dam will begin generating power by the end of 2020 and will be fully operational by 2022.
* Egypt says it is reliant on the Nile for 90 per cent of its irrigation and drinking water supplies and fears it will be catastrophically affected by the dam project.
* For years, the two countries have been wrangling for a resolution, with repeated talks – including with Sudan – failing to reach a solution.
* In the most recent round of talks in Khartoum held earlier this month, ahead of both sides meeting in Sochi this week, the parties failed to break the deadlock.
* Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi has cited “historic rights” to the river, guaranteed by decades-old treaties.
* The Nile is a shared resource, one belonging to the world, not simply the 11 countries it traverses.
* When Mr Sisi meets Mr Abiy in Sochi this week at the first Russian-African summit, there will be the opportunity for international partners and allies to play the role of mediator as the two sides search for a satisfactory solution.
* The White House has responded offering support and urged all sides "to put forth good-faith efforts to reach an agreement".
* To secure the future of the Nile Basin and prevent food and water scarcity reaching a critical point, Ethiopia and Egypt must prioritize sustainability and a fair deal for both in their allocation of a shared resource.

* Ethiopia admits that the cost of the Renaissance Dam construction is about $4 million, hoping it becomes the largest African source of electricity primarily designed to generate power with an expected capacity of 6,000MW.
* Mufti said Ethiopia hopes that this dam would help support Addis Ababa’s plan to face “the undermined development,” including population growth, not only in his country, but also in several developing states where the youth generation is largely increasing amid a lack of employment opportunities.
* Egypt insists that the Renaissance Dam policy should not affect “its interests and rights in the Nile,” particularly that Egypt relies on the River to cover more than 90 percent of its needs.
* Mufti said the Renaissance Dam would protect the water from evaporating and it would help decrease the accumulation of slit, which engenders Ethiopia considerable costs.
* Mufti expressed no objections to the US role in the technical negotiations between Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia on the massive dam being constructed on the Nile River.

The sub-events of news article:
* The European Court of Justice (ECJ) will rule on November 12 on whether to mark exports of goods produced in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights to European Union countries.
* The decision will be made following a petition filed by Psagot Winery to the Administrative Court of France against the 2015 EU directive to mark products manufactured in the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem with a special label.
* Israel fears that an ECJ precedent, which would require labeling products from the settlements, would be forced upon all 28 EU countries and embolden the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) and other de-legitimization organizations against Israel to fight Israeli exports.
* The decision is a follow-up to the European Union's guidelines approved in November 2015 for labeling products from the settlements, a move that has been criticized by Israel as "discriminatory" and damaging to peace efforts with the Palestinians.
* France became one of the first countries to adopt these guidelines, and in 2016 the French Ministry of Economy even issued its own guidelines requiring the marking of products from the settlements.
* The Administrative Court of France later annulled the decision until further notice after Psagot Winery, among others, filed a petition against marking its products, claiming that the directive contravenes the French constitution.
* The ruling might effectively provide practical tools to attack Israel and Israeli exports to Europe.
* The ruling will allow BDS activists to appeal to their local courts across the EU, which will be obliged to implement it without holding hearings on the matter.
* The Israeli Foreign Ministry is preparing for the decision. In the event of an unfavorable ruling for Israel, most of the activities of the Israeli embassies will be directed at the local ministries of economy and agriculture in order to to convince them not to apply the ruling or interpret it in a lightly.

* Psagot Winery, supported by The Lawfare Project, sued the French government for its discriminatory application of the notice.
* The Advocate General (AG) of the European court declared in a non-binding opinion that he believes E.U. law requires such labeling.
* The AG stated that while Israeli products from the “disputed territories” may not be labeled as “Products of Israel,” but rather must be labeled as products of “Israeli colonies,” Palestinian products from the exact same region may be designated as originating in “Palestine” rather than, for example, “Palestinian colonies.”
* The ECJ is expected to announce a decision on the limited questions before it only, and then the case will be remanded back to the French court to rule on according to French anti-discrimination law.
* Countries like Germany, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and others have indeed been ramping up their enforcement of the European Commission guidelines on labeling and sending letters to E.U. importers.
* Psagot’s legal case does not change the status quo—it challenges those regulations themselves with the aim of preventing any future legal cases against Israeli products.
* Even in the event of an unfavorable decision from the ECJ, Psagot’s case will be remanded back to France, where it will be challenged on anti-discrimination grounds.

* The European Court of Justice (CJEU) is expected to issue an opinion this week on a long-running case brought forth by an Israeli winery challenging a requirement that Israeli-made products be labeled as coming from “settlements” and “Israeli colonies.”
* Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) petitioned EU ambassador to the United States Stavros Lambrinidis to raise concerns about a possible ruling in favor of the warning labels, stating that it could create policy tension with the United States and involve us in a boycott war with the EU.
* Sens. Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) and Rob Portman (R-OH) sent a similar letter to U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer expressing concerns that the ruling holds Israel to a standard no other country is subjected to.
* Rep. Juan Vargas (D-CA) also sent a letter to U.S. ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland. It warned that the ruling would lead to discrimination against Israel.
* The lawmakers stated that such a ruling could trigger multiple U.S. anti-boycott laws and damage the nearly $1.3 trillion in trade between America and the EU.
* A decision mandating the labeling of Jewish goods also would be seen as an effort by the EU to interfere in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, giving Hamas justification to continue their attacks on Israel.

* Thirteen Israeli notables issued an open letter welcoming the European Court of Justice’s ruling that settlement products need to be labeled as such, but said the move is insufficient and the European Union must ban the import of settlement goods altogether.
* The letter was signed by former speaker of Knesset and head of the Jewish Agency Avraham Burg; former lawmaker Mossi Raz; former ambassador to France Prof. Eli Barnavi; former Israeli ambassador to South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe Ilan Baruch; former attorney general Prof. Michael Ben-Yair; former ambassador to South Africa and Turkey Alon Liel; former Israeli ambassador to the Czech Republic Erella Hadar; Israel Prize winners Prof David Harel, Prof Yehoshua Kolodny, Alex Levac, Prof David Shulman and Prof Zeev Sternhell; EMET Prize Laureate Miki Kratsman.
* The European Court of Justice ruled that it was necessary to label Israeli settlement goods as such “to prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity.”
* The court further stated that Israeli settlements “are characterized by the fact that they give concrete expression to a policy of population transfer conducted by that state outside its territory, in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law.”
* The Israeli government lambasted the ruling, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that “Europe the other day decided to act against Israel, and to put labels on products that are made here.”
* The US State Department condemned the ruling, while Palestinian officials welcomed it.

* The ruling was made in response to a lawsuit brought before a French court by Psagot winery, located north of Jerusalem.
* Israeli political leaders and American Jewish leaders roundly and rightly condemned the court ruling as anti-Israel, biased and anti-Semitic.
* The ECJ’s ruling will not be applied on behalf of vegans and Tibetans. Everyone knows it was directed against Israel and its Jewish citizens alone.
* The verdict was political, not legal.
* Israel should seek justice against the E.U.’s hostile and unfair trade practices at the World Trade Organization’s arbitration bodies and in U.S. courts.
* Europe is not enlightened and it is not Israel’s ally. It is not susceptible to reason and evidence. It is a hostile post-national governing structure that is conducting political, diplomatic and economic warfare against Israel to harm the Jewish state and assist its enemies.

* The lawsuit was brought by the Psagot winery, located in territories occupied by Israel since June 1967, challenging a notice published by France’s Ministry of the Economy requiring that goods originating from Israeli-occupied territories be labeled in accordance with Regulation 1169/2011.

 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gives a thumbs-up during a news conference in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on October 17, 2019. (Photo by REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne)

In the image, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is giving a thumbs-up while standing at a podium. He is wearing a dark suit and red tie, and has a folder in his left hand. The background is blurred, but appears to be a room with columns and a chandelier.

This image is significant because it shows Boris Johnson expressing his support for a "Trump deal" to replace the Iran nuclear pact. This is in contrast to the UK, Germany, and France, who still hope to save the old agreement. Johnson's support for Trump's deal could potentially be a way out of the current crisis, but it is also likely to anger Iran, which has already dismissed the idea of a "Trump deal" as "strange."

* The British anti-Brexit campaign group Led by Donkeys laser-displayed one of the 12 gold stars of the EU flag on the cliffs of Dover with a message to keep the symbol safe until Britain one day returns to the continental grouping.
* The UK government is looking to shape the country’s destiny from a much different perspective, including securing trade deals that are better suited to the structure of the country's economy, faster, more clear-cut policymaking, more scope for independent, effective diplomacy, and no longer operating under the shadow of encroachment on its national strategic interests.
* The UK will continue to comply with the EU’s sanctions policies throughout the year.
* Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab used a speech to foreign correspondents in London last week to touch on this point.
* Lawyers specialising in this area expect human rights-related sanctions to be unilaterally imposed under what is called the "Magnitsky amendment" to Britain’s most recent sanctions act as soon as March.
* Compliance with the British sanctions regime will be distinct from that of the EU, which could affect licences to operate in one place but not in another.
* Britain has not joined the policy of maximum pressure on Iran.
* However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thrown his weight behind a “Trump deal” with Iran that addresses the gamut of international concerns over Tehran’s policies.
* The US and UK still have the relationship where they can finish each other's sentences.
* The US has the superpower sway and is capable of maintaining its principles-based lines on Iran’s role as the “biggest state-sponsor of global terror”.
* London chooses to take a more managerial approach.
* The 2015 deal is the only game in town, according to Mr Raab.
* Officials have in the meantime announced a raft of negotiations with the UK’s biggest trade partners.
* The UK must be pragmatic in its dealings with the world.
* Aligning with Europe in matters of sanctions and security will be a no-brainer.
* The US meanwhile could be boosted by importing British fin-tech expertise.
* Manufacturing exports should be tariff-free.
* There is much uncertainty to come in the weeks and months after Brexit.
* Trade talks are likely to hog the headlines and the country’s diplomatic positions are up for grabs.

* The United Kingdom leaves the European Union, marking the biggest shift in British foreign policy in almost 50 years.
* The UK wants to stay an influential European foreign policy power outside the EU.
* The UK can still play a leading role in shaping Europe’s foreign policy after Brexit by engaging with Europe differently.
* The UK’s traditional diplomatic handling of foreign policy crises — align with Washington and shape the EU response — no longer applies.
* The UK can lead European foreign policy after Brexit through four new steps:
    * Doing more bilaterally with European countries, especially France and Germany.
    * Using meetings of other international groupings to coordinate European foreign policy positions and actions.
    * Agreeing to close co-operation on foreign policy with the EU as part of negotiations on the UK’s future trade and security relationship with the EU.
    * Working closely with the EU in other international organizations, particularly the United Nations.
* Europe should support these steps to keep the UK within the European foreign policy orbit.
* The UK’s ability to lead European foreign policy after Brexit will depend on the strategic posture it chooses to adopt between Europe and the US.

The sub-events of news article:
* British Prime Minister Boris Johnson may trigger the "snapback" clause of the Iran nuclear deal, which would permanently end the agreement.
* Johnson is eager to secure a favorable trade deal with the United States, and triggering the snapback clause could put President Donald Trump in a good mood for negotiations.
* Iran has deliberately violated the nuclear deal in protest of Trump's sanctions, antagonizing the European parties to the deal (E3).
* The E3 have initiated the dispute resolution process of the nuclear deal, but if Johnson refuses to trigger the snapback clause, the deal could be dead in as little as 30 days.
* Johnson has previously supported the nuclear deal, but recently told BBC News that he is willing to replace it with a "Trump deal."
* Trump has tweeted his agreement with Johnson's comments, and the E3 initiated the dispute resolution process after Iran suspended many of its nuclear commitments.
* The JCPOA includes a three-step dispute resolution mechanism, but a shortcut to terminating the deal requires just 30 days.
* Any party to the JCPOA can send a matter of noncompliance to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), where a vote must be held within 30 days to preserve the deal, or all previous UN resolutions and sanctions would come back into effect.
* The U.S. State Department has reportedly found that despite having withdrawn from the JCPOA, the U.S. can still trigger snapback by tabling a resolution about Iranian non-compliance and then vetoing the continuance of sanctions relief.
* Johnson's political thinking closely aligns with Trump's, and he has made clear that he favors national interests over multilateral institutions.
* Johnson values his ties with France and Germany, and has previously defended the JCPOA.
* Iran's recent actions against UK citizens include the downing of a civilian airliner, the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran, and the seizing and holding of multiple British hostages.
* Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has hinted that European soldiers may now be "in danger" because the E3 initiated the dispute resolution process.
* Trump's tweets may make it harder for Johnson to act, as the president has shown contempt for diplomacy.
* Iran is betting on Europe to slow-roll the dispute resolution process, but Trump or Johnson could initiate a snapback at any point in 2020.

* Boris Johnson has canceled plans for a spring visit to the United States to meet with Donald Trump.
* The cancellation was not intended as a snub to the US president, but may be seen that way in Washington ahead of trade deal talks.
* The Prime Minister is said to have originally planned to visit Washington last month following his election victory, before moving the trip to February.
* The two men will not meet face-to-face until a G7 summit at Camp David in Maryland in June.
* Washington and London are at loggerheads over issues including Mr Johnson's decision to allow Chinese tech giant Huawei to have a role in the UK's 5G phone network.
* They have also clashed over Washington's refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the alleged CIA agent accused of killing British teenager Harry Dunn in a Northamptonshire road accident.
* Last week it was claimed Mr Johnson endured a phone call with an 'apoplectic' Donald Trump following the decision to approve a deal with Huawei.
* US prosecutors have accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and helping Iran track protesters in its latest indictment against the Chinese company.
* Boris Johnson again stood up to Washington on Wednesday by claiming the UK's extradition arrangements with the US are 'imbalanced' and suggesting they need to be reviewed.

 The image shows British Prime Minister Boris Johnson exiting a car, US President Donald Trump speaking at a podium, and a Huawei logo. This juxtaposition suggests that the three individuals and the company are somehow related. The news article reveals that the three are indeed connected through recent political tensions. The article explains that Johnson's planned visit to the US to meet with Trump has been canceled, potentially due to disagreements over Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network and other issues. The image, therefore, captures the essence of the news story by visually representing the key players and the central point of contention.

* Masih Alinejad, a former journalist who has left the country and leads a campaign against the enforced Islamic headscarf for women, warns that voting overlooks the memory of those killed in the protests.
* Amnesty International has confirmed the deaths of 300 people in the crackdown that followed those protests, and some estimates are far higher.
* Turnout has varied widely in Iranian parliamentary elections over the past decades, but has generally been recorded at more than 50 percent and sometimes topping 60 percent.
* Conservatives — or “principalists,” who are themselves split between different factions — will likely dominate the next parliament after the disqualification of reformists.

* Palestinians said Trump's plan had given the "green light" for Israel to formally annex its settlements in the West Bank.
* Trump's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, but with strict conditions that Palestinians have baulked at.
* Trump proposed a four-year schedule for the creation of a Palestinian state, with Palestinians first having to agree to halt attacks by the Islamist militant group Hamas which controls the enclave of Gaza.
* Trump's plan also gave U.S. recognition of Israel's West Bank settlements - deemed illegal under international law - Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, and a redrawn, demilitarised Palestinian state that would meet Israel's security requirements.
* Jerusalem would be the undivided capital of Israel, according to Trump's plan.
* Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Trump's plan the "slap of the century".
* Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Wednesday Trump's team had simply "copied and pasted" the blueprint that Netanyahu and Israeli settler leaders wanted to see implemented.
* Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and the plan's principal architect, said: "We're not going to chase the Palestinians...the Palestinian leadership, you can't really treat them like they're a serious government, or capable or competent dealmakers".
* Gaza political analyst Talal Okal said the deal gave Israel the right to take what it wanted "immediately, while the Palestinians have to wait four years to see whether they have rights or not".
* Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli head of military intelligence said: "This is the most favorable plan for Israel ever presented by an international player."

* US President Donald Trump's proposal recognizes Israel’s right to annex the Jordan Valley, all West Bank settlements and their surroundings.
* Netanyahu pledged to bring the annexation issue for a vote in the cabinet on Sunday, but has since backtracked after the US administration indicated that it was not ready to see it happen until at least after the coming Israeli elections on March 2.
* Netanyahu is eager to present his right-wing supporters and settlers with something symbolic ahead of the vote.
* US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman initially indicated there was no impediment to Netanyahu bringing the annexation bid to a vote in Sunday’s cabinet meeting, but senior adviser to the president Jared Kushner and other senior US officials later said that they expected Israel to hold off until at least after the elections.
* A senior Israeli government official said that Israel wanted to perform the annexation in one, two or possibly three stages — first the Jordan Valley and the settlements, and their immediate surroundings later.
* The official said that the Americans don’t want to do it in several rounds, because they don’t want to extend recognition several times.
* MK Ayelet Shaked said that Israel must begin annexing the territories allowed for in the plan in order to prevent a Palestinian state from being formed.
* The plan grants Israel much of what it has sought in decades of international diplomacy, namely control over Jerusalem as its “undivided” capital.
* The plan also lets Israel annex West Bank settlements, and rules out the return of Palestinian refugees to Israeli territory.
* Many Western countries and international bodies said they needed time to assess the plan, reiterating their support for the longtime international consensus favoring a two-state solution to the conflict on the basis of the pre-1967 borders.
* The UK warned Israel against a hasty annexation, saying the move needs to be part of a peace treaty agreed with the Palestinians.
* The Palestinians have angrily rejected the entire plan.

The Charles de Gaulle is one of the most powerful warships in the French Navy and is capable of carrying a variety of aircraft, including fighter jets and helicopters. The ship is also equipped with a range of sensors and weapons, making it ideal for conducting maritime surveillance and interdiction operations. The deployment of the Charles de Gaulle to the Mediterranean Sea is a clear signal of the EU's commitment to enforcing the arms embargo on Libya and helping to stabilize the country.

 The image shows a map of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, highlighting the maritime boundaries and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Turkey, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, and Libya. The map illustrates the complex and disputed nature of the region, with overlapping claims and conflicting interests.

The Turkish-claimed EEZ extends south from Turkey's southern coast, overlapping with the EEZs of Cyprus, Egypt, and Greece. This has been a source of tension and conflict in the region, as Turkey has been conducting hydrocarbon exploration and drilling activities in these disputed waters.

The map also shows the location of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), a self-declared state that is recognized only by Turkey. The TRNC's EEZ claim overlaps with that of Cyprus, further complicating the situation.

The image highlights the potential for conflict and instability in the Eastern Mediterranean region due to competing claims over maritime resources and territorial waters. It also underscores the need for diplomatic efforts and negotiations to resolve these disputes peacefully and avoid further escalation.

The first section shows Palestine in 1947, before the establishment of the State of Israel. The second section shows Palestine in 1949, after the first Arab-Israeli war. The third section shows Palestine in 1967, after the Six-Day War. The fourth section shows Palestine in the present day.

The map illustrates the dramatic decrease in Palestinian land over time. In 1947, Palestinians owned most of the land. By 1967, Israel had occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In the present day, Palestinians only have a small area of land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The image is a powerful visual representation of the Palestinian loss of land. It is a reminder of the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and the need for a peaceful resolution.

 The image shows a large number of apartment buildings built on a hill. The buildings are mostly white and have a similar design. The image was taken from a distance, and the sky is hazy.

The image is of the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim, which is located in the West Bank. The settlement is home to around 37,000 people, and it is one of the largest settlements in the West Bank. The settlement is controversial, as it is built on land that was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967. The Palestinians claim the West Bank as part of their future state, and they oppose the construction of Israeli settlements in the area. The image is relevant to the news article because it shows one of the areas that may be affected by Israel's planned annexation of parts of the West Bank.

However, the plan was rejected by the Arabs, and the subsequent war resulted in the creation of the state of Israel. In 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War. The Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995 established a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but Israel has continued to occupy the territories and build settlements.

 The image is a map of the West Bank, with the areas that would be annexed by Israel under Netanyahu's plan highlighted in blue. The map also shows the location of illegal Israeli settlements and Palestinian communities in the West Bank.

The image is significant because it shows the extent of the territory that would be annexed by Israel under Netanyahu's plan. It also shows that the annexation would create a large swath of contiguous Israeli territory in the West Bank, which would make it difficult for Palestinians to establish a viable state.

The image is also significant because it shows that the annexation would have a devastating impact on the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank. The annexation would cut off Palestinian access to vital resources, such as water and land, and would make it difficult for them to travel and trade. The annexation would also likely lead to increased violence between Israelis and Palestinians.

 The image shows a large number of apartment buildings built on a rocky hill. The buildings are mostly white and have a similar design. The image is taken from a high angle, which gives the viewer a good perspective of the size of the settlement. The settlement is located in the West Bank, which is a disputed territory between Israel and Palestine. The image is a good example of how settlements are expanding in the West Bank, which is making it increasingly difficult to achieve a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

 The image is a map of the West Bank, with the areas that Israel plans to annex marked in red. The map shows that the areas to be annexed include the Jordan Valley and the northern part of the West Bank. These areas are strategically important to Israel, as they provide access to the Jordan River and the Dead Sea, and they also contain a number of Jewish settlements. The annexation of these areas would have a significant impact on the future of the peace process, as it would make it more difficult for the Palestinians to establish a viable state.

* Several European nations are considering ways to deter Israel from moving forward with its declared intention to apply sovereignty to the entire Jordan Valley and all settlements across the West Bank, and how to punish it if it ignores their warnings and carries out the annexation.
* According to the coalition agreement on which Israel’s new government was founded, Netanyahu can bring the annexation plan to a vote in the government and the Knesset as soon as July 1, as long as it’s done in full coordination with the US.
* Palestinian leaders are concerned that leading Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Gulf states, have reacted with seeming indifference about the prospect of annexation.
* Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas may resort to still more dramatic measures if Israel presses ahead with unilateral annexation, including dismantling the PA.
* The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has been one of the most outspoken opponents of the annexation plans, but in a recent conversation with Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, he did not highlight the bloc’s vociferous opposition to Israel’s plan to annex parts of the West Bank.
* The EU’s foreign policy czar “underlined the EU’s unequivocal commitment to the security of the State of Israel, which is not negotiable for the EU” and reaffirmed the union’s intention to “address jointly issues of mutual interest and concern and to work with Israel to promote global peace and security and to contribute to building trust, in particular in the region and the immediate neighborhood.”
* The fact that the readout of the conversation between Borrell and Ashkenazi did not explicitly mention annexation is to be seen as an indication of the union’s “willingness to engage” with the new Israeli government.
* The EU’s position on annexation “is abundantly clear.”
* On May 18, Borrell had issued a brief statement that largely focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the need for a two-state solution, the importance of international and Brussel’s “grave concerns” over Jerusalem’s supposed plan to unilaterally annex the Jordan Valley and all settlements across the West Bank.
* Some EU member states, including Ireland and Luxembourg, sought to issue a statement that was even harsher, including mentioning steps the EU may consider if Israel were to advance its annexation plans.

 The image shows the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) under construction. The dam is located on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia and is the largest hydroelectric dam in Africa. The dam is expected to generate 6,000 megawatts of electricity, which will make Ethiopia the largest power exporter in Africa. The dam is also expected to have a significant impact on the downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan. Egypt is concerned that the dam will reduce the amount of water that flows into the Nile River, which is essential for Egypt's agriculture. Sudan is concerned that the dam will cause flooding downstream. The image shows the dam under construction and the surrounding area. The image is a good representation of the size and scale of the dam and the potential impact it will have on the region.
